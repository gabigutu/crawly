		<shortDescription>A fantasy rooted in the landscape of your childhood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like 'Gone With the Wind', 'Citizen Kane', 'The Godfather', 'Star Wars', have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of 'The Wizard of Oz' it's hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because 'The Wizard of Oz' is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children. The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland's developing bust line. There's even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make 'The Wizard of Oz' a much bigger legend than it already it, but that's okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don't linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn't any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds. Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn't have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they'd be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings 'Over the Rainbow' we know that it's to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from 'Love Finds Andy Hardy' and by the time of 'Oz' she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn't that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.If movies are a time capsule than 'The Wizard of Oz' wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland's life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but 'The Wizard of Oz' sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There's poignancy in that, and that's why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.Garland's presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn't fit.If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn't hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we're in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I've ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We're told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart's desires weren't that far from our own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People talk about The Wizard of Oz as a backdrop to their lives; and how true that is. I just saw it again, DVD, for the first time in--gosh!--20 years. There was a little art house in Lansing Michigan USA that ran it back then, on the popular premise that there's nothing like TWoO on "the big screen." That's the last time I'd seen it, 'til today.I guess the part that "gets" me about the movie is how the writers made it pretty plain that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion really already had what they thought they were missing; that their respective problems were in misapprehending their own complete natures. That's a powerful statement for many of us. I found myself most touched in scenes where the Scarecrow was showing wisdom, the Tin Man feeling deeply ("...when I think of Dorothy in that awful place..."), and the Lion...well, maybe accomplishing this effect was harder in his case...what *is* true courage?Anyway, if you're reading this here, you must be a movie weenie, and you've no doubt already seen the movie, so I'm not going to recite the usual "go see this movie" mantra.I was just very touching to see this movie again, at this phase in my life.I will mention a few more things about how I now see this movie as a "growed up" (I'm almost 50): It's interesting how you can see the production values of the time; the lot sets and special effects and so forth. This movie is a powerful example of how a good story overcomes limited means in other areas.People who look back with disdain on the low-tech chintz of old movies can see in TWoO the magic ingredient; narrative solidity. And I'm not a pollyanna about this: I'm sure the underlying reality behind its making is rife with horror stories of expert disagreement, rewrites, discarding, jerryrigging, and the rest of it. But in the end, something like narrative love won out; and that's the important thing.Oh: And having Harold Arlen write the music was good luck indeed. And orchestrations which cleverly appropriated very tasty new ideas in composition (polymodalism, non-standard phrasings, etc.) didn't hurt, either!Geez, this movie is such a little universe....I'd better stop here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enchanting film with flaws that cannot seriously mar its durable delights?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorothy's trip, as we follow her from her Kansas farm down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City and back home again, is depicted with rare cinematic imagination and skill? At the beginning, we may wonder at the obvious falseness of the black-and-white Kansas setting, although the monotonous, arid landscape ultimately makes an effective contrast to the later scenes in Oz? But rationality disappears the moment Judy Garland strikes at the heart with her trembling singing of "Over the Rainbow." And when Frank Morgan appears as Professor Marvel, we are captivated by his familiar bumbling charm?Dorothy's entrance into the land of Oz remains one of the screen's most memorable moments, as the black-and-white scene give way to glowing color photography? "I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore!" is her understated response as she enters Munchkinland? The sequence in Munchkinland, though beautifully designed, is actually, a mixed blessing? Billie Burke is exactly right as the Good Witch of the North, and Margaret Hamilton is wonderfully shrill and repulsive as the Wicked Witch of the West? But the Munchkins themselves, midgets gathered from all over the world for the occasion, are all wonderful with their prematurely old faces and chipmunk voices?The talents of Dorothy's friends?Jack Haley as the Tin Man, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion?have been frequently celebrated, but their good humor and their shining humanity behind the grotesque makeup remain fresh eternally?"The Wizard of Oz" is a joy forever? Why does it still glow, while other films of the period grow dimmer every year? It is unquestionably due to more than the sum of its sterling cast, winning songs, and lovely special effects, although the absence of these virtues has turned more than one "musical fantasy" into failures? It may be that Dorothy steps from black-and-white Kansas into the bright colors of Munchkinland, she is taking everyone's first voyage of discovery? With the universality of the best fables, "The Wizard of Oz" has her learning about evil (the Wicked Witch), friendship (her companions on the road to Oz), and fallibility (the Wizard). And somehow children?and the child in all of us?like to see this voyage made repeatedly? Children as adults, today as in 1939, "The Wizard of Oz" will remain for us the beloved movie ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wiz of a film, if ever a Wiz there was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The NBC Peacock began unfolding its wings. "The following program is brought to you in living color--with portions in black &amp; white--on NBC." That exclusive intro began my exposure to color television at Grandma's in 1968. When Dorothy stepped out into Technicolor, I'll bet my eyes just popped.This is the Movie of All Time, folks--a status achieved during its long run as a huge annual TV event during that classic era whose programs now show up on TV Land network. In the 1970s, Peter Marshall once read the answer on Hollywood Squares as to the program seen more times by more people than anything else ever shown on television. It was "Oz." Likewise, no movie has the hold on popular culture that this one does. What lion character ever since (i.e., Snagglepuss) hasn't been an impersonation of Bert Lahr going, "Put 'em up, put 'em uuuuup!"Few musicals offer an equal combination of lovable music and engaging story. Perhaps "The Sound of Music." Hard to think of many Hollywood musicals where the story gets as serious as it does here when the Witch informs Dorothy that, "The last to go will see the first three go before her...and her mangy little dog too!" Yikes! In contrast, even the best of other Hollywood musicals seem to serve up fluffy, forgettable story lines that are mere backdrop to the song numbers that typically put the plot on hold.I can't say that "Oz" doesn't have technical flaws or story element inconsistencies. It's just that the astonishing production values all around so overwhelm the shortcomings. The tornado sequence is a 1939 special effects tour de force--incredible. And the Nutcracker-quality musical score offers songs tastefully interwoven with the action. Certain numbers like "Merry Old Land of Oz," I never get tired off, though I like each of the songs.Oz should be viewed in the lightness of spirit that it deserves. I mean look, we have Frank Morgan as the Emerald City gatekeeper, then seconds later as the cabbie with the Horse of a Different Color, then the Wizard's palace guard, and then the voice of fire-and-smoke Wizard of Oz who bellows, "Step forward, Tin Man!" What other film could put an actor go through 4 quick-changes within 10 minutes to such an endearing result? "Oz" is as magic as those sparkling ruby shoes.The early Technicolor process utilized triple nitrate negative strips--separately recording each primary color in light. This was done due to the lack of a suitable "color film" in 1939. That would quickly change--but films from years following suffered from hues that faded with the years, even original negatives. Because "Oz" was actually filmed on a black-and-white base film, the negatives never faded. So now we have home videos/DVDs of breathtaking color quality. Now, the tinted filters in the cameras that separated the colors onto the negative strips meant that intense illumination was required, rendering the filming experience miserably hot for the actors involved, especially Lahr. But they all hold up amazingly well."Oz" has a valuable message. As the pop group America once said, "No, Oz never did give nothin' to the Tin Man....that he didn't, didn't already have." If we have truly search, we can find within us--or create through trial, like the Lion's courage--what we think we most lack. The Wizard (like the Lord) helps those who find help within themselves.I feel sorry for the Almira Gulches who can't treasure this film experience. They need to visit the Emerald City to get their own ticking Testimonials and find their hearts.Didn't bring your broomsticks with you? Well, I'm afraid you'll have to walk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie when they would air it once a year on CBS a few years back. Now it is shown on a couple of different networks quite frequently. This is a wonderful film for the whole family. Who wouldn't want to take a journey to the magical land of Oz?I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-two years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless. It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever. The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages. Everything about it brings a smile to my face. Wouldn't it be wonderful to just magically be transported to a land of talking trees and little munchkins? Of course it would be. The flying monkeys, a talking lion, the astounding ruby slippers, and everything else adds a special kind of magic to the screen.The atmosphere and setting is magnificent. This is one of the things that makes the film so stunning. Anyway, the forest, the witch's castle, and even the farm is really well laid out.I don't think that the casting could have been done any better. Judy Garland shines as the innocent Kansas girl. Her dancing and singing just brightens the whole story up. The lion, tin man, and scarecrow perform amazingly also. Everyone involved down to the littlest munchkin acts so well.Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. What's left to say? Other things like the wardrobe, special effects, musical talents, and even the famous yellow brick road, are so well put together. Oz gives us an idea of what an almost perfect world would be like. No matter how old this movie becomes and we still look back on it, we'll still be able to enjoy at least one thoughtful movie. Classics never die. (Hence the name.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Has Its Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judy Garland's portrayal of Dorothy, Dorothy's oddball Oz friends, "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", and the rest of this fine production of "The Wizard of Oz" have lost little of their magic over the years. While it has become oddly fashionable in recent years to deride this kind of classic, innocent fantasy, the movie itself has aged very well, and it is likely to retain an appreciative audience for some time to come.There's no doubt that part of the appeal of the story and the characters comes from them being such old friends to so many cinema fans, but there are also good reasons why they have endured for so long, and have been able to hold up even after becoming so familiar. Although Dorothy is not a particularly complex character, she represents an innocent but deep yearning that is easy to identify with. Likewise, the 'Oz' characters are bizarre enough to remain interesting, but there is a core of substance that again is easy to believe in. Who does not feel that he or she could use at least one of the things that Dorothy's friends want?The adaptation from the original story is done quite well, making fine choices for the characters and episodes that would work on film. The settings and visual effects may not impress the devotees of today's computer imagery, but in their time they certainly demonstrated a great deal of skill and planning, and even now, in their own way they are more believable than are most of the computer tricks that have become so overused.The popular story has also been used for a number of more recent adaptations, and some of them have had some good points of their own. But this Wizard remains by far the most wonderful of the versions of the classic tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true cinematic milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? MGM's elaborate adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ not only became an institution among itself (and practically defined the concept of modern popular culture), but is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. A sharp screenplay effectively condenses the novel's text into a workable film, and director Victor Fleming (along with countless other behind-the-scenes technicians) craft a visually stimulating fantasy world that surpasses the expectations of even the most imaginative viewers. Brimming with stunning visual effects (the film's fierce tornado is an FX feat that has yet to be surpassed by CGI), witty dialogue, and eye-popping Technicolor, THE WIZARD OF OZ truly lives up to it's reputation as a once-in-a-lifetime film where every element comes together flawlessly.The cast could not be improved upon. The quivery-voiced, solemn-faced Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, the little lost farm girl on the road to Oz, clutching her beloved Toto (impressively portrayed himself by the female canine performer Terry, the terrier). It seems inconceivable that MGM had originally wished to cast Shirley Temple in the role, as Temple's doe-eyed, cutesy-voiced shtick would have been a catastrophic ill-fit for the tone of this picture. Conversely, Garland is perhaps the screen's quintessential woman/child; always seemingly just one step away from reaching full emotional maturity. It is her sadness that transfixes viewers to the screen, the exact same quality that made the film's most memorable Harold Arlen/E. Y. Harburg number "Over the Rainbow" into one of the most exquisite marriages between artist and song ever to be recorded.The remainder of the cast is similarly exceptional, many of whom perform perfectly even under the most debilitating make-up and costumes. Frank Morgan is marvelously versatile in no less than five roles, the insanely energetic Bert Lahr mugs brilliantly, the handsome Jack Haley swoons sweetly, Billie Burke lends the film an ornate ethereality, and Ray Bolger's gravity-defying physical presence nearly steals the entire picture on several occasions. Perhaps most notable is former schoolteacher Margaret Hamilton's transformation into the wickedest of wicked witches, which certainly remains among the vilest and most terrifying portrayals of full-throttle evil ever to be seen. No matter how it is analyzed, scrutinized, or satirized, the 1939 production of THE WIZARD OF OZ is a top-notch example of how to turn a great story into a fabulous, milestone of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Her Way Back Home -- To Our Hearts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with the advance of special effects there will never be a movie as honest and as true to its heart as THE WIZARD OF OZ, with the exception of THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY. But since the latter is too new, it can't be compared to the former. Everyone at one point of their lives, especially as children, has seen this film and has experienced the emotions that Dorothy experienced, the terror of entering the Wicked Witch's lair, her transition from little girl to wise young woman, and this incredible world that L. Frank Baum created and Hollywood perfected.What makes a great movie? The experience that you are watching it for the very first time, whether you were seven years old or an adult living in an adult world. This film is one of those. Even when as an adult I can see some of the cracks peeking through and some lapses in continuity, who cares? The tornado ripping through the cornfields is as real as the real ones I have seen even though is was really muslin. The moment that the sepia-tones from the Kansas segment peel away and Dorothy opens the door of her house and I saw the bright colors of Oz I knew I was there. The story had enveloped me now, as it had did back then. In my world, this is an utterly, fantastic film.And what is Oz, by the way? Well, from a little girl (and the child in all of us), it's that place where our imagination runs wild, where everything is perfect, where there is no tomorrow and a yellow brick road will take us to that perfect place filled with song. It's that place where we feel we will belong, and who as a child didn't feel like we were out of place? Notice I repeat the word 'place' because this is so much about placement, places, our place and therefore, our own self-expression, our own sense of self. Who hasn't wanted to "seek a place of one's own' where light and love prevailed only to return back to where we came from, stronger and wiser? Its message is so universal. Truly, there is no place like home.Timing is crucial for the symbolic success of this movie as well. Still in the middle of the Depression years, when unemployment was at an all time high, it focuses not just on the harshness of keeping a farm, but then throwing a parent-less girl into a strange land who finds a foster mother of sorts who would tell her that the way back home would not be an easy one. Glinda the Good represents this character, the same way, the Wicked Witch of the West represents the darker forces that watch her every move and aggressively try to trip her up. This is quite a lot on the shoulders of a little girl, and having Judy Garland -- not yet the major star but just on the brink of becoming one -- play Dorothy Gale has become casting history. In 1939 she was about seventeen, fresh-faced, innocent and vulnerable: she is Dorothy, and we can't imagine anyone else, not even nearly 70 years later.And speaking of casting, it was genius to have the actors playing Dorothy's friends and enemies in Kansas also show up in Oz. Since the movie is so much like a dream, it's more than logical: many people in our lives sometimes show up in dreams -- it's even in books about dreams. That they also represent that which not only they, but Dorothy most of all, lacks -- courage, love, and wisdom -- makes their appearances even more intrinsic to the story, so when they grow as characters, so do we, and of course, so does Dorothy.THE WIZARD OF OZ is timeless. So simple, so honest, but so deep in its messages about love and self-discovery. All of the actors including the veteran Billie Burke would be remembered the most for their roles here more than any other movie. The set direction is made to look as close to a storybook; all that is missing are the page frames. There isn't a false move here, and all those back-stories... well, their okay to read but for the cinema lover looking for magic, it's all here, in about two hours of pure entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most cherished fantasy films to ever grace the screen, "The Wizard of Oz" stands as a crowning achievement in 1930's film making. The special effects are highly impressive considering the limited technology available at the time, not to mention they are infinitely more endearing than most CGI effects present in today's films. The lavish sets, impeccable costume design, and glowing Technicolor help to create a convincing and enchanting Land of Oz. And though obviously filmed on a soundstage, the sets never seem confining; thanks largely in part to the meticulous backdrop paintings used to add depth to the foreground. The musical numbers are quite lively &amp; catchy -- never slowing the pace of the film -- except perhaps for the Lion singing "King of the Jungle". Judy Garland truly shines in her portrayal of Dorothy, perfectly capturing the wide-eyed innocence of her character. She definitely deserved the special Oscar she was awarded for her performance. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and Frank Morgan as the Wizard also turn in praiseworthy characterizations. Definitely timeless in every sense of the word, this film is recommended to those of all ages ? a 10/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dorothy is a young girl living on a Kansas farm, during a tornado, she, along with her dog Toto, is swept up and plonked down in a magical and mysterious land known as Oz. Desperate to get back home and under threat from a wicked witch, she is advised to seek out a great wizard who should be able to help her get back home. As she sets off and on her way she meets and befriends a wonderful array of characters whom also have something to ask of the fabled wizard, it's a journey that will prove to be both magical and fraught with danger.The Wizard Of Oz is a film that has been pored over and dissected from almost everyone involved in the wonderful world of film. One thing that strikes me every time I view it is that their not only is no place like home, there is also no film like The Wizard Of Oz, and really, when all is said and done, there is unlikely to be another film of its ilk to ever grace the silver screen. Upon multiple viewings only the most biased of film fan could say that it is a technically perfect picture, it clearly isn't. At times it's a wee bit creaky and when scrutinised, some of the performances in the piece are far from an excellent standard, but crucially any misgivings are quickly erased due to the wonder of it all because the film has an ability to transport everybody who is watching into OZ alongside Dorothy.The Wizard Of Oz appeals {and caters} to every demographic and pretty much any age group; adventure, meeting new friends, fears and trepidations, booming colour, songs to singalong with, and of course it's total point of homely values: The Wizard Of Oz stands up well 70 years later because it taps into all the emotions available to the human being, be it a young child spellbound on a first viewing, or an octogenarian couple of grandparents wistfully humming along to the tunes, it's a film that shouldn't be dissected looking for faults and hidden meanings, it's a film that should be loved and praised for the ode to fantastical whimsy that it so obviously is.The film of course will forever be associated with its darling star, Judy Garland. Viewing now, and knowing what a sad life she would eventually lead, The Wizard Of Oz is a fitting picture on which to remember what a magical and wonderful performer she was, myself as a 14 stone lump of waning machismo, I have no shame in saying that as Judy sings Somewhere Over The Rainbow I melt and feel as tho I'm being sent spinning into another world, that's the power of the piece, as a sepia Kansas becomes the glorious colour of Oz, nothing else in my world matters, I'm in hook line and sinker.There are many interesting back stories to the picture, with books galore available to anyone interested. Some notes that might interest you being: original castings to be W.C. Fields, Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, munchkins running riot, drunken cast members, sadness and suicides, and grizzled old pros fighting hard not to let Garland steal the picture. Well it makes for a great read, for sure, but what remains to this day is one of the most beloved pictures to have ever been made, for once in the pantheon of great cinema we have a film that is termed a classic, that actually deserves to have that tag. One of the great things about the advent of technology is that it can benefit old classic movies to make them better, for now we can view remastered editions of The Wizard Of Oz and appreciate even more what a great job the makers did. Keep your eyes on Dorothy's Ruby Slippers during the film and see how they are the sparkling important character that they should be, or take in the brilliant work of the make up crew, the tiniest of rivets on The Tin Man a testament to the brilliant work that goes into bringing magic to our lives. Get the newest copy you can and then see it on the biggest screen available to you because The Wizard Of Oz is a 10/10 movie: and then some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic tale about a Kansas farm girl who's spirited off to the wondrous land of Oz. The film still tingles with freshness and beauty. Garland is forever memorable as Dorothy Gale, the young girl and the supporting performances of Bolger, Lahr,Haley, Hamilton and Morgan are all stand out and will remain national treasures. The superb songs of E.Y. Harburg and Harold Arlen are still beautifully blended with the lovely photography, cinematography and art direction. Unforgettable!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even A Misanthropist Loves It: It's Unanimous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The real best picture of 1939 not that overrated, boring piece of crap: Gone With The Wind. Please, this is one of the most beautifully crafted little treasures with great moral depth and above all a great heart. The song of youth, the longing for Transcendence: Somewhere Over The Rainbow. It captures what it is to be young. Yet, its power carries forward into adulthood. The feeling that happiness is just further along waiting to be attained. The acting and characterizations are the star of the movie. Who else but Margaret Hamilton could be the Wicked Witch Of The West? When Dorothy sees Auntie Em in pain looking for her, how quickly she runs back home, just as the kind huckster intended. That is the treat of this little treasure, the good hearts of the people within it. Having watched this movie since I was a child, on broadcast television, every November, I still love it as much as I did then. The movie is filled with wonder and humor for all ages. It models loyalty, love and courage in the face of great fear. There is not a better film to show to your children. Its teachings are always hidden deep within its allegorical script so that is is never pedantic or professorial. Just a sweet, timeless classic of a band of seekers joining together in friendship.When you watch it, over and over, you can but wonder what on earth the Academy was thinking when they snubbed this eternal treasure for the young and the young at heart. Who would not want to live within a world with this kind of warmth. Take it from a cranky, misanthropic, old philosopher; the movie is as powerful and moving today as it was seventy years ago. Dorothy lost and alone but for Toto is aided in seeking out the Wizard so she can return to Kansas. She meets others who work together; they fight the evil Witch; indeed, later sneaking into her castle to rescue Dorothy. This is the film's genius, it does not lecture or say goodness, it shows goodness. In its little way, risking your life to help your friends is modeled and shown for the good that it is. A musical with not only a brain, which is rare for a musical, but a great heart. A Movie That Will Outlive All Of Us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a metaphor of America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often been said that this is a simple tale, a story of the coming of age for Dorothy. It's not that simple. It's also a story of the coming of age of America as seen through Dorothy's eyes.Dorothy is a familiar American teen who grew up on a farm, a bit naive, never been to a city, but heard about them. Is family focused, but starting to open her eyes to a bigger world around her and looking for familiar structures through which she can understand that world.The scarecrow, who thinks he's lacking a brain, is the American farmer. Usually minimally educated, often thought (at that time) of as stupid or ignorant, but it's proved through the movie that farmers in fact have a brain. Farmers are often known for their strong common sense and wisdom which is often undervalued by city folk or college types.The cowardly lion represents the elected politicians. Afraid to do anything - especially preemptive - and shirks facing any controversy until it bites him on the rear. Only later to find that the problem was impotent all along. Politicians haven't changed in some ways.The tin man represents industry, which is often seen as heartless machine. But when run by people who have compassion, companies have proved to "have a heart". This generosity is often seen in the form of philanthropy, but sometimes exists right in the corporate culture itself. Industry isn't always as heartless as a robot (or computer, to use a more modern metaphor).Poppies, which represented the opium drug from China that can distract us from our goals and our responsibilities, like the more modern cocaine, marijuana, or even liquor, etc.The "wizard" turns out to be only a mere human, as all of our heroes turn out to be in the end. We can strive to be like them, but it's only when others place us on a pedestal that our daily acts of heroism seem larger than life. It's those daily acts when added together that are truly the heroic in us all.The wicked witch, the "enemy" of America, requires more than just an army to be overcome, it also requires brains, courage and a heart to be overcome. By "heart" understand that compassion, sympathy and empathy are vital weapons in the battle, which is why America invests so much in foreign aid.It's this depth of storytelling that keeps us captivated by this movie as adults. There are many other reviews that better articulate the other great features to this film, such as the visual appeal, the music, the singing, the dancing, and...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A HUGE classic everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is creative, original, and very watchable. I first saw it 25 years ago. I was about 10 years old. I still find myself watching it every time it's on TV. It's not supposed to be realistic(obviously). It's filled with metaphors and meaning. Here's some trivia that can be missed. Repeated viewing reveals that the 3 characters that Dorothy meets are based on 3 people she knows. They are seen earlier in the movie, and are played by the same people. When re-watching, their early dialog becomes more note-worthy. The music is VERY memorable. And the movie has a very popular catch phrase everyone's heard many times. Also, there was a play on PBS in '95 based on the movie and I loved it. It starred Jewel and Roger Daltry as the Tin man and he ROCKed - literally. It was classic. I like how the audience laughing added to the play. It's out on VHS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am 51 years old and can remember watching this as a child. It was a major event in our house. Staying up late to watch the whole movie was a treat. It is still a treat to watch it now. As I sit here watching it on TBS while typing this posting, you can't help but sing along with the songs. I can remember being scared to death by the witch. Her laugh gave me the heebie-jeebies. Movies from this era were so well made. To attempt to make this kind of production today would cost much more than any film made. Today computers make special effects so easy. Back then you had to very ingenious to have believable special effects. This is one of my top 10 movies off all time. It makes you feel like a kid again, and isn't that what a movie is suppose to do, take you to another time and place. Those that don't understand are entitled to their opinions, but they really don't understand the real world. The more advanced the mind, the more need for play (or fun and escape). Just my humble opinion and something to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Endurable Fantasy...Will Continue To Last For Many Years Yet...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the world's most-watched film (GONE WITH THE WIND running a close second), THE WIZARD OF OZ is an enduring, magical piece of fantasy that has permeated popular culture like no other film before or since. There are hundreds of unforgettable, instant-classic moments in the film, with the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy and Toto, the songs, Garland's dazzling ruby red slippers, sepia-toned Kansas and the closing line "There's no place like a home!" just a few of the wondrous delights that THE WIZARD OF OZ offers.It is hard to believe that the filing of "Oz" was so fraught with problems when you view the finished product. It seems a thing of absolute perfection, with Garland's casting a stroke of genius. Her wistful interpretation of "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" is the stuff of legend. The spellbinding Technicolour photography is still a massive achievement, as is Oz, the utopia land of dreams and magic.Most audiences discover the film in childhood, and they will be pleased to find out that the film is just as magical when viewed as an adult, perhaps many years later, if not more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This marvellous film is so much a part of my childhood that I can't really look at it too objectively. But the more I watch it as an adult, the more impressed I am by the sheer quality of the sets, the special effects and the make-up. As a child you take it for granted, but to think all this was done in 1939. For serious Oz fans I would highly recommend Aljean Harmetz's fascinating book, which contains all the background info about the shoot and the planning of the film. The DVD is also good value and contains several scenes which were taken out of the finished version (such as the well-known "Jitterbug" sequence.)Every Christmas I sit down to watch this film, and I don't mind admitting that every time I hear "Over the Rainbow", it brings tears to my eyes. (The songs are, of course, another huge contribution to the movie's greatness.) The scene when Dorothy opens the door and walks into Oz, and the screen is filled with colour for the first time, is another memorable moment.The proverb may say that familiarity breeds contempt, but in the case of this film I doubt I will ever tire of it. Mind you, I am a friend of Dorothy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the fall of 2006, my husband and I saw a screening "The Wizard of Oz" that had a full orchestra providing the soundtrack. Never in my life had I seen a more eclectic audience: there were families with little children, adults who came alone (one woman was dressed as Glinda), teens and college students, even couples who had to have been in their '90s. Not to gush, but it's really a testimonial to "Oz"'s legacy that it can appeal to every generation, to every age. Like hot chocolate or Mickey Mouse T-shirts, "The Wizard of Oz" is something you never have to worry about being too old for. There is something so comforting about the familiar story of farm girl Dorothy's journey through the strange but wonderful land of Oz, and yet it remains a wonder to behold. I still get excited when Dorothy steps out her sepia-toned world of Kansas into the Technicolor Munchkinland, even though I learned ages ago how the trick was done. I'm still overjoyed when Dorothy makes another odd yet loyal friend along her journey (hmmm, a nice message of tolerance, too!). I still cry when Dorothy bids her friends farewell (Jack Haley in particular breaks my heart). I just want to yell at the screen, "no! Forget boring old Kansas, stay in Oz!"Not only is "The Wizard of Oz" a charming, addictive classic, but it's one of the best-cast films ever. Putty-limbed Ray Bolger ("Some people without brains do and AWFUL lot of talking, don't they?"), over-the-top Bert Lahr (I haven't any courage at all, I even scare myself!"), and boyishly charming Jack Haley ("Now I know I have a heart, 'cause it's breaking.") are pitch-perfect in their respective roles as the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man. All three were vaudeville vets, and they infuse their roles with both theatrical shtick and warmth. Billie Burke is memorably twittery yet poised as Glinda the Good Witch, and who can possibly forget Margaret Hamilton's cackling, gleefully evil performance as the Wicked Witch of the West? Hamiltion's iconic, villainous image is so emblazoned in our minds, that it's easy to forget she was a former kindergarten teacher and future animal rights activist! As superb as the cast is, however, "The Wizard of Oz" belongs to the young Judy Garland. Garland makes Dorothy a very real character that we can all relate too, whereas any other actress would have made her one-note and whiny. She believably plays an ordinary girl in an extraordinary place, her lovely brown eyes wide with awe and wonder. And that singing voice! Long before Garland's voice became tinged with tremulous desperation due to age and hard living, the true beauty and purity of her voice comes through in "Oz". Garland sings "Over the Rainbow" so simply, without a trace of theatrics, and you're swept away just the same. It's spellbinding, seeing someone so young have the presence and talent to hold a movie in the palm of her hand. "The Wizard of Oz" will remain the ultimate escapist classic for generations to come, and it will always be one of my favorites. It's comforting, familiar, why... it's just like home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The following is a quote from another review on here, complete with spelling errors..."Hello friends. To many of you, these claims may be outrages but i hope and pray that you will take this into your heart. As many of you may know, The wizard of Oz is the classic tale of a small Kansas girl named Dorthy and her adventures in the magical land of Oz all to find a wizard who can take her home. But when you can look past all of that you can see the storys real, dark, meaning. It may shock you to know that the wicked witch of the west is actually a parody of Christianity, out cast and feared. Glenda, The good witch represents Satan, who may seem nice on the outside, but is actually out to get your soul. And of course, sweet innocent Dorthey is the modern heathen who is pulled away from Christianity by Satan. Also there is the Lion, the Tin man, and the Scare Crow an obvious mockery of the Trinity! But friends, it dose't end there, if you look closely enogh in one scene, You will see some munchkins sacrifice a virgin on an alter! I am appauld that they show this movie in schools to CHILDREN! So I urge you to throw out any Wizard of Oz related items you may have and instead READ THE BIBLE. It is a great book written by the best aurthor ever!"End of quote. Whew!I believe in the Bible as much as anyone, but why oh why do so many "thumpers" insist on ramming it down peoples throats? I suppose they don't realize they're doing the exact opposite of what they're attempting to accomplish. Good Lord, get a life.The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. Period. End of story. Did you notice I said, story? It's a fairytale. A delightful fantasy. Nothing more, nothing less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enchanting, almost nostalgic art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With trepidation I decided to watch The Wizard Of Oz, for I have memories of it from when I was five, 32 years ago. My memory was of a flying house, and of a laughing witch, who didn't quite look like the witch I saw yesterday, but that is false memory for you! Of course yesterday I saw the movie as a hardened adult, as opposed to a pure innocent, so philosophically I am a different person. Even if there were no nostalgia in memory, there would have been, I feel sure, a sense that the morals of this movie would never be repeated today. We live in a world where even infants' dolls have been sexualised with makeup. Of course no time in history was innocent, but here we had a media that put warmth above "cool", charm above cynicism. There is something of a relatively European feel about Oz, a sensation I rarely see with Hollywood, with the magical The Lord Of The Rings trilogy being another example. The movie was an absolute joy to watch, such pleasure from movies is rare to be had, and I cannot recommend this enough, not just as an antidote to MTV-generation philistinism, but as a genuine work of art. No doubt much has been written on the skill and joyousness of the acting , the amazing sets, the imagination, the witty songs, the metaphors and the songs, all of which are perfect. I recommend showing this to all kids, it has so much more depth than the tacky, merchandising-driven modern stuff they ingest! And equally I recommend it to grown-ups, for we need this therapy more than the kids :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best fantasy of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen The Wizard of Oz lots of times and never tire of it. It has to be the best fantasy movie ever made.A twister sends Dorothy, her dog Toto and their home to the magical land of Oz. When there, she first discovers her home has crushed the Wicked Witch of the East to death and the area of Oz she has landed in is Munchkin Land. After a visit from the Good Witch of the North, some songs with the munchkins and an unpleasant visit from the Wicked Witch of the West, she starts to make her way along the Yellow Brick Road to the Emarald City to visit the Wizard himself who can get her back home to Kansas. On the way, she meets up with the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion and they eventually end up at the Emarald City. Before eventually meeting the Wizard, she is kidnapped by the Wicked Witch of the West's strange monkey-bat creature slaves and locked up in her castle but is rescued and the Witch disintegrates when some water is thrown over her. Dorothy then gets to see the Wizard, who gives the Scarecrow his brain, the Tin Man his heart and the Cowardly Lion his courage. The Wizard turns out to be a Kansas person as well but his balloon is accidentally released and Dorothy misses out on returning home with him. She returns home by saying "There's No Place Like Home" but all this turns out to be a dream at the end.The best song in the movie has to be "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", which Dorothy sings before she gets to Oz.Now to the excellent cast. Judy Garland plays her best role as Dorothy and is joined by Frank Morgan who has five roles, Burt Lahr, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and an excellent performance from Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West.This movie is an excellent way to spend part of an afternoon, not just at Christmas when most TV channels screen it. The VHS copy I own also features some extras, including one on the making of the move.Rating: 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic achievement that never truly grows old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You have no power here! Begone, before somebody drops a house on you, too!" It seems a little silly to be writing a review of The Wizard of Oz. It's the movie that's been seen by more people than any other in history. Most of us have seen it 10 times by the time we're seven. But I'll put my two cents in anyway, from an adult's point of view.As a kid, I thought the munchkins were slightly creepy and the winged monkeys much more so, but I loved Dorothy and I loved the songs, and the entire movie was just so bright and colorful that I find it hard to believe that any kid could dislike it. Now, at the age of 25, I can still recognize the merit of it, without being influenced much by a lasting nostalgia. The Wizard of Oz is a lot like Alice in Wonderland (my all-time favorite children's novel), it treats children like they're smart and clever and capable of understanding and handling ideas that sometimes we adults forget they can get a handle on. The danger and excitement of The Wizard of Oz is a true adventure, be it a candy-coated one.I can also better appreciate now the staggering amount of work and creativity that went into bringing this novel to life. It's just remarkable, really. The choreography, the classic songs, the sets, the costumes, the special effects, they're all still impressive today. More so, really, because many of the tools used to make modern movie magic weren't available back then. And Judy Garland...really, what needs to be said about her that isn't blindingly and extraordinarily obvious? No one else could have been Dorothy Gale.It was nice to revisit this once again, and while some of my childhood adoration for The Wizard of Oz may be gone, my admiration for it still remains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magic of The Wizard of Oz Created Through Theatrical, Cinematic and Musical Effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz, based on the children's book by Frank Baum, was released in 1939. The screen play was written by Noel Langley and the film was directed by Victor Flemming. Judy Garland stars as the main character Dorothy Gale. Billie Burke plays Glinda the Good Witch of the North, Ray Bolger the Scarecrow, Jack Haley the Tin Woodman, Bert Lahr the Cowardly Lion, Margaret Hamilton the Wicked Witch of the West, and Frank Morgan the Wizard of Oz.The story begins when Dorothy's house gets swept up in a tornado in Kansas and then lands in the magical world of Oz. When she steps outside of her house after the storm, Dorothy finds that her house has landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, and she acquires the witch's ruby slippers after she encounters the munchkins, Glinda the Good Witch, and the Wicked Witch of the West. To find her way back home to Kansas, Dorothy must travel to the Emerald City to see the Wizard of Oz. Along her way down the yellow brick road, she meets three new friends: Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion. Together, the group reaches the Wizard and, after killing the Wicked Witch of the West, the Wizard grants the Scarecrow a brain, the Tin Woodman a heart, the Cowardly Lion courage and Dorothy a ride home to Kansas in his hot air balloon. Unfortunately, the Wizard accidentally takes off before Dorothy can get on board. Then the Good Witch of the North enters and informs Dorothy she can go home by clicking the ruby slippers together and saying "there's no place like home." When Dorothy returns home, she realizes she was dreaming and many of the people from her life in Kansas were the characters she met in Oz.I think because the story was first adapted to the stage as a musical, the directors of the film used a combination of theatrical and cinematic effects to create the movie. I think the combination of these effects helped create the child-like whimsy of the story.Many theatrical effects can be seen throughout the movie. The characters' costumes and make up, especially that of the Munchkins, the Scarecrow, the Tin man, the Lion, the trees in the forest, the witches and the flying monkeys, would also be suitable for the stage. Much of the depth in the scenes and shots that take place in Oz, such as the field of flowers leading toward the Emerald City, is created by painted backdrops and panels similar to what you would see in on-stage productions. For many scenes, the camera was also positioned to give an audience member's point of view and much of the blocking is set up similar to an on-stage production. Many of the special effects are also theatrical in nature. The melting of the wicked witch was accomplished with dry ice and a hydraulic lift that lowered the actress into the set floor, much like a trap door on a stage. The Wizard's lair was accomplished with dry ice, lighting and fire. They also created the Wizard's hot air balloon with a painted backdrop and the basket was lifted with a pulley system to give the effect that he had taken off.However, many effects in the movie could only be accomplished by using cinematic techniques. Special effects such as the horse of a different color, the wicked witch's crystal ball, the good witch's pink bubble, and certain scenes with the flying monkeys could only have been created in the cinema. The director used the camera in a variation of shot angles, durations, sizes and movements to emphasize different actions and ideas that could not be highlighted as well in a stage production. The directors also used the camera to add to the mise en sc?ne of certain sequences such as the shots when Dorothy is clicking the ruby slippers together and saying, "there's no place like home." The shot is long in duration and is a close up on Dorothy. The lens slightly blurs the focus and then eventually overlays three images together: Dorothy's face, her ruby slippers, and a starburst-like pattern. This helps add to the idea that Dorothy is crossing back into the real world from the dream world. Another major effect that was only possible in film was the switch from sepia tone to color when Dorothy leaves Kansas and enters Oz and when she returns to Kansas from Oz. This effect helps creates a distinct separation between Dorothy's real world and fantasy world.Another effect that added to the whimsy of the story was the audio. The movie combines diegetic sound and non-diegetic sound to help tell the story. Diegetic sound such as the singing of the actors, ambient sound such as farm animal noises, the wind from the tornado and the Wizard's voice, and the character's dialogue were sources of sound found on the screen. Non-diegetic sound such as the musical score and some sound effects was sound that came from an off screen source.A combination of theatrical, cinematic and audio effects helped make The Wizard of Oz a movie masterpiece. The costumes, blocking, special effects, camera effects and sound all play important roles in tying the story together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wizard of Oz, is it even possible for anyone to not see this film? It's such a huge part of our pop culture, the picture, the sounds, the songs, the characters, the story. When you see the movie, you absolutely fall in love with it instantly, just because of it's magical charm. It makes you laugh, cry, and just realize maybe those little moments you realize you didn't mean what you said in anger. This is also such a beautifully made film, the colors were just so elegant, not to mention for 1939, how incredibly vibrant it was. The characters are just so lovable, how could you not fall for them? Dorothy, Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion, and the Tin Man along with a great supporting cast made this the most memorable and cherished classic.Dorothy is just a young girl in Kansas with her dog, Toto, and she lives with her Aunt and Uncle on the farm. When she learns that the nasty next door neighbor wants to get rid of Toto because of his barking, she runs away with him, but when she realizes she must come back home, there is a nasty tornado. The tornado lifts the house up with her in it and lands her in the world of Oz, but she learns that her house landed on the wicked witch of the east, the munchkins that she is greeted by worship her. Glenda, the good witch of the north, welcomes her as well, but the celebration is stopped when the wicked witch of the west wants Dorothy dead, but since Dorothy is wearing her sister's ruby red slippers(a gift from Glenda), she cannot harm Dorothy. But Dorothy knows she must go home, Glenda sends her to meet the wizard who will help her. On her journey to the Emerald City, she meets a scarecrow who is scared to death of fire and doesn't have a brain, he wants to come too to get a brain from the wizard. They meet the Tin Man next who has no heart, he wishes to go to the wizard to get a heart. Then they meet the Cowardly Lion who wishes to have some courage and asks if he could ask the wizard for it. Together they are on a journey to get what they want, but it won't be easy with an evil witch on their tale.This movie has practically every memorable line that you can imagine, memorable songs, just all in all, I know in some way or another if you haven't seen this film, you just know about it. It's such a magical film that will always bring back pleasant memories for me, I just love this movie. I will always recommend it, not just because of what it is, but seriously, it's just hard not to love the film. Everyone could relate to it in some way and it just touches your heart. It's a great movie that will remain a treasured classic for years and years to come.10/10</fullReview>

Follow and LIKE us at facebook.com/TwoMovieCriticsA remake and remaster of the great classic movie in 3-D IMAX with stunning detail.It was an amazing transformation as Cissy and I were taken back in time before we both were born, August 15th, 1939 when The Wizard Of Oz opened at the Grauman's Chinese Theater.Immediately when the movie started and the title began in eye-popping 3-D fonts with the great sound track, Cissy and I got misty eyed. Now we were seeing this movie as it was meant to be seen and that we had only seen on T.V. sets all of our lives. Seeing it on the large IMAX screen, and in 3-D was an overwhelming experience.You see and hear things you missed all those years on TV. The detail of Glinda's ( The Good Witch's ) costume and many other costumes was amazing. The rust marks on the Tin Man's ( Jack Haley's ) body was very detailed, and later very shinny after their visit to Oz.We also heard several adults explaining to their children some of the story line before the movie started. A new generation was being introduced to the Wizard Of Oz just as if they were at the opening in 1939.I suggest all lovers of The Wizard Of Oz relive this classic again with their children, and grandchildren the way it was meant to be seen on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And my head, I'd be scratchin/While my thoughts were busy hatchin/If I only had a brain..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know this is a classic which has more than withstood the test of time, so just some thoughts: Why would Dorothy want to go back to that god-forsaken farm instead of living in Oz, a place where Technicolor might've been invented? She didn't seem to get much love from anybody in Kansas, and Elvira Gulch is bound to come back for the dog (providing the cyclone didn't kill her). Another thought: Why is Glinda such a masochist? She appears to watch out over Dorothy and her friends from the heavens, but where is she when they really need her? Why are the residents of Oz so happy to see the Wizard leave? It's a big celebration, yet he's their ruler! Wouldn't they be sad to see him go? Also, there is no scene depicting the Wizard's unmasking of himself to the people of his city. How do they know he's the Wizard? Has he been behind that curtain since he arrived? A sketchy plot like this--which invites more questions than it answers--really shouldn't result in such a joyous picture, but it does. I remember when they re-released this to theaters in 1972 (after years of showing the thing on TV every year) and people lined-up down the street to see it again. That's the power of good movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz was my all time favorite movie when I was younger! After giving this movie a fresh look, after not watching it for a few years, I still noticed that there were those few parts that I absolutely loved! I think the special effects in this movie are great! I loveeeed when I was younger, and still do, the color changing horse! I also liked the entrances/exits of the Wicked Witch with the smoke/fire! Another great special effect is in the very beginning when the tornado hits and the lady is riding by on her bike, and as she passes the window, she gradually gets closer to it; at the closest point she turns into a witch. I love the fact that Dorothy's uncles in the beginning are the same characters or representative of the same characters as she finds down the yellow brick road (scare crow, tin man, and the lion). I also like the whole general meaning of the movie. I think that it is a great children movie because of this. It teaches you that you have to look within yourself to find the parts of you that you are missing; you can't just expect someone to give it to you. Overall, I love this movie!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great adventure, full of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is possibly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's full of life, energy and heart. This is probably what defines the term: movie-magic. There are so many classic moments here, after all this movie is still heavily quoted in pop-culture, 75 years after it was first released! The story is basically about a girl who longs for somewhere over the rainbow, and then gets what she wants... or is it really what she wants? The movie starts (as most people know) in plain sepia color, but when we first enter Oz, it switches to full color. This is truly amazing to see, especially in the 3D-bluray release! I must admit that I was a bit skeptic towards the 3D version, but when I watched it I was blown away! I felt suck in to the movie in a way that I had never been before! So I recommend everyone to watch this movie, no matter how old you are! And if you have the opportunity, then watch it in 3D, it's totally worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can anyone give this film less than 10/10? This should be number one film. It's not only magical and amazing and beautiful in a colourful, feel good way, its filled with talented actors, joyful songs and amazing characters.If you haven't seen it you must be mental. Go and see it. For a 1930's film the picture is amazing.How it goes from a black and white old sad picture to being the most colourful, bright, energetic thing on TV.Margaret Hamilton, The wicked witch of the west, once told a magazine before the film was out to stop ranting on about The Wizard Of Oz and focus on her other films as she thought the Wizard Of Oz would never make it big... Well look at it now.Worth every second of watching. It seriously makes me cry thinking of how much magic it brings to my heart and the world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..what else to say ?..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one can imagine what a sensation "Wiz" made at its original release. I was there - I saw it - and, quite frankly - I was not a child, even then......no one you knew had a penny, and could hardly afford the $1.25 I paid to see it. Many reviewers talk about "65 years", etc., much longer by now.......It was sheer magic - even to older survivors of the great depression. It took many adults back to a magical dream of a childhood become too-long bleak by the lack of money, just as "The Grapes of Wrath" was a testament to grinding poverty. That it has preserved so many factors of life and has endured through the decades since its release, what a inspiring document to people of all ages.Much has been written about the three-line process of recording color on film in the late 30s. It's this startling revelation to the eyes, this brilliance on the senses which make those films which used it so indelible on the mind and heart. This brilliance is far above the "natural" colors we see in today's movies.Although the entire cast could hardly be assembled today, no individual's names is necessary to make "Wiz" the most healing-of-the-soul movie it is. No matter your age, close your eyes and it will play for you. It may be a fairytale, but if only life were more like it. Wherever, see it.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a true classic in every sense of the word. The music, the story, the cast, the acting. This is all great. Of course I wasn't around in 1939 when it first came out, the first time I saw it was like many of you, on TV then later of VHS tape. I've seen this movie so many times that it isn't even funny. So many times I lost count over a decade ago. But as many times that I've seen it, I will never get tired of the WIZARD OF OZ. Now the only complaint I got and it's minor I assure you is that some of the musical numbers run a bit long, like a lot of musicals of the time period. But that is minor compared to the whole thing. 91/2 STARS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was always interested in fantasy movies and after watching this one it has become truly my favorite one, even tho I watched it quite late, in the age of 25. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and I just loved it. The story is about Judy Garland who plays Dorothy and is traveling to the land of Oz where she meets with Lion and the Scarecrow with who she has plenty of adventures and to battle the forces of evil. The writing and dialogues in the film are so fresh that you will be surprised. you will never have read or heart anything like this. This is kind of film which can be enjoyed by everyone regardless of their age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Whiz Of A Wiz If Ever A Wiz There Was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you've got a classic film that several generations of fans eagerly look forward to seeing televised every year, what critics say doesn't really matter. Several generations of the movie going public have made their voices heard loud and clear. It doesn't even matter that not one member of the cast is still with us to occasionally promote the film. It's reputation precedes it.What lucky accidents for two performers in the celebrated cast. First Judy Garland got her break because Darryl Zanuck would not loan Shirley Temple out at any price. She was just making more money for hi studio than anyone else in Hollywood and he wasn't going to cut Louis. B. Mayer in for a dime.However when MGM contract player Buddy Ebsen had a toxic allergic reaction to that Tin Man makeup paint, there was Zanuck happy to loan Jack Haley to MGM for what turned out to be his career role. In fact all seven of the stars, Judy Garland and her adult co-stars all got the roles they are most identified with. Tell me another film that can claim that?Back at the turn of the last century L. Frank Baum adapted his Oz stories to the Broadway stage in 1903. Baum wrote the play and also most of the song lyrics, none of which had any staying power. The great vaudeville team of David Montgomery and Fred Stone starred on Broadway for 293 performances. Stone played the Scarecrow and I could see him doing it, though not quite the same as Ray Bolger, Stone played all kinds of rustics when he later went to Hollywood. Montgomery played a character name I had not heard of, in fact if you look down a cast list on the Internet Broadway Database, you'll see a ton of characters you wouldn't be familiar with unless you read all the Baum Oz stories.MGM simplified and cut away a lot to bring what nearly all moviegoers on the planet are familiar with today. Included is new music which brought for The Wizard Of Oz it's two Oscars, for MGM house composer Herbert Stothart one for best musical scoring and for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg for Over The Rainbow, Best Song of 1939.That song almost didn't make the picture. In his infinite wisdom Louis B. Mayer pronounced the number as too much for a juvenile like Judy Garland, it belonged to someone like Nelson Eddy. Director Victor Fleming insisted it be kept in and the result was an Oscar and a song that Judy Garland could never do a live performance without. Though her voice and persona changed from winsome juvenile to the greatest female singing star ever, Over The Rainbow adapted itself over the years to her aging. Judy's now over that rainbow for many years as are Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch. Margaret Hamilton who scares the waste product out anybody as the Wicked Witch of the West. Kids even now when first seeing her have nightmares, I can speak from first hand experience there. We can't leave out traveling medicine showman and the title character Frank Morgan. To think all these people in one film got their career roles.For their time the special effects were breathtaking, from the tornado that took Dorothy Gale and her house over the rainbow to the mystical land of Oz. The camera work of Hal Rosson and the imagination of Buddy Gillespie in the MGM special effects department hold our rapt attention to this day.Back when she was starting the terrible twos, my niece Tara got to see The Wizard Of Oz for the first time. At that point for the next three years it became her ultimate babysitting tool. You sat her in front of the television, plopped in The Wizard Of Oz and just left her alone. She wouldn't move, but it got so bad that her parents and both grandmothers just got totally Wizarded out and couldn't look at the film for years.Knowing there's a Tara out there as I write this who is getting her first exposure to the Wizard Of Oz, this review is dedicated to her and all the youngsters like her and untold millions that will follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like viewing a favorite memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've avoided commenting on this film because for me, reviewing such a personal part of my childhood seemed impossible. Before vcrs/dvds, children gathered once a year in front of their televisions and held their breath. The seasonal showing of this film was an event not to be missed and I was no exception.Basically a surreal dream, the story moves with an excellent pacing that has delights at every turn. The Kansas scenes are cleverly timeless, no one talks on a telephone or drives a car for instance and the tornado is a miracle of cinematography. Totally fake, it looks very, very real. Whoever thought of the dual roles deserves a big tip of the hat.Everyone in this film is stellar, but personally the two actors who stand out from the pack are Garland and Hamilton. After so many years I can't imagine anyone else as Dorothy. Garland plays the role wide-eyed and full of conflict, frustrated at every turn she soldiers on and we fall in love with her. Then there is the great character actress Margaret Hamilton. I confess she was the reason I loved the film as a child when most children were terrified of her. Bigger than life, almost unhuman, Hamilton steals every single scene she is in. The combination of Hamilton's stern schoolmarm look and the brilliant costume by Adrian forever defined the perfect witch. Balancing the hat and dragging what looks like a very heavy cape creates a unique movement that is both grand and menacing. Forever remembered for this iconic role, it's a shame Hamilton wasn't recognized in her career with an honorary Academy Award. MGM obviously took advantage of the enormous sound stages. The Munchkinland set is mind boggling, weird and wonderful. Likewise the Emerald City with it's glamor gals (who date the film more than anything else)and the delightful "horse of a different color". The Great And Powerful OZ is still one of the coolest special effects ever.The musical score is beautiful, the lyrics to the songs corny but fun and memorable. Over The Rainbow of course stands alone and is probably the highlight of the film. The song foreshadows but also shows the turmoil within Dorothy (and later came to represent the turmoil within Garland). It's one of the most quintessential songs associated with a performer.Thankfully restorations have improved the quality of the print; the first section is presented in it's original sepia tone and the sound is crisp. This film is an American treasure, entertaining young and old for decades. I find it hard to believe that someone might not have seen it, but if you're out there and you're reading this, set aside some time, get comfortable and share a memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a classic, I am surprised to read some of these comments. Apparently, some people forget how old it is? In the 50's, we could not wait to see this movie, especially once a year on TV. But, seeing it on the screen was awesome. Last week, we took our nephew to see it, and I was amazed at how many people never saw it on a big screen. Guess we were lucky, it only cost 5 cents. Anyway, I have not read all the comments, and most are from out of the country, but if anyone travels thru Chittenango, NY---it was the home of L Frank Baum. His grandson still lives there, and every year, they put on a spectacle. The first time we drove thru, I was amazed, to see all the streets, yes, paved with yellow bricks. The businesses? They all had names like; Dorothy's place, or Oz gift store (I don't actually remember what they are, even thought I'm 45 minutes away.) But again, if you are going thru upstate NY, central NY---it's really pretty, especially this time of year, in the fall. Speaking of falls, they also have a pretty waterfall. My husband and I still watch this movie on TV! And tho the movie was released in August, it has my birthday in June, when the book came out, so it's special to me. Now, if only more movies were like this. Better yet, life! (one of the munchkins looks like a cousin of mine.) 1939 was a great year for movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Professor Marvel needn't have worried about Dorothy. She had what another screen icon displayed in an equally memorable role 30 years later: True grit.The 'true grit' that Mattie Ross admires in Rooster Cogburn was something she also possesses and I find a lot of similar character traits in Mattie and Dorothy. In 1939, audiences then loved Garland's performance as the girl who survives falling into a pigpen,losing her dog,riding out a tornado,then has to battle a witch and an obstreperous wizard on her journey back home. I mention the Duke because her Dorothy and his Rooster role both netted them Oscars in their somewhat similar careers. Her Oscar was a smaller honorary statuette (which she called a "Munchkin" award) given for her work as Dorothy. The Duke's Oscar was close to an honorary one also. It was far from his best work and his other nominations for THE ALAMO and SANDS OF IWO JIMA were much beneath his better efforts in RED RIVER, THE QUIET MAN and THE SEARCHERS, just to name a few. I think the older members of the Academy voting the awards wanted to give Wayne the prize for his body of work to that point, partly because they were a bit shocked at the popularity of THE MIDNIGHT COWBOY, an X-rated film that garnered best actor nominations for Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. I think the Academy knew they both had long careers facing them and would be up again for awards, and they do have 3 Oscars and 11 nominations between them. The other two actors up for the award then were equally deserving. Richard Burton had received his sixth Oscar nomination and went on to a record seven nominations without wins and Peter O'Toole had picked up his fourth nomination and just this year broke Burton's record with his 8th non-winning nomination. I'm sure a lot of the voting members felt O'Toole and Burton more deserving of the Oscar, but sentiment for the aging Duke won out and it was probably a very narrow margin of votes that carried the day. While the Duke's Oscar came near the end of his career, Judy's came when she was just getting started. But like Wayne's Rooster role, her most honored and beloved screen character represents just the tip of an iceberg. She earned two other Oscar nominations and sold a lot of records and was a popular TV performer. As John Wayne could never overcome his western/war hero screen persona (and probably never really would have given that up), Garland was never able to find a plum part like Dorothy again either. That's not to say she went totally downhill from there. By all accounts, she had an outstanding career, plagued though it was by personal troubles. But Dorothy put her star up in the cosmos and she could never reach that high again. Her plucky character and her memorable friends and foes in the enchanting world of Oz set this film apart as one of the greatest of all time and deservedly so.I just saw this on the big screen at my neighborhood Garland Theatre. Although like millions of others who had seen this on television more than once, it was still a great story brought to life by the magic of cinema. I don't know if I suddenly became allergic to popcorn, but the climax brought tears to my eyes. Few films do that for me and I was surprised at my reaction to what I thought was an old chestnut I'd seen more times than I can remember. Maybe I'm just getting old and decrepit and overly sentimental for the good old days or maybe it's because this film can still carry a powerful message to new generations seeing it anew. I'd like to believe it's more of the latter than the former. Dale Roloff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WIZARD OF OZ came out in 1939, captivating the hearts of thousands of children (and adults). The simple story of a young Kansas girl landing in the land of Oz with it's favourable characters like Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion, Tinman with Dorothy of to Emerald City to meet the great Oz himself.For a film this old, the Wizard Of Oz is stunning. Not classified as a mere child's movie but a movie classic. It's beauty and magic the sentiment of the soul. Judy Garland, gave her signature performance as Dorothy, Jack Haley for Tinman and Bert Lahr for Lion.The story is simple, the film is quite childish and the movie is dated; all the ingredients of such an enjoyable and memorable classic from the pen of L. Frank Baum.The DVD is great as we get to see a missing number from the film by Scarecrow. It is brilliant. Unleash the child within you and watch the movie for the classic it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 6/10/2007 - 10 out of 10(Dir-Victor Fleming): Perfect fantasy entertainment with singable songs and danceable tunes fit for the whole family. Prior to this viewing, I'm sure I saw the movie on television when I was younger during one of those annual viewings, but this is the first time I've seen it in it's entirety since taking on the challenge of reviewing movies and I must say this is the first time in a long time that I'm having a hard time finding any fault in a movie. It is fun from beginning to end even to a 42-year old, with excellent portrayals of all the well-loved characters from the L. Frank Baum novel. The closest thing to an issue I had was the cowardly lion's 2nd song about being the king, but even it had it's merits. The version I watched was at a special Turner Classics movie presentation with added sing-a-long titles that just added to the fun for the audience allowing them to participate. We all know the story, but I'll recap it here. It's about a girl Dorothy from Kansas(played by the immortal Judy Garland) having struggles at home being noticed(in black &amp; white), then a tornado comes, she goes into a fantasy world(in color) where a lot of her family is portrayed behind the Oz characters. She eventually learns that there is no place like home after struggling to get back there thru many trials &amp; tribulations mainly coming from the evil witch of the west. This is the basic story, but it is told with such inventiveness with excellent set pieces, songs, costumes and storytelling that keeps you interested to the very end(which changes to black &amp; white). After watching this, I now understand why this movie &amp; it's stars have been immortalized in filmdom for all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Central Text of American Pop Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of America's most often viewed and beloved films, The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a central text of popular culture. Its images and dialog represent a fund of common reference often drawn upon and responded to even by those who have not seen the film (a group of beings that excludes earthlings). One measure of Oz's impact is the vast quantity of borrowings from, re-makings of, and homages to the film found in every popular American artistic medium. As just a small sampling, one might cite Star Wars (1977), The Wiz (1978), The Muppet Movie (1979), A Christmas Story (1983), After Hours (1985), Return to Oz (1985), Wild at Heart (1990), Twister (1996), The Simpsons (multiple allusions), the rock group America's song "Tin Man" (1974), Oz (TV prison drama, premier 7/1/97), and Wicked: The Untold Story of the Witches of Oz (the current hit Broadway musical). In addition to its lasting cultural currency and entertainment value, The Wizard of Oz occupies an important place in American film history in a number of other respects. Along with The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Gone with the Wind (1939), Oz was an early masterpiece of the three-strip Technicolor process. Like most of the early Technicolor films, it used color not to enhance realism, but to create a fantastic or historically remote realm. Color is an obvious source of symbolism in Oz (e.g. "the yellow brick road," "Emerald City") and even infiltrates its musical score ("Somewhere Over the Rainbow"). Anticipating a film like Pleasantville by some 60 years, Oz also creates irony and other meaning through the dramatic juxtaposition of color and monochrome (sepia) film stock. The film's soundtrack was also groundbreaking in that, apart from backstage musicals, The Wizard of Oz was perhaps the first film to use an array of musical numbers to advance a dramatic plot, rather than simply as set pieces for heightening emotion or for demonstrating the singing and dancing ability of its protagonists. The film's visual effects are likewise historically significant. Although not quite the landmark that King Kong (1933) had been, The Wizard of Oz was nonetheless a remarkable and important testament to the increasing importance of film "magic" to the Hollywood style of production. The verisimilitude and dramatic power of such memorable scenes as the twister that transports Dorothy (Judy Garland) to Oz, the screen entrance of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke), in a gigantic bubble, the "Surrender Dorothy!" skywriting sequence, and the melting death of The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) are undeniable. Oz's visual grandeur is also the product of stunning glass painting composites of the Oz landscape and Emerald City skyline, wildly imaginative set designs in Munchkin land and the Wizard's palace, and the most memorable use of fantasy costuming and makeup in Hollywood history, gloriously highlighted of course by the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr).Adapted from L. Frank Baum's popular "modern fairy tale" The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1899), the film version of the story directed by Victor Fleming (et al.) is arguably a far superior work of art. Although it preserves the simplistic moral lessons of Baum's work ("there's no place like home"), The Wizard of Oz creates much more complex characters than are found in the original text. This is particularly true of the main character, Dorothy. If in the novel Dorothy's journey to Oz is straightforwardly literal, the film's Oz quest entails a transformation of characters and situations from mundane Kansas into dream/nightmare symbolism. This device adds psychological depth to the tale, particularly pertaining to Dorothy's problematic relation to the various mother /father figures in both locales. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Baum's novel) does, however, offer a fascinating sub-textual political allegory of the late 19th century Populist Movement, which is understandably absent from a screen adaptation written several decades later. According to this allegorical reading, the novel's Dorothy represents a well meaning but na?ve American public being led down a yellow brick road (the gold standard) to financial disaster. The road leads to Emerald City (i.e. Washington, the home of greenback dollars) and a sham Wizard (i.e. President Cleveland). Dorothy's companions represent politicians (The Cowardly Lion suggests William Jennings Bryant, the Populist Presidential candidate) or political factions (the Scarecrow suggests Midwestern farmers; The Tin Man evokes dehumanized Eastern factory workers; and even cuddly Toto is purportedly named for the era's "teetotalers.") As a political goal, "the way home" is the ideal of economic equity - to be secured, among other means, by the substitution of silver for gold as the standard for the dollar, legislation that would ease the spread of wealth to the nation's working class. Not coincidentally, the novel Dorothy's magic slippers are made of silver. That the film changes this famous footwear to a visually more dramatic, but politically meaningless, "ruby" indicates the Populist subtext had lost its significance to Oz's late 1930s audience. In its place, some commentators have argued - quite plausibly I think - that a "pre-feminist" politics may be discerned instead. In this view, Dorothy embodies a late 1930s stage in the transformation of the social role of American women from the end of the 19th century to the present day. Garland's Dorothy was the first widely popular female character in American storytelling to be portrayed as an archetypal "hero figure" (one who - in Joseph Campbell's formulation - is usually marked by birth and reluctantly called forth on a journey/mission fraught with dangers and filled with a significance beyond her or his narrow self-interest). As an orphan chosen by chance/fate in the form of a Kansas tornado to become the dream-world liberator of Oz and its "little people" inhabitants, Dorothy is closely akin to Luke Skywalker, Frodo, and The Matrix's Neo - awkward, unconfident adolescents whose heroic adventures symbolize their maturation into adulthood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie for Everybody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie again after a hiatus of several years. I was able to view it with a more objective eye; the movie didn't disappoint.Two facts stick out at me when pondering this film. First, it creates the hugest impact when the viewer sees it as a child. I still remember trembling at the Wicked Witch of the West at the tender age of seven. To a child, the Witch is terrifying--she'll scare the living Beejeesus out of him. The underlying subconscious motives of children are all addressed, in a most direct fashion, in this movie--the desire to get away, the loss of security, our feelings towards our Mothers (the Antie Em figure) and our fear of scary things. Nothing could possibly be more horrifying to a child than the crystal ball sequence, where our beloved Mother figure (Antie Em) turns into this horrible, cackling, Id-figure Witch.People who see the movie first as an adult are less impressed; one acquaintance said,"The movie's no big deal--you're not missing much." They have missed the child's Wizard of Oz experience and can't understand the impact.The other fact that strikes me is that this movie is truly Pan-Human--there's absolutely nothing in the film that would offend anyone, whether he be Muslim, Jewish, Christian, African, Russian, Chinese, or green or blue or purple. It truly is a film that transcends all human boundaries.There are a few plot holes in the film made necessary by cutting the film due to over-length. I wish I could see an unabridged edition; Margaret Hamilton has said that her part was cut drastically because the children in preview audiences got too scared. I believe, in retrospect, the deletion of the Jitterbug number was a mistake; its deletion causes a glaring plot hole, obvious to those who watch the movie closely.A little piece of errata--I remember very clearly a scene in the Witch's Castle that is either lost, or been deleted. It's when Dorothy is gazing at the hourglass. Seeing that the sand is getting ready to run out, she desperately tries to turn it over--but fails; the hourglass won't budge. Does anybody else remember this scene?All in all, this is a wonderful movie. If you and your children haven't seen it, run--not walk-- to the nearest store and buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Me and the wizard of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I been watching this film The Wizard of Oz for as long as I can remember. PS I'm 38 now. Both my kids who are 20 yrs old and 9yrs old adore it. The film is the most feel good film there is and its not Christmas unless its shown. The film teaches us all good morals. I've now received the film on DVD and video and I recommend you watch the documentary afterwards. My friend who travelled to Kansas two years ago brought me back items from the wizard of oz shop. These are my treasures. Everyone who knows me knows that I'm going to be the next Dorthy ha ha only joking. At the end of the day theirs only one Wizard of Oz and remember there's no place like home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is, and always will be, a classic for all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order to coincide with the upcoming "Oz, the Great and Powerful", I'm going to make my own review of this 1939 classic that will be celebrating it's 75th anniversary next year (not to mention the fact that it will be in IMAX 3D this year in September). I watched it when I was a little kid and loved it as much as anyone else in the film industry. Sure, it's not actually faithful to the book, but it doesn't matter.It did what it had set out to do and defined the meaning of a true Hollywood classic that inspired other acclaimed directors and filmmakers to do the same. The story is very original in the overall light-hearted tone, although it does have some moments that would make you feel scared(especially the Wicked Witch of the West who scared me as a little child). The scenery is beautiful and realistic and the look of the Emerald City is a sight to behold. The characters are charming and likable too. Judy Garland is a beautiful Dorothy, Ray Bolger is a terrific Scarecrow, Jack Haley is a wonderful Tin Man, Bert Lahr is a hilarious and cowardly Lion, and Margaret Hamilton is a scary Wicked Witch of the West.The pacing moves along very nicely, but the best part would have to go to the musical numbers written by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Yip Harbug including "Somewhere Over The Rainbow", "Ding! Dong! The Wicked Witch Is Dead", "If I Only Had A Brain", "If I Only Had A Heart", "If I Only Had The Nerve", "We're Off To See The Wizard", and more.Overall, The Wizard of Oz is, and always will be, a classic to those who are young and old. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Feature Is, v2.01</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story that scared me 55 years ago, around age four, but not as much as Peter Pan scared me. A story that I enjoyed during a school holiday, aged around 9, around 50 years ago. I now find that I could watch the budget DVD version, a triplet with Singin In The Rain and High Society, without going to sleep, that it held my attention better than most, even better than many recent features and the standard has improved massively since 1939. An unusual film. Interesting that Judy Garland, age sixteen, reminded me of Ashley Johnson, age ten. * Early 2008 I found an affordable copy of Easter Parade 1948. I know this is rated as a classic, but not many of these early ones that I used to rate a lot still have the fascination that they once had for me. This is one of the exceptions. A big plus for me is the commentary, by Ava Astaire McKenzie, Fred's daughter, and John Fricke, Judy's biographer. It brings out the warmth in the feature. It is supportive to this feature being one of the exceptions. I start to wonder if I should be a Judy Garland fan. The background notes for Oz put me off, but this swings things around. * April 2008, I try a search for affordable early Garland and the little that was there was rather high priced by my standards. A bit later I try an Amazon search and found Love Finds Andy Hardy 1938, Judy at age 15, shortly before Oz, but playing a12. A story with several strands so it is easy to not notice that Judy maybe has the second most important slot as regards screen time. I feel drawn to enjoying it and to considering it as an unusually interesting feature for that epoch. Early Garland seems yes, if and when available.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz, is no doubt, a cinematic class that breathes new life with each generation. Despite the film being released 76 years ago, it is still one of those rare gems that clicks with today's audience. Sure it has a rather simple story, but it's a resonant film that features groundbreaking visuals (that famous twister scene, anyone?), themes that can relate to anyone (courage, having a heart, etc), famous music that became a part of pop culture lore, and just a simple fantasy story that is fun to watch and is suitable for all ages. The story itself has the feel of a 1939 movie, but those visuals are still mightily impressive. The twister scene is just amazing, and it still fathoms me to see how they created all the flying objects seem realistic. The production design is amazing as well, as we get a very colorful film. Keep in mind that during this era, most films were black and white. The yellow brick road is a delight to look at, especially occupied by the central characters. The story is simple enough to follow, and it's one for all ages. Dorothy is whisked away from her Kansas farmland by a tornado, and it transports her to the magical land of Oz. Dorothy desperately wants to go home, but she is tasked with finding the wizard of Oz in Emerald City. She must follow the yellow brick road, where she finds allies in a talking scarecrow, a tin man, and a cowardly lion. But she also must avoid the Wicked Witch of the West if she wants to get home safely. The film is full of pure, magical performances. Judy Garland, a well- known name in 1939, was transported to stardom after the success of this movie. Her acting method is different by today's standard, but she effectively carries the movie as the kind-hearted Dorothy. Margaret Hamilton's performance was very scary, and rumor has it that much of her performance was edited due to it being scary. I imagine what her performance could have been if there was no editing. I also liked Ray Bolger, as the scarecrow trying to find a brain, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion looking for courage, and Jack Haley as the tin man looking for a heart. Everyone delivers praise-worthy performances here. While not an instant box-office success when first released, the Wizard of Oz delivers magic, wisdom, and just a great movie to the audience all around the world. From the magical tunes of "Somewhere over the Rainbow," to the interplay between Miss Gulch and Dorothy, to the experience with the Wizard of Oz, we have ourselves an unforgettable classic, which began with the writings of L. Frank Baum. I have seen this film many times, and it is still a fantastic delight to watch. Once I'm transported to Oz, "I'm no place like home," as Dorothy so kindly tells Toto, her dog. Once again, a classic movie for all ages. My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is groundbreaking, and even now it is held dear by many as a classic for film and storytelling. The costumes were brilliant especially for a new techni-color film, something many hadn't worked with at the time.Moreover, the special effects were outstanding for 1939, and I think that helped to step up filmmaking's game afterwards. With all the sequels and reboots, I think it's great that this movie has remained a timeless classic for the ages. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on such a great movie no matter your age, so go out and see it today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dorothy is played by Judy Garland, and her portrayal has lost little of its charm over the years. I honestly believe somebody watching this film for the first time would enjoy it just as much as its original audience.Dorothy is a simple innocent girl and that's what warms us to her, and this helps us to identify with her. In addition the additional characters in the film have their own unique charms. But each one of them has enough quality for us to believe in them.The conversion from the original book to this film is done excellently the actors that were chosen to play each part were just amazing. Maybe for people today the visual adaptation does show its age, but I for one don't care it shows thought about set design maybe missing in today's blue screen studios.There are more recent adaptations of this film but in all honesty this one is still my favourite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you believe I just saw this movie?! I've watched many classics over the years, but I just hadn't got to this one. Until this week. And I'm glad I did.The young Judy Garland as Dorothy singing Somewhere over the Rainbow is one memorable moment. And that's just one among lots of others in this movie. And all those lovable characters, The Scaregrow who wants to have a brain, The Tin Man who wants to have a heart and the Cowardly Lion who wants courage. Not to forget The Munchkins. The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a timeless classic, that's suitable for both kids and adults. Some kids may find some scenes rather scary, though. If you haven't seen this one yet, go do it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is literally a classic for all generations. The different changes made it what it is today. The most memorable part for me is when the Dorothy comes out of the house and if goes from sepia to color. The plot line is good and easy to follow it's great for all ages. The Wizard of Oz is a solid memory to have as a child. Dorothy role was so strong and solid and shows what can "happen" when you want to run away. The effects in the movie are great, when the evil which first makes her appearance it's big and dramatic. Her entrance describes her character right then and there. When Glinda the good witch makes her appearance she comes in sweet and smoothly. That describes her character for the rest of the movie. I will always give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Score Great childhood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well what a movie this classic was. I hadn't seen this movie in years. I can vaguely recall it even. However when I went along to it, It slowly came back to me. And I MEAN slowly. The plot was quite simple, in that Dororthy(Garland) is shushwed up ie swept up in a tornado into a fantasy land. The tornado was so real like, the one in Into the Storm(Review here). It was so impressive. So anyways, Dorothy then is found in a new place and is woken up to Munchkins. Then it is found that there are TWO wicked witches. One of the East)(whom was killed with Dorothy's house) and the Wicked Witch of the West(Hamilton). The Good Witch is also there and helps Dorothy out. Dorothy wanted to return home. However she has to Follow the Yellow Brick Road. People who know me, will know my love for music in Movies. Well this one surely did not disappoint me. I was happily singing all the songs. One thing I did notice was that the songs that were being song I was saying to myself: "Oh so this is where the song came from". On the way to the Wizard, Dorothy encounters Scarecrow(Bolger), Tin Man(Haley) and the Lion(Lahr). She told them as she met them on her travels, that she's going to the Wizard in the Emerald City to ask to be sent back home, while so Scarecrow wanted a Brain, Tin Man wanted a Heart, and the Lion wanted Courage. So a conflict ensues with the 4 of them and the Witch. As with any childhood movie, the Winning character is always what I want all the time not the "baddie". Then quite a shocker for me personally. Not sure abotu the rest of yeeee, but the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and the Lion and the "Wizard" are all her own family. Which I was saying: "Isn't that....." etc., Great childhood movie. Ohhh and the quotes, just unreal. One quote: When the Lion was requesting his Courage: "What makes a King out of a slave? Courage!" and the most one quote that really went through me: Considering my heart was broken by my first ex: You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable." and another quote relating to the heart: ": A heart is shown not by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others." So the movie ended on as always with a childhood(well the one's I've seen - hhaha) on a positive note. The Wicked Witch of the WEST, had been defeated. Dorothy was heading back. It was made out to be of a DREAM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're off to see the Wizard! The Wonderful Wizard of OZ! This movie is so magical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Victor Fleming, the 1939 musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, is probably the most well-known and commercial adaptation based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. While the film is so dated, it's still watchable even today becoming part of American pop culture. The film is known for its use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score and unusual characters. The movie starts out amazing black and white, with Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland), a young farm girl who lives with her Aunt and Uncle, in Kansas in the early 1900s. She decide to run away, due to Dorothy's dog Toto, biting a neighbor. Before she can get far, a tornado comes up, carried her and her house to the Technicolor world of Oz. Dorothy find out that the only way to get home is to find the Wizard (Frank Morgan). With help from Gilda, the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and some new friends on the way, like Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin-Man (Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion (Bert Lehr), they make their way to the Wizard on the dangerous yellow brick road, where the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is looking for revenge for Dorothy accidentally killing her sister. All the actors were wonderful in their roles, playing multiply complex parts, bringing the comedy and music and dance alive. Still, it was bit over the top. All the actors also play the farmhands in the beginning, making you wonder if all this Oz was just a dream. That was the main different between the film and the book. There were other things that the film change, such in the case of Dorothy's age. Shirley Temple was originally wanted for the role, but since they couldn't get her. They got Judy Garland and had to change the age from 7 to 16. They even wanted the blonde curls that Temple is famous for. The wig was top heavy and kept getting mess up, so they took it out, and went with Garland's natural hair. It's creepy in a way, that Dorothy was literally based on Frank Baum's daughter that die in childbirth. Frank Baum was known for his medium spiritual belief, and you see it in the character of Professor Marvel (also Frank Morgan). It's believe that the Wizard character represent fault power leader. The Wizard can be allegory to what Baum thought was fault power leader at the time, such as President McKinley who introduce the Gold Standard, in which many historians believe was represented by the Yellow Brick Road. Oz is indeed: an abbreviation that stands for gold, a hot political topic of the day where people were rallying for fixed gold and silver ratios. Some believe that, the Wizard in the film represent Franklin D. Roosevelt who was known to make illusions to sound strong and look powerful, when trying to present the New Deal to Americans at the time. Emerald City is allegory to Washington D.C that looks like money, but in the end, the film, it was dull white. If the novel, Emerald City look was based off the White City in the 1893's Chicago World Fair. Then 1939's Emerald City was the New Deal, Washington D.C. Then, all of Dorothy's friends could be presented as Coxey's Army, an group of unemployed workers made out of farmers (Scarecrow), laborers (Tin-Man) and free silver supporters (Cowardly Lion). It is said that the Lion represents 19th century politician William Jennings Bryan, who was viewed as someone having a load roar, but no power or bite. Honestly, in the book, the Bimetallism Ruby slipper were really silver. There were a lot of things that wasn't in the film that was in the novel such as the visit to China Country, Queen of the Field Mice, the battle with Giants Spiders &amp; Kalidahs, and the attack of the armless Qualdings. Talking about missing limbs. Civil War vets with prosthetic limbs were inspiration for the Tin-Man. There is a tale that Tin Man was indeed a munchkin named Nick Chopper. The screenwriters wanted Tin Woodman to be a hardened criminal so heartless he was sentenced to be placed in a tin suit for eternity. The torture of being encased in the suit had softened him and made him gentle and kind. Wow, that's really dark. Another dark urban legend claimed that, in the film, a Munchkin could be seen committing suicide by hanging by the neck from behind a prop tree and swinging back and forth in the left background, but it was just a bird. There were a lot of weird rewrites, like a spoiled, selfish princess in Oz outlawing music and others. The role of the Wicked Witch of the West was also enlarged for the movie. While, the Witch of the West in the novel was less evil. I think this role fit the film, well. Mad props to Hamilton for continuing the role after getting badly burn during production. There are at least 44 major differences between the book and this movie. Nevertheless, the film was far more faithful to Baum's original book. Still, they almost cut the most famous song from the movie, 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' written by E.Y 'Yip" Harburg. Glad, they kept it. The song "The Jitterbug," was instead delete. The film footage for the song been lost, but you can find the 'Jitterbug' footage rehearsals on newer DVDs version. I still dig the other songs. "Ding! Dong! The Witch is Dead" "We're Off to See the Wizard" and "The Merry Old Land of Oz" are some of my favorites. The movie always have great special effects, and top production value for the time. Still the story is lacking an overall moral and there were lot of not necessary extra scenes that could be cut out. Overall: a great movie that will forever be known as one of the greatest movies of all time. I have to agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic fairy tale with dazzling fantasy , colorful images , impressive songs and enjoyable roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marvelous tale in which Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland , she had to wear a painful corset-style device around her torso so that she would appear younger and flat-chested) is swept away to a magical location in a tornado and being transported on the land of Oz she embarks on a quest to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan , he plays various characters) who can help her return home . The film opens in sepia-tone academy ratio for the Kansas scenes, before widening out and blooming into full color in Oz . There appears Dorothy and her dog when she is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz. She's helped by the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) , but she's also in trouble with the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton, many of her scenes were either trimmed or deleted entirely, her performance was thought too frightening for audiences) . Reluctantly drawn into the problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Dorothy must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. On her way she meets the Munchkins (they are portrayed by the Singer Midgets, named not for their musical abilities ,the troupe came from Europe to immigrate and escape the Nazis) , a Scarecrow (Ray Bolger , face makeup wore consisted, in part, of a rubber prosthetic with a woven pattern to suggest cloth) who needs a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley who wrote additional dialogue) who wants a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bet Lahr , he wrote additional dialogue , too) who desperately needs courage . Putting their arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry they transform themselves not only into the great and powerful helpers of Oz but into the better friends as well . This is an agreeable film for children of all ages based on the all-time classic by Frank Baum . This engrossing picture contains powerful ,haunting images and immortal songs ,in fact the song "Over the Rainbow" was ranked #1 by the American Film Institute in 2004 on the 100 Greatest Songs in American Films list . Beautiful scenery , colorful cinematography by Harold Rosson , spirited adventure and a stirring climax lift this story . It is a genuine as well as imaginative tale written and directed with great sensibility , fairness and imagination. It's plenty of scenes that stay in the mind as when Dorothy/Judy Garland appears at the 'other side' that results to be the fantastic as well as glowing world of OZ . There's something for everyone here ; fans of fantasy , fans of magic and necromancy , fans of incredible adventures , should all find something to enjoy about this film . A perfect cast and enjoyable secondaries in the perfect fantasy . As a likable acting by Judy Garland as an adorable girl who is swept away to an enchanted land . Sympathetic support cast such as Ray Bolger , Billy Burke , Charles Grapewin , Jack Haley , Frank Morgan and Margaret Hamilton as witch ; among others . Spectacular and glamorous sets , production designer Cedric Gibbons studied the films of Walt Disney classic films to achieve the appropriate Art Deco design for the Emerald City of Oz . The film was completely shot in studio , the only location footage in the entire film are the clouds over the opening titles . The director opted to use practical sets in conjunction with matte painting . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Victor Fleming , though supported by other notorious as well as uncredited filmmakers such as George Cukor , Norman Taurog , King Vidor and Mervyn LeRoy , also producer . However , Richard Thorpe, the original director of the film, had shot around two weeks of footage before he was fired . A recent study claimed that this is the most watched movie in film history, largely due to the number of television screenings each year as well as video which has enabled children of every generation to see it. This story about OZ has been adapted several times such as : An old and mute version (1925) , this classic and the best rendition , the MGM release The wizard of Oz (1939) by Victor Fleming with Judy Garland , remade in 1978 as The Wiz by Sidney Lumet with Diana Ross , Richard Pryor and Michael Jackson and Return to Oz (1985) by Walter Murch with Fauriza Falk ,Nicol Williamson, Matt Clark and Piper Laurie . And recent prequel (2013) by Sam Raimi titled Oz the Great and Powerful with James Franco as Oz , Mila Kunis as Theodora , Rachel Weisz as Evanora and Michelle Williams as Annie .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born the same year the movie came out, but only caught up with it the other night, mainly because musicals are not my usual movie fare. So what's left to say after 500+ reviews. I was most impressed by the art and set direction. Too bad they didn't win Oscars. The sets were so imaginative and well done, from poppy fields to enchanted woods to yellow brick road. For once, MGM's habit of over-producing what's on screen really paid off with an appropriately lavish scale. The effects are simply breathtaking, but I can also detect the nightmarish visuals that go beyond the demonic Witch of the West. So I can see why kids would be both mesmerized and unsettled by the fantastic adventures.I also have to say that Garland was wonderful as Dorothy, though I've never been a particular fan. Plus, her captivating rendition of Rainbow deserves to top the all-time movie charts. All in all, I'm sorry it took me so long to catch up. It's really hard to believe that so many cooks (writers &amp; directors) didn't spoil the outcome. Somehow, the sumptuous production with its sturdy moral all came together, and remains aptly a movie for the ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think everyone everywhere should watch this movie every year. Well I guess that is a bit much. I do believe, I do believe so says the cowardly lion in this wonderful tale. It has everything, black and white, a dog, a girl that can really sing, a lesson to be learned by all and of course a Wizard. I don't want to spoil this movie so if you haven't seen it I would suggest you go and buy it as soon as you can. I recently saw the re released 3 D version and thoroughly enjoyed it. What fun it was to see it in a big theater with lots of people who love this movie and it reminds many people of their childhood. I do wish there was a real place like Oz where you wouldn't have to go to work till at one but take an hour for lunch and then at two we're done! Jolly good fun.</fullReview>

With her beloved Toto the dog, they find themselves in such a weird but happy land.Where she runs into the Scarecrow, Tin Man,and Lion. Who are in need of brain, heart, and courage respectfully. But the Oz person is not who they seem to be. If you did not see this, near the end.There is also one good witch and one bad witch. The latter happened to be a mean woman trying to sell off Toto from a crying Dorothy. Still really a sweet and really funny movie.You do not get much movies like this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"And you, and you, and you were there." All of Dorothy's friends look at her as if she was crazy, assuring her that her adventure was just a dream. Was it really just a dream? How could it be, when it seemed so real? In Viktor Fleming's, "The Wizard of Oz", dream is made into reality and reality into dream. "The Wizard of Oz" is a classical masterpiece in which breathtaking design, performance and a heart-warming storyline combine to create a movie in its very own category.In Kansas, a twister hits Dorothy's home and she is hit by a window, falling into her dreamland of Oz. We follow Dorothy (Judy Garland) on her quest for the Wizard of Oz, in the land of munchkins, evil and good witches, and many more interesting characters. The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and Tin Man (Jack Haley) are just some of the friends, with their own problems, that she meets on her way. The story is all about "following the yellow brick road" as "we're off to see the wizard."The screenplay was adapted from Frank T. Baum's story chronicle, The Wizard of Oz. It was produced by Mervyn Leroy and acted out by a first class list of actors. Perhaps the most important factors of this movie are the Technicolor (this is the first movie in color), the songs (that you'll never forget and never get enough of), and the ubiquitous theme/moral of "there's no place like home."The plot is very easy to follow and straightforward. Despite the seemingly unrealistic storyline of wizards, a land of munchkins, flying monkeys, and bad witches flying on broomsticks, viewers can't help but fall into the fantasy of it all and imagine there really is such a place "somewhere over the rainbow." The characters are all believable and you seem able to relate to them and know at least one person in your life like them. People love the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion for their loyalty and personal quirks, and loathe the Wicked Witch of the West for being so sinfully evil. The dialogue is also very amusing, with a deeper meaning than most would conceive at first. There are many hidden messages of friendship, loyalty, and seeing what's right in front of you all along. The actors are very convincing as their characters, all seemingly to step right out from the original story. Judy Garland perhaps was the best choice for Dorothy because the viewer just can't help but fall in love and sympathize for her when they see those big brown eyes staring back at them from the screen. She has a raw performance in which you can feel each emotion through her expression. From the moment Dorothy opens her front door after landing in Oz and exclaims "Oh!" the screen is filled with bright and vibrant color, a sharp contrast from the dull black and white from a second before. The significance of this is not lost, as the use of color is artfully done throughout the movie. The Technicolor sets the film apart because it is the first picture to be in color. During the movie the ever present yellow brick road takes the viewer through a journey of colorful and unique places, like the charming Munchkin Land and eerily spooky Haunted Forest.This film is one that's timeless for a good reason. The acting is wonderful as is the set, themes, and dramatic aspects. The "Wizard of Oz" was one of a kind when it first came out and 75 years later it still touches people's hearts. The movie keeps the audience's interest and you walk away from it smiling. After watching the movie, it will give you a deeper respect for what you are and have. As Dorothy says, "There's no place like home," well, there's no movie like the Wizard of Oz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz with always be treasured throughout centuries. It is a piece of art. So magical. So beautiful. Judy Garland is so poised as Dorothy even at the young age of 16. The music and dancing are wonderful. Roy Bolger is awesome as "The Scarecrow". Such talent went into the casting of the film. Such special effects for a film almost putting it way before it's time. I feel some of these effects have been carried through with future films that have been made. Each film learns from the other. I will always love "The Wizard of Oz. Looking forward to the recent films that will continue the Oz series. I loved James Franco's portrayal in "Oz the Great and Powerful". Still nothing will come to the magic of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no place like Oz!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Fleming made two movies in 1939, Gone With The Wind and The Wizard Of Oz. This may be the most played movie of all time and left children of all ages a classic, quoted as much as that other movie. We all know Judy Garland and the dreamlike story, but it continues to work for me due to it's altruist quartet together on their journey for personal completion. As they often meet up with the terrifying Margaret Hamilton and her army of flying monkeys, the struggle to find their way home is rewarded by the self help revelations which seemingly grant each their wish. There's movie theaters where we can escape, AA meetings and their like where we can seek self improvement, and there's home, of course. But there's no place like Oz that puts them all together</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful "Wizard of Oz"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still one of the best children's fantasy adventure films ever - with songs! The use of colour in a film has never been surpassed in my view, making the contrast from dusty, grey Kansas to perfect, day-glo Oz all the more telling, and making you realise what an inspired cinematic idea it was! The point has been well made before, but you do have to wonder why Dorothy would ever want to leave the fairy-tale world, until you consider the moral point of the movie which is to celebrate family and home life, even if the grass is literally greener on the other side.The special effects are remarkable for the time, from the devastation of the tornado, the monumental city of Oz and even the comings and goings of Glinda the good witch. Probably the only sub-standard scenes of this type are those of the wicked witch flying on her broomstick, but perhaps I'm being too post-modern in my judgement. The characterisations are mostly delightful, my only carps being that Glinda is just too glutinous to be true, plus I never really cared much for the Munchkins.. Outstanding in the cast naturally is Judy Garland as Dorothy, displaying childish insecurity on the one hand but feisty perseverance on the other. She interacts beautifully and naturally with her three new friends and even Toto! The songs are unforgettable too, "Over The Rainbow" and "We're Off To See The Wizard" especially being songs for the ages . I've seen the film many times, naturally, but it's still a remarkable feat of artistic creativity and to mind hasn't been matched never mind surpassed by any number of real-life Disney or Pixar films since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding; Legendary Performances and Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had never seen this movie before, I would have been speechless. I don't want to overdo the praise I have for this movie, because I wouldn't want to make you think it's better than it is. But it really is very, very good indeed and when you consider the date it was made (1939), a production like this is of the very highest quality. I am surprised it didn't sweep up more Oscars but I'm glad that Judy Garland received some quality recognition as a fine performer in this movie.All the acting is superb and nobody is badly cast. Yes, these were the good old days, days when acting was the supreme thing and if you couldn't act very well, you could not hope to make it. Judy Garland was the very best of the best. She could act very well, she could sing beautifully, she could dance and keep you very entertained. She was excellent and her performance in this film is merely an example of her extreme amount of natural ability. It is indeed a great shame that her life was such a tragedy and I can hardly believe she never won an Oscar. But her friends are all outstanding too, especially Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. His performance shines the most in my opinion, but it would be unwise not to say that Ray Bolger and Jack Haley are just as naturally gifted. The characters these three portray are some of the finest and most infamous in movie history and rightly so. They are an absolute pleasure to watch. Margaret Hamilton is very good as the witch, especially her vocal work. Her cackle and a plenteous amount of her words ring in your ears afterwards.The story is great and will be enjoyed by both children and adults. The scenery and production is fantastic and can hardly be improved, even to this day. I was staggered. This must have been a very expensive movie to make. It's a real triumph of Cinema.This film certainly deserves to be classed amongst the greatest films of all time. I'm glad it is on the Top 250 list of IMDb. If you've never seen it, it's a real treat for movie and acting-lovers and most of us on IMDb seem to think so.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most likable movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is one of those movies that it's hard not to like, and I'm not just saying because everyone else likes it and you feel obligated to like it. It's just such a sweet and charming film, that if you do dislike it I bet you feel kind of like an asshole. So this film has definitely earned it's rebutation as a classic.However, there are a few plot holes in the story, such as why the witch doesn't just take Dorthy when she doesn't have Glinda to protect her. Or they may just drop a major part of the film. Remember the fact that Toto is bound by law to be killed at the beginning, and then it just sort of is never brought up again. And am I the only one who thinks Judy Garland is a little too old for this. She was sixteen when she filmed it, but she is playing a twelve year old, yet to me she always kind of looked like she was in her early twenties.Now let's talk about the special effects, while watching this today, I still ask how they did some of these. Yes some of them are quite obvious, but others seem like they need CGI to be able to become reality. All the characters are extremely likable, and in the middle of the film when it gets dark I honestly feel really sad for Dorthy and want her to get back home. The songs are catchy, despite a few being very similar in tune. And this film looks beautiful, I mean don't get me wrong, "Citizen Kane" was technically a fantastic movie, but this film came out two years earlier, does some really unique stuff too and is in color, so why is this always rated lower. And it just leaves you with a good feeling, with a nice moral.While The Wizard of Oz isn't perfect, it's just such a likable movie, I can't really imagine people hating this movie. Sure it has some plot holes and some stuff doesn't make sense, but it's just a beautiful, likable, and well executed movie with great characters and songs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a great film after all these long years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to fantasy films, people of today look at Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Most of them are extraordinary in their own way, but The Wizard of Oz still stands out as an all time classic. The Visual Styles, the story and memorable songs still hold up after 72 years. The film was based on the novel and ever since it's release, it has been recognized through out decade after decade, and till this day, people could still confirm this film as a great movie from their childhood. When I watch this film, I get a warm feeling in me that just glows. Even when I was not in the best mood, this film was always their to cheer me up. The visual style is still fantastic, even to this day. It's like a flash of color in your eyes, and that Emerald City still shines like a diamond. The characters are still great. Dorathy is a farm girl who's tired of her life in the farm and dreams of a world full of imagination. Scarecrow is without a brain. Tinman is a human tin without a heart, though is still sentimental and compassionate. The Cowardly Lion is a hilarious Lion who's...well, a coward. And The Wicked Witch is a symbol of childhood fears. Man I remember how much she scared me when I was a child. That black attire, green skin and cackling voice would have kids running for their moms. What else is there to say. The music is done very well and the musical numbers are great. My favorite is when the lion sings about what his life would be if he had the nerve to become king of the forest. Then there's one of the most memorable songs ,sung by Judy Garland, that will live in all our hearts and never be forgotten from time to time.This film will go on and on for generations to come. If you have kids of your own, give yourself the time to introduce this film, they might have the same effect for their childhoods as ours did. If I have kids, this will be the first film I will introduce them to. It's a timeless gem that will never grow old, it's one of my all-time favorite films. One of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable and enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is a musical fantasy film which is a 1939 movie adaptation of the 1900 book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, written by Lyman Frank Baum. Baum also wrote 13 further stories set in Oz, as well as many other children's novels.Firstly, I'll start off this review by saying that I'm not a big fan of musicals. While I can appreciate the amount of effort that goes into writing lyrics and incorporating the songs into the film, I've never really understood or enjoyed the genre. Just the idea of having a film where people burst out singing for no good reason doesn't sit too well for me.That being said, this is one of the few musical films that not only I find enjoyable, but it's also one of the most memorable films I've ever seen. The songs in this film, apart from being catchy, are incorporated very well into the film and, most of the time, are actually important to the plot, and not just for entertainment. One of the biggest pet peeves of mine is the fact that in most musicals, generally they just sing about something that's completely irrelevant to what's going on. Anyway, onto the review! The plot revolves around Dorothy Gale, a farm girl from Kansas, her dog Toto, a scarecrow, a tin man and a cowardly lion, among other characters. Starting off in Kansas, when Toto bites the irritable Almira Gulch, she obtains a sheriff's order to take away and put Toto down. Dorothy and Toto flee back home, and find that a gigantic twister is fast approaching. Seeking shelter inside the house, Dorothy is knocked unconscious. She and Toto wind up in the strange, very colourful land of Oz (still in the house). Wishing to return home, she is informed by Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, that the Wizard of Oz is her only option, and the only way to get Emerald City, where he is situated, is by following the famous Yellow Brick Road. Along the way, she meets a Scarecrow who seeks a brain, a Tin Man who seeks a heart, and a Cowardly Lion who seeks courage, and they all decide to go to the Emerald City together. But their journey is hindered by the Wicked Witch of the West, who wishes to seek revenge against Dorothy for killing the Wicked Witch of the East. Coincidentally, Dorothy's house accidentally lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. I won't reveal the ending, but I will say that it is a surprising one, and by far one of the best I've ever seen.So, what makes this film "memorable and enjoyable"? Being a musical, the songs play the largest role in the film, and they are among the most catchiest, most original and happiest I've ever heard. The voice of the beautiful Judy Garland make the songs really stand out and shine. Of course, you can't forget the other characters, such as the munchkins, who sing the ever-so-catchy "Ding Dong The Witch is Dead", and the Scarecrow's wishful ballad "If I Only Had a Brain". Not only are the songs amazingly well written, but they really do fit in with the story, and turn what would be boring dialogue scenes into joyous and remarkable melodies.And it's not just the songs which make this film a masterpiece. While the acting isn't realistic, the lines are delivered extremely well by every actor in the film, and there are a lot of lines in the film which people still use today, such as "There's no place like home" and the more hilarious "I'm melting! Melting!". Another thing that's well done in this film is the visual aspect. The farm sequences in Kansas are filmed in Sepia, in order to create drab, mundane effect, while in Oz, it's filmed in colour, to create a wonderland type effect. The sets are also very attractive and original. The Emerald City glows the brightest lime green, but the Wicked Witch's castle, in contrast, is dim and dark, with lot's of grey, black and brown.There are a few things which drag the film down, such as the duration. Some scenes, I feel, are stretched out and are a lot longer than they should be. And, sometimes the film can get a bit boring in the non-musical scenes, but I suppose that just proves how good the songs are! With amazing audio, visual and dialogue components, it's no wonder that The Wizard of Oz is the most watched film of all time, and some, including me, would go as far to say that it is the most enjoyed film of all time. I give the film an 8 out of 10 because, while I enjoy the film, I just don't like musicals. However, I will say that if this film was done in any other form than a musical, it would've been horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what is the main genre for this movie: musical, family or fantasy movie. It has a bit of everything and succeeds in every aspect. Yes the story is simple and there isn't that much action but I don't think a movie needs to be scary or have violence to be entertaining. Despite being made pre World War II this movie is magical. What makes the movie really enjoyable are its colorful characters who take you onto a journey with catchy songs. Although Judy Garland was story-wise too old to play Dorothy, I don't think anyone else could have done it better here. Her song "Somewhere over the rainbow" is still a very recognizable and loved song today. That this movie still stands strong without CGI or expensive decor is an amazing feat. Maybe not a movie I would watch that often but when I do I will love every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie that takes us to our childhood..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of us remember seeing the film at an early age on television, when the bleak black and white of Kansas is magically transformed into the rainbow colors of the Land of Oz. The special effects were by Arnold Gillespie, and to this day the horse of a different color that switches from purple to red to yellow is an inspiration to young audiences. For a film shot on MGM sound stages, the picture has amazing depth, and this is thanks to George Gibson's painted backdrops with blue mountains and white peaks that evoked the aura of the Emerald City.This is pure escapism and Dorothy (Judy Garland) literally escapes from Kansas to take her journey to see the Wizard. In the journey she meets a few friends. These friends are the Wizard of Oz played by Frank Morgan, the Scarecrow played by Ray Bolger, the Cowardly lion played by Bert Lehr, the tin man played by Jack Haley, and the princess played by Billie Burke. Everyone could always enjoy a nice story that takes them on a crazy ride through fantasy world and then snaps back to the real world at the end. The appeal of the film may have something to do with the fact that it symbolizes Dorothy's last childhood experience and it is her loss of innocence that is portrayed. At the end of the movie, Dorothy returns to Kansas, back to her old life with her family. Dorothy wore a corset-like dress to make sure that her filling-out figure was not revealed this made the look of an eleven-year old is preserved. The film ends with the moral that there is no place like home, no matter how exotic and fantastic. Far from being depressing and anti-fantasy, the film encourages young people to be creative with their minds. There is no reason that Bert Lahrs Zeke cannot be transformed into The Cowardly Lion though creative day-dreaming. I know when I saw it as a small child I liked to day dream and try to go to the Land of Oz myself. From then on out as a child if I were having a bad day I would just lay in bed and try to go away. It was very relaxing to try and use my imagination to visit the tin man, the lion, the scarecrow and the Wizard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story for discovering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1939, the U.S. qualified director Victor Fleming, had made 39 films, and "THE WIZARD OF OZ" became his third major children's film after "Treasure Island" and "Captains Courageous". With this trilogy, was already part of the immortals of film. Based on the book by Frank Baum, "THE WIZARD OF OZ" is the story of a beautiful dream. Lesson for a girl named Dorothy, and for all children - and adults - of the world, some of those things that we spend looking outside, when in fact we have inside. Four unforgettable characters we recreate these values: a scarecrow (intelligence), a tin man (feeling), a lion (courage) and little Dorothy (the family warmth).All they travel, by a witch enchanted land and on board in search of a known character called The Wizard of Oz from whom they hope they can recover what they consider to be lost. And this, with great wisdom, giving them the opportunity to act, they should watch. "Extract from within you all the values you claim. The values are within us, only must flow". "I must find what I want out, because it is there will not be anywhere else." "Many people own symbols, but are not really what these symbols represent". "The value of a man is not determined by how much he loves, but by how much he is loved". Fundamental lessons for life in the home, in the street, at work or study. Lessons allow us to be and should not ever forget. "THE WIZARD OF OZ" fun, looks with delight, one falls in love with his characters, unrestricted travel by that fantasy world that never grows old, and Judy Garland singing "Over the Rainbow", carved bear it in your memory forever. And finally, there is one with the feeling of seeing something beautiful, something meaningful.I see no objection. It is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

The others that I've seen are either like sequels or something or they just add in a bunch of random garbage. As the first movie to have color, this movie was amazing when it came out and it's still pretty good today. Although color is normal today, it's interesting to see what people thought was incredible in 1939. According to IMDb, several Wizard of Oz movies are scheduled. I think that they need to stop them just as much if not more than they need to stop Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. In short, this movie is worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfecting Baum's vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A book I was once reading referred to Frank Baum's use of a dream as a narrative device--revealing the author's ignorance that Baum's novel depicted Oz as a real place, not a dream. The idea that it was a dream was an innovation of the 1939 movie. I'm always amazed at how many people haven't read the novel and make mistakes like that. It's one of the most popular and enduring stories of modern times, yet it's remembered mostly through the 1939 film.Ironically, Baum disliked the "It was all a dream" convention in literature. I agree with him. It's a convention that usually seems contrived. "Wizard of Oz," however, is a a rare example of a film that makes it work. One of the movie's secrets, I believe, is that it keeps the idea in the background most of the time and doesn't dwell on it. Dorothy's Oz experience is far too coherent and stable to plausibly represent a dream. It isn't like "Alice in Wonderland," a meditation on absurdity. Since it's adapted from a straightforward fantasy, the events are impossible but not absurd, magical but not nonsensical.That's why it works so well. Too many filmmakers today think they have to present dreams as, well, dreamlike, full of weird and disconnected imagery. That may be realistic, but it doesn't make for good storytelling. As a result, movies about dreams usually range from turkeys like the John Candy comedy "Delirious" to bizarre tours de force like Richard Linklater's "Waking Life." Few movies treat the subject in a nonchalant, offhand fashion, the way "Wizard of Oz" did.Granted, occasional scenes in the 1939 film do feel a little dreamlike. There is, for example, the "lions, tigers, and bears" sequence, where as soon as Dorothy thinks a frightening thought, it immediately happens. Then there's the scene where Dorothy can't remember why Scarecrow and Tin Man, both versions of workers from her Kansas farm, seem so familiar to her. Fortunately, however, the movie avoids anything strange or off-the-wall. We can take the story at face value even as our knowledge that it's a dream gives it an added psychological dimension.The Oz sequences are broadly faithful to the book, though they do not include some of Dorothy's later adventures. Partly as a result of this trimming, the movie feels less episodic and more focused, with a certain depth the book lacked. Glinda, a composite of two relatively minor characters from the book, has a godlike, deus ex machina quality here, and there's a sense that she is watching over Dorothy the whole time. By placing Dorothy's final confrontations with the Wicked Witch and the Wizard near the end of the story rather than the middle, the film draws greater attention to their significance.Most important, the movie creates a whole new storyline for the Kansas section. All these early scenes--Dorothy's feeling unloved by her caretakers, Dorothy's hanging out with the three farmhands, Dorothy's attempting to rescue her dog Toto from the ghastly Miss Gulch--were invented for the film. Yet they provide the setup for Dorothy's Oz experience, where she will meet versions of the people she knew in Kansas. This not only fleshes Dorothy out as a character, but adds meaning to the Oz sequences. She yearns to be taken away to a faraway land, only to discover that once she's there she faces simply a fanciful version of the problems she was running away from at home.The book, in contrast, gave hardly any detail about Dorothy's Kansas life. Baum's Dorothy was consequently a more passive character, victim to circumstances beyond her control, and her journey to Oz was merely a random, insane event with no bearing on anything other than that it made for an entertaining tale. The movie gave her a will and purpose that Baum's protagonist never had. When she mournfully longs to be sent home, it resonates more strongly than in the book because we know the real cause of her separation wasn't the tornado but her own actions.Adapting the book to the screen thus involved a bundle of wise decisions, made all the more impressive because when you read about what was happening behind the scenes, you're struck by how much could have gone wrong. The film went through no fewer than five directors. Judy Garland was first told to play Dorothy with a blonde wig and baby-doll makeup. "Over the Rainbow" was almost cut from the film. Margaret Hamilton suffered severe burns from a scene where she disappears in a cloud of smoke, the original actor to play Tin Man had to quit when his face paint made him ill, and the dog playing Toto had to be replaced after an actor stepped on the animal. These stories, which have been part of Hollywood lore for many decades, make the filming of "Wizard of Oz" sound more like a comedy routine than the creation of a classic.As an expensive, high-tech production for its time, the movie could easily have lost sight of its spirit, as so many big-budget spectacles today do. Instead, it not only remained true to Baum's vision but infused it with additional layers of meaning that speak to people of all ages, in all generations. If you've never read the book, I encourage you to do so, if for no other reason than to gain a greater appreciation for what the movie accomplished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wizard vs Wicked: Wizard Still Reigns as Most Magical Adaption of Baum, Far Better than "Wicked".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1939 MGM production of "The Wizard of Oz" still stands as the best theatrical adaption of L. Frank Baum's timeless classic. The songs, although maybe a little light-hearted by today's standards, are still the best and the most memorable of any other production, be they film or musical. The witty lyrics by Yip Harburg withstand on their own terms and help feed into the rhetoric and humor of the story, particularly "Over the Rainbow", "The Wicked Witch is Dead", and "If I were King of the Forest". The cast is perfect, the sets incredible, and the effects stand-up well against many CGI films today. And the script retains the spirit of Baum's original novel but never lapses into too much gushy sentimentality.The cast have become immortalized in their own right. Who could imagine anyone else playing Dorothy other than the young Judy Garland whose rendition of "Over the Rainbow" still brings tears even after 70 years? Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion was a choice made in Heaven. Lahr, who was probably the most experienced Vaudevillian in the cast, practically steals the show with his rendition of "If I were King of the Forest", which he sings to the hilt in a manner reminiscent of Ethel Merman. His only rivals are Maragaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West who seems like she was born to play the role of Dorothy's arch-enemy, and Frank Morgan as the wizard. Morgan, like Lahr, brings a theatrical quality to the entire production as he plays four different characters on-screen. Billie Burke as Glinda, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, and Jack Hayley as the Tin Man also deserve honorable mention.The well-known story concerns a Midwest farm girl, Dorothy, who goes on an unexpected trip to a faraway land known as Oz. Her line "I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more." has become one of the most quoted in the annals of motion pictures. It is practically an allusion meaning to be in an unknown place. After making enemies with the Wicked Witch of the West, Dorothy desires to return home. She is told that the only person in Oz who can help her is the great Wizard who resides in the Emerald City. Along her journey to the city, she befriends three of the most famous characters of children's literature: a scare crow, a tin man and a cowardly lion. Together they seek audience with the great Wizard of Oz. The only Hollywood shortcoming is that the entire experience is related as a dream which was not how it was characterized in the original book. Still a triumph of early cinema that seems like it could have been made just a few years ago instead of a half century plus a score of years ago. A must for children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's No Movie Like Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is one of those rare, timeless movies that improves with age (probably because we're used to seeing dozens of pallid fantasy films each and every year). Like It's a Wonderful Life, Oz is a film that almost everyone sees at one time or another and instantly falls in love with. It's a great, magical film that your great, great grandkids are certain to embrace.The film is sort of beyond criticism at this point, so I'll just list some of my favourite aspects and scenes.1. Margaret Hamilton is the epitome of all witches. Whenever I hear the word "witch" her green skin, black pointed hat, and extended nose spring into my mind.2. "Somewhere over the Rainbow" is one of the greatest songs of all time. To have this song alone would have been more than enough for any musical. But, luckily, we also get "Ding Dong the Witch is Dead", "If I Only Had a Brain", and many others.3. Each actor is perfectly suited for his or her role. And I mean perfectly.4. The writing and dialogue are as fresh as anything you will ever read or hear.5. Victor Fleming directed this and Gone with the Wind in the same year (1939). I realize that he took over for other directors on both films, but he still did direct the majority of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to believe that this film is almost seventy years old, yes some of the special effects look rather dated now but not that dated. There are many films that people say everybody should see at least once in their life and in many cases those films are good but not that important, this film I genuinely think everybody should see though, preferably when they are still fairly young; although it is still a delight to watch as an adult.I'm sure most people will know the plot even if they haven't seen the film but just in case anybody doesn't I'll give a brief description. Dorothy is a girl living on a farm in Kansas with her aunt and uncle. When a mean spirited neighbour threatens to have her dog Toto put to sleep she runs away from home and meets a travelling magician who persuades her to return home. Unfortunately before she can get home a tornado is seen approaching and everybody there has taken shelter in a storm basement. She goes into the house and when the tornado hits she is knocked out.She awakens to find the house in the air and through the window she sees many strange things, including the mean neighbour on her bicycle who turns into a witch on a broomstick. When the house crashes to the ground and she goes outside the film switches from sepia tinged black and white to spectacular colour. As she looks around the strange land she has arrived in she is met by Glinda, the Witch of the North. She introduces Dorothy to the Munchkins, the little people who inhabit that part of Oz. The Munchkins treat Dorothy as a heroine as her house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West is not happy though, especially when her sister's ruby slippers magically appear on Dorothy's feet. Dorothy is told that if she want to return home to Kansas she must follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City where the eponymous Wizard of Oz lives.As she walks along the road she meets three strange characters; a scarecrow who wants a brain, a tin man who wants a heart and a cowardly lion who wishes to be brave. As strange as these characters are each of them is vaguely familiar to Dorothy. They journey is made harder by the witch who is determined to get the slippers off Dorothy. They eventually reach the city but once there the Wizard is not as welcoming as they'd hoped and demands that they must go away and no return till they have the Witch of the West's broom stick, this obviously isn't an easy task. Just in case anybody has yet to see this I won't spoil the ending.Judy Garland is perfect as young Dorothy and the rest of the cast a pretty good too. There are plenty of songs some of which are now classics which you'll find yourself singing in your head after you've finished watching the film. The film is a treat for all the family although very young viewers might find some parts a little scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reading Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OZ is, my dears, about learning, and, as such, a meaningful fairy tale; it should teach the kids that guts, mind and aptitude to love are not given miraculously by any wizard; are not magically conferred, but come by experience, by life, by facing the life. As the wizard explains the team, they're cases of temporarily messed psychologies?individuals deluded about the meaning of what they're searching for. You do not get to be hearty, gutsy or brainy by some magic, these don't come from a wizard, but by experience and learning who you are and what you're capable of and what defines you indeed; I must confess I've found this identity quest very much appealing. Baum's literary world is one without psychologies, of course, without psychologically true creations?yet these questions are very acutely underlined in the movie (and, of course, in the books).So, they do not so much learn how to love, or how to think or be braver?but rather they learn who they are and what their forces already are?see the scarecrows prodigious, and I mean prodigious, ingenuity in devising plans.This educative piece is also a work of wild fancy; and, if you ask me, Baum solitary created a _sui _generis form of surrealism and of literary _magicality. His was a surreal, unbridled, unbound fancy; sometimes mechanical, given the scope of his enterprise, sometimes wonderfully creative.The whole episode of the evil witch's castle was marvelously done?the choreography of the guards, etc.. It's the one I've liked best. There is some of the original creepiness of the book, and the flying monkeys are well crafted?see the impressive view of the departure of the flying monkeys, when sent by the evil witch to kidnap poor Dorothy Gale.Do the characters truly need the controversial, if I might say so, the controversial wizard? (Because in today's crapped language, that's what they would call him?a highly controversial wizard.) well, first they need experience, true open experience, action; but then, they need one to disentangle their messed up psychologies; and the couple of magicians?the wizard and then the good witch?does that.Now on the other hand, if somewhat compared to the book, of course the action in the movie is a little hurried, or a little messed up itself, some fine points of subtlety are definitely missed for good?but such as it is, this adaptation is some fine work.This brightly colored, vividly colored, exquisitely scored and fast?paced classic really deserves exceedingly its prestige; its meaning is vital and needed. Its values shall endure.</fullReview>

Well... i definitely say "10 out of 10! One of my favourite films. Can watch it time and time again. Great musical and great actors and actresses." And I'm sure many other people think this also. Winning two Oscar's is quite a big thing. Its one of the oldest films i know... actually i think it is the oldest film i know.Its such a great film to say that it is so old. 1939, wasn't that during the war!

		<shortDescription>What's not to like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is without question one of the best films Hollywood ever cranked out. This was one of two films that inspired me to be a filmmaker (the other was the original "Star Wars"). "The Wizard of Oz" was one of the first movies I ever saw, and even to this day it's one of my favorites.It's a great example of something that's called escapist entertainment, which means that it sort of "sweeps" you away from the cold, ugly world that we inhabit and into the world of the characters. Even in 1939, with America recovering from a harsh economic depression and with World War II escalating, it was definitely an escape.I think today's movies can and should be more escapist (and artistic) than they are. Now it's mostly about how much cash all the studios rack in per film, which, to me, is a drag. Most of the films I saw back then were REAL investments. They had lots of really nice stuff.I really love the shot when the film turns from sepiatone to Technicolor (when Dorothy opened the door in her house beaten and shaken up by a twister in Kansas and saw a gorgeous, full-color place called Munchkinland). That was a breathtaking shot.Someone else on IMDb said this about the original Star Wars by the way: "A kid's fantasy. An adult's memory." The same thing goes for this one as well. This is another movie that I have never seen in theaters to this day. I'd really like to, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz has survived, thrived, and often influenced great works like Broadway's Wicked musical based on the evil witch who died. The story from L. Frank Baum's novel of the same name is adapted again but starring the wonderful Judy Garland as Dorothy, a role that never really escaped her identity. Margaret Hamilton, a former school teacher would play the evil witch in this version. The supporting cast of characters included munchkins that earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The munchkins introduced it's audiences to dwarf sized adults many of us for the first time. The Wizard of Oz and it's unforgettable cast of characters included in the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion. The film version has inspired spoofs and countless attempts to recapture it's brilliance. The cast and crew are unforgettable in developing one of the finest film classics of our time and with Judy's Over the Rainbow performance, you won't forget her ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Wizard of Oz'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Wizard of Oz' is a fictional tale about a young woman, Dorothy, and her dog, Toto, who find themselves in a fictional dreamland; and their journey to return home. Along their journey, Dorothy and her dog find stragglers who end up being of some importance to the whole. The broad, overall message or underlying theme of the movie is a memorable quote; "There's no place like home." Even more interesting, though, is the amazing symbolism in the movie. The entire movie is symbolic of the lifestyle in America regarding social, political, and economic lifestyles of the 1890's. Strangely enough, L. Frank Baum, the author of the Wizard of Oz, which the movie was made about, claimed he never intended the book to be about the socialistic problems of the United States, but rather a child's story. It wasn't until later, that the general public learned of his true motives. The movie starts out with Dorothy and her family, which is the standard representational figure for the hardworking people of America in the 1890's. The tornado comes in and swoops up Dorothy and drops her in the magical dreamland known as Oz. Oz is symbolic of America, where there's ton of opportunity awaiting. The yellow brick road is symbolic of the gold standard, which was what the American dollar was backed by. Dorothy, while in Oz, represented the hard working common man. The Scarecrow represented the farmers of America, who were without a brain to realize that they held the power as they were the food source for America and did not realize they were being stepped on by the big politicians. The Tin-man stood for the steel workers, as they were the ones who needed a heart to have compassion for the American people instead of the money they made through industrialization. The cowardly Lion represented the local politicians who needed the courage to stand up for the American people. The wicked witch of the east and west stood for the national bank, as well as big banks in general. The evil monkeys stood for the local banks as they did the big banks bidding; mere puppets of the big bank. The Emerald City is symbolic of Washington D.C., where the President resides, the Wizard. "No one gets to see the Wizard." The reason why is because the President was a busy man, and to see him at the time, took a little bit of bribery and important contacts to put in the good word. The giant head in the Wizard's chamber was the general public's idea of who controlled America, but the giant head never wanted you to see who really controlled the politicians; hence the reason why he didn't want Dorothy and the gang to look behind the curtain. The other great piece of symbolism, which also served as ground breaking technology, was the opening scene's transition from the humble farm in Kansas (black and white), to the wonderful dreamland of Oz (in color). The black and white represents bleakness, and sets the tone for the poverty settings that the family was in. The scenery portrays the plains of Kansas with dust surrounding them, and barely any shrubs. All of a sudden, the tornado picks them up to Oz, portrayed in color; showing how vibrant the world can be and hope and optimism for a better future. This optimistic idea is only heightened after the audience realizes that the wicked witch of the east was killed by the house Dorothy resided in, dropped on her and the famous ruby red slippers. In a way, this symbolizes the death of the national banks, and it's corruption over the political scene of the United States. It really brings a new meaning to "dropping the house" on something.At the end of the movie, Dorothy returns to Kansas with her dog, Toto, and finds that "there's no place like home." She realizes the simplicity of life on the farm, and how one can get caught up in the politics of the world; especially after how frustrating it can be to get policy done (i.e.: getting to the Emerald City, finding the wizard, stopping the wicked witch of the west, and returning Oz to its normal, happy state; then finally returning home). We take a look around the room and outside the room, and realize that there is a bit more shrubbery. The music sets a deeper, more happy tone, and Dorothy seems to favor her Aunt, and Uncle. The moral of the story is that "there's no place like home," but also that you don't really know what you have until it's gone. Change is essential to life, especially when we live in a corrupt society like in the 1890's, but do not try to wish away the good out of the bad because sometimes, the good is all we have to hold onto to get us through the bad.</fullReview>

I did the filter thing for "Hated It" and sure enough, plenty of entries. I checked out some of the other reviews from folks listed under "Hated It" and I notice the same reviewers also hated motherhood and curing cancer.I guess I should give a hint of the plot, for the thousands of folks reading these reviews trying to decide if they should rent the Wizard of Oz because, uh, they've never seen it and don't know anything about this obscure, little-known film. Once in a blue moon it does show up on television, maybe every twenty years or so, late at night on backwater UHF channels with numbers in the 50s or 60s.

I find it completely amazing how this movie transports you in time to a place somewhere from your childhood dreams. It is as vivid and wonderful now as it was when I watched it when I was 5 years old. Gosh, 1939 was even before my parents time! This movie is a classic that hopefully my children can enjoy as well.

My dad made it a habit to speak to Mr Dee every time he came into the store and loudly say "HELLO MR DEE HOW ARE YOU THIS FINE DAY?" He said that this greeting was also a way let people know that Mr Dee was not a little old lady. He told me that Mr Dee used to frequent a local Pharmacy called Lothrop Drugs before it closed and that was where the staff informed him (my dad) about Mr Frankie Dee Brown's marriage to Ruby Dee for 4 years!!

This movie, like they say, truly is the world's modern day fairy-tale that everybody can relate to, in a sense, and if the movie's star score " Over The Rainbow" don't invoke some goosebumps or any form of touching emotionally, then I pity you. I have always loved the movie and grown with it over the years, going from being terrified of the Wicked Witch of The West and her flying monkeys, and being happily entertained by the Cowardly Lion's slapstick, to being enchanted as I got older by Judy Garland's voice and the main story, which, in reference to the book, is extremely flawed and shortened by one third of what is actually done, but that is okay for it was based on a stage production of the show, which today it still runs as school programs, and I saw one that gave a spectacle, treating audience members to the dated, but extremely infectious " The Jitterbug" a deleted song, to the heartstring pulling reprise of " Over The Rainbow" when Dorthy is captured within the confines of the witches castle, but is unable to finish and burst into tears, but nevertheless, the movie is a standard and is something that I will never tie of, and until a remake that can honor the glory of such a wonderful movie, I can't think of a movie that can match it's magic!</fullReview>

It lives in our culture, woven into the fabric of our thoughts and conversations. "I don't think we're in Kansas anymore." "Are you a good witch or a bad witch?" "Just click your heels three times and say, 'There's no place like home.'" "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain." "Surrender Dorothy." "I'm melting, melting!"The music. Songs people hum every day. "Over the Rainbow," "We're off to see the wizard," "Follow the yellow brick road."What other movie has even come close to engraving itself that way into our consciousness? (Casablanca and Gone With The Wind only have a couple quotes each that we remember, not even considering the songs.)The stars. The best work of each actor. The cornerstone of the iconic reputation of the greatest cinematic voice ever. Judy, Judy, Judy. There have been books written about the production of this movie, but in the end we just have to be grateful that somehow, despite multiple directors and cast changes and hair changes, it all came together in this incredible flick. It just happened.Thank you, 1939!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched "The Wizard of Oz" as a child. It was memorable for many reasons. The songs, the cartoon quality of the characters, and the colorful story and sets made it a life experience I remember to this day. Most vivid to me as a child of 7-8 was how scared I was of the Wicked Witch of the West. I have seen this film many times since, and have enjoyed it with my siblings and my wife and children also. It is truly one of the great films of all time. In fact, it was ahead of its time. I am surprised it is only #52 on the list of greatest American films. It is part of our DNA, as virtually every American has seen this film. Judy Garland, Ray Bulger, and Jack Haley are marvelous together, and the the supporting cast very memorable. What other movie has munchkins? The songs are very catchy, and "Over The Rainbow" is one of the great songs of the 20th Century. The theme of the film is to get "home" and the importance of helping others. In the age we live in, maybe every adult should watch "The Wizard of Oz" again, and watch it with the eyes of a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An institution on television.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, OZ wasn't a movie so much as it was a family ritual. It was so embedded in my childhood and puberty, that I no longer thought of it as a movie- especially since it had an annual pilgrimage on television. I was still in diapers when it aired on CBS- the first time. That network's contract with the film only lasted until 1967 (I was just five then), and then the film switched its airings from CBS to NBC between 1968 and 1975- though CBS would take it back and air it yearly until the end of the 20th century. I watched it during the NBC period, and it was always introduced with the NBC peacock- with a special reminder that the first 19 minutes were in black and white. We would always circle the date on the calendar, and it always seemed to be a Spring broadcast, usually on Easter Sunday. And when the tornado sequence ended with the house crashing down, you could hear a pin drop in our living room. My favorite part of the film- since I was five- is watching the film change from b/w to the color of Munchkinland simply by opening the front door. (I saw the film years later as a college student in a real theater, and this scene actually brought whistles and applause from the audience!!) That's what I remember the most. When it left network television, I purchased the DVD.</fullReview>

Judy Garland is wonderful as Dorothy, bringing a sense of vulnerability and sadness to the role, making Over The Rainbow more poignant than it already was. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are really entertaining as her three friends. Billie Burke as Glinda, and the Munchkins were great fun too. The wicked witch of the west scared the life out of me here and still does, and even Frank Morgan does 5 roles to great comical effect. The songs are just fabulous, and so is the cinematography and the stunning scenery. True, the film isn't completely faithful to the book, but why does it have to be? If I had one minor drawback, it would be the singing voice of the Lion, but apart from that, this movie is a must-see! 10/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kids today are weak, they play video games from the couch and cry when mommy doesn't buy the right kind of sugar cereal. The fact that "The Wizard of Oz" sits so low on the IMDb top 250 list is a testament to the young, immature users that have clearly flooded the gates here on this website. The fact that it has been beaten by such works as "Memento" and "The Dark Knight" is laughable.I watched this last night for the first time in years. I had forgotten how well this film was done; arguably the most visually stunning of our time. The way Dorothy's whole world is black and white and then she enters Oz, full of color. To think that this came out back in 1939 is a trip. I can't imagine the first people to see this film. They must have been completely blown away. You just can't amaze like that anymore. All you can do as a viewer is try to put yourself back there and if you can do that, you can appreciate this film and all its glory.I had forgotten how scary some of the sequences are here. I think it was smart that they lightened the story a bit for the big screen and made it more for kids. It's plenty dark and grimy for my tastes. Those flying monkeys haunted my sleep when I was a kid and who can forget the melting wicked witch of the West? Or her sister's feet shriveling up when the ruby slippers disappear? Or the evil trees in the forest, grabbing the apple back from Dorothy? Made in a time when kids played outside, got bruises, black eyes, worked at age 14 and lived in the midst of World Wars, "The Wizard of Oz" is certainly a wild, undeniably groundbreaking and brilliant film. I recommend seeing this one again so you can remember what real, beautiful film making is all about.10 out of 10, kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic that families have enjoyed for decades!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of oz is most definitely a favorite film for several generations. Children have enjoyed this film for years. However what many people never quite realized is that Dorathy's journey in the land of oz was all in her dream. The film starts out with Dorathy being very upset because the nasty woman Ms. Gulch wants to take her dog Toto to the sheriff to be put to sleep because Toto bit her so she gets an order allowing her to take the dog to the sheriff, so Mrs. Gulch takes Toto in a basket on her Bicycle and heads for the Sheriff. Toto jumps out of the basket and runs back to Dorathy who is in her room crying. When Toto jumps in Dorathy's bedroom window, Dorathy takes Toto and starts to run away and she and Toto end up at Profesor Marvel's Trailer, After talking to Professor Marvel Dorathy realizes that running away from Aunt Em and Uncle Henry was not the right choice she starts to head for home right when the tornado hits. By the time she reaches the house the tornado is getting stronger and everyone has gone to the basement cellar. Dorathy goes in the house and looks for everyone and the window caves in right where Dorathy is standing and it knocks her unconscious and that is when Dorathy has her dream about the magical land of oz with characters who resembled people she knew in Kansas such as the three workman on the farm, Professor Marvel and The wicked witch of the west who resembled the mean Mrs. Gulch. When she wakes up at the end of the movie from the dream Everyone on the farm is there beside her. Nothing was mentioned about Mrs. Gulch so most of us assumed that she was killed in the tornado. Bottom line is this film has been a favorite for many generations and it always will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I tried to hate it, really i did (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't touch me. I'm a hideous, hideous freak. Somehow, I managed to live for twenty-two years without seeing The Wizard of Oz.Don't hate me. I'm not a complete freak; I'd seen bits and pieces over the years, but I'd hated most of them. I hated Judy Garland's tobacco-chewing voice, I hated the gaudy colours of Oz, I hated the simplistic story and the childish morals, I hated the songs, I hated the pantomime feel of it all, I hated the Munchkins' singing voices, I hated pretty much everything about it, and thought of it as just another over-rated classic.Sitting down to watch this properly for the first time, I was looking forward to writing a bad review, because they're more fun to write. My plan was scuppered when I realised I loved this movie from start to finish. Damn!Judy Garland is great as Dorothy, managing to be feisty and helpless at the same time, the cowardly lion is always funny, and the tinman and the scarecrow are both charming. The story is still simplistic, but now I see it as childlike, not childish. There was a more cynical voice inside my head telling me I shouldn't be liking it, but I managed to ignore it ? that voice should learn to shut up every once in a while.It's far from perfect, and even now I think most people over-rate it. The black and white opening is a little strained as the farm hands are forced to throw in words like `courage', `heart' and `brain' to drop hints about who they'll be when they reappear in Oz. The wicked witch is a bit hammy, her make-up is unconvincing, and you can see the trap door open before she disappears from Munchkinland. The did-it-all-really-happen ending is too familiar a twist to be effective or surprising, but these are only points of pedantry.It gets boring reading the clichd professional reviews that say how this movie captures your heart, but my heart was captured, and for a few days after seeing it I felt happier than I had before. Like Mary Poppins, Oz is a genuinely innocent, childlike story with great songs, loveable characters and heart-warming morals. It's such a shame I couldn't hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe the greatest fantasy film of all-time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has always been a favorite of mine from childhood through adulthood. A great fantasy film adapted from the famous L. Frank Baum stories with screenplay from noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf and about a dozen others that contributed to dialog including tow of the film's stars Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. The film received six Academy Award nominations winning two for Herbert Sothart's musical score and original song for Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg. It lost the 1939 Best Picture and Best Art Direction Academy Awards to Gone With the Wind and Best Cinematography to Wuthering Heights but incredibly lost Best Effects yo The Rains Came. Director Victor Flemming had a good year in 1939 directing both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, two films that endearingly live on for generations. Great cinematography here from Harold Rosson who had a 50 year cinematography career that began in the early silent films and ended with Howard Hawks El Dorado in 1966. Veteran film editor Blanche Sewall skillfully edited this piece but over the years so much of this film has been cut up for television that it wasn't until recently that it's been restored to near it's original form. A fantastic cast with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, Billie Burke and Margaret Hamilton. Amazingly Burke who plays good witch Glinda was 54 years old at the time. Five years older than Frank Morgan and 17 years older than Margaret Hamilton. I would like to see a restored version of this as I have not yet had the opportunity to and I would also like to see this up on the big screen. This is true movie magic and I would give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go Dorothy, Go!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is probably the only film ever of which I think everybody should see it! Not one person on this planet has an acceptable excuse for skipping it if they have the change. Even after 65 whole years, the story and characters still look fresh and the breath-taking scenery still causes daydreaming. Dorothy's extraordinary journey in the Land of Oz is funny, touching, valuable and rhythmic! Even the overload of sentiment and moral doesn't bother me in this one. The story couldn't be more sappy or politically correct but I don't care?it's a visual masterpiece for sure and the importance of this motion picture in the history of cinema is inescapably. The Wizard of Oz practically is a complete chapter of cinema-history itself?referenced, spoofed and honored in numerous other titles. A must-see fairy-tale that'll escort you to an imaginative and colorful world where wondrous characters live, evil has to be fought and important life-lessons are educated. Preferably one to watch at very young age for the first time?you'll never forget this movie! And now you're off ? to see the Wizard!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oz is that place somewhere over the rainbow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Wizard of Oz' is a very old movie and looks awfully dated, but still has its magic and charm. To this day it still has many fans, which is a surprise for a movie this old.The sceneries/backgrounds and special effects don't impress by today's standards, but they must have caused great impact back in 1939. Plus, some of the special effects are astonishing for the time. Look at that tornado, for example! It just seems so real! Amazing that they could do something like that in such primitive times.Speaking of the sceneries, they are full of creative and details which create this childish world of fantasy (the land of Oz). Looking at all those sceneries and to what people dress, it almost reminds me about those childish theater plays I used to see during my childhood. The yellow brick road and the Emerald City are just two among many creative and imaginative details of this movie.The characters are as original as much as they are odd and unusual. The most bizarre characters are the army of flying monkeys, the Winkie Guards, the Wicked Witch of the East, the Munchkins, the talking trees and the Gatekeeper. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion are less weird, but still unusual. Dorothy and her cute dog Toto, Professor Marvel, Hunk, Zeke, Hickory, Auntie Em, Uncle Henry and the Wizard of Oz are normal characters.Of all the 3 strange friends of Dorothy, the Scarecrow is my favorite. He is the funniest of them, even though the silly Cowardly Lion is hilarious.To a degree, I can see why this movie is considered a classic. It consistently appears in the lists of the greatest movies ever. It is much praised and regarded by many people. It gets generally high ratings. Does it really deserve to be as venerated as it is? Well, it's all a matter of tastes. But despite its charm and magic, there are things of discussable taste in this movie, such as the bizarre characters which become tiring after many viewings. Certain scenes are also somewhat dark and sinister for a kids's movie.The songs are simple but jolly and charming, such as "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", "We're Off to See the Wizard", "If I Only Had a Brain" (in this last case, including its related songs) and my favorite: the wonderful opening music. I don't like the songs sung by the Munchkins because of their weird voices.Although the movie is beyond dated and obsolete nowadays, it was nevertheless advanced for its time, thanks to the special effects and the fact that it is a sepia-toned black-and-white film in the Kansas sequences and a fully colored one (Technicolor) in the Oz sequences.The actors are generally good in their roles. The best are Frank Morgan (who portrays a total of 5 roles in the film), Ray Bolger (as the Scarecrow and Hunk) and Judy Garland (as Dorothy Gale).Filming was a nightmare. And yet the movie would become a lasting legacy, even though that was uncertain at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic movie that just celebrated 75 years in film history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got this on DVD a few days ago and was watching it last night. To this day I still have this as one of my favourite movies of all time. Where does it mark my list I am not so sure but anyway here is the review.Dorothy(Judy Garland) is a young girl living in Kansas with her aunt and uncle and the film of course starts off as a sepia toned film. Dorothy of course gets upset as a woman wanted to get rid of her dog Toto and she runs away,only to get whisked away into the magical world of OZ. Now Dorothy is in the magical world and she has to try and find a way home. Along the way she meets a wicked witch,a white witch named Glenda,a lovable lion who wants courage,a tin man who wants a heart and a scarecrow who wants a brain who are all very well done.So here is the good,the bad and the verdict.The good: The visuals are very good (yet I did find a problem with it as well which will be talked about in the bad section). The cast was very good,especially the late Judy Garland who did it justice as Dorothy our main heroine in the film and the premise is original and not predicable. Think of it as Alice In Wonderland where she goes to another dimension and the 2013 James Franco flick OZ The Great &amp; Powerful which was also a fantastic film.The music was very good too especially the iconic song Somewhere Over The Rainbow and Follow The Yellow Brick Road.The bad: The backgrounds are just so false looking. Maybe its just me but you know once you see it in the colourful world that its not real as it looks like canvas in the background. Also the songs can get too irritating from time to time but I loved them all the same.Final verdict: Overall this is a film that I have loved since I was a child and I was so happy to have picked up the 2 Disc DVD version of it in HMV a few days ago. If you haven't seen it I recommend it to everyone,who loves a good fantasy and musical.Thumbs up.Visuals: 7/10 Premise:9/10 Characters: 9/10 Setting: 5/10Overall rating: B+9.5/104.5 stars because the backgrounds were fake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love watching the classics and actually seeing every reason it's a classic in the first place. Some classics make me question the sanity of the people who made them, but luckily The Wizard of Oz deserves its title.No need for an extensive review, honestly. Everything was great. The performances were wonderful, the story was brilliantly adapted, and the music was just delightful. So many iconic images, moments, and words, a whimsical fantasy land, special effects (COLOR!) that had audiences in 1939 screaming and cheering. Such a fun watch, I can't get over it. I highly recommend you let yourself experience this beautiful film. I can't wait to watch it with my grandkids someday.10/10 Bye love you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Number 1 Family Genre Film of All Time !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, i would say that Victor Fleming is the best director in his generation. No one on par on how beautiful a movie can be if directed by him. Any film directed by him always have a stunning art- direction and marveolus cinematography with adaptive actor/actress performances. And i would say also he was one of the legendary director that Hollywood ever had.The Wizard of Oz. A hundred percent, no other family-genre film had reach the level of this movie, even a small piece until now. Only one movie that i know which nearly reach the level of this film as a fantasy-genre, it is "Pan's Labyrinth".By wide aspect, TWOO have a deep and inspiring storyline. It is enjoyable by any age range and also enjoyable by any generation- time. The art- direction is by far, the no.1 in 1939 since any movie ever made in the past, and it also superb nowadays. Then if we see into detailed aspect, any costume-design, make-up, and set-decoration are undoubtedly extraordinary. This film, set a new standard model for color-movies in 1939. This movie is a predecessor for color-movies after 1939. Victor Fleming genuinely using suitable style direction for color- movies, yet technicolor also beautiful. Fleming means to separate Dorothy's real life with Dorothy's world in Oz, so he using two style of coloring (technicolor and color). These will drive the viewers to feel how the true fantasty-film is. No director ever used that style before Fleming, it was absolutely genius and trend-set.Any act performed by actors/actresses was incredibly natural. They likely fit with the film itself and had use to live inside the film already. I must tell that to perform in a fantasy-genre needs something that people called it a "talent". Actors and actresses need high level of imagination and creativity to perform any role in fantasy-genre. In TWOO, there were no miss act by all role. That was unbelievable.I can's say anymore. This movie definitely will amaze any people who watch it. As fantasy-genre, this movie extraordinary beautiful, as family-genre, this movie truly inspiring and highly enjoyable. The Wizard of Oz, or in other word i called it "A Masterpiece"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rating-7/10The Wizard of Oz is a classic and many consider it to be one of the best movies ever made, I have to disagree. Now don't mistake me here it isn't bad at all, it is pretty good in my opinion but I just can't say I absolutely loved it. It has it's charm and for a child then maybe they would love it but I couldn't help feel I needed to be younger to view it with such a magical view. The story is however well timed and a good length for it's kind of film and felt the ending is one of the best parts of the movie.Now Judy Garland is great in this, and I'm not just saying that because it's her and because it's Wizard Of Oz, she is a great talent here and back in the day people must have been blown away by seeing her on the big screen. One element I absolutely loved about this was the music because that really is the highlight and produces such memorable songs you forgot were even from this film, just great great fun. It feels a bit strange at times the plot, maybe a bit too random to be properly assembled but maybe an hour after watching I personally felt joyous and filled with a happy like memory from watching the movie.The numerous directing changes don't help and although the finished product with Victor Fleming at the helm is strong, it can at parts feel messy. I didn't like the script and that is one the major reasons I can't see this as perfection, the lines are delivered well by most but the choices of wording are poor and anything like that done today would be classed as conventional and much seen before in musicals. I can't doubt the sheer mass of the cast for putting on a good show and even though the Munchkins are barely hear able with such high pitch voices, it is people like that who make this film what it is today.I think one big reason this is classed as so good is because of the big technological things seen in this and a new type of film that hadn't been seen before, and in such vivid colour. The sets are horrible and I mean nothing can be done about that for the times and although they are kind of sweet looking, nothing more positive can be said about the walls seen to create the backgrounds. One big thing technology wise that does work for me is the cinematography, beautifully shot and crafted well by Harold Rosson and you can see why he received an Academy Award nomination, just marvellous.When we come on to the songs things like "Somewhere over the Rainbow" come to mind but that isn't the only song that sticks in your head for a time after. "Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead" is another song famous for being a Munchkin dance and is a great song as well. "We're off the see the Wizard" is another absolute classic in the songbook and I can't think of any musical with so much goodness but also so many known songs, This film is lovingly crafted and so well written in the music department.Overall I felt it to be Solidly kind of good and although as you can see I don't agree with maybe most who see it, I still very much enjoyed it. If you haven't seen it then I couldn't recommend it more to you but I will say this, although loads and loads of film fans rate this number one and critics alike, don't expect to love this as much as some do, but then again you may fall in complete fantasy like love with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz is an enduring and charming film for all ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this charming film based on the popular L. Frank Baum stories, Dorothy and her dog Toto are caught in a tornado's path and somehow end up in the land of Oz. Here she meets some memorable friends and foes in her journey to meet the Wizard of Oz who everyone says can help her return home and possibly grant her new friends their goals of a brain, heart and courage. Roger Ebert wrote: "There are good and bad adult figures in Oz--the Wicked Witches of the East and West, the Good Witch Glinda. Dorothy would like help from her friends but needs to help them instead ("If I Only Had a Brain," or a heart, or nerve, they sing). Arriving at last at the Emerald City, they have another dreamlike experience; almost everyone they meet seems vaguely similar (because they're all played by Morgan). The Wizard sends them on a mission to get the Wicked Witch's broom, and it is not insignificant that the key to Dorothy's return to Kansas is the pair of ruby slippers. Grownup shoes." Wizard of Oz is an enduring and charming film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic that revolutionized movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few reviews of The Wizard of Oz that say it is an outdated and hokey movie that should be remade. Well, I'm glad it has an 8.1/10 stars currently because it deserves them and I don't think it should ever be remade, it's timeless and nostalgic and I can remember seeing it with my family back when I was four, living in Sydney, Nova Scotia (I had The Wizard of Oz on VHS).When I was a kid, I watched into the first scenes and it was all in black and white, which certainly doesn't appeal to four-year-olds. A grown woman played the part of a little girl named Dorothy which I thought was strange at the time. I was way too little to really understand the movie, but I do remember the tornado sucking away Dorothy's house, sending her off to a world beyond imagination. This was a revolutionary effect in its time; Dorothy steps outside and the movie is in full color, and she meets a variety of characters straight away, from a beautiful witch to a city of small people to a very ugly wicked witch. Dorothy's only friend from her home in Kansas is her beloved dog, Toto. As the movie goes on, Dorothy meets three beings who become her closest companions during her journey to find an enigmatic and powerful wizard who will supposedly send her back to her aunt and uncle.Okay, the movie does get a little hokey at times, but given what they had to work with and the era it was made in, I was very surprised. I recently re-watched The Wizard of Oz and it made me really sad, believe it or not. Here's why: in the current year 2014 in less than a year a movie can just be thrown together with cheap voice acting, bad singing, a bunch of CGI that looks fake and a cheesy plot and still be more appreciated than The Wizard of Oz (EG The Hunger Games, Frozen, The Lorax, all of which I deeply hate by the way). Think of all the effort that went into making The Wizard of Oz such a stunning movie! Some of my friends have never seen it, and when I told them about it, they said, "that sounds stupid, can't we just watch Dumb and Dumber instead?" Well, that's society's intelligence today for ya.I think some of the effects were very impressive for the 1930's - even for the 1970's some of these effects would have been difficult and costly. Examples include the horse that changes color, the tornado and the wizard himself. The acting was excellent, no doubt about it, and there was a lot of singing but come on, it was made during WWII, people needed something to make them happy. There are still bits of interesting trivia I'm learning about this movie, such as the fact that the snow in the poppy scene was created with industrial asbestos (carcinogenic which was sort of known even back then).All I have left to say is that this is a movie that should be watched by continuing generations, because not only is it a timeless and amazing film but it also reminds us of how lucky we are to just have the technology to film in color and how often we take these types of things for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pure Delight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a pure delight. I remember back when I was young that it would come on television once a year and whenever it played it was like watching it for the very first time. It was both wonderful and magical. Even today it is a joy to watch and having seen it at least fifteen times that in and of itself is quite remarkable. At least for me. Be that as it may, I think it is important to inform new viewers that this movie was made back in 1939 and as a result it doesn't have the computer graphics or any of the technology used today to enhance the special effects. But what special effects it does have is still pretty good even by today's standards. Add in the music and performances of Judy Garland (as "Dorothy"), Ray Bolger (the "Scarecrow"), Bert Lahr (the "Cowardly Lion"), and Jack Haley (the "Tin Man") and the end result is something that I don't believe can ever be duplicated. In short, not only is this movie a "classic" in every sense of the word but I believe it ranks in the top 3 films of all time. If you've never seen this movie then by all means you need to buy or rent it as soon as possible. You'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Click your heels, fly out of Kansas, and go where nobody mourns the wicked.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my 2000th review, I felt it would be appropriate to visit the film that I saw 20 times by the time I was 20. Between countless network T.V. viewings (on my grandparent's old T.V. where everything was green, even the black and white Kansas sequences), several big screen visits, hundreds of playings of it at the video store I worked at for 10 years and numerous video covers and different DVD releases, this film has never escaped our culture, and thus my life. My favorite VHS cover was the one in red which focused on the witch and her crystal ball, but that was out of print almost immediately after its release, while the one copy I owned was the blue "50th Anniversary" special edition which came with a ton of extras.While throughout grade school, I was obsessed, not only with the film, but the book too, I made a point of seeing it every time network T.V. aired it. When I first discovered it on video, I was thrilled to be able to see it without commercials and certainly without edits. I was also surprised to find out how much was edited from the film, and like Angela Lansbury quoted about the film in her documentary on its filming, "How long is too long?". Certainly, I would have loved to see the filmed footage of "The Jitterbug" rather than the home movies, but it is obvious from what I have seen that it takes away from the flow of the completed film. What would have been more interesting was the lavish sequence (seen briefly in one of the re-release trailers) of Dorothy and her friend's return from the witches' castle.Of course, the star-making performance of Judy Garland is the heart and soul of this breathtaking fantasy, often imitated but never surpassed. She's a bit busty for the role of the pre-teen Dorothy, but her sincerity is magnetic. There was a genius behind all her madness and as sorry as you can feel for her because of all her woes, you can't feel sorry for the artist who to this day strikes a cord in non-fans, not to mention those of us who consider her the single greatest female performer of all times.There's no better supporting cast (although much of the roles were initially mentioned for other actors), with Ray Bolger an absolute rubbery delight as the Scarecrow, Jack Haley tender and gentle to the max as the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr a blubbering gem as the Cowardly Lion. No good witch was more glamorous than Billie Burke's Glinda (even all the blonde starlets in Broadway's "Wicked"), and for pure fright, no wicked witch was scarier than Margaret Hamilton's. I became a huge fan of this wonderful character actress as a child, and to this day, I delight in finding works of hers I hadn't seen yet. Hamilton's Miss Gulch reminds me of the delightfully nosy neighbors of my childhood, and to see her in the same outfit the year later sticking her nose up to W.C. Fields' in "My Little Chickadee" was a comic treat.While Fields was mentioned as a candidate for the role of the wizard, it was Frank Morgan, a stuttering gem of a comical character actor who ended up with the role. He appears in an assortment of other roles, beginning in the Kansas sequence, and later as the doorman of Oz and the doorman to the wizard, all disguised to make you think that he's actually another character, which is doubtful. Hamilton obviously is not only Miss Gulch and the Western Witch, but in the brief guise of the Eastern Witch as well. Of course, in "Wicked", Nessarose is a lot more beautiful than her sister, only made ugly in spirit by her change in character which didn't ring true.In smaller roles, Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em offer wise, if distant, support to Judy Garland's Dorothy, with Grapewin very funny as he reluctantly greets the Gulch Woman and Blandick downright hysterical as she tells her off. Toto is an adorable pooch, and I long for a spoof of him getting his revenge on Gulch by biting her in the tush before jumping out of the basket. So as I reflect in my journal of my journey down the yellow brick road, I must call it a lifetime of great and powerful entertainment where every character has become an important part of my child-like heart in my transition to find my own land of Oz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film For All Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is one of my favorite movies growing up as a child, and to this day; it is considered to be timeless. Everyone knows the story, characters, music, magic, fun, etc. This is a very memorable movie because again everyone knows the movie very well. The movie is based on L. Frank Baum's book, and there had been many adaptations for "The Wizard of Oz" which it was during the silent film era; so I guess you can say if the movie that I'm reviewing is somewhat like a remake of the original silent movies or not. I know that the movie had went many production changes along with the original director Richard Thorpe getting fired for lacking the movie's spirit. So now that we have what Dorothy Gale looks along with the Scarecrow, Tin Man, Lion, and the Wicked Witch of the West. Also, Victor Fleming taking over the director's chair for making such a wonderful looking movie, and making OZ look beautiful in Technicolor. I do know that he did not direct the Kansas scenes because of his commitment to work on another production from MGM studio's "Gone With The Wind," which I never saw and don't know if I should see it. Maybe I should but I still don't know because I felt that movie stole the Oscar for Best Picture for not letting "The Wizard of Oz" win, but I digress. As I was saying about the Kansas scenes, they were pretty much much filmed by King Vidor. With that said, I thought the cast were perfect, and they do manage to bring their roles to life. Judy Garland is Dorothy Gale and she will always be remembered for playing that kind of role. Ray Bolger was fantastic as the Scarecrow along with Jack Haley as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton does a memorable job to played the evil Wicked Witch of the West. The production design in this movie are sensational, and it does look a place where anyone fantasize in their own world away from their home. The cinematography is beautifully well shot for OZ being filmed in Technicolor, and the Kansas scenes being filmed in a Sepia tone. The special effects in this movie are quite special for the used of matte paintings; witch being melted; holographic head of the Wizard of Oz; and most of all the tornado. The tornado itself looks really good before there was any CGI by today's special effects. The movie "Twister" from 1996 does used CGI for the Tornado, while this movie was all done practically. The songs in this movie are indeed memorable such as "We're off to see the Wizard;" "If I only had a Brain;" "If I only had a Heart;" "If I only had the Nerve;" and everyone's favorite "Over the Rainbow." The movie never gets tiring, and anyone can watch this movie as much as they want to because the movie's premise along with the pacing goes by very well. I wish I can say more about this movie, but everyone who has seen this movie had already said about what makes this movie so special. As of that, they are very much right. After this movie was made, there were more "OZ" movies that appear on the big screen as "The Wiz" based on its play which it is not a good movie and never saw the play. Also, there were two more "OZ" movies that were made by Disney such as "Return of Oz" and "Oz the Great and Powerful." Those were good movies, but none of them were as good as the original timeless classic. "The Wizard of Oz" is never going to die, and it will live on forever. This is a film for all ages for both children and adults. As Dorothy would say "There is no place like," to me I say "There is no great OZ movie like this one." I give "The Wizard of Oz" a perfect 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia...The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have come across this film during the various stages of my life with the interpretation of Dorothy's travels changing each time. Maturity is a sobering catalyst of realism which often extinguishes the merriment of candy coated mountain tops and melting lemon drops. Nostalgia, however, is the last hope one has that connects them to that place somewhere over the rainbow. Watching this film as an adult sometimes creates a feeling of confounding dismay. Why can't I? Is the question I ask as I sit in the unemployment line or spit shine my useless, but nicely framed college degree. As I sit here broke, burdened and depressed by the tribulations of my adulthood, nostalgia finds its way into my gloomy existence offering a map to emerald city. How dare Dorothy lie to me, by igniting my ambitions as a child only to let me down in my adulthood. Is this the fault of Dorothy and her fellow conspirators or has the interpretation of her experience changed? I guess I will go with the latter since I know now that the place somewhere over the rainbow is still attainable, however, this place has a refurbished sense of meaning to me. This place exemplifies a spiritual paradise that can only be attained by faith. Here on earth, the daily grinds of life will always find a way to kill what little hope I have left, but money, credit cards, and SallieMae can never purchase the true feeling of spiritual freedom otherwise known to me as that place somewhere over the rainbow. I guess nostalgia has won me over yet again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, you can't deny that this is a classic movie. i don't know many people who haven't at least heard of it, and don't know many people who don't like it. I used to watch it every now and then when I was young, and I knew the words to quite a few of the songs. I hadn't seen it in a while, but, I still knew what I liked about it. When I was little, I used to be absolutely horrified of the Wicked Witch, and the Tin Man was my absolute favorite character. Since then, I am no longer afraid of the Wicked Witch at all; if anything, I just sort of hate her, because she's mean. I think that it is just a good movie through and through. It's very charming and colorful, has a good deal of humor, and you can sort of get sucked in to the story easily. Of course, they changed it a bit from the book, which only a few years ago, I didn't know about, but I much prefer the movie to the book. In conclusion, I think it's a great movie, that was a pretty big deal when it first came out, with the beauty of tis Technicolor, and that everyone should watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Childhood Favorite That Stands the Test of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You would be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't seen the Wizard of Oz. It is just one of those movies that seemingly everyone has seen. In my family, it has been an old standby for all sorts of gatherings. After I re-watched it from a technical viewpoint, I was blown away by the sheer amount of work that went into creating this film. From the musical numbers to the pulling of heartstrings towards the climax, this film will bring you on a journey through an incredible land full of magic and wonder. This film has stood the test of time because of how it draws people in with such an innocent girl, and the wild adventure she embarks on, all to return to the ones she loves. What stand out to me however, is the key phrase of "There's no place like home." This little piece has left such an impact on so many people, it would be wrong to not include it. So if you are one of the few who has not seen the film, just go out and do it. You're missing out on Americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Movie That is Still Cherished Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz (1939) directed by Mervyn Leroy, is a fun movie that is simply unforgettable. This film has iconic set pieces, and bright colors, which is amazing for the time it was made. The film starts out black and white, but progresses to color upon arrival at Oz. The characters in the film are all great, and the relationships between the characters is heartwarming. The music in the film is great and the band of friends skipping down the yellow brick road is iconic and simply innocent. The movie has some macabre elements and themes, but they do not make up the vast majority of the films feel. Overall, The Wizard of Oz (1939) is an outstanding piece of filmmaking worthy of a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film for the whole family!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT**The Wizard of Oz has a wonderful surface of comedy and music, special effects and excitement, but we still watch it all these years later because its underlying story hits home with us. It undoubtedly penetrates straight to the deepest insecurities of our childhood, stirs them and then, finally, reassures them. As adults, we love it because it reminds us of the journey we have taken since first viewing the film. The Wizard of Oz fills such a large space in our imagination. It somehow seems real and important in a way most movies don't. To this day, each time I watch The Wizard of Oz, I pick up on different small details that I had not previously noticed. The film takes us along on a journey that young Dorothy, played by actress Judy Garland, and her little dog Toto embark on after being swept away from her Kansas farm home in a twister. They are taken to the wonderful Land of Oz After having offended the Wicked Witch of the West, played by Margaret Hamilton, Dorothy is protected from her wrath by the ruby slippers that she obtains. At the suggestion of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, played by Billie Burke, Dorothy heads down the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City, where dwells the all-powerful Wizard of Oz, who might be able to help the girl return to Kansas. On her journey, she befriends a Scarecrow, played by Ray Bolger, a Tin Man, played by Jack Haley, and a Cowardly Lion, played by Bert Lahr. The Scarecrow would like to have some brains, the Tin Man craves a heart, and the Lion wants to attain courage. In hopes that the Wizard might also be able to help them too, they accompany Dorothy on her journey to the Emerald City.Of all the years I have been watching The Wizard of Oz, I had never previously picked up on the importance of the change from black and white to color. The switch from black and white to color had a very important role back in 1939 when this film was first made. Up to this time-frame, films were still primarily done in black and white until the prior release of another classic. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was made in 1937 and it pioneered the idea of a color animation feature. With The Wizard of Oz following its release and combining both black and white and color filming, it was sure to be a classic. The Wizard of Oz began one way and ended in another completely. Richard Thorpe was the original director of the film but was fired after only 12 days on the job. Next came George Cukor, who lasted just three days. When Victor Fleming took over, things were finally progressing. Not only were there direction changes, but there were also cast changes that took place. The actor, Buddy Ebsen, who was originally the Tin Man, had to be replaced after having an allergic reaction to the silver makeup involved in the costume. He was replaced by Jack Haley. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic. How does it manage to still shine, when others falter year after year? It has a lot to do with the dynamic cast, heartfelt songs, and eye-catching special effects. The story of The Wizard of Oz shows us how young Dorothy is learning about evil, friendship, and fallibility. The message in this film along with its presentation is why people of all ages continue to view it time and time again all these years later. I don't see this changing any time soon. The Wizard of Oz will remain a family classic for many more years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I likely saw this before the age of 5-6, however this is the earliest I can remember seeing "The Wizard Of Oz". This is one of those movies that you appreciate more as you get older. As a small child, I remembered this movie most for the characters. As I got a bit older I began to appreciate the use of color film in the movie, and the impact that it has on the audience.It wasn't until I was in my 20's that I began to appreciate this movie on all levels. It's an incredible story, and it's also kinda messed up at the same time. The characters falling asleep in the poppy fields for example... not too many children's movies these days with characters getting so high off of opiates that they're passed out in fields. There's also commentary about the economic conditions at the time this film was shot ("All we own - we owe" as chanted by the guards).1939-1940 was likely the most extraordinary period of movie-making in Hollywood history, and "The Wizard of Oz" was one of the most extraordinary movies of that period. If you haven't seen the movie since you were a child I'd recommend doing so. It's an entirely different experience as an adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to the land of Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was 1939, when "Gone with the Wind" took the major awards of Oscar. But, that's another movie that also made a history of the cinema, yes, this movie. Full of fantasy, that very surprising in its era. I haven't watch "Gone with the Wind" yet, but this movie just make me believe the magic of 1939. I think the revolution of the movie and also new standard of the film-idea itself. There are no border in the movie, you can make a world whatever you want, that's what "The Wizard of Oz" tried to make.Land of fantasy, a very new field of the cinematography that time. I think the audience will understand that movie isn't just a imagination of usual activities or world, but sometimes as an interpretation of fantasy imagination itself. With the fun song and simple story line, "The Wizard of Oz" will last forever, as an old-classic-movie for every children in every era.There were some not optimal scene, but that's okay. I just can grasp the entire feeling of this movie. At last, this movie very amazing and inspiring for the next generation of fantasy-genre. A new genre was born, a new entertainment will come to the world. Fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic, if ever I saw one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is a story of a woman who discovers that there is no place like home. Granted, it is a musical, and I am not a big fan of musicals, but this film is a classic if there ever was one, and it truly is a film for all the family.Dorothy is a teenager whose best friend is her dog Toto and she lives in Kansas during the dust bowl. To say that life was hard is an understatement, and Dorothy dreams of a better place. It is not helped that a neighbour hates her dog and wants to put it down, so she runs away from home, only to be convinced by a magician that her auntie wants her to come back. However she never gets there as she is caught up in a tornado and taken 'over the rainbow'.Granted, this is all a dream, but to her the dream is real. Each of the characters that she meets in Oz is a reflection of one of the characters back home, and further the wicked witch is the horrid neighbour. Back home, she was told to use her brains and to have courage, two of the qualities that her travelling companions are seeking.The Wizard of Oz is a story about a girl growing up and becoming an adult. Learning that there is truly no place like home, and that those whom she lives with love her dearly and are worried about her. Of course Toto, her faithful companion, is by her side all the time. Further, in Oz she is a hero, but this pales in comparison to her desire to return home, and that is the purpose of the quest.True, the Wizard turns out to be a fraud, and it is interesting that Toto jumps out of the balloon that the wizard is using to get home, but it turns out that it is much easier to get home than travelling in a balloon, and we all know how she does it.As for the music, or more so, the singing. Many movies these days have music, but it is rare indeed for the characters to burst out into song, unless the song is a part of the film. However, songs play an important role in this film, and in a way bring out the character's emotions in a way that dialogue is unable to do. Long gone are the plays with lengthy discourses, however these seem to be replaced by songs in the musicals, though the discourses are nowhere near as deep or as thought provoking as they are in Shakespeare. Still, they add much to the characters that, as I have said previously, simply cannot be done with dialogue.</fullReview>

Together with the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man, and the Scarecrow, they must follow the yellow brick road to find the Wizard of Oz while being hounded by the Wicked Witch of the West.The colorful visual Technicolor is the best of the day. The iconic songs, and the fun amazing story are just some of what makes this movie great. Not only is it a great movie, it's influences stretches far and wide beyond just a film.

		<fullReview>The Wizard Of Oz (TWOO) is probably one of the most famous Hollywood films of the late-1930s and, maybe, even the early-1940s.As I understand it, when TWOO was first released back in 1939 it really wasn't a colossal hit. It wasn't until the coming of TV when it was first aired in the 1950s that it attracted a humongous fan-base and from there it became one of the most popular films of all-time.Filmed at MGM Studios, TWOO was made at a time when MGM was, without question, the wealthiest, most impressive, and most successful Hollywood studio in the USA.Back in 1939 TWOO was made simply as a showpiece. This was MGM showing the world just how much power they wielded, that they could make an expensive film like this one and not care, one bit, whether it earned them a profit, or not.Little did the MGM big-wigs realize at the time that TWOO would go on to become one of the most beloved Fantasy/Adventure films of all time.So - "Tap your heels together 3 times and repeat after me - There's no place like home.

		<fullReview>Often I am dubious about old movies, especially old sci-fi or "classic" movies. However, this movie was both enchanting and quite humorous for an oldie. The scenery was beautiful and so intricate. I was especially impressed by the lion's tail, flitting about in a life-like manner without the use of modern graphics or technology. The scenery impressed me because of all the time and effort that must have gone into creating it. Though much of the movie was spoiled for me through its fame, I was still amazed even with the scenes I knew were coming. The actors made the movie a delight to watch and the songs were humorous, and sometimes a bit stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most well known and watched film in history?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film predates my birth by 19 years, so I've seen it as a child when it was an annual event on network TV, stretched out to hours in length, believably due to commercials and maybe not so believably today due to the network hosting and talking about the film a little during breaks.Today at age 55, when it shows up on Turner Classic Movies, even though I have in my possession the deluxe "Wizard of Oz DVD Set and Museum in a Box", I'll still stop and watch it from whatever point I catch it to the end. Having the advantage of having seen it at all ages I can truly say that it has enough fantasy and whimsy and spectacle to keep the interest of children without being inane so that adults cannot appreciate it too. I think in all of filmdom only Walt Disney in Walt's time with his animated features and Pixar in modern times have been able to strike that balance. Even "Star Wars" has lost a step or two in the 36 years since its release.Wizard of Oz has the universal themes of the value of friendship and family, of how many of us have strengths and virtues inside of us we'll never believe we have until tested, and how many powerful people are literally all hot air. "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain" is practically a slogan of American politics as I am writing this in the year 2013. Then there is beautiful Judy Garland when her exterior still matched her voice, before the studio system chewed her up and literally spit her out. She was never more lovely than she is right here. You'd never believe Billie Burke as the good witch Glenda is 55 years old. You'd never believe that Margaret Hamilton as The Bad Witch is only 37. I remember seeing her on a daytime commercial in the 1960's as a child and thinking "Isn't she dead yet?" There is maybe one aspect of this film that is uniquely pre-WWII. The theme of the film - "Never look for anything if you can't find it in your own backyard" is a motto for the isolationist years between the wars that would be left behind in only a couple of years when it became apparent that the U.S. would have to confront the evil expansionist powers growing on both sides of the globe. It is perhaps a unique snapshot in time in that regard only. It also shows the best the studio system could produce in that fabled year of 1939 when it was at the height of its power.Forgive me for yammering on about a film that has been reviewed hundreds of times, but this one will always have a special place in my heart and my memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Fantasy One Could Embark On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1900, Lyman Frank Baum wrote a story about a little girl named Dorothy who was hurled away from dusty Kansas to the magnificent land of Oz, filled with talking Scarecrows, wicked witches, big headed wizards and magical shoes. This story was so successful upon it's release that several film adaptations have been made throughout the years, but it wasn't until 1939 when the world first saw the film that is probably the most well known and admired film of forever more. The Wizard of Oz is the pinnacle motion picture of many of our childhoods, for we saw it at a very young age and it augmented our lives and points of view. Some consider it their favorite film, others consider it a icon feast, I however see it as the greatest fantasy one could embark on. This is one of the greatest tales ever told (both the movie and the original book) and every time I set my eyes upon it, I realize more and more how much I love this film and just how legendary it really is. The Wizard of Oz is THAT film, the film everyone has seen more than once and it's imagery and surroundings are very hard to rid from the mind. It's characters are relatable and very vivid to look at (Would you believe Bert Lahr's Lion costume was 90 pounds!) and the songs the characters chant are songs everyone can sing, for everyone has heard them so many times and know the lyrics by heart. But where The Wizard of Oz truly shines is in it's moral, that there is no place like home. Stated only once in Baum's original story, this quote has been the most prominent and well known movie quote ever spewed from a human mouth and it goes to show that no matter who you are and where you are, you always have a place to go to and people you can love and cherish. It's not about what kind of home it is, it's the fact that it's a home and it's a place where you can be who you want to be and relate with those most dear to you. It's the love and the warmth of being together that really matters and it's what Dorothy realizes at the very end of the film, that no matter how sepia toned her homelike is, she can be happy there and always love the things around her. That is one of the many reasons why this film is truly perfect in every sense of the word. Nah, it's not perfect, nothing is perfect, but this film is pretty darn spectacular and it's a film that will live on many, many, many, many, many years down the road, even after I am gone off the face of the Earth. This film is a tradition that generation to generation can savor and take to the heart and it's a film no one can deny, no one can get fed up with. It's the very film that gets you out of sadness and despair and into the realm of grandiose and fantastic nature. It's the film that gives us brains, gives us courage, gives us heart, gives us strength. That's all I have to say about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate reviewing movies like this. This is an unequivocal classic. Even when some lists and reviewers have called the film one of the most over-rated classics...you can sort of understand why. I grew up on this movie, watching it again and again. But I would hazard to guess that 99% of North America know the absolutely timeless songs, and the constant barrage of famous quotes. Even watching it again, when I got to see it on the big screen which was awesome, I was shocked by how many literally epically famous quotes are from this one movie. Considering when the film was made this had to be a stunning feat for film making. The special effects lack in some aspects and then in other ways it is truly astonishing. The painting backdrop of OZ definitely looks dated, seeing it again, but then you look at something as small as the Scarecrow/Lion/Tin-man's make up and it is really quite astounding. The film is simply fun and a little bit dark at times creating one of the most well known villains in film history. It has a moral story to it that I actually felt was a little forced but you can't deny that the film is just beautiful and simple and fun and takes many of us back to a time of our childhood.Judy Garland was many things in her life, and I don't think I've seen her in anything other than this but she was simply angelic as Dorothy. Squeaky clean and beautiful and perfect and flawless in her role. Her voice is beautiful of course and this role easily one of the most iconic. Ray Bolger gives one of my favourite performances in films as the Scarecrow. He is terrific and bumbling and just his facial expressions and movements are brilliant. In my opinion, this would be an Oscar worthy performance. Bert Lahr is probably equally as iconic as the cowardly Lion. He certainly plays up the role and is very campy but somehow it works for the film. Sometimes I think his character was slightly overused but you can't deny he is an integral part of the cast. I always felt like Jack Haley as the Tin Man was very under-rated and under-appreciated. Its true that he doesn't stand out quite as much as everyone else but I still think his more subtle and courageous character was fun and well played. What can you say about Margaret Hamilton? Her Wicked Witch is certainly one of the most well known villains in history and for good reason. She is mean and her cackle is perfection. Nowadays you might say her witch is so stereotypical and maybe it was then too but she nails this role. She is certainly one of my favourites from childhood. I have to say that Billie Burke as Glinda has always been one of my least favourite parts of The Wizard of Oz. I would hazard to say she is downright annoying and her awful condescending tone (brilliantly and respectfully mocked by Michelle Williams in the new Oz film) was terrible. Honourable mention to both Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em who are both excellent in their roles. And finally the Wizard himself Frank Morgan who is a master of disguise playing five different roles. Morgan is very good in each of his roles and certainly captures everything that we have come to know about the Wizard of Oz.Its quite amazing reading about all the trials and tribulations this film went through to get made including multiple directors and actors in various roles. 1939 was some kind of year for director Victor Fleming who I think is a visionary and that's only from seeing Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind. He knows his material and he knows how to completely whisk away his audience to a completely different world and that's perfect for Oz. I could nit pick the film and find a handful of things that annoy me now...as an adult, and maybe as someone who has watched so many movies that I have become a little bit jaded but you know I'm going to go in a different direction with this review. Who am I to deny a sincere classic. This film has stood up for 70 years and given us some of the most well known music, characters, film lines and the movie is easily one of the most watchable. I could watch this any day and any time and just simply enjoy it and that to me makes this a huge 10!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most memorable journey and musical numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a notorious classic and I finally got the chance to see it. Although the main reason is because "Oz The Great and Power" came out which I am sorta ashamed of. For a movie that came out in 1939 this is a great accomplishment. The musical numbers really stand out and even when the movie is over some of the tunes, actually just about all of the tunes was stuck in my head. The musical numbers all just really stick and although the adventure is simple it's memorable. Some of the virtues and morals in this movie can be questionable to some, but it's well blended into the story. In fact the musical numbers and the journey in this is more memorable than "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory". Especially since it has musical numbers like "Over the Rainbow". There is a reason why just about everyone has at least heard of or somewhat know about "The Wizard of Oz". This is a fantastic musical journey that I highly recommend.8.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think every kid has THAT MOVIE growing up. You know, the one you watched every day &amp; had memorized. The Wizard of Oz was my movie. It was my life. This movie is one of those classics that could not be improved upon by modern film wizardry. If made today, the Cowardly Lion would most likely be CGI but he wouldn't have the personality Bert Lahr gave the character. One of the most depressing things that has happened to the filmmaking process, in my opinion, is how many movies are just people standing in front of a green screen with all the magic added later by computers. The fact that the land of Oz was made by real hands and that Dorothy actually walked down the yellow brick road, makes everything a little more special to me. http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/29/the-wizard-of-oz/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wizard of Oz is a colorful classic, that is filled with thrills and it is a straight shooter right from the start to the very end. From following the yellow brick road to finally meeting the wizard himself, it was a bumpy ride that I always look forward to going again.Filmed mostly in Technicolor, except the opening scenes which was shot in sepia-tinted black and white, The Wizard of Oz has stood the test of time as a top fantasy movie, with highly unusual characters. The movie is based on a book titled The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, and although it did differ a lot from the book, this movie is the best adaptation that is near to its original book story.The movie plot is about Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto who got caught in a tornado's path and somehow end up in the land of Oz. At Oz she mistakenly killed the wicked witch of the East, who was a sister to the Wicked Witch of the west, who was now after her. Now Dorothy must find her way home and the only person who could help her is the Wizard of Oz.On her to see the wizard she meets along the way a Scarecrow with no Brains, a Tin Man with no Heart and a Lion without Courage. Together this team head off to see the wizard with the hope that the Wizard will meet all their needs.The movie production had its twists and turns, with Ray Bolger who was originally cast as the Tin Man and Buddy Ebsen was to play the Scarecrow had their roles switched later on. This switch was to the detriment of Ebsen who had an allergic reaction to the makeup of the Tin Man and Jack Haley was called to take his place.Another thing to note about this classic is how it deviated from its original book story, up to 40 differences can be sited; from the merging of characters to the overall theme of the movie, this 1939 fantasy film carved out its own theme: in the book Oz is real and Dorothy did get to return in Baum's later books, but in the movie Oz is just a dream that Dorothy had.The movies popular song, "Over the Rainbow" won best original song in the Oscars. Over the Rainbow has been re done by many artist notably Kyle Minogue during her treatment and recovery from breast cancer.Wizard of Oz is a classic that you must see, a nice fantasy film for you and the kids. Disney will be making a prequel to this classic, named Oz: The Great and Powerful the movie is set to be released in 2013 and it will star James Franco as the Wizard of Oz.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is an musical fantasy film based on the 1900 children's novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.It stars Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, and Frank Morgan, with Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, Charley Grapewin, Clara Blandick and the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins.Dorothy is an innocent farm girl whisked out of her mundane earthbound existence into a land of pure imagination. Her journey in Oz will take her through emerald forests, yellow brick roads, and creepy castles, all with the help of some unusual but earnest song-happy friends.It is one of the greatest movies ever made, and even today it stands the test of time as a quality family flick as it retains its emotional power and visual enchantment.Also,it is an absolute masterpiece whose groundbreaking visuals and deft storytelling are still every bit as resonant. A must-see film for young and old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasy movies of today are generally escapist extravaganzas of uncompromising pace. They show everything for real what kids once didn't even dream of imagining - they are graphic, loud and if there's a morality lesson to be learned from it at all it's sugar-coated beyond recognition. The musical classic "The Wizard of Oz" is different. Starting off on a farm in Kansas, a plain kind of reality shot in black and white awaits. A genuine surprise move for its time the film then dives into the Technicolor fantasy world of Dorothy's dream, only to eventually emerge back where we set out - in the reality of life, unchanged in color, but full with experiences gained from the journey enriching what once seemed drab and plain. Thus the "Wizard of Oz" is a coming of age movie that deals with anxieties and how to overcome them - with a bit of brain, heart and courage things are half as frightening as they seem, and we are reassured that even wizards are just plain human."The Wizard of Oz" based on the timeless children book classic by L. Frank Baum however is much more than a film only children would enjoy - it's a treat for all ages. The action and the music are heart-lifting, the film is funny, entertaining, fascinating, the tale's metaphors are deep enough to appeal to everyone and it still holds up many years after its release back in 1939. Take for instance Roy Bolger's famous scarecrow dance, Judy Garland singing "Somewhere over the rainbow" and the final scenes with trusted faces and the realization that there's no place like home, despite all the problems and troubles. Well, sometimes it helps to take the shortcut through fantasy land to get to the real thing. Here's one way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a film about a beloved book is a tall order to fill. If it's a book from our childhood it may be ever harder. People have such fond memories of the books read to them as children before bed. When film was invented, it was only a matter of time before people adapted books for the screen. One book that has spanned so many generations is L. Frank Baum's immortal classic 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.' The film version was a major event and boy did it not disappoint. Over 70 years later, people are still enjoying and discussing this treasure.Pros: Beautifully acted. Lovely score and songs. Great production design and costumes. Amazing effects. Steady direction. Nicely photographed. Paces just zips right along. At times moving.Cons: Perhaps not enough obstacles. The book has many for the characters.Final thoughts: What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? It's one of the all time greats that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's one of those films that can lift your spirits if you're feeling down. It's a remarkable achievement that has stood the test of time.My rating: 5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no place like home ... no time like childhood ... no movie like "The Wizard of Oz" ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red like magical ruby slippers, yellow like a brick road to follow, green like the Emerald city, blue like a cloudless sky, violet like a floppy field ? all the colors of the rainbow celebrate two magical universes with the same initials: cinema and childhood."The Wizard of Oz" is and will forever be associated with a magnificent imagery, unforgettable songs such as "Ding Dong! the Witch is Dead", "We're off to see the Wizard", the catchy "If I had..." songs, the Munchkins' high-pitched voices, Dorothy having the feeling 'not to be in Kansas' anymore, the shrill and scary voice of a green-faced evil witch and so on and so forth. With all these elements, it's comforting that the film lost against a worthy adversary, the iconic "Gone with the Wind" from the same director. God, if there ever was a year where film-making triumphed, it's 1939, and the throne of Hollywood undoubtedly belonged to Victor Fleming."The Wizard of Oz" is both a spectacular milestone for its first use of colors and groundbreaking visual effects and a timeless classic in the way it touched the heart of children from many generations, all over the world. It's fascinating how these two aspects drive the film's paradoxical nature as the ultimate escapism, plunging us in the dreamlike Technicolor vision of the enchanted land of Oz, yet concluding with the immortal "There's no place like home". "Oz" captures through the innate power and insecurity of childhood a very poignant contradiction that reminds us how we used to dream of such places 'over the rainbow' and still were deeply rooted to our home, our family. And Kansas, with its sepia-like simplicity is Dorothy's home and we couldn't be happier for her when she was finally back.But as a set-up to this powerful finale, the whole film is a miraculous journey into a magical world where a group of friends will try to find the only person whose power could fulfill their wishes. Dorothy wants to go home, because she left her aunt worried after a frightening tornado destroyed the farm, the Scarecrow wants to have a brain, the Tin Man, a heart and needless to say what the Cowardly Lion wants. We all can identify with Dorothy or her friends because each one remains true to one of the many emotions that inhabit childhood, fear, awkwardness, joy, sadness, homesickness etc. And watching these three adult actors and an adolescent Judy Garland taking their roles with such dedication is the best tribute to the good old days' innocence. Those were the days ruled by Walt Disney and MGM's roaring lion, when people went to the movie theaters to escape, to dream ? an even sadder desire when put in the tragic international context of the film.Speaking of my personal experience, I had "The Wizard of Oz" in mind long before watching the film, with the unforgettable image of Dorothy and her three friends walking along the "We're off to see the Wizard" song, one of these indelible shots in the history of film-making that invites us to re-enact them every once in a while. That's the secret of "Oz", which makes any attempt to summarize the film pointless. Any other fantasy film can be more spectacular or penetrating but its popularity might mostly rely on the story, on the way it ends. Take Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life", the whole significance of the film depends on the reception of the last act of the film, and kind of diminish the impact of the first scenes. In "The Wizard of Oz", it's all about characters, scenes, songs, quotes, each sequence is as valuable and impacting as another, and more than anything, each one conveys a valuable lesson about and for children.Whether it's about children's adoration for their pet animals (Dorothy's adventure starts because she wanted to protect her dog Toto from the evil Miss Gulch) or about the value of friendship in order to face the adversity of the adult world, an undeniable pedagogical value elevates "Oz" above all the other fantasy movies. It is, for once, not a coming-of-age, but a coming-to-realization story and a proud affirmation of the value of childhood in the way it intelligently mirrors our own memories of a time of misunderstanding, naivety, trust and fear and a perpetual leaning helping us to face the world, to accept it and moreover to accept ourselves (there's a subtle message about self-acceptance powerfully conveyed by the wizard, played by the jovial Frank Morgan). And the merit of these lessons is to be learned through action: Dorothy and her friends are never passive characters characters and that's crucial because it puts action as a necessary step before learning, and fear, not as a flaw, but a necessary step before learning about courage. "The Wizard of Oz" provides also through the wizard's character, the man 'behind the curtain', a lesson about naivety and how child's eyes can easily trust or be impressed. In a way, it illustrates the sad reality that all the adults aren't trustworthy. Of course, some of them can be really mean and the film wouldn't have been half the masterpiece it is without the scene stealing performance of Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West, rightfully nominated #4 in the AFI Top 50 villains. The Witch happens to be a representation of Mrs. Gulch in Dorothy's dream, like most of the characters, including the three friends (farmhands in real-life) and the wizard ? in a way, it helps us to keep in mind that Dorothy is only dreaming, which doesn't make her dream less impacting anyway.And bizarrely, as we forget it's all a dream, we cease to be marveled by the beauty of the cinematography and the special effects, forgetting that it was before CGI, before "Star Wars", that's the miracle of "The Wizard of Oz", and as a beautiful dream, its memory can be eternal?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The epitome of easy viewing and quite possibly the most colourful film ever made: THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of those old-time films that never seem to age, and indeed become more and more loved as the years go by.I'm not a huge fan of musicals, but the tunes in OZ are outstanding: from the jaunty ('Follow the Yellow Brick Road') to the moving '(Somewhere Over the Rainbow') and everything in between. Judy Garland is excellent as Dorothy, as are the rest of the supporting cast - including the ever-loyal and ever-lovable Toto.If there's a complaint, it may be that the Wicked Witch of the West wasn't quite wicked enough for this viewer, at least not enough to make her deserve her quite horrible fate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz (1939) - Follow the Yellow Brick Road, Go Over the Rainbow, and You'll Have a Feeling You're Not in Kansas Anymore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most wonderful and beautiful entertaining family masterpieces is 1939's all-time classic, "The Wizard of Oz". Directed by the same director of "Gone with the Wind" in the same year, Victor Fleming has helped to bring L. Frank Baum's timeless children's' stories to life on the big screen. The story tells about Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto, who get sent to the land of Oz, after their house in Kansas was sent in a tornado. Along the way, they meet singing munchkins, a scarecrow in need of a brain, a tin man in need of a heart, a lion in need of courage, a beautiful kind witch, flying monkeys, a green nasty witch, and a wonderful wizard of a green city. "The Wizard of Oz" is one of my all-time favorite movies for many reasons. It's a movie for all audiences to enjoy, and it's perfect for the whole family. The performances by Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, and Margaret Hamilton as these wonderful characters were quite memorable to watch on screen. The characters are memorable, the art direction and costumes are imaginative, the story is timeless, and the music is still wonderful, with all of those classic songs we used to sign to as children. The songs never leave your head, and you always want to hum to them. "The Wizard of Oz" is a beautiful memory of our childhood, and it brings some heartwarming moments of love, courage, and how home matters. I can watch this movie over and over again, because it's the definition of an entertaining classic family film. "The Wizard of Oz", in my review, "a wonderful masterpiece of entertaining proportions".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time 1939 came around, sound had only been present in films for 10 years, and colour had barely put in an appearance. But that year saw 4 films arrive, each of which made revolutionary use of the new full colour technology with a breadth of vision which would never be repeated - Gone WIth The Wind, Snow White, The Adventures Of Robin Hood, and The Wizard Of Oz.The Wizard Of Oz builds on Baum's source material and adds some wonderful touches of its own: the songs are the obvious additions, but the parallels between Oz and the real world are another, as is the inspired decision to have the real world in monochrome and Oz in dazzling Technicolor.The entire cast is also excellent, notwithstanding that the performance style is rather broader than we are used to these days. In particular, Judy Garland's Dorothy, despite being perceptibly older than Dorothy should be (even after the physical torment Garland was put through to make her look younger), is an achingly honest performance, blessed with one of the most sublime songs ever committed to the screen.The only possible criticism is that the stage sets are a little obvious these days, but that is a minor point to raise against a film which is as fresh now as it was more than 70 years ago.I note that it has never been mooted for a remake, a fact which speaks for itself!2014 update: the 3D retooling is first rate, and enhances a film which was already close to perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Classic that will always be remembered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is an amazing classic movie that I have watched several times in my life... all the way back to when I was very little. I even used to be afraid, especially of the flying monkeys! This is a film that I will probably watch several MORE times in my life, and I think that it is rare to find a person that has not seen it. And it is also pretty rare to find someone that did not like if not love it. Even if someone has not seen it they most certainly must have heard of it.The film takes you to a great fantasy land that turns to color and Judy Garland is fantastic in it. Although there are some points of joy, Dororthy, Toto, and her new friend have to overcome many obstacles to reach the Wizard of Oz. I even feel as though the picture and sound is pretty great for a 1939 film. In my mind this film is right up there with the classic, Gone With the Wind. Although both have very different story-lines and are totally different genres of films, they were both made the same year (to my knowledge), and will forever be remembered as wonderful movies to watch again and again and again. If you feel like escaping into the world of Dorothy, Toto, The scarecrow, the tinman, the cowardly lion, and of course the Wicked Witch of the West, then I highly recommend that you watch this classic movie. It is a treat that never gets old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We can't seem to remember the first time we saw "The Wizard of Oz." We just seem to have always known what it was, how the songs go, and each and every character. Whenever we think of the musical genre for movies, some of us automatically think of "The Wizard of Oz." This has been one of my favorite movies since I can remember, and every time I watch it, it keeps getting better and better than the last time I watched it. Although the storyline, characters and costumes are all well developed and elaborate, the best parts of this movie was always the music and the effects. I was always blown away from the switch to old time sepia to full blown bright and bold colors. The music and sounds are the key point to the movie. Music is what keeps audience involved and wins hearts as well as the sound effects that drag the audience even deeper into the movie and creating a even stronger relationship with the movie.</fullReview>

I grew up with it on annual re-runs (in the fog of my brain they were always hosted by Danny Kaye) that were a big deal every Easter. The film itself is full of ironies: it was released in August, 1939 to an indifferent audience and bombed. Producer Mervyn LeRoy was so financially damaged he swore never to put another cent of his own money in another movie. No adaption of Oz has ever been a hit in it's initial release. The film didn't achieve it's classic status until it was recycled on TV in the 50's (more irony: the vast majority of the first TV audiences viewed it in blazing black &amp; white, taking out much of it's color transforming wallop). The back story production drama is well documented and only adds to the film's mystique. Unlike so many movies of our childhood, it remains as delightful as ever. It's an honest 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's probably safe to say I've seen this film more than any other, hearkening back to my days as a kid in the late Fifties/early Sixties. Back then it was an annual staple on network TV, usually in the spring around Easter time, and every year my family would gather around the TV set to watch this familiar classic once again. The time eventually came when it stopped being shown, and like all good things coming to an end, it was something one had to deal with and get over. But times change, and with today's technology and availability, one can watch "The Wizard of Oz" just about any time you'd want to.Knowing the story while viewing with an adult's eye today, one is struck by the simple yet timeless message that's delivered by Dorothy and her friends. Even before embarking on their mission to save Dorothy from the Wicked Witch, the Tin Man had a heartfelt concern for rescuing her, the Scarecrow was already working on a plan, and the Lion somehow found the courage to go along. All three already had the one thing they most desired without realizing it - a wonderful lesson for young minds and young hearts to see demonstrated so effectively in such a charming and engaging story.As for Dorothy, she also came to realize that you can take the road home with the shoes you're wearing right now. Along the way, it was useful to learn that it's always best to start at the beginning, some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, only bad witches are ugly, and dogs can always spot a phony. And as we grow older and start to lose our innocence, it's best to heed the advice of the Wizard himself - pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.Since I'm in the habit of reading other viewers' comments of the films I've watched on this site, I fully expected to see some negative ones for "The Wizard of Oz". However the harshness of some of these reviews rises to the level of vitriol, and in a way that makes me sad. The world of 2010 isn't the world of 1939, this I understand. But it seems to me there must be something missing in ones's life to be unaffected by the charm and delight of the characters offered here. It leads me to believe that for some, there may have been no place like home to begin with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all the films I admire and love, "The Wizard of Oz", 1939, is the film I love the most, with all my heart. I grew up with annual showings of the film each year, during the 1970's, as many other people did. This helped make the film such a beloved classic.After watching "The Wizard of Oz", 1939, many times on TV during the 1970's, I finally viewed it in a 1998 theatrical re-release. Though it was not in the sepia tone of the original film, I appreciated the visual imagination of the film much more than before.The 2005 restored and remastered version is definitely more impressive than the 1998 version. Lovingly restored, frame by frame, to it's original sepia tone and Technicolor. The original mono audio track is cleaned up and expanded to Dolby 5.1 Surround. The film looks and sounds better than ever. The film restoration is the best I've ever seen for a 1930's film. The quality of this 2005 restoration is claimed to be better than many of the theater prints of the film back in 1939, which were copies of copies. "The Wizard of Oz" is based on one of Frank L. Baum's series of "Oz" books, first published in 1900. The original book, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", is widely regarded as one of the best children's' books of the 20th century. Most everyone familiar with movies, is at least somewhat familiar with the story of Dorothy and Kansas, which was changed, in it's film adaption. Dorothy is whisked away from her farm home in Kansas by a tornado into the magical land of Oz, befriends a scarecrow, lion and tin man, as she seeks out the Wizard of Oz, all the time pursued by the Wicked Witch of the West, for her precious ruby slippers. Dorothy's fantasy journey, from the original book, was here changed to a dream. It was thought movie audiences of the time would be reluctant to accept an all out fantasy. Dorothy's slippers were changed from silver, in the original book to red ruby, which could be shown off better in Technicolor.Judy Garland was just 16 at the time of filming, four years older than the character of Dorothy in the original book. I love Garland's acting performance in this film, as much as I love the film as a whole. This is her first big acting role in a Hollywood feature length film, and she does a terrific job. Her acting performance in "The Wizard of Oz", is genuinely charming, sweet and sincere. Judy Garland is definitely the big acting highlight of the film. Much credit goes to director Victor Fleming, for getting such a good acting performance from Judy Garland and from the cast in general. At the time the film was released, actors under the age of 18, could not be nominated for an Academy Award for acting. During 1940, Judy Garland won a "mini" Academy Award for "Outstanding Performance by a Juvenile Actor", for her work in "Babes in Arms" and "The Wizard of Oz", both released in 1939. In my opinion, her acting performance deserved a Best Actress in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination. The voting rules were different back then. An actor under the age of 18 could not be nominated in the usual two categories of Best Lead Actor/Actress or Best Supporting Actor/Actress.Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, the film won for Best Original Song for "Over the Rainbow" and Best Original Music Score. I completely agree with The American Film Institutes' choice of "Over the Rainbow", as the greatest movie song ever. The Record Industry Association of America (RIAA), voted it: Song of the Century. A very famous, beloved and charming song, indeed. The film deserved to be nominated for Academy Awards for Best Director, Best Makeup (if the category existed at that time) and Best Costume Design.Victor Fleming was already nominated for Best Director for "Gone With the Wind" of the same year. Actually, Fleming had much more to do directing "The Wizard of Oz", than "Gone With the Wind", where he was one of four directors. Fleming directed all of the Oz sequences in "The Wizard of Oz", which is most of the film. Art direction, cinematography, sound and visual effects are all excellent. The famous tornado scene, was done long before computer graphics were possible, and yet, looks great. The famous transition from sepia toned black and white to Technicolor, was a movie first and one of the many inspired imaginative decisions made for the film.There's a lot to admire and be charmed by, in the film. The story is timeless because it's universal: the importance of home, discovering oneself, intelligence, heart and courage. The film contains a number of famous and memorable quotes, the most famous being: "We're not in Kansas anymore". "I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too" is a favorite line of mine from the film. The ending of the film has three memorable lines: "Hearts will never be practical, until they can be made unbreakable", "A person's heart is judged not by how much they have loved, but by how much they have been loved by others" and "There's no place like home".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who hasn't seen this movie? Everyone has seen this as a kid and it sticks in the deepest confines of your brain forever. My great-grandmother saw this when she was a teenager and she loved it. She showed to my grandmother, who loved it also. Then she showed it to her children and then finally me. Now, a movie that can stay timeless for four generations has to be something special. This film should be shown to every generation of children to the end of time. And even though it doesn't do the novel justice, it wouldn't matter at all. This film has a charm that touches the child in all of us and this film will never leave our hearts.Verdict: F**k Citizen Kane! This movie deserves the title of Greatest Film of All Time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magical moving picture that for me will never lose its lustre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of the people on this planet I have watched this film many times but in order to get some idea of the events leading up to its creation I looked at the trivia section on IMDb. How this film actually made it to the screen is just amazing and how it actually turns out is absolutely stunning when you read some of the problems there were in just arriving at the cast and main crew list. I find it curiously satisfying that the film turned out to be so magical. Not being in the position of knowing anyone who was around at the time the film was made I can only speculate why after all of the problems surrounding the making of this film it turned out the way it did. I choose to believe that it was down to the professional attitude of those who were involved. Maybe that is a dewy eyed attitude but the film was actually made and all the rest is other detail. I know that I was captivated by it all the way through and found the whole experience extremely pleasant. Unfortunately I did not see it as a child but I am told by some who did that their reaction was the same jaw dropping captivation as mine. I don't really look too deeply into why I liked it so much, I do not know enough about why something works, scene construction or camera angles or whatever I just know this works and I know I am not alone in liking this film. If you were looking for a description of a plot or synopsis in this review you will not find one here because there are numerous other reviewers who are infinitely more eloquent than me. For anybody watching this film for the first time please don't look for the goofs just enjoy it for what it is. It is a fantasy and one of the best if not the best ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that got me to love the wonderful Judy Garland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that got me to love the wonderful Judy Garland, and also the OZ books series by Frank L. Baum, from which the film is based on - particularly "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ". I don't have any particular scene I like, because I love this film. The movie begins when 12-year-old Dorothy was walking home from school with her dog Toto. But Toto had snuck into the yard of the irascible townswoman, Miss Almira Gulch. Then he chases her cat and bitten Miss Gluch on the leg. Dorothy was upset that Miss Gulch hit Toto over the back of the head with a rake. But the two ran all the way home unharmed. But whenever Dorothy tries to tell her aunt and uncle, as well as Hickory, Hunk and Zeke, the farmhands what happen, they are too busy to listen. Miss Gulch shows up with a sheriff's order and takes Toto away to be destroyed by euthanasia. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who is momentarily elated. When she realizes that Miss Gulch will soon return, she decides to take Toto and run away. On their journey, Dorothy encounters a fortune teller named Professor Marvel. He is a kind and lovable man who guesses that Dorothy is running away and feels unappreciated at home and he tricks her into believing Aunt Em is ill, so that she will return home. As Dorothy leaves, there begin to appear signs of an oncoming storm. She rushes back to the farm's house just ahead of a sudden tornado. There, she takes shelter inside the house, where she is knocked unconscious by a loose window frame. Then Dorothy dreams that she, her dog Toto and the farmhouse are transported to the magical Land of Oz. There, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda, advises Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and meet the Wizard of Oz, who can return her to Kansas. During her journey, she meets a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, who join her, hoping to receive what they lack themselves (a brain, a heart and courage). All of this is done while also trying to avoid the Wicked Witch of the West and her attempt to get the ruby slippers from Dorothy, who received them from Glinda. The slippers of course originally belong to The Wicked Witch of The East who is squashed by Dorothy's house. I love 4 out of all the songs from the film, which are: "Over the Rainbow," "Ding, Dong," "If I Only Had a Brain," and... "The Merry Old Land of Oz." And I always like when the Cowardly Lion goes "Ruff!" So overall, I would say this film is an excellent film for young and old alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BeatlesFan3287 Reviews "The Wizard Of Oz"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As incredible as it might seem, phrases like, "Where not in Kansas anymore", and "I'll get you my pretty...and your little dog too!" were completely unknown 70 years ago. "The Wizard Of Oz" set more standards in the industry than just about any other film. If not for this film, "Dorothy", "Toto", and "The Cowardly Lion" would not be house-hold names. If it had never been released, the song, "Over The Rainbow" would never had been heard and it certainly wouldn't be one of the most celebrated songs of all time. Had this film not been released, fantasy as a film genre and even film in general would have turned out very different.Judy Garland, in her trademark role, plays Dorothy Gale: a young girl who longs to leave her bleak country life in Kansas for a place that lies "over the rainbow". As we all know, Kansas was filmed in sepia tone where as Oz was in Technicolor. This was very experimental at the time and set a stark contrast between the two settings. To this day, film has seen nothing else quite like Oz. An amazing land of colorful flowers and plants, lofty mountains, and cities of emerald. Even more incredible than the land is the people who inhabit it. The diminutive munchkins, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion, and the wizard himself are just some of the many characters who the public has come to know and love. But even as Dorothy befriends most of them, she comes to realize, is the land of Oz really a substitute for her family back in Kansas? The acting is superb as each actor completely embodies the character he or she plays. Even more so than the acting, the visuals are what has made this film a classic. Every so often you get beautiful shots of Oz and its terrain, which is amazing considering the movie takes place entirely on an indoor set. The CGI of today rarely catches the magnificence of what was done by the set-designers of this production. All of this gives the film a much more organic feel than the often artificial films of today.Many people will point to this film, rather than Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane, as the defining movie of the Golden Age of Hollywood. And indeed, this film is just as golden as the yellow brick road Dorothy follows to reach her goals. This is a flawless piece of cinema that has set the standard for all fantasy films that have come after it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What else can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the few films that just about everyone I've ever known has seen. So much has been said about it before that there's almost nothing left to say. Having said that, what else can I say than that "The Wizard of Oz," is perfect? This classic seems to endure from age to age, generation to generation. So what is it about this film that works so well? The plot is ridiculous beyond all reason, but that's not the point. There's something about the film that makes me cry at the end every time. This is the film that teaches us to believe in who we already are, that "There's no place like home." There's also themes of the power of friendship, courage, etc. Combined with "Over the Rainbow," "The Yellow Brick Road," and more of the best original movie songs ever written, everything about this film works. It's humorous ("Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain"), touching, entertaining, and 100% engaging. In my opinion, probably the best film of 1939, maybe even slightly better than "Gone With the Wind." If you're one of the handful who hasn't seen this film, you've truly missed out. It's not just a classic; it's an American past time. Absolutely perfect.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Fleming's Wizard of Oz has withstood the test of time over almost 70 years as one of the most beloved family movies of all time. I personally feel it deserves its acclaim. In The Princess Bride (1987, Rob Reiner), the grandfather (Peter Falk) narrating the story to a young Fred Savage, tries to point out the story's high points saying that it has "Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles... ". In a similar vein, I would try to sell you on the benefits of The Wizard of Oz by saying it has witches, magic, monsters, tornadoes, noble quests, friendship, heroes, a fantasy world and humor. In short, it has a bit of everything.Almost certainly a large part of my admiration for this film comes from nostalgia. But there are several aspects of it that I like. I enjoy the contrast between the black and white of Kansas to the color in the Land of Oz. I like the musical numbers. I like the performances by all the actors, and I like the camera work. I like the special effects, some of which still look fairly impressive today (for instance, Glinda's arrival in a bubble, the witch leaving her castle on her broomstick, the sky writing, the horse of a different color, and I could go on...).I just watched this again with my nine year old daughter, and I am pleased to see that its magic has been passed to yet another generation. I am taken by the pure escapism that this movie offers-a wonderful way to daydream away from our daily problems. And with the Great Depression still going on (though just about to end) at the time of its release, I wonder if this escape from the stress of real life was even more of a reason for its popularity at the time.All I know is that I enjoy it immensely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved this film when I was younger, and still do. It's not even in my top-20 list, but it's still a film that zips along in pace. It has some horrifying moments for very young viewers, so steer clear of those road bumps, but the acting is all grand, the visual effects are just as captivating, and the story as a whole is one for the ages.Overall, while there may be some high expectations from some, they're all met. From the memorable music, to the great scenery and images, The Wizard of Oz is well-worth the time and money to view. Great escapism, and a nice little message to go along with it.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dorothy, the Small and Meek.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stark and bloody tragedy in which a young girl is whisked into a surreal landscape, kills the first person she meets, then teams up with three strangers to kill again.Actually, a beautiful fantasy, unimpeachably realized. Dorothy is knocked out and dreams she is transported to the Land of Oz, where only the Wizard of the Emerald City can send her and her dog, Toto, back to her home in Kansas. Along the way, she picks up three companions who hope that their defects can be corrected by the Wizard. Ray Bolger is the Scarecrow, Jack Haley is the Tin Man, and Bert Lahr the Cowardly Lion. They are all hated and opposed by the Wicked Witch of the East, Margaret Hamilton. It ends happily.Just a few comments. One is that the three companions are kind of interesting. The Scarecrow and the Tin Man are flawed in some way -- one needs brains and the other needs a heart -- but they illustrate a gentleman's model of interaction. "Oh, thank you very much." And, "I wouldn't want to be a burden." And, in truth, the Scarecrow doesn't seem so dumb. Look at the way he tricks the talking trees into giving up their apples. And the Tin Man shows no signs whatever of having no heart, except that his chest doesn't tick. They're charming without being particularly funny. But the Cowardly Lion is a different matter. He speaks for Everyman. Lahr is outrageously hammy. He has a working-class New York accent. He brags and threatens and he's a complete hypocrite, which the others definitely are not. He's given the best lines and songs too. "What makes the Hottentot so hot? Whadda they got that I ain't got?" (Steatopygeia, the Hottentot apron, and a language that doesn't seem designed for human speech organs, among other things.) He's our man in Oz alright.Dorothy, of course, is the central figure, and Judy Garland plays her splendidly -- weak and winsome, with huge watery brown eyes. And what a voice! She's a small girl but she seems to sing from her abdomen. She's just about right, cute but not the sort of "cute" that rouses the pedophile in a normal man. She has high hips, rather shapeless limbs, and no neck to speak of. Later in life, strung out behind leapers and sleepers with a booze backer, she became an idol of the gay subculture. They loved her in her middle age. Every performance raised the question of whether she would finish the show or collapse on the stage.Another thing that strikes me. As in some other films, and speaking as a one-time day laborer who showed up in the line on Warren Street in New York, who does the work around here? In the Emerald City, everybody wears bright green costumes. Who presses them all? And then there's that "horse of a different color." Who cleans up after that horse? The songs by Harold Arlen and Yip Harberg are just fine, and the incidental music was heavily influenced by Russian composers. The wardrobe is outrageous.The four of the principals, or five, counting Toto, go through so many adventures and tribulations that when the end comes and it's time for Dorothy to leave, even the most sophisticated and mature among us must weep abjectly, like a child. Maybe Dorothy should have stayed in Oz, married the Scarecrow, served as First Lady and run the place instead of leaving behind a rather shaky political structure. Queen Dorothy. After all, things weren't so smashing back in Kansas. Aunt Em was a pretty cold fish, her husband was emasculated, and the three laborers treated her as a nincompoop. It might have been good to be the Queen.Here's a final thing that struck me. I must have watched this thing a dozen times or more, usually with my kid. I just finished seeing it again for the first time in ten years or so, and this time on an HD TV on an HD channel with Dolby 5.1 sound. The difference was remarkable. I had never been able to see, for instance, that the Tin Man is blotched with small rust patches all over, until he's buffed bright and shiny in the Emerald City. And every stitch of the Scarecrow is visible.This is one you can't really miss. Your cultural literacy depends upon it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How special effects can have an effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is a timeless film filled with adventure, life lessons, and special effects. A young Kansas farm girl dreams of a place where she can go with her dog rid of all problems and daily worries. She ends up finding her euphoria but runs into a bushel of trouble in doing so. "The Wizard of Oz" is a cinema marvel packed with action, special effects, and even flying monkeys. Once the film hit the television "The Wizard of Oz" became a cultural phenomenon, due to its immense amount of special effects, in which the whole family will enjoy and is a must see movie.The movie starts in a black and white color in a small, Kansas farming community. The film is shot in a production large studio. The backgrounds are very detailed but you can decipher they are not real. Dorothy lives a simple life with her tiny dog Toto who has a knack for getting into trouble with the neighbors. One day Toto stirs up trouble with one of the neighbors and Dorothy decides to run away because she thinks the mean neighbor will hurt her precious dog. Dorothy encounters a professor who is a fake fortune teller. Dorothy ends up telling him she ran away and he convinces her her aunt is sick and dying and she must return home at once. There is a terrible cyclone on the way home. Dorothy's house is picked up by the storm and carried off into the sky. This is the first major special effect featured in this film. The house appears to be spinning around inside of the cyclone. Dorothy is looking out at the window at all of the objects being thrown around by the cyclone including her mean neighbor.Dorothy's house lands in the wonderful land of Oz. Oz if full of vibrant color and still being filmed in an elaborate production studio with immense detail and many props to enhance the atmosphere. Dorothy's house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. An interesting special effect appears at this point in the movie. A good witch, named Glenda, appears to be in a tiny bubble which is getting larger and larger as she approaches Dorothy. Glenda tells Dorothy she killed the Witch of the East. Suddenly in a puff of red billowing smoke the Wicked Witch of the West appears. She threatens Dorothy and then disappears with another poof of thick red smoke. Dorothy then begins her journey on the yellow brick road to the Emerald city to talk to the Wizard of Oz. After being thanked by the munchkins, tiny people who inhabit Munchkinland she is on her way.Along the yellow brick road Dorothy and Toto encounter many new friends as well as her newfound enemies. She first meets a scarecrow with no brain. The scarecrow appears to be stuffed with straw and his face looks like cloth. Next, she meets a tin man with no heart. The tin man is stuck in place and cannot move unless he is oiled thoroughly. The tin man's face seems to be meshed perfectly to his rusted tin can body. Finally, she meets a cowardly lion who has no courage. The lion has a large tail which you can tell is being held up to a thin string. These four characters embark through a plagued forest filled with angry monster apple trees whom come to life when they are disturbed. They also encounter a deadly poppy field which is a trap set by the Witch of the West. Once they get to the Emerald city they talk to the Wizard of Oz. The Wizard appears to be a huge silhouette head against the backdrop of a wall with billowing fire and smoke. There are also flickering lights to enhance the spookiness of the wizard. This is all actually done by a man who is behind a curtain, which is found out later in the movie.The group of characters has to reach the Witch's castle high atop a steep pathway. The Witch looks into her crystal ball and sees them coming and sends her blue, flying monkeys to get Dorothy and Toto. The monkeys carry them off to the castle into the night sky. Dorothy ends up killing the Witch by melting her with water. The Witch appears to melt into thin air with a cloud of smoke coming off of her as her black gown crumples to the ground. Glenda appears again after another meeting with the Wizard and tells Dorothy she can go back home because all she has to do is find her heart's desire. Dorothy taps her heals together and says "there's no place like home" and she is transported back to the black and white Kansas. All along Dorothy's experience was just a dream.Through special effects "The Wizard of Oz" makes a story of adventure seem mythical and euphoric. From flying monkeys to melting witches, The Wizard of Oz is a special movie enhanced by its visual stimuli and special effects. This classic film shows how the tiniest of special effects such as smoke can entangle the viewer into believing this inherently untrue story is actually real.</fullReview>

Now all of the movies are just plain boring and dry. This is a great movie for nearly all ages, but the witch may scare those under 3. When it's on TV, I always try to catch it, but if I miss it, I have the DVD anyway. It doesn't follow the book very closely, but is nevertheless a classic. This movie has a special place in nearly everyone's heart forever. People who don't like it don't know what they're missing. The Wizard of Oz will remain loved for as long as the world turns, not just because it's entertaining, but because it teaches us so much. If you haven't seen it, which is doubtful, go out and rent it now.</fullReview>

It has a nice way of combining the reality along with the fantasy. sometimes it almost seems it could be real.I recommend this movie to anyone with children of course but definitely adults. If you have a bad day then watch it and go somewhere over the rainbow and enjoy it!! It melts all your troubles and help you forget the day to day grind.

		<fullReview>This is my favorite childhood movie because it is so cheerful and funny at the same time. Dorothy runs away from home because the witch wants to take Toto away. Well, then she gets swept away over the rainbow to a land of enchantment and all she wants to do is go back to her Kansas home.I could see why so many people love this movie. It was made during the great depression of the 1930's and it probably cheered up a lot of people for a short time. They could also probably relate to Dorothy because she lived on a farm during the dust bowl. I didn't exist during the 1930's but this movie made me happy.This movie was an inspiration for a lot of movies such as "Labyrinth." The girl in Labyrinth gets send away and meets up with characters and wants to go home. So similar but Wizard of Oz is better because it is the original.I loved it and wish sometimes I could go over the rainbow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Film That Anyone Could Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSOkay, okay, in my last comment I said I'd only be commenting on Holiday films, but apparently I was wrong. I'm commenting on Wizard of Oz, a magical film. First of all let me get this straightened out. There is no hung Munchkin. There is none! It is a crane. Anyway, this is a fantastic film that anyone with their family could enjoy. Also, the special effects are amazing in this film. It makes you think. When I first saw this film, I wondered that this was really made in 1939. The colors were too vivid. It sort of looked modern-day when I first saw it.A young girl named Dorothy is whisked away in a tornado with her dog. The house that she was in crushed a witch. The witch was wearing ruby slippers. The witch's sister comes and is upset. Then the ruby slippers go on Dorothy's feet. The witch seeks revenge. Dorothy is told to follow the yellow brick road to go to the Wizard's house to get back home. On the way she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. They tag along. They get to the Wizard's house and he tells them to kill the Witch and get her broom. They go to the Witch's house and are captured. Dorothy is put into a room with a hourglass. Aparrently that's how long she has to live. The Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Cowardly Lion rescue her. Then Dorothy kills the Witch by splashing her with water. Dorothy gets back home with the ruby slippers. It was actually all a dream, or was it?Overall, this is a fantastic, magical film that, like I said, the whole entire family would enjoy. But I warn you, the first hour may be very happy, but the last hour is surprisingly dark. The flying monkeys are, in my opinion, very creepy. The tone and mood of the film go very dark. But it's a great family film, but do not expect all happy and cheery situations involving no creepy little flying monkey guys.9/10Recommended Films: Return to Oz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to pinpoint exactly why this is such a good movie. I loved it when I was a kid- and I can't say exactly why it was so good back then either. And yet I can't deny the fact that it's a great movie.The story sounds ludicrous if slightly charming- Dorothy, a young farm girl, gets caught in a tornado with her dog Toto and, when the storm finally sets her house down, finds herself in the magical land of Oz where she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, all of whom look strangely like the farmhands that work with her aunt and uncle. Dorothy is sent on a journey down the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City to find the Wizard of Oz whom she is led to believe will help her get back to Kansas.Apparently, L. Frank Baum intended it as an allegory to the politics of the time, but I can't see why anyone would care about that when the movie stands on its own two legs just fine. I think the main reason it works so well is that there is never a feeling of ridiculousness throughout the entire movie. Oz is strange, but it's meant to be strange; it never feels completely unrealistic though. I think this has something to do with the contrast provided by the Technicolor applied to the film when Dorothy is Oz and the sepia look when Dorothy is in Kansas. Oz is a different world, but not an entirely unreal world. Our dreams may be larger than life, but there is always something very real about them.Maybe that's the special allure this movie always has for me. Oz is real in this movie. There's never a sure explanation of Oz as Dorothy's dream, but there might as well be. And when I dream, I want to escape into that world because sometimes it's more exciting and better. Dorothy's world is drab, and Oz helps her to see the good in it- the color in it.Metaphors aside, The Wizard of Oz is a fun movie. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of the best songs ever recorded, and many of the other songs in the movie are memorable. Judy Garland is obviously not an amazing actor, but her na?vet makes her performance very true and it's near impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.It may be hard for me to establish exactly why The Wizard of Oz has remained such a classic, but there's no difficulty in saying that it is truly a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was 4 or 5. I liked it then except the flying monkeys. I would have shot those things. It is a movie for the young at heart and I love watching it now. I'm 20 now and I have such good memories of watching it when I was a child. To anyone who hasn't seen it, I hope you enjoy this wonderful movie. Judy Garland had such a stunning voice and I love to hear her sing the songs that she sings in the movie. Her daughter also has a good singing voice. There just isn't any other singers who sound quite as beautiful singing as Judy did. When I have a family of my own I will show this movie to them and tell them how I loved it when I was a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is probably one of the five most popular movies ever, along with "Gone with the wind", "Casablanca", etc. It was a technical revolution (one of the first color movies) and everyone agrees that it's sickly sweet and sentimental and that there is not a character more affected than Dorothy Gale... Whatever, the colours, all those mythical scenes, "Over the rainbow"... It's a classic and that's that! I don't like musicals, I've never understood those movies in which the characters begin to sing with no reason, but "Wizard of Oz" is an exception, as well as "Willy Wonka" or "The Rocky Horror Picture ShoW"WE'RE Going' TO SEE THE WIZARD!!!PD: Can anyone tell me which one was the very first color movie??+My rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had almost as much advance publicity from MGM as GONE WITH THE WIND. Long run, it has become more &amp; more of a classic. This is a film with a great script &amp; a cast that is at their peak of skills. Judy Garland is the heart &amp; soul of this movie, &amp; never got back to the heights of this performance throughout the rest of her career. Only "Meet Me In St. Louis" approaches it. The support she gets from the rest of the cast, Frank Morgan who is at his best, Ray Bolger, etc. is outstanding. This film has more quotes than any other film. Yet, it is still considered a children's fantasy film &amp; is a film which viewers either love or hate for some reason. Margaret Hamilton made her entire career out of being a witch in this film.Let's not forget the music from this film which is nothing short of amazing. One song from this film, DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD was made into a top forty song in the 1960's, many years after the film was made. While this film did little in theaters when it was released, it became an American icon on TV.AS I write this, though, I sum up my comments on how the heart of this film has touched folks by using a quote from this movie from the Wizard himself, when the Wizard awards the Tin Man with his heart. Take this quote, &amp; view this film, &amp; you will wonder why it is not quoted more often as it is the most over-looked quote I have ever found from any movie. "Remember my sentimental friend, a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others." To me, this says it all about this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when my grandmother bought me the 50th anniversary addition of when i was too young to recall my own age. I grew up watching this film on an almost daily basis until i was at least 10 years old. i never got tired of it and i always found it inspiring to a boy who needed to be inspired like me at that time. this films magical portrayal of the inner child in all of us brought out of the best in me at that time. knowing full well how your friends can make a difference for you. and not to mention that most this film has a message for more than just children...but for the young in heart in all of us. In the opinion of most no film has yet to capture the imagination like this film, and no film has yet to exceed the wonderful affect this film and most of all the story itself have had on people for the last century. From the moment it hit the screen it took a while to sink in to the public imagination... and it took a while to sink into my imagination the messages this movie held so dear. Well I hold this film dear to me for it has helped so many children find at least a small sense of that incredible adventure we all seek at that age. if you haven't seen this movie I recommend you do. As this film has done since its release it has captured imagination... of both the young and . so take the time and sit down to watch it. you may find that your still young in heart even if your not young.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would ever think of a fantasy that would leave an impression that would last for a lifetime? Well, Victor Fleming made "The Wizard of Oz" with a cast that would make a successful movie happen. Judy Garland as the ever impressionable Dorothy Gale really makes it sparkle with her sly wit and sultry voice. And that footwork with those ruby slippers, very graceful. Ray Bolger, another great dancer. Looks great as the goofy Hunk, and his role as The Scarecrow. Man that takes a lot of talent I really like that. Jack Haley, really good play both Hickory and The Tin Woodsman he had a lot of guts to help the others in distress despite having no heart. Bert Lahr as Zeke and The Cowardly Lion now that's a riot! "Put 'em Up!" Put 'Em Up!" Why he's supposed to be the "King of the Jungle" now he's The "Chicken of the Jungle". Pure encouragement is what each one needed. The bronze screen beginning is really cool, who needed that black &amp; white format? And the character that really made my blood boil is that dirty old Miss Gulch(Margaret Hamliton). She was bad to the county, and Dorothy was right, she is nothing but a mean old witch! Especially when Dorothy was in that tornado and saw everyone she knew. She killed the Wicked Witch of the East with the house, the Munchkins thank her. She used water on The one of the West, the guards thanked her. I guess Oz owed her a debt of gratitude, I guess she is welcomed to Oz at anytime! This movie is a surefire classic, and it is great for the whole family. Which in fact it really is! Rating 5 stars!

		<fullReview>It may be pointless to try to add to comments on one of those rare films that transcends virtually all others. I've been told that the audiences gasped when Dorothy walks out of the house and everything is in color. It is a transition to a magic place, made possible by cinematography. Growing up, we got one chance a year to see this. It became the highlight of an evening. It was usually on a Sunday night. The individual characterizations and incredible songs are the stuff that dreams are made of. I'm especially fond of Jack Haley's Tin Man. When he sings his song and then pounds his chest, finally releasing steam from his hat (a funnel) it's amazing. Those flying monkeys haunted me for years. Someone had a nightmare some time before dreaming those guys up. The amazing thing is that there is hardly a person who couldn't sit down and run through the plot of this. Some of my friends who grew up with kind of a harsh view of life, have no problem watching this. if you've been on Mars for the last 55 years, I hope one of your first tasks upon return to earth is to watch this movie.</fullReview>

The book was found by relatives go through his belongings following his death.To think, Shirley Temple couldn't get out of her contract to go to MGM. As a result, we got Judy as Dorothy. What a voice! Singing Over the Rainbow, naturally, the best song of the year.To think, that Buddy Ebsen was allergic to his costume and had to bow out of the project.To think, Gale Sondergaard, having won an Oscar 3 years before, thought that the wicked witch part was beneath. Thanks Ms. Sondergaard. You made the biggest mistake of your illustrious career. As a result, we got Margaret Hamilton and the rest is history.To think that W.C. Fields and Mae West were first considered for the roles of the Wizard and Glinda. What comedy we would have had, but much less of a movie as a result.The film is super outstanding. It is primarily for children but adults can certainly learn regarding the human frailties.Poor Dorothy, caught in that Kansas tornado with Toto too! Injured, she falls into a memorable dream and is transported to the land of Oz, filled with adventure and memories to last for a lifetime.A film to challenge our hearts and dare to dream your dreams that will come true. Some day I'll wish upon a star and wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Isn't it great to escape into a world of fantasy? Trouble should only melt like lemon drops upon all, not only chimney tops. Why can't I fly beyond the rainbow? See the film and get caught up in those magical moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golden Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people speak of Hollywood's Golden Age, I think they're referring to Casablanca, the Wizard of Oz, and Citizen Kane. These films are timeless, classic, and all-around wonderful. They will never grow old and they will never go away. The Wizard of Oz has been a part of my life for such a long time that, truly, I cannot think of a time in which I was unaware of it. When I was three, I saw my sister become the Wicked Witch of the West in a high school production. I shall never forget her disappearing act. In a puff of smoke, my sister was gone, and I was dismayed. I saw the movie a short time thereafter, in its annual televised appearance on network television, and I've never shaken the feeling of that film. I think, when I see The Wizard of Oz, I see it perennially through the eyes of a four- or five-year old. Any cynicism and experience drops away as soon as I see Dorothy crouch upon the dusty road with Toto. It's transporting. That's to say nothing of the magnificent moment when Dorothy sets foot into Oz. I've watched that moment a thousand times and it still astounds. From sepia to transcendent color--it's such a shock; I cannot imagine what audiences thought in 1939. Apparently, they thought very little of it, as the film did poorly during its initial run. It wasn't, I believe, until the mid-1950s that The Wizard of Oz grabbed hold of the national psyche. Has it ever let go? I can't be sure, but references to it are ineluctable. It has so infiltrated our society that anyone's likely to know the tale whether or not they've seen the movie or read the books. In that regard, it's so unlike almost any other object our culture has produced and certainly any movie. It's in the same pantheon as Huckleberry Finn, Bob Dylan, and baseball. It's, in a manner of speaking, America. That's my take on it, in any event.It's also great spectacle and great entertainment. Not only does it contain memorable performances, it also contains memorable music. The Wizard of Oz represents one of the only films of which I can think that is a musical without quite fitting that category entirely. The songs grow organically out of the picture, unlike, say, another great movie, Singing in the Rain--it's more akin to the early Disney films where music and film were entwined inseparably--or maybe it's like The Red Shoes where music/dance exists symbiotically with narrative. In any event, it's a major achievement and one that I hardly noticed for years. To The Wizard of Oz's credit, I never once thought of it as a musical until I was into my 20s. Moreover, unlike the children's movies of today, there is no fear of inducing fear. The Wicked Witch is frightening, Glinda seemingly impotent, and the flying monkeys crepuscular. Oz is fantastic, but look into the background forests and see some gloom. Look at the plastic flowers in munchkinland, and tell me they're not eerie. The movie is bright and colorful, but with a hint of mischief and melancholy. I would not be surprised to learn that this film stands as a major influence over the work of Tim Burton. His melancholy fairy-tales are far more blatant but nevertheless find source material here. The Wizard of Oz is, quite simply, one of the major works of cinema, American or otherwise. It's great for children and wonderful for adults. I believe, if you do not like this movie you have a heart of stone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Children's Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago I recall queuing around the block to see the first release of The Wizard of Oz. An experience that is not easily forgotten. It remains for me the best children's film ever made, thanks to Victor Fleming and his marvelous cast. Considering the technology of the cinema back in 1939, it was truly remarkable in many of its effects. There are some magical moments, Judy Garland's heart felt singing of "Over the Rainbow" (never equaled by others), and the early monochrome scenes in Kansas with the approaching tornado, the first view of Oz in colour, the Witches feet rolling up under the house, the walk through the enchanted forest and the field of poppies, the initial meetings with the Scarecrow, Tinman, and the Wizard, the Bad Witch melting under the water, and the farewell to Oz. Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch, remains one of the screens most frightening characters. Perhaps the Munchkins are allowed too much screen time, but once Dorothy starts her journey along the yellow brick road, and meets her strange companions, it's a joy to behold. A film that both enchanted and frightened me at a very early age, as indeed did Walt Disney's "Snow White" a couple of years earlier. Perhaps many future generations of children will find the thrill of Oz still alive and well in this remarkable production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite whiz of a wiz....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily one of the top films of all time, this infectiously charming and meticulously crafted musical has become legendary and runs deep in the blood of anyone who saw it as a child and revisits it as an adult. Garland plays a rather restless Kansas farm girl living with her aunt and uncle and pouring her feelings out to her beloved dog Toto. The local crankpot is bound and determined to send Toto away to be destroyed for such grievous crimes as chasing her cat and running through her garden (and also snipping at her decidedly untasty leg!) Just as Garland realizes that she has to face up to her challenges and responsibilities (after briefly running away) a tornado hits and she is konked on the head. She awakens to an entirely different world (called Oz) in which great beauty is tempered by even greater evil. She finds herself at odds with the Wicked Witch of the West (Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to destroy her (and her little dog, too!) while she desperately tries to reach the title character whom she hopes will get her back to Kansas. Along the way to the Wizard of Oz, she is joined by a trio of equally needy friends. The Scarecrow requires brains, the Tin Man wants a heart and the Cowardly Lion longs for courage. Together, they brave the Witch's scare tactics and set out to achieve their personal goals. It turns out that the foursome always had the things they desired, they just never really realized it. This is a rather clinical deconstruction of what is a magical and psychologically affecting tale. The story works on many levels and contains endless parallels (driven home by the fact that many of the people in Garlands home life appear as the characters in Oz.) It's observation of human desires and needs could be dissected for hours. Beyond that, the entire film is jaw-droppingly beautiful (even the "drab" opening and closing sequences shot in a sepia tone.) With expert talent involved in the production (Cedric Gibbons, Adrian anyone?), it's an eye-popper throughout and an aural delight as well. The songs (with peerless tongue-twisting lyrics) approach Gilbert &amp; Sullivan greatness at times with Garland's unforgettable rendition of "Over the Rainbow" just one of many gems. All of the acting is top-notch. Garland's portrayal works because she completely buys into the story. She believes and so the audience believes. Her almost unfailing optimism gains greater irony when compared with her own troubled life. Bolger, Haley and Lahr forge an iconic, thoroughly enjoyable trio, each getting the chance to show off his considerable comedic and musical talent. Morgan plays virtually everyone of note in Oz and gives great presence to each characterization. Toto is one of the true great screen canines. It's impossible not to root for him as he scampers across rough terrain to find help for his owner. The real blood-curdler here, however, is Hamilton. She crafts a character so vile, so menacing and so relentlessly evil that it's hard to ponder anyone else in the role. Every gesture, every inflection of her voice seems calculated to drive kids under the covers (and has....for generations.) Someone bitter or bored, with no sense of awe, may find ways to pick at the story or the technical aspects of a film that's more than 60 years old, but most everyone will be enchanted by (and moved by) this one of a kind piece of film history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first of all, I never did like Glenda, not even when i was a child of the American Suburbs. She wasn't as unsettling as the Wicked Witch of the West, but she wasn't someone who I would have warmed up to. And I remember feeling angry, resentful of her when she said to Dorothy, after she had been attacked by flying monkeys, gone through the haunted forest, been kidnapped, had her life threatened, and her friends tortured, that she "could have gotten home anytime she had wanted to" by clicking her heels. Dorothy should have stepped up and knocked her across the jaw. Boom! bitch goes down.And whatever happened to the flying monkeys now that the Wicked Witch of the West isn't around to control them? I imagine Oz is plagued by gangs of lawless, evil primates, doing daring hit and run attacks on markets and farms throughout the country.The Wizard is gone, the Wicked witches are gone, and now there is only Glenda to rule over Oz. She knew that Dorothy was a threat right away, seeing how she killed the Wicked Witch of the East right off the bat. Glenda got her to take care of the WWW and the Wizard, leaving Glenda unopposed, allowing her to rule Oz with a benevolent fist.so I guess I see the Oz of today being ruled by a flying monkey prince and Glenda, the benevolent dictator. A sad, sad outcome to such a happy land.</fullReview>

But you like it because you have been successfully brainwashed. Some say the acting of the bad witch was the only thing that possessed some quality, but I thought she was merely failing to act. Interesting phenomenon this cult movie propelling "Oz" into Technicolor. It's very disappointing. Very bad for children. Forgettable for grown-ups. An unsuccessful attempt at defining anything.

		<fullReview>THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of my favorite films of all time and I will make this a short review.The plot follows the book very nicely and this movie is known for it's use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, amazing songs and unusual characters, but over the years it has become one of the best known of all films and part of American popular culture.The film also featured what may be the most elaborate use of character make-up effects and special effects in a film up to that time.This was MGM's most expense production up to that time, having a budget of just $2 million dollars and earned only $3 million dollars, but due to re-releases, the film has grossed a lot more and has also been showed on TV, as well including Cartoon Network, TCM, TBS and TNT.The story is just wonderful and the 1939 film, follows the book nicely and it was really amazing to see and the song "Over the Rainbow" won an Oscar for best original song and was ranked first in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs list.The performances in this film are great. The late actors, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Terry the Dog as Toto, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, Charley Grapewin, Clara Blandick, the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins and Pat Walshe as the leader of the flying monkey and those performances are really fantastic in this film.The film is also named the most viewed motion picture All Time in various critics and popular polls including IMDb's Top 250 List and is the source of many memorable quotes referenced today in modern popular culture.It was directed by the late Victor Fleming, who also directed Gone With the Wind and the screenplay was written by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf. The lyrics were written by E.Y. Harburg and music were composed by Harold Arlen.The make-up and visual effects are really amazing, but they are just cool and is fantastic, but really spectacular. The characters are all true to the way they are written in the book. My favorite characters in the film are The Scarecrow, The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion, The Wicked Witch of the West, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North and The Flying Monkeys. I also love Dorothy and Toto.The way the movie is shot was just amazing and I have no problem with the film's cinematography because to me, this movie does not feel like it ages at all.Overall, I love THE WIZARD OF OZ. It is earned a right to be called "a classic". The film gets a 10 out of 10 and it really deserves to get that from me because I have no problem re-watching this one again also.This is one movie that really deserves to be remade and I would love a chance to direct a remake, or at least write the script and play the Scarecrow because he is a cool character. My version would be a 2 hour and 10 minute movie of the 1939 film and I would love a chance to remake it.</fullReview>

Sometimes you watch a movie and you may forget about the characters, or different scenes but not this one. This film also became a musical on Broadway, that's how beloved it was. We forget about the little songs we learned growing up like," We're off to see the Wizard the wonderful Wizard of OZ". The film was so colorful from the background to the characters, the only thing that was dark was the witch and wizard. The lion, the tin man,the straw man, Toto, and Judy Garland as Dorothy from themselves walking on the yellow brick road to see the wizard.The imagery was absolutely magnificent, and you can't forget about the effect of the house spinning and lifting off the ground.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorites. Why? Because it's quite impressive and still fresh as a daisy nearly 70 years later and if that doesn't speak volumes, I don't know what will. Of course it's about Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto getting whisked away to a magical land called Oz. In Oz she meets up with colorful characters like the Tin man, The Lion, Scarecrow and several different types of witches. The characters are so vivid and the land is so charmingly created it's impossible to think of how they would have made this at the time. The songs are wonderful and it doesn't even seem like a musical because everything makes sense and blends together so darned well. This is a must see for anyone of any age, it's really a magical beautiful treat!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superlative fantasy film for young and old alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I managed to live almost twenty-nine years of my life without seeing this universally beloved film, believed to be the most-watched film in history. Then I finally did see it and it was like taking a step back into childhood.Looking at the cast I think to myself that no-one delivered a performance that could truly be called Oscar-worthy and, yet, replace any one of the actors and it just wouldn't be the same. Simply put, these people were perfect for their respective parts and played them with relish.The film's look is exceptional. The land of Oz brought to life in glorious Technicolor is a sight to behold. The transition from sepia tone to color and back again was a nice touch, too. Sure, some of the effects work is decidedly rudimentary but to me that only adds to the charm. Of course, there's also the music to consider. The score deservedly won one of the film's two Oscars and the legendary song "Over the Rainbow" garnered the other.However, the thing that really seals the deal for this film is the story. Not only is it entertaining, it also has immense meaning to both young and old. Isn't there a part of all of us that longs for the security of home? Don't we all doubt our own courage, intellect and compassion from time to time? Of course; that's why the film speaks to us on such an emotional level.If you've avoided this film because you thought that it was nothing more than a kiddie movie then I urge you to reconsider. Don't miss out on one of the finest films ever to come out of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After almost 70 years, still the most vivid and colorful film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And knowing a little more about film, and about quality, I have to say, it truly is an unforgettable movie. I will start with it's visual styles. To this day, I have never seen a more colorful film in my life. To think that it was the year 1939, wow. The costume designs were so amazing. It had to use a lot, and the were so original and beautiful. The make-up done on the Wicked Witch, and a bunch of other creatures and being, just pure genius. Also, this is a film that when it ends, it leaves you in 'awe'. Like not really wanting it to end. It leaves you feeling for everybody.It's lesson is so simple, but I always forget it, along with others. Our families DO hold us together. It's storytelling is so pure and bewitching. The effects done on the twister are great. Every scene holds a visually stunning work of art. Great cinematography. And what really makes this film, it's amazing characters. Sure to stay with more generations to come. Definitely has to have a soft spot on everybody's list. How could it not?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Essence of Decency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Easily, the sweetest, most charming, and most thoroughly optimistically American movie you will ever see, The Wizard of Oz stands as a testament to the creativity and decency that was Hollywood seventy years ago. The film version of the Baum novel captures the best of what we are as a people and as a species. I can find no flaw in the film.My suggestion for you--if you haven't seen TWOZ in awhile--is to grab a restored copy from the late '90s. But if you have an old tape from CBS, pop it in anyway. When the news blares that the price of a barrel of oil is topping $100+ or the body of a baby was found in a dumpster or some other ghastly event, big or small, chills you to the core, watch Dorothy and her thoroughly human compadres go on their quest to find what they already had in the first place.Take heart. There really is good in people.And The Wizard of Oz reveals it to you, if you have patience and faith.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily, in the 10 top movie productions!! One of the few films that the entire Family can enjoy. It didn't need any animation or the overkill of today's special effects to be totally entertaining. And yes, no one needed to spout out those 4 letter words that in todays world are somehow mandatory for good acting &amp; film-making. And what a wonderful idea. Start the film in black &amp; white. Then, when landing in OZ, they used a most effective technique of switching to color as the house door is opened for a first peak outside. Also, credit the gifted supporting actors, whose characters played so well against each others personalities and obvious shortcomings. The simple innocence of the Dorothy character bolstered by the incredible musical talents of Judy Garland made the film an all time classic. Many of the really great films were made during the 30's &amp; 40's. And no, I didn't live during those times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz... a movie for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Wizard of Oz countless times when I was a kid. It now amazes me how a movie made in 1939 could be a kid's favorite in the 80's and now a favorite of my own kids' here in the 21st century. Even more amazing is that I normally can't stand musicals, but I loved the music in The Wizard of Oz. They seamlessly and fittingly entered into each song. There wasn't a single song about which I said, "That was awful," or "Where did that song come from?" The story was pure genius. The Wizard of Oz was one of the most creative and brilliantly done movies of all time. You can always gauge the success of a movie by how it impacts society in general and the film industry in particular. There were plays made after this movie and there were many scenes mimicked or lines often quoted in the years succeeding it. There are numerous lines from "The Wizard of Oz" that, if quoted, just about everyone would know them. Every role and every character was vital to the movie. There were no wasted characters or wasted scenes even. Each actor did a magnificent job. The acting was superb. They really brought the characters to life and added just as much vibrancy as the Technicolor. This movie is a classic. There are not enough superlatives I can use to describe "The Wizard of Oz", I cannot say enough about the excellence of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some sixty plus years after it was released (in that extraordinary year for Hollywood movies, 1939) The Wizard Of Oz is back (albeit temporarily) where it belongs, on the Big screen and digitally remastered to boot.It's sad to think that the children of today will probably scorn its simplistic message and computer sophisticates to a man laugh it 'effects' off the screen but that is their loss and the current re-release only serves to remind us how modern children have been deprived of childhood on virtually every level.The film does a nice line in irony; after kicking off with one of the most potent 'want' songs ever written, Somewhere Over The Rainbow with its built-in yearning, longing for a better world the movie then negates this with its famous epitaph 'There's no place like home'. Arlen and Harburg didn't write a song to cover this and had they attempted to do so they may have found it a tad difficult because it had already been written: Back In Your Own Backyard. All that remains is to sit back and delight in the familiar story, performances, music and recall the first time you saw it and how far away you have journeyed from the child you were in the years between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost all 6.5 billion people in the world have heard of this film. Where a young girl and her dog are transported into a fantastical, magical land of munchkins and fairies and... The Wicked Witch of The West.I am no fan of this film, but it must be said that this film is far greater than any film: even the Godfather. Why it is not #1 on the top 250 list I will never know.This motion picture is a family/fantasy/musical with a little mini-thriller for the little ones. Judy Garland plays the poor, beloved Dorothy, who just wants to make sure her dog isn't killed. In despair with her family and life around her, she leaves her family with her dog Toto and a picnic basket.But as she returns home, a whirlwind comes and transports her into the lovely land of Oz. And so the adventure begins. Accompanied by a scarecrow who wants a brain, a tinman who wants a heart, and a lion who wants courage, the four follow the yellow brick road that has been presented to them, trying to avoid the schemes of The Wicked Witch and her devious army of flying monkeys.But all hope is lost when she must take the broomstick for the Witch in order to go back home. They make a daring move to capture the Witch, an in the end, they do! The acting is done well, the music is great for kids, and the fact that it is in color 95% percent of the film shows that movie-making has been taken to the next level. Even though it is almost 70 years old, it's age doesn't show anywhere. Not even a wrinkle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange and Wonderful Musical Journey - A New Appreciation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorothy has never gone away. In a new reincarnation, the glorious 1939 musical is back, remastered to be presented in 2013 3D IMAX technology, and what could have been another gimmick turns out to be quite an enhancement. It doesn't distract from the original masterpiece because every single element remains strong, as a reminder of what it made "The Wizard" such a landmark in the cinema world, especially outstanding because 1939 was probably one of the best years in cinema.There are so many elements to like in this film, from its very simple and touching story of a quest back home. In the story a simple Kansas girl travels to the land of her dreams, only to realize home is where the heart is. During her trip, she is joined by the most amazing friends she could have. She is accompanied by a smart friend, a sensitive friend, and a friend who needs a little more confidence. In other words, with her innocence and them, we have the perfect person.The marvelous score includes "If I had only a brain, a heart... We're going to see the wizard... Follow the yellow brick road... If was king of the Forest", never faltering, hitting the wrong notes. It is a great collection of tunes that easy to love, hum, and most importantly support and advance the story. Of course, "Over The Rainbow" leads the way into the wonderful world of Oz, and the rest of the score must keep up with the high standard of the classic.Who will ever fail to appreciate the flawless performances by Garland and her supporting team: Bolger, Hamilton... Everyone is wonderful. There are the amazing special effects, which even in the grandeur of the IMAX screen are still quite remarkable for the period. This movie is by all means, a treasure, a classic, something to be loved for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Fantasy Film Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The magic that this film creates cannot be denied by the few humbugs that find it boring or only for kids. This is a film masterpiece THAT has stood the test of time. Its magic has not decreased but increased. I will not go into everything which has already been gone over. Obviously the music, the sets, Judy Garland, the rest of the cast, and everything else is something special. I grew up with this film; I waited eagerly every Easter for it to come on TV. What particularly works for me? The film has the MGM musical tradition behind it and dancers and singers in roles, but the story and creativity and diversity of the musical score attract me. Margaret Hamilton makes an outstanding witch too! The film has some remarkable scenes: the field laden with poppy flowers, the flying monkeys carrying Dorothy away, the guards ho-he-hoing at the castle, and of course Munchkintown and its citizens. Though the years have passed by rather quickly, I still have an enormous respect for this film and a great desire to still watch it for the fiftieth plus time. The Wizard of Oz is movie magic at its zenith and has enthralled young and old alike for every generation after 1939.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comment to the few absurd reviews and silly questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished reading most of the 100+ IMDb reviews of "Wizard of Oz." It is clear that the vast majority of reviewers rate this as one of the best films of all time, an evaluation I agree with. But there are a small few reviews which criticize it harshly. And some just ask simple questions. The following addresses this.SPOILER - First off, once you've seen the entire film you realize the whole visit to Oz was Dorothy's dream. During the storm a window frame blew into her bedroom and knocked her out. The house was not swept up by the tornado. When the storm passed, and everyone else came out of the storm cellar looking for Dorothy, they found her on her bed, unconscious. While she was unconscious she had the dream of going to Oz. All the strange people she met, all the strange places, were all things she imagined. It was all set up during the first 10 minutes or so, in conversations with her family members, and the fortune teller she met when she attempted to run away right before the storm.Why dream of going to Oz? Recall that Dorothy was being hassled by the wicked rich woman who wanted to kill her dog, and family members wouldn't give her the time to talk about anything. They were all too busy. She sang about finding a place "over the rainbow" where everything would be wonderful. When we go to sleep with a lot on our mind, we often have very vivid dreams about it. Her dream of Oz was the playing out of her imaginary place over the rainbow. But her dream eventually made her realize that such a place was not where happiness resided, but instead within her and her family, "there's no place like home." And then, she woke up.So, do all of us dream too? Sure we do, if we are normal. Do all things in our dreams make sense once we wake up? Of course not. Then why should we expect anything different of Dorothy's dream? Why didn't the good witch tell her early on she could get back to Kansas by clicking her heels? Because there was no good witch. It was all part of Dorothy's dream, therefore she would have to get angry at herself. Now, do you see the absurdity in criticizing any part of the movie's plot? Or talking of "plot holes?" Dreams are dreams, and are not expected to bear a strong relationship to reality.I don't believe everyone should consider "Wizard of Oz" a great film. Tastes differ. I don't think "Pulp Fiction" or "Lord of the Rings" are great films. But I do believe everyone should realize when certain comments just don't make sense. Because it was a dream, the story cannot have plot holes. Why could the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion talk? Because it was a dream. The dream of a 15-year-old girl. Accept that, and any questions you may have suddenly make perfect sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most difficult thing about reviewing The Wizard of Oz is finding something to say about it that doesn't begin with "the best." It's hard to argue that this isn't a strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Navel-gazing dramas about the human condition are fine, and I know most critics' lists would give preference to those sorts of films, but this movie has a little bit of everything and is easily among the most perfect films ever made. It doesn't matter if you're a kid or a grown-up. The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic that has appeal for every open-hearted person out there. It's full of iconic lines, songs, characters, and moments. It's had a cultural impact few films do. So many things from the film have made their way into our everyday lives and language. If I had to single out one thing about it I love more than the memorable characters played by an ideal cast, exuberant Arlen &amp; Harburg songs, delightful story, and beautiful sets, costumes, and matte painting backdrops, it would be the vibrant and rich Technicolor. It's such a gorgeous looking movie. Funny, sentimental, sincere -- it's a masterpiece that I've been in love with since I was a little kid. I've never grown tired of it and I hope I never do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz, directed by King Vidor and Victor Fleming, (of Gone with the Wind fame) is really what is referred to as one of the classics. It has earned that distinction by charming generation after generation, thanks to numerous re-releases and annual TV broadcasts. It's one of those movies that has transcended the medium of cinema. The songs are not only perfect, but they actually integrate well with the plot and tell the story that the characters are unable to put into words. Quotes such as "Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore." and "I'll get you my pretty... and your little dog too!" became apart of pop culture and the breakaway hit "Somewhere over the rainbow" won an Oscar for best original song in the original music category. The special effects were really ahead of their time and the stark contrast between the black-and-white Kansas in the beginning, compared with the explosion of colors when Dorothy enters Oz really made this movie something special The warm, bright colors of Oz opposed to the cold darks of the wicked witch's castle provide a wonderful contrast for the eyes. I particularly found the cast in this movie quite compatible, with Judy Garland in the lead as Dorothy and with Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr playing the scarecrow and tin man. I find it hard to imagine what it would have been like with the original intended cast, including Shirley Temple as Dorothy. But 20th Century Fox would not loan its top star. Judy Garland is a perfect Dorothy -- vulnerable, sensitive, and completely believable On the brink of leaving childhood, her dreams of a place "over the rainbow" are in part a yearning to escape the concerns of adulthood. The makeup and costumes are quite impressive with the lavish costumes of the munchkins, the good witch Glinda and the lion, tin man and scarecrow adding to the colorful aspect of the land of Oz. Possibly one of the most memorable props on the set of "The Wizard of Oz" are the Ruby slippers. There are thought to be seven pairs of ruby slippers. Each has an estimated value of $1.5 million, making them the most expensive Hollywood memorabilia. The movie is really a success as a musical telling the story through the songs and resolving the problems of the central characters. Even though this is a movie for everyone, it is categorized as a children's flick. The writing is good with very simple lines and problems, but slightly complex so we're not falling asleep of boredom. Although the story is slightly predictable in the way that most musicals were in the early nineties, the adventure and suspense make this one stand out against the others. I especially liked this movie as a child, even though I didn't really look beyond the main frame of the story. I think the primary attraction was in the fantasy aspect of the show that quite obviously entices young children to this timeless classic. The wonderful colors, bright sets and the objects that almost gain a role of their own (such as the red ruby slippers and the yellow brick road) are pivotal in capturing audiences of all ages. Although there are a few mistakes visible to the naked eye such as when the voice-overs of characters don't match up, it made a very big impression for a movie of its time. This movie is an ideal family film, superb in every aspect, with outstanding art direction, music, and performances. It is still as fresh and engrossing as it was in 1939, and improves with every viewing. Each scene in The Wizard of Oz is spectacular in its visual creativity. Each song is inspired. And the performances, especially by Dorothy's three companions, are memorable. The bad guys are very bad - especially the wicked witch, played by Margaret Hamilton. The Wizard of Oz has no dull moments. It is understandably popular with kids, and just as much fun for adults. Many have seen it year after year. In fact, before the advent of home video, millions of people sat down once a year to watch it again when it made its annual appearance on network television. I think that it is terrific how well this movie has held up over the years. It's going on sixty-six years since it was first released and yet, it is timeless.It is great to look back on a film that was made in the thirties, and compare it to the movies made in this day and age. This is a film that will just be something that stays around forever. The Wizard of Oz is enjoyable for people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic fantasy/musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All-time classic family fantasy film with hundreds of midgets dancing to a Harburg/Arlen score and a smart story with an earthy moral -- there's no place like home (but who wouldn't want to visit a place like Oz?). Garland creates a classic characterization, sings with real emotion, and despite playing a bit too peppy, pulls it off in the end. She's well-supported by a cast of vaudeville legends, including dancer Ray Bolger, comedian Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley and Frank Morgan.The photography is amazingly vivid, offset to good effect by the sepia-toned b &amp; w sequences at the film's beginning and end. Director Fleming once again shows he's one of the best in the world.A few notes on the film: As many know, Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the tin man (after having exchanged the part of the scarecrow with the more popular Bolger), and I think he would have made an excellent tin man. Jack Haley does a good job, but his style of comedy is very dry, and I think Ebsen had a better brand of physical comedy, plus he was a very good dancer (anyone who's seen him do his somewhat robotic shuffle can easily imagine him in the part).A lot of people have commented on the combination of rock band Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" and "The Wizard of Oz." After trying this several times (in order to do it for oneself, simply begin the CD at the moment the MGM lion roars for the third time), I have become convinced that Pink Floyd did in fact time some of the musical effects with the visuals of the movie. There are numerous instances of this that will be immediately noticeable, but I particularly like the ringing bells on the album which are timed along with Margaret Hamilton's appearance on a bicycle!For fans of midget movies -- and I'm a big fan myself -- this is one of the all-time delights. There are hundreds of midgets, they get their own theme song, and are showcased in some of the film's most stupendous moments. Having met a few of these little people myself at conventions, I have to say that I doubt the veracity of stories concerning their "riotous" behavior at local hotels, but then everybody WAS a bit younger way back then, so you never know!A technical note on the DVD -- I thought the quality of the production was excellent, the colors were perfect -- I've had problems with other WB discs which look like second rate laserdisc transfers, but they really put some effort into "The Wizard of Oz" and it shows.... also features fabulous deleted dance scene with Ray Bolger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really a Friend of Dorothy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the British general election of 1983, the centrist Social Democratic Party mocked their political rivals by depicting Margaret Thatcher as the Tin Man and Labour leader Michael Foot as the Scarecrow from "The Wizard of Oz". The accompanying caption read "One hasn't got a heart; the other hasn't got a brain". Unfortunately, they appear to have forgotten that Dorothy had three companions, not two, and it was quickly suggested by both Conservative and Labour supporters that the SDP leader Roy Jenkins- a politician often accused by his opponents of lacking any convictions to have the courage of- must therefore be the Cowardly Lion.I mention this story because it shows how deeply this film has become a part of popular culture, so much so that a reference to it was readily understood by voters at an election more than forty years after it was made. If anything, the story is even more familiar today than it was in 1983, following repeated television showings (normally during the Christmas holidays) and the opening of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical based on it. In Britain at least, its fame has eclipsed that of the novel on which it is based. The story is so well-known that I won't try to summarise it here, except to say that, like "Alice in Wonderland", it deals with the adventures of a young girl in a bizarre fantasy world.The film is not only well-known, it is also highly regarded; it frequently features in lists of the "100 Greatest Movies Ever Made". (Sometimes even the "10 Greatest Movies Ever Made"). Certainly, it has its good points. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow, Jack Haley's Tin Man and Bert Lahr's camp Lion are all inspired comic creations, as is Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch of the West, although several of her scenes were cut because the studio thought that they would frighten young children. There is some imaginative use of colour- the bright, vivid colours during the Oz scenes would doubtless seem unbearably hectic and strident in any realistic film, but in a film set in a fantasy world they fit in with the strange, dreamlike mood. The use of monochrome for the real world and colour for imaginary ones became something of a clich in fantasy movies after this, although Michael Powell was to reverse this convention to brilliant effect in "A Matter of Life and Death".The casting of the teenaged Judy Garland as Dorothy (supposedly a nine-year-old) made sense from a musical point of view, as she copes far better with the demands of the film's numerous songs than any child actress could have done, but children in the audience might have found it easier to identify with the character had she been played by someone closer to their own age. (Shirley Temple, six years younger than Garland, was at one time considered for the part). As an actor, as opposed to a singer, Garland's performance in this film is nothing special, but that may have more to do with the way her character is written. Dorothy is essentially a passive character who acts as straight woman to a series of comic ones. Some of the other acting contributions are not very good, particularly Billie Burke's rather wooden Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Given that Glinda is supposed to be young and beautiful, it seemed rather odd to cast an actress in her fifties in this particular role.The film was originally intended as a children's movie, although I don't think it works very well as one. This may have been the reason why it was a box office failure in 1939; its subsequent fame has been due to repeated broadcasts on television and its taking on the status of an adult cult. When we were taken to see it as children, my younger sister was terrified by the witch and I was bored, especially during those sepia-and-white scenes in Kansas. Some of the songs, such as "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead" and "We're Off to See the Wizard" are jolly enough to appeal to children, but "Over the Rainbow", sentimental corn-syrup in its purest form, has always struck me, both as a child and as an adult, as one of the most over-rated songs ever written.Most children's films from this period had to have an improving moral, and "The Wizard of Oz" has two. The first- that one must look inside oneself for qualities such as intelligence, kindliness and courage- is unexceptionable, but the other, "There's no place like home", seems rather parochial, even un-American, given that America is a country of immigrants, most of whom moved to the New World precisely because they couldn't, for one reason or another, find their heart's desire in their original homelands.I must confess that I am not really a Friend of Dorothy. It is not that I hate the film, or even seriously dislike it. It is simply that, like another reviewer, I cannot understand why it is so often mentioned in the same breath as genuinely great films like "Gone with the Wind", "Casablanca" or "Citizen Kane". I am prepared to accept "The Wizard of Oz" as a colourful, imaginative and at times enjoyable piece of fantasy. I just can't see it as one of the Greatest Movies of All Time. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based upon the Baum book series, the wizard of Oz has delighted fans the world over for nearly a hundred years about a Kansas farm girl on a magical journey through the land of Oz.Landing atop the Wicked witch of the south, her sister declares to obtain the ruby slippers upon her sudden death.For a film that changed many settings from the book, multiple script changes and actors for the parts it turned out a multi color class delighting all ages. Some of the scenes like Chinatown, the rat village and the rainbow bridge to the witch's castle wouldn't be possible at the time due to budget and special effects available at the time.Who couldn't love the side characters each with a unique personality and skull set used to save the heroine. Its hard for me to choose a favorite as they're all iconic, funny, charming, brave and loyal to a fault. Oz is a sight filled with awe and wonderment where anything can happen over the rainbow. Oz comes across magnificent, scary and alluring. The wicked witch from the 31st very menacing, powerful and evil with her flying monkeys spreading terror across the land until her dying days.The musical numbers are catchy, fit the plot and timeless.The wizard of oz deserves preservation forever so many more generations will be delighted by this interesting world to explore with Dorothy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is one of the films that changed the way I look at movies. First enjoying The 1939 film by Victor Fleming as a childhood favorite, revisiting the film, proved it to be so much more than a kid's movie. When I was about 20 and in college, I really started appreciating film as the art form that it is and respecting it as such. In gaining this new understanding for the medium as a serious art rather than mindless entertainment, I sought out favorite films of mine to see if I could gain any deeper understanding of them, and perhaps, appreciate or enjoy them more. One of the first films I watched through this new lens was The Wizard of Oz. Starring Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley, and Billie Burke in the film adaptation of L. Frank Baum's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz follows a small town girl into the world she discovers as she only wishes to return home to the life she didn't realize she loved. No matter how simple the film seems on its surface, Baum packed quite a punch in his book, which was more than adequately transferred to the screen.Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a simple young girl living in Kansas on her Auntie Em's (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry's (Charley Grapewin) farm. Frustrated with her family after they agree to take her dog Toto away after nipping at a neighbor, Dorothy contemplates running away. When a tornado rips through the farm, she and her dog Toto are deposited into a magical world called Oz. Everything in Oz is different and beautiful. There is a unique class of people called munchkins, there are talking scarecrows, and tin woodsmen, there are witches, there are even lions and tigers and bears. The more Dorothy learns about the land of Oz, the more she wants to find a way to go back home, as soon as she can. In order to get back home, the Good Witch of the North, Glinda (Billie Burke) instructs Dorothy that she will need to travel to Emerald City and request to go home of the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan). In order to get there, Dorothy must follow the yellow brick road, that leads all the way to The Emerald Palace where the Wizard lives. To protect herself through the travels, Dorothy is given a pair of Ruby slippers, much sought after by the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) who will stop at nothing to get them. Fortunately for Dorothy, she meets friends along the way to Emerald City. She meets a talking scarecrow, who wishes to ask the Wizard for a brain, a tin woodsman who is seeking a heart from the Wizard, and a talking lion who wishes to be granted courage from the Wizard. Each with a special request and believing only that the Wizard of Oz can fulfill them, they travel along the yellow brick road hoping to be granted their destinies. In a race against the wicked witch, the group hopes to reach the Wizard of Oz before being thwarted by evil. There are a number of technical achievements that The Wizard of Oz boasts, of these is probably the most beautiful revealing transformation scene in cinema history. One would struggle to find someone unfamiliar with the door first opening to Oz revealing the technicolor wonder revealed to the audience. There is a good reason that this reveal is so engrained in the hearts of audiences forever. The coloration used in The Wizard of Oz is not only striking for 1939 but is still striking today, nearly 80 years after the film's release. It was also the brilliant transition from the sepia tones that the film had used until Dorothy entered Oz. This was a brilliant directorial decision to contrast the bleak simple world Dorothy had known until she was thrust into the world greatly different than her own. Many times since has this device been copied in films proving that so many filmmakers and film genres have much to owe to The Wizard of Oz. In addition to the beautiful shooting of the film, the writing comes to mind instantly as a standout piece of the film. I struggle to think of another film as quoted as The Wizard of Oz, from the exclamation of the Wicked Witch when she promises Dorothy "I'll get you my pretty" to the realization Dorothy has when landing in Oz "Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore", no other film has been imitated and quoted as much as The Wizard of Oz. The Wizard of Oz also comes with it, quite a thematic punch. Brimming to the top with symbolism, The Wizard of Oz really opened my eyes to how much cinema can say without overtly saying it. Each of the main characters means something deep and different than it would appear on screen, and there is room for each audience member to see what they will in each character. Just like going to an art gallery and 40 people seeing 40 different aspects of the same painting, film creates the same opportunities to see something deep and beautiful within it, if you only look for it. Whether you see industry titans in the tin man, politicians in the lion, farmers in the scarecrow, or the exploited working class in the munchkins; film has within it as much depth as any other art medium. The Wizard of Oz was my first introduction to film as art, and I am eternally grateful for what a viewing of a favorite film with a fresh perspective has afforded me for my years to come. I suppose I was somewhat like Dorothy before she opened the door to Oz, comfortable and unknowing; I'm glad for both of us that the door to that technicolor world has been opened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pink Floyds' soundtrack twist to The Wizard Of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get the film -&gt; The Wizard Of Oz and Dark Side Of The Moon by Pink Floyd. Start playing Dark Side Of The Moon immediately after the MGM lion roars three times. Wish You Were Here is the second half of The Wizard Of Floyd soundtrack. When Dark Side Of The Moon ends down to the last very faint heartbeat (on screen you should see the Tin Man falling backwards &amp; being caught by Dorothy and The Scarecrow)pause the film and put on Wish You Were Here... then unpause the film and start Wish You Were Here at the same time. I won't give away all the syncs in the film because they're fun to watch and listen to however you'll know you have the sync correct when during the little Moog solo at the end of the Wish You Were Here album as the witch is slowly melting the Moog solo is slowly fading out. When the witch has completely melted the Moog solo has completely faded out and the album ends there. For those of you who have trouble synching Dark Side Of The Moon you'll know you're in synch when after the warning bells (alarms)of the song "Time" ring warning that the mean lady is coming to Dorothys' home to take Toto away you'll notice that the alarms dwindle as she gets off her bike... and the key to the synch is 'at the same time as the fence door slams on her butt the first bass slap tones in the song "Time".' I did this with my friend over 6 years ago figuring that since Dark Side Of The Moon ends practically halfway through the film it is only logical that Pink Floyds' next album should cover the rest of the film and it does till Dorothys' mission is completed with the "hit" on the witch. "Money, It's a hit,Don't give me that do goody-good b.s." is sung precisely when the Good Witches' ball appears. The Good Witch appears all nice however she leads Dorothy to do a "hit" on the witch. When Dorothy finally does the "hit" on the witch that's where The Wizard Of Floyd ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In US History class, the most boring and particularly monotonous portion of the curriculum was the section spent on the incorrigible populists, who were clearly quote vexed about something in particular pertaining to the government, but I couldn't find anyone to explain it to me. The best reply that I got was: "Go watch the Wizard of Oz!" and then the door was slammed in my face as my high school librarian shut me out in a fit of pique. So I did, and I wound up more confused then I was in the first place. Finally, I received deliverance: the Wizard of Oz is a allegory for the populists, who wanted free coinage of silver so that they wouldn't have to be sent to debtor's prison. They, most farmers, are represented by the scarecrow; the tin man is for industrial workers, Toto represents abolitionists, while Dorothy herself symbolizes traditional American values. The reluctant hero of the populists, William Jennings Bryan, is portrayed by the cowardly lion; his nemesis, William Mckinely, is depicted by none other than the Wicked Witch of the West, who is, for some reason, greener than Kermit the Frog. While there are many other cross-references, including the "yellow brick road" (gold standard) and even the word "Oz" (as in ounces of gold), but I don't have the time or the patience to outline them all...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie to see in a theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More years ago than I care to remember my mother took me to see this movie. This was when theaters were palaces. To a small boy the screen looked 50 feet high and 100 feet long. Sitting through the Movie Tone News I had no idea of what to expect. The curtains parted in the dark theater, and the movie started. When the movie started in what I thought was black and white, and I was disappointed. This was the age of color movies. But wait, the eyes of the actors had color. What was this? The actors had me. I didn't care if it was black and white. Dorothy sang the song that made history, and 'Some Where Over the Rainbow' captured the hearts of the nation. When Dorothy opened the door, after the tornado, I was trapped in the magic! The Color was like nothing I had ever seen before. Bille Burke looked like an angel in that bubble, and I hated Mararet Hamilton for 50 years. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, and Burt Lahr showed that you could overcome your weakness. I saw 'Gone With The Wind' back then, and it was good, but not in my eyes. Buy the DVD, get the biggest T.V. you can find, get the heart of a 7 year old, and hit play. When you get to be my age you will find you yourself whistling 'If I only had a Brain', and find some 7 year old joining in. Sometimes you have to follow the yellow brick road, and not pay attention to the man behind the curtain, with your children. If you do, you will find Oz is not cable show about a prison, but a magical place you don't want to leave - even when your hair is gray, and all you teeth are not your own more than 50 years later.</fullReview>

I have also been looking for a place just like the theme song says, over the rainbow. We all want to believe, and that is why. I also recently saw the special "Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic." It made me feel right at home. Remember that famous line in the film? I may not want to be Dorothy, but remember that there's no place like home. There's no place like the movies to warm your heart either. Another thing I like about it is the Munchkinland scene. That is really fun. Glinda introduces every Munchkin. I also like when the Lullabye League dances for everyone.</fullReview>

"Just as good the fifteenth time as it is the first." Of course, the film has had outstanding success on television. Television success: Bravo!High irony: the didactic Message that "there's no place like home" takes more time to deliver on the bonus material of the DVD edition than the movie itself. Of course this Message, like all "Messages to wayward children", is beyond any child's care or understanding. This is not a film for children but, rather, a film for the "child inside every one of us." One might as well subject that inside-child to numerous viewings ("Just as good the fifteenth time as it is the first") in a vain attempt to convey the Message.

		<shortDescription>Starring vehicle for Margaret Hamilton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's almost no point in writing about this movie, since it is so familiar. Like almost everyone else in the known universe, I saw this movie about 77 times as a child, and was terrified by the winged monkeys. I also noticed the surfeit of Boston-born actors, complete with Boston accents (notably, Ray Bolger and Jack Haley). And when I grew up, I actually tried watching this movie with the sound turned down and Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon" playing on the stereo. (Don't bother, by the way; it's no big deal.)But what I remember today is the performance of that beloved character actress, Margaret Hamilton, as the Wicked Witch of the West, a role with which she would be identified for the rest of her days. This is perhaps unfortunate, as it overshadowed a notable career in which she played prudish spinsters, nosy neighbors, gossipy biddies, and the like. She was to W. C. Fields what Margaret Dumont was to the Marx Brothers. In later years, she became famous (and much beloved) as a small-town innkeeper named Cora in a series of Maxwell House Coffee commercials.I hope it's not too indecent to admit this, but I had something of a crush on her when I was younger. The old-fashioned clothes, the tight, disapproving face, the whole schoolmarm gestalt - I don't know, it just did something for me. As you can imagine, when I have occasion to share this opinion with my friends, looks of stark terror flash across their faces as they back away from me, ever so slowly.I guess there's just no accounting for taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This eternal gem of a film enters the digital revolution with ever-increasing appeal. Glowing healthier than ever before, this 1998 restoration seems to be the definitive version. The DVD format laps up the rainbow so wondrously that you might occasionally feel you're in Oz... As a perpetual lover of this film, I personally feel it has only improved with age. The original three-strip Technicolor hues of the DVD release are now vibrantly restored to their former lustre. One must praise the work of the restorers who seem to have obliterated any vestiges of artefacts or impurities from the Master print. Technicians have also color corrected former garish shades to subtle and more realistic variations. The film looks so breathtakingly sharp and clean that you might stop and wonder if it was filmed late last year. It would be safe to say that audiences of 1939 could not possibly have viewed the film with such articulate clarity and definition. Never have I been so taken aback while viewing Dorothy's entrance from bleak sepia tones to Oz's gorgeously rich colors. Other versions I have seen of this transforming scene do not convey the fluidity of movement and color shade that only DVD at its best can offer. The sharpness of the print allows us more than ever to become Dorothy's companions along her magical quest. Thanks to modern technology, our generation is allowed the privilege in seeing this classic as it so rightly deserves. This special DVD release also comes with many extra treasures. A behind-the-scenes documentary by Angela Lansbury journeys the film's making, while vintage movie clips, cartoons, outtake musical numbers, cast interviews and much more will keep many a buff awake. A must have for anyone interested in great classics. Take my word for it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a whiz of a "Wiz" all these years later!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly agree with the many who see 1939 as the single greatest year in the history of American Film. What other year can boast a list of successes, both critical and box office, on the order of: "Gone with the Wind," "Love Affair," "Dark Victory," "Juarez," "The Roaring Twenties," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "Babes in Arms," "Beau Geste," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," "Union Pacific," "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," "Wuthering Heights," "Drums Along the Mohawk," and on and on? And one of the greatest of these is still "The Wizard of Oz," probably the best family film ever made some sixty years after it was released.This is a film where everything works. Most notably, there is the casting. With the possible exception of her "Vicki Lester" in "A Star is Born," Judy Garland never had a better cinematic vehicle for her talents than right here. Even when one knows her history of personal and professional heartbreak, her Dorothy Gale can still make believers of us all, while simultaneously causing us to regret what might have been had Louis B. Mayer stayed out of the pharmaceutical business. Ray Bolger brings his usual effortless charm to his best-known role, the Scarecrow. Jack Haley, Sr. rarely had a better vehicle for his understated brand of humor than the Tin Man. And the great Bert Lahr can still elicit his share of belly-laughs as the Cowardly Lion. Frank Morgan brings his usual dithery charm to Professor Marvel/The Wizard. And, Finally, Margaret Hamilton can still elicit a good old-fashioned scare in the role that would make her immortal, the Wicked Witch of the West. Interestingly, in real life, everybody who knew her had only the nicest of things to say about her. A single mother at a time when such things were less common than they are now, she was, by all accounts, a loving Mom to her only child, journalist Hamilton Maserve.Now to the technical end of things. If Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg had written the score to "Oz" and nothing else, that alone would have put them among the immortals. A. Arnold "Buddy" Gillespie's special effects were state of the art for that age, and how they could have lost the Oscar to "Suez" is beyond me. Harold Rossen's camerawork makes it all come alive, like a dream come to life. But the biggest suprise is the director. Victor Fleming was best known as a dramatic director ("The Virginian," "Red Dust," "Test Pilot") whose one previous attempt at a musical, "Reckless," with Jean Harlow, was a high-budget bomb. This, however, doesn't prepare one for his work on "Oz," in which he captures the sense of fantasy, whimsey, and, yes, menace, in a way no other director probably could. He would win the Best Director Oscar that year, not for "Oz" but for "Gone with the Wind."In short, "Oz" was, is, and always will be a delight, due both to its charming story and the dedicated team of professionals who made sure that "dreams really do come true."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of you who think this movie is purely kid-stuff - think again! Although most people see this movie by age 6, it is great fun for everyone. "The Wizard of Oz" boasts high production values and a timeless story based on the pre-eminent American fairytale by L. Frank Baum. As Dorothy Gale, Judy Garland plays her most memorable role, and does a fine job. Bert Lahr also deserves accolades for his comedic performance as the Cowardly Lion. "The Wizard of Oz" is ablaze with color, and luxurious sets from the Art Deco splendor of the Emerald City, to the brilliantly colorful Munchkinland. "The Wizard of Oz" is move-making in it's prime. Go see it as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where troubles melt like lemon drops...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was a little kid, I remember The Wizard of Oz being my favorite movie. I always wanted to go "over the rainbow" and have exciting adventures, what kid wouldn't? This movie grips you as a kid with its fantasy and remains in your mind as an adult. As an adult (or whatever ;)), I still love this movie. It's a great movie with good songs, neat-o characters, and that simple message that "There's no place like home." From the beginning, the movie takes a hold on you and never lets go. It never stops moving until Dororthy gets back to Kansas and find out that "it's only a dream." For me, the best movies are those you remember throughout your life, no matter where you are or what you're doing. Also, I think a good movie should keep your interest from beginning to end. For me, The Wizard of Oz succeeds at both of these. It makes you laugh, cry, all that stuff. It's like visiting an old friend you haven't seen in a while and I think that's what kind of feeling you should get from your favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi! Just wanted to reply to the person who identified him/herself as "Anonymous" in Boston. You commented that you went to see the Wizard of Oz, and were disappointed that it wasn't shown in letterbox. This was not a mistake...the film played that way all over the US during its re-release. The reason is because "OZ" was not filmed in widescreen. Cinemascope did not exist in 1939, nor did any other widescreen film process. Hope you still enjoyed the film! It's a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am an adaptation of the popular novel first saw when I was 10 years old. THE WIZARD of OZ has left a mark. The film, in which can be enjoyed by the entire family, especially young and children. So many colors, songs and magic did not hurt. There are not many films that children can fraud broad smile in one part and few tears at the end.Changing the black and white goods in the movie "in color" is certainly magic in itself. I think there was a key to the world "over the rainbow". This is unquestionably the most important moment of the film. Dorothy (Judy Garland) She left their loved ones and the hard life on the farm with the magical game of unfortunate circumstances and "dreamed" in the land of their dreams. In the dream, she wants only one thing, to return home, or rather to awaken. Parody and somewhat true. Dreams are really beautiful and fascinating, ugly and frightening.Wizard of Oz is a very direct a movie. I think the kids watching this movie get a certain confidence. Older viewers coming back to their childhood. Where is the magic began. Magic does not have to be exclusively beautiful. Honestly, never. The effect is twofold. The story comes down to a trip or maybe a little more extreme told getaway. Friends and travel almost always provoke a spell.Judy Garland glowed. Such a combination of joy and sadness at some young actress is rarely seen. I got the impression that all the other actors enjoy their roles. Margaret Hamilton is unforgettable in the role of an evil witch. They all seem relaxed and simply. The ending is painful, but I doubt that someone from the beauty and magic of sleep woke up unhappy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhere Over The Rainbow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite films. From childhood, Dorothy Gale left me awestruck with her beautiful voice and her red ruby slippers. The whimsical, fantastic nature of this film makes it ideal for families and children, but one of the reasons that The Wizard of Oz has stood the test of time and become such a classic is that it isn't just for children, but for people of all ages. It inspires a sort of nostalgia in many, and it allows the modern-day viewer a glimpse into a simpler age of film-making. The lack of CGI despite the exotic nature of Oz dates the film and simultaneously adds to its charm. The Wizard of Oz allows the viewer a refreshing break from reality, and it will likely continue to touch the lives of future generations of movie- watchers everywhere, even somewhere over the rainbow.</fullReview>

These things help the movie to be easily comprehended by kids of all ages and from all generations. This movie becomes timeless due to those factors. But I have to admit that this movie doesn't really serve my personal taste, even for a family movie. I see the acting as to inflated, making the movie enjoyable for kids exclusively while the older viewers can only find interest in the story as a whole.

		<shortDescription>Oz- life's lesson's for children of all ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" a MGM's adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 fantasy classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has become a beloved movie standard which is reported to be the most viewed film ever made. This classic movie touches the heart and invites each viewer to relive a childhood sense of wonder and adventure. How many have grown up having viewed this 1939 movie not necessarily recognizing its cutting edge impact during the transitioning from black and white to Technicolor? It is interesting to contrast other musical adventure cinema to The Wizard of Oz. More recent movies such as Annie, The Sound of Music, or Mary Poppins do not capture and stretch the imagination holding dear specific scenes to our hearts as does the story line and characters in Oz. The songs that each of the character sings along the journey to Oz representing meaning and inspiration to us individually. "If I only had a brain", "If I only had a heart", "If I only had the nerve and were king of the forest."Judy Garland who portrays Dorothy lends a heart touching and melancholy singing of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" that draws the viewer into her dream filled story. Dorothy ultimately finds true happiness by realizing that everything we seek in life is found in our understanding of home which she possesses all along. The movie stresses core components of 1930's belief systems (these seem to be diminishing in today's families) that of the importance of love, heart for others, brains, and courage. The Land of Oz and Dorothy's journey along the yellow brink road symbolize both the joy, challenge, and dangers faced when seeking the wisdom of our life's understanding and ultimate happiness. The movie also demonstrates the importance of friendship and relationship with others as we face life's struggles. The characters who play a part in her life at the farmhouse and along the yellow brick road are represented by Ray Bolger portraying 'Hunk' / The Scarecrow, Jack Haley portraying 'Hickory' / The Tin Man, and Bert Lahr portraying 'Zeke' / the Cowardly Lion. Each actor gives us endearing and memorial lines that remain etched in our childhood memories. From a technical standpoint the scenes are focused on the characters where there is dialog. It appears that with each scene the camera shot breaks with a distinct transition. The editing of each individual scene has natural progression and follows the poignant storyline. Yet I didn't feel that the editing was so much smooth as it was natural in terms of following the dialog, flow of song, or background sounds. For that time period the editing appears smooth yet in comparison to today's computer generated 3D and High Definition technology it appears choppy and a bit disjointed at times. In many ways given the time period the editing and follow of scenes are very effective. The story and adventure are certainly geared toward the youth. However the costumes make up and music certainly keeps adult audiences interested and engaged. The visual appearances and disappearances of the wicked witch are done well given the time period. The visual of color when entering the dream sequences of The Land of Oz definitely adds great contrast impact and makes each scene more dynamic. Everything described from the yellow brick road, ruby slippers, emerald city pertains to vibrant color. The film provided realistic imagery to the eye even though this is very much a fantasy dreamlike setting. From my perspective it might be scene where Margaret Hamilton who portrays Miss Gulch/the Wicked Witch of the West and Dorothy (Judy Garland) that leaves the lasting memory and underpinning theme of the journey. How more visceral can the director demonstrate innocence and purity defeating unhappiness and evil? How poetic this visual demonstration of simplify pouring water on the evil in life proving they are just all wet. Even more importantly is Dorothy who demonstrates humble compassion as she accidentally throws the bucket of water on the witch in an attempt to save the scarecrow from burning up. The effective believability of the dim lit background coupled with the effects of colored smoke and a slowly shrinking witch screeching "Oh No? I'm melting. The screenwriter and director Victor Fleming along with special effects technicians have crafted a visually and thought proving fantasy that surpasses the expectations of all imaginative viewers. the end the soft background, satiny colors, and voice of Glenda, the good witch of the north portrayed by Billie Burke represents a motherly figure who provide the wisdom that Dorothy trust in bring her back home. The vibrancy of the ruby slippers and the three clicking of the heals together might suggest that it is heart, brains, and courage that are the inherent qualities we all possess yet must use to take us home or on our life's journey. The lesson is that children both young and old often fail to recognize "There is no place like home." By having the open eyes to see compassion, intelligence, and demonstrating a courageous heart we all move forward to capture our dreams. The Wizard of Oz is a musical fantasy movie that provides far more than munchkins, witches, and a tornado that propels a Kansas farm setting into the Land of Oz, it's a life's lessons for children of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz (1939): Dir: Victor Fleming / Cast: Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton: Sensational treasure about mind and imagination. Judy Garland plays Dorothy, a farm girl who, in the midst of a tornado, is spirited away over the rainbow to the glorious land of Oz. She is greeted by numerous Munchkins after her house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East. This angers the Wicked Witch of the West who demands the ruby slippers, which have appeared on Dorothy's feet. To return to Kansas she must follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and seek help from the wizard. On the way she encounters a scarecrow who needs a brain, a tin man who needs a heart, and a cowardly lion who needs courage. Skillfully directed by Victor Fleming whose luck had him direct this film and Gone With the Wind the same year. Garland graces the screen with her innocence and beautiful singing voice that belts out "Over the Rainbow." Margaret Hamilton plays the menacing wicked witch whose defeat is one of the great scenes due to its simplicity. Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr are wonderfully cast as Dorothy's companions. Margaret Hamilton gives a menacing performance as the Wicked Witch of the west. It regards important things taken for granted. Triumphant visual wonder that renders that "you're not in Kansas anymore." Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a good message underneath the darker stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, The Wizard of Oz is a very dark and twisted tale. Dorothy the protagonist lives in the country, surrounded by corruption (for example, a mean-spirited local woman has relatives in high places, thanks to which she easily gets the local judge to sign off on an order to put down Dorothy's adorable dog Toto), crime (when Dorothy runs off to save Toto, she doesn't get more than a few miles from her house before coming across a vagrant who tries to rob her, and would've probably tried worse if the weather hadn't suddenly kicked up), and frequent natural disasters in the form of twister tornadoes. It's pretty much Hell on Earth, and it's no wonder that Dorothy is desperate to leave this dreadful place, to which effect she sings a very moving song in the beginning. Then a development occurs which seems at first to be fortunate - Dorothy flies to the magical land of Oz, using her house as air transport. Well, the development quickly turns dubious, since Dorothy marks her arrival to Oz by killing the regional supervisor - the Wicked Witch of the East. The local population called the Munchkins, strangely afflicted by mass stunted growth, goes ape with joy over this fact. Now, such shameless celebration of anyone's death is suspect to me. Moral people don't revel in murder so much, especially when it's a local official who is killed. But then I got to thinking: maybe this Witch had some genetic experiments going on in the area. That would explain why all the Munchkins are so underdeveloped physically. So I suppose that killing her was the right thing. When a foreign dictator flies so far off the rocker, you ice the barbaric scum. Sometimes Gandhi's methods don't work so well.Anyway, at this point the movie starts to purposely mess with your head. Dorothy suddenly wants more than anything to go back home. Well, "a", we were led to believe that what she'd wanted most of all was an adventure. Now that she's got her wish, however, she just wants to return home. And "b", did she forget that they'll kill Toto once she comes back? Apparently so! That annoyed me extremely, because Toto was my favorite character in the entire romp. This dog was cute, and didn't blab much, unlike the other characters who seemingly did nothing else but whine about their problems. That's basically the only type of people/beings that Dorothy gets to join her when she marches to Emerald City to get a ticket home - whiners looking for handouts. There's Scarecrow - a kind of field-based bird-bouncer who wants to magically gain cleverness. Obviously going the way of persistent studying and mental training doesn't even occur to him. Then there's Tin Man - a case of artificial intelligence gone completely haywire. He was designed for cutting wood, but must've short-circuited in a few places while rusting under the open sky, or maybe the reason his owner ditched him in the first place was because of programming defects... Anyway, now Tin Man is obsessed with obtaining a living heart, on the wild assumption that this will make him more emotionally complete. Consider the difficulty of obtaining a living heart - donor? stem cell technology? If it's genetic know-how he's after, the Wicked Witches seem to have that covered, what with the Munchkins and winged monkeys and all, so he'd be better off seeking audience with them, not some "Wizard" they know nothing about. Consider also the difficulty of fusing a living human heart with a metal robot. Finally, the entire endeavor is useless in principle - emotions come from the brain, not the heart. But the most ridiculous part of this is that the guy is already emotional like you wouldn't believe! All he ever does is cry. Finally, the third minion Dorothy gains in her journey is Cowardly Lion, who is, frankly, a bouquet of psychological disorders. He is a bully, a narcissist, a neurotic, and has megalomaniacal tendencies to boot. Plus I find it rather strange that a flamboyant fellow like Lion absurdly has the mannerisms of an alcoholic dock worker.All these freaky folks go to beg the "Wizard" for a handout that will solve their lives' problems. The only real "adventure" they encounter before getting to the Wizard is a poppy field. They become very sedated, well, the biological organisms among them do, but have no fear! The "good fairy" flies by and sprinkles some white powder on them, and they spring right back up and practically sprint to the Emerald City, singing on the way. You can see that all these indulgences have their effect, though - the characters have severe hallucinations while in the city. For example, one of the horses keeps changing colors.Do you see what I mean by "dark"? At this point I was becoming somewhat depressed by all the immorality. But luckily, towards the end the movie actually becomes much better, and teaches the viewer several very important lessons: 1. In this world, external attributes and illusory things are at least as important than actual inner qualities, and sometimes more so. The Wizard uses a college diploma, among other things, to demonstrate this, because, indeed, in our society a useless piece of paper like that will open at least as many doors for a straw-brained guy like Scarecrow as actual mental ability. 2. It teaches people to be realistic. The land of Oz turns out to be just a fleeting fantasy that Dorothy had. The movie thereby says, and rightly so, that you should accept reality for what it is, and then work to change your circumstances - not wish for magical freebies. Consequently, I'd even say that there's a strong anti-religious message here, and for that alone, I forgive Oz all of its apparent flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>#Awesome film! SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS! he Wizard of Oz is the most watched film in history. And it's obvious to see why. It has flaws, but only petty little flaws. It's strange and bizarre but in a good way. A spectacular way. It's beautiful. It's the perfect film. In the history of cinema, the only film that has ever come close to its splendor is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.The story: A Kansas girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland) and her dog Toto (Toto) are swept away in a twister to the land of Oz, their house falling upon and killing the Wicked Witch of the East. To get home, they must find the powerful Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan)the only person who can take her back. Along the way, she meets a the Witch of the Easts sister, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) who wishes to destroy her so she can have the ruby slippers Dorothy possessed after landing in Oz. She also meets a friendly Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) who tags along in hopes of getting a brain, a Tin Man (Jack Haley; Some singing and dialogue by Buddy Ebsen) who also tags along in hopes of getting a heart, and a Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who follows in hopes of getting courage. When they get to the City of Emeralds where the Wizard resides, they are dismayed to find that he will only grant their wishes if they kill the Wicked Witch of the West. On their way to the Witches castle, Dorothy is captured by the Winged Monkeys, who take her to the Witch, and ripping apart the Scarecrow. The Witch, who can't take the slippers off unless Dorothy is dead, flips an enchanted hourglass that, once empty, will kill Dorothy. Meanwhile, Toto escapes and shows Dorothy's friends the way to the castle. Once their, they free Dorothy, but on the way out, the Witch and her army surround them, and lights the Scarecrow on fire. Dorothy puts out the fire with a bucket of water but hits the Witch as well. The Witches weakness happens to be water, and she starts melting. Dorothy and her friends then return to The City of Emeralds, and find out the Wizard is actually a humbug. However, to pay for his crimes, he tries to take Dorothy home in a hot air balloon. However, the balloon comes loose, and he flys away, leaving Dorothy behind. But right after the a Humbug leaves, the Good Witch of the North tells a Dorothy she can use the the ruby slippers to go home. Sure enough, she returns home, and lives happily ever after... until Return to Oz, but we'll get to that later.So if that is not an awesome fantasy story, I don't know what fantasy is. I hope you enjoyed this review, happy 4th of July!</fullReview>

After he looks at it he stuffs it under his leg and does not give it back to Dorothy. I wonder if anyone knows about this and what the purpose of it might be. After watching the movie several hundred times since I was about 7 years old in the 50's,this is the first time I noticed it, about a week ago. I have noticed things like this in other movies that I have seen many many times and just when I thought I learned the entire dialog and every movement in this movie, I see something new that I have never seen before. Thank technology for VHS or a lot of things would go unnoticed and anyone watching a certain movie would not get the full benefit of the director's effort.

		<shortDescription>A Great and Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1939, "The Wizard of Oz" is a classic American film that had a modest start. After its release, and for many years, it was viewed as an entertaining film but not as a great film. When I was a child, it aired on network TV once a year, around Thanksgiving. Whole families would gather around their sets for this special annual viewing.Later, when films became more widely available, its reputation seemed to grow and one would find it included in the lists of "best" films. Personally, I have always loved "The Wizard of Oz". I have seen it so many times, I practically know it frame by frame, as I am sure many others do.Here are some of the reasons this film should be considered great and powerful:1. The Beginning: The first part of the film, which is filmed in rich sepia tones, includes comedy, suspense, drama, music, and the establishment of all main characters.2. The tornado: The special effects used to create the menacing tornado are spectacular. It is still an emotionally charged element, despite our exposure to the spectacles of modern CGI.3. The song: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is regarded as one of the best film songs of all time. The film almost starred Shirley Temple and MGM wanted to cut the song, so we should consider ourselves lucky.4. Judy Garland: The use of Judy Garland to play the role of Dorothy Gale added a sense of maturity to the role and to the movie in general. Her vocal talents elevated the film.5. Frank Morgan: First introduced in the film as Professor Marvel, Frank Morgan's talents are used in a clever way through his various characters.6. The use of color: When Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland, the screen erupts in color. It has various symbolic uses, but mostly it delineates between the world Dorothy is from and a new world where the rules are unknown.7. The Munchkins: The strangeness of the new world and a considerable amount of charm are enhanced by this troupe and their voices.8. The Yellow Brick Road: Not the literal road, but what it represents--an adventure of possibilities, where heroes are tested.9. Serendipity: The fortunate way the elements of this film came together (Judy Garland vs. Shirley Temple, Ray Bolger vs. Buddy Ebsen, the use of the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", etc.)10. The Wizard: The use of screen projection, smoke and sound produced a scary Wizard that contrasted sharply with the beneficent image suggested to Dorothy by Glinda and the Munchkins.11. The musical score in general. The production is generously endowed with some magical musical numbers.12. The supporting cast: Dorothy's fellow travelers seem perfectly cast to us now, so iconic are their characterizations.13. The Witch: One of the great villains in film history, surrounded by her henchmen and her minions (the flying monkeys, terrors in their own right).14. The script: The story is engaging. It is also responsible for a slew of iconic quotes. My favorite is "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!"15. The director: Victor Fleming's vision produced a delightful film that can be enjoyed over and over. When we consider that he also is credited with directing "Gone with the Wind" in the same year--amazing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This quintessential gateway to movie fandom hasn't aged a day in 75 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the ultimate mark of deciding the greatest film of all time is the sheer number of people who have seen it, then a strong case could be made for The Wizard of Oz being the most enduring achievement in Hollywood history. Beloved by everyone from eight to eighty, the musical has entertained countless generations since its spellbinding release in 1939. It remains one of the first cinematic memories entrenched in the minds of many a self-respecting cinephile and now, on the eve of its 75th anniversary, the film has been re-released (in 3D, naturally), in all its visually arresting glory.When bloodthirsty farmgirl Dorothy Gale (a fresh-faced and stunning Judy Garland, in the role that launched her towards unabashed superstardom) is transported to the surreal landscape of Oz, she kills the first person she meets, then teams up with three strangers (Ray Bolger, Jack Haley &amp; Bert Lahr) to kill again. Okay, maybe writer Rick Polito's famous synopsis is a little deceiving, but this is truly a film that needs no introduction.It's hard to forget just how gargantuan a legacy the film has left on the world of cinema and, indeed, the pop culture landscape. A delightful screenplay brimming with quotable material from co-writers Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf, and a range of eclectic musical numbers work in perfect harmony, from Garland's spine-tingling rendition of Somewhere over the Rainbow and the Tin Man's touching If I only had a Heart to more upbeat diddies like Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead! And We're Off to See the Wizard.Although seasoned with an innumerable amount of on-set dramas and ludicrous urban legends, the film hasn't lost a touch of respectability in any department three-quarters of a century later. Margaret Hamilton's Wicked Witch is just as traumatising; the pulsing aesthetics of Oz just as mesmerising; the virginal Dorothy's realisation that "there's no place like home" just as sympathising. The whole experience is a product of a simpler time, so rich in history and innocence that even youngsters will somehow find themselves reminiscing about remote 1930s Kansas and its bone-deep, home-cooked morals.The 3D gives the film a little extra pop in places, but much like other conversions, it falls into the background after a while, likely to be all but forgotten by the time we get our first technicolour glimpse of Munchkinland. Of course, this is no major gripe, existing only as a small bonus on top of what is a near-unbeatable big screen experience.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is one of the movies every American should see at one time or another. The most significant aspect of the film is of course its use of color. Wizard of Oz was one of the first films to successfully incorporate color and actually have it look astonishing. What is interesting is the transition from low-key black and white while Dorthy is in Kansas, to color while in the land of OZ, and then back to the low-key B&amp;W when she returns to Kansas. Perhaps this was meant to signify the gloomy and hard life of midwestern farmers during this era in contrast with the majestic environment of Oz. The films manipulation of colors both in black and white and the entire spectrum helps to really make the audience embrace the ambiance in every scene. The Wizard of Oz also serves an admirable use of elaborate special effects. Between the flying monkeys, extravagant costumes, and artificial acting the film has an overwhelmingly magical impression. The film serves as a significant indicator of what was to come of adventure fantasy films. It set a new standard for film elegance that is hardly matched today. It also provided the truthful, celebrated, and timeless theory that "There is no place like home".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is without a doubt one of the most iconic movies in cinema history, a tale about Dorothy Gale being swept away by a tornado to a magical land, where she is joined by the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow. Together they seek the Wizard to help Dorothy find her way home, going down the famous yellow brick road. Along the way, Dorothy and her friends encounter the famous Good Witch Glinda and the lovable munchkins. They are thwarted by villains, which became some of cinema's most recognizable characters, including the Wicked Witch of the West and the flying monkeys. It's a film full of music and songs, including the famous "Over the Rainbow," magic, vibrant color, adventure and whimsical scenes. I watched this movie for its iconic status and the good vs. evil scenes, which I thought were pretty entertaining. The characters were memorable, some if a bit whiny and annoying, and the plot makes you suspend reality and lets your imagination run wild. The special effects were great for its time and the lavishness in the sets, costume design and cinematography helped create a convincing Land of Oz. Some might be taken-back by the overly-sung musical numbers, over-hyped sappiness and whimsicalness, and the slowness of the plot at some points, but it's still a fun adventurous movie to enjoy.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're off to see the "Wizard"....again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" (1939) is unquestionably one of the most famous films in the entire world. It's so popular that even the people who've never even heard of films at least recognize the characters. There hasn't even been a year that's gone by in which this film wasn't talked about at least once. This probably explains why many critics and audiences alike consider it "the greatest family film of all time". And while I still enjoy and appreciate this film, I now personally find it a tad overrated. Before we delve further, let's recap the plot for the one or two of you who don't know what it is. We follow a young girl named Dorothy (Judy Garland) who lives with her aunt and uncle on a Kansas farm. After she gets in trouble with a mean neighbor, her dog Toto is taken away to be put to rest. Luckily, Toto escapes back to her and they run away from home after not getting enough attention from her guardians or their farm hands. Through a series of circumstances, they come back home in the middle of a tornado and they (along with the whole house) accidentally get swept up into the tornado. The house lands in a magical world called Oz where she is greeted by Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, and the Munchkins. They claim that she's a hero in that she unknowingly killed the Wicked Witch of the East. After celebrating her "heroic" deed, the Wicked Witch of the West arrives and tries to claim her sister's ruby slippers. But the slippers are instead transferred onto Dorothy's feet by Glinda, which in turn causes the Wicked Witch of the West to seek vengeance upon Dorothy "and her little dog, too." Glinda tells Dorothy that the only person who can help her get home is the Wizard of Oz. She also says that by following the yellow brick road, it will guide her to the Emerald City where she will find this wizard. During her journey towards Emerald City, Dorothy meets and makes new friends who also want to see the Wizard of Oz. Among these new friends are the Scarecrow who wants a brain, the Tin Man who desires a heart, and the Cowardly Lion who seeks courage. In my opinion, the best characters in the whole film are the three I just mentioned. It's not simply because the makeup on the actors playing them are unbelievable. It's also not just because they're filled with personality and charm to spare, especially the Cowardly Lion who really cracks me up every time he's on screen. It's mainly because I was able to relate to or identify with them. In other words, the storytellers did a fantastic job in terms of giving these three characters clear goals and motivations. The payoff of the journey for them is absolutely exceptional in that the way they have to earn what they desire is fairly creative. Without spoiling it for the only people who didn't see this yet, the payoff is reassuring, logical, magical, and realistic all at the same time. Say what you will about some of the special effects in this film, but you got to at least admit one thing. For the time in which it was being produced (the late 1930's to be precise), the amount of effort and detail these filmmakers put into the film's production value has to be seen to be fully appreciated. Nearly everybody is familiar with the film's music and songs by Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg and for good reason. These are very memorable and well-written songs from "Ding-Dong - The Witch is Dead" to "We're Off to See the Wizard", but my personal favorite has got to be "If I Were King of the Forest". I just love the passion that the Cowardly Lion puts into performing this number and it's simply a delight to watch him belt it out with charisma to spare. The Oscar-winning song "Over the Rainbow" was originally considered to be taken out of the film altogether. While it is a great song, I might understand why that might be albeit for a different reason than the one the executives had at the time. You see, the song is about following your dreams and going to whatever new places you want to go in the world. And yet, when Dorothy is in this magical world which she dreamed of during this number, guess what she's doing when she's there? She wishes she was back at home in Kansas. Sort of a big problem, isn't it? Though it handles the morals with the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Lion very well, the film seems all over the place in terms of Dorothy's morals mainly because it feels uncertain of what it wants to communicate. And at the expense of being crucified by fellow film fans, I must admit that I'm not much of a fan of Dorothy. I'm not sure if it's because I thought that this was the story of a young little kid. I'm not certain if it's because Judy Garland's acting skills were a tad inferior to her singing. I'm also still debating whether or not it may be because she's a bit too whiny for my liking. Either way, something about this character just didn't do much for me. To be fair, how could any teenager play a young child without looking odd? Plus, her singing's still great and she has a couple quotable lines that have been completely ingrained into pop culture today. So for what it's worth, she's not bad, she's just highly overrated. Aside from that issue which will probably displease most readers, I still think people who haven't seen "The Wizard of Oz" owe it to themselves to check it out and see why it has singlehandedly become one of the most recognized films in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dorothy Gale is a lovely girl in Kansas. She wears pigtails. She meets Glinda the Good Witch and the munchkins. I love The Wizard of Oz and also Oz the Great and Powerful. In Oz the Great and Powerful, Glinda was captured. But in The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy Gale was captured by the Wicked Witch of the West, but her friends saved her. She defeated the wicked witch by pouring water on her to melt. They even met the wizard of Oz. She wanted to go back to her home. She woke up by Auntie Em. She wears her red ruby slippers like Sally Smith from Wee Sing Together. She has a dog named Toto. She met the scarecrow, the tin man, and the cowardly lion. Dorothy is named after the dinosaur from The Wiggles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We're off to the see the Wizard. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In every childhood's dream, we all have been inspired to be somewhere. Some have the dream to become someone in a different place. An place where speculation is an key point in that particular environment. Some dream about being in an place, where wonder and joy filled up their imagination. When Frank L. Baum wrote the book, "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", his vision was much more different than the movie's adaption. In 1939, The Wizard of Oz was made into a motion picture. It is not only a motion picture for audiences, but a motion picture for all generations. The movie tells us about how Dorothy, played Judy Garland, set off on an adventure in the colorful, lively world of Oz. But, before even being situated in the world of Oz, let's start from the beginning. In the great state of Kansas, Dorothy is happily living in her little Kansas farm, with her aunt and uncle. But, an mean landlady named Mrs. Gulch has a grudge on Dorothy because Dorothy's dog, Toto, bit her. She is ignored by her guardians, who are helping out on the farm. Then, the movie strikes a major chord, and from there, The Wizard of Oz begins to unfolds as Dorothy sings the musical number, "Over the Rainbow". Soon enough, an huge tornado threatens Dorothy's home and eventually, Dorothy lands in the wonderful world of Oz. From there, her adventures will unfold and set the viewers on a vivid, magical, journey through Oz. Dorothy begins to make new friends with the people she comes in contact with. But, like any other fairy tale, there's always evil lurking. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens to take over Oz, and so it's up to Dorothy and her friends to make it to Emerald City to see the Wizard. There are supporting characters in The Wizard of Oz that consists of The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion and The Scarecrow. Each one of those characters want to achieve something during this journey to see the Wizard. The Tin Man wishes a heart for his body. The Cowardly Lion wishes to be brave and have courage to stand up against his fears. The Scarecrow wishes he had an brain. Over time, The Wizard Oz had been broadcasts on local television stations over the last 30 years. It is till being shown on TV as of today. But, what is about The Wizard of Oz that makes the movie worth-watching? Well, there are a lot of reasons to speculate on that question. First of all, the original Frank L. Baum's novel was a dark allegory on historical figures being represented as the characters in the Wonderful World of Oz. In this movie version, those elements are thrown away. Second of all, the movie's appeal is to everybody. A lot of parents would take their kids to see The Wizard of Oz every time it is shown on TV or at the movies. In my opinion, The Wizard of Oz is timeless classic. This is a movie that is based on the tradition of magic. We, as the audience, are stunned when we see the world of Oz. Not only the set design of The Wizard of Oz is spectacular, but also, it has a juvenile feel to it. The spirit of the movie really makes the movie more pure than any other movie that is meant to seen by children. The Wizard of Oz is juvenile in its tone, especially the leading role of Judy Garland. For me, Garland is probably responsible for making the movie appeal to children. There's a deep meaning to the movie's argument on whether Dorothy's dream was real or fictional. This was significant when the movie was released in 1939. In the end, her dream is validated as being a dream. MGM was willing to gamble on The Wizard of Oz because it was the most expensive production at that time. The end result was an great-looking, very appealing and dazzling story of magic. The musical numbers in the movie are compelling and is full of joy as we hear Judy Garland's splendid singing voice that makes it all the more purer. It is a unforgettable classic that will live on for many centuries. And, also, there's no place like home. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only two other Movies from Hollywood's Golden Age that have been as influential, deconstructed, analyzed, reconsidered, penetrating, viewed, and reviewed, noticed, and unforgotten as this one. King Kong (1933) and Citizen Kane (1941).Everyone who has seen Oz has an opinion and it is usually a strong one. It undeniably unmasks facades and oozes into the deeper parts of the consciousness worthy of the best Psychoanalysis.On the surface it lures one in with its sentimentality and charms with its catchy and heartfelt tunes. It bombards the senses, like a psychedelic, expanding consciousness through dripping Colors and the most imaginative of imagery.As the mind opens it is vulnerable to scary images as well as the sublime. Reality becomes a focused blur that is experienced profoundly and deeply. It is Art at its most cunningly persuasive. If you "pay no attention to the Man behind the curtain", you will find yourself in a land of Milk and Honey, but if you acknowledge reality for what it is and not what is hoped for, it might become a Truth that is as scary as a Flying Monkey. This Film is a Wonderful way to open the "doors of perception". That is the least and the best that the Movies can offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wonder of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My early plan to watch Sam Raimi's OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL (2013) has been successfully foiled by the tepid reviews and in fear of another ALICE IN WONDERLAND (2010, 6/10) travesty, then it stroke to me that I had never even watched the worldly-famous 1939 version, it must be a presumably safe and better alternative. I'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio- based product. It all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye. The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz. Despite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Acting-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill. Overall, it is a cartoonish adaption of children's best-known bedtime story, may be predisposed to be an overrated sensation which stands flimsily after a serious filmic anatomy, but the bent of director Victor Fleming and his crew has been testified positively through the arduous endeavor, and one can still relish 75-or-so years after its inception.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of the most quintessential classics of cinema. Chances are that you've seen it aired every Thanksgiving, or you've seen clips of it all over the place, of you've heard the songs sung and resung, or you've seen parodies. The Wizard of Oz has become so ingrained in American culture that the film, its scenes, its characters, its music, its dialogue, and just about everything is instantly recognizable and endearing.To be perfectly honest, this is a really short and silly film. The comedy, especially with so many silly lines, is still hilarious to this day. There is peril and adventure in short bursts, and such scenes have become seriously iconic. Frequently catchy musical numbers add to the overall whimsey of the picture. There's hardly a dull moment in this film, and most moments are memorable and fun.The story is a short and simple affair. It takes a stretch to believe something this fantastic, but the film plays things so straight that it successfully immerses the audience. Characters aren't terribly deep or fleshed-out, but they stand out really well. In the end, it's the themes that count. On one hand, it's a fundamental fantasy adventure: the classic there-and-back-again tale, in which the characters embark on their journey and come back stronger and wiser. With the film's ending, such themes are made even stronger, when it's revealed that it may have all been in Dorothy's dream. The big reveal for the actual wizard of Oz is also a thematically strong moment, as it underscores a key theme regarding magic and imagination; it's a theme that not only extends to the characters of the story, but also reaches beyond the screen and demonstrates movie-making magic on a fundamental level. If there's any thematic weakness, it's purely in the very very end, when Dorothy concludes that it's much better to stay at home than it is to have an adventure (she almost makes it sound like she'll be a recluse from then on, which kinda defeats the purpose of everything, in my opinion).This film is well-filmed with steady and solid photography. It's most distinctive for utilizing both black-and-white and color photography together, to create a stark contrast between reality and fantasy. Acting is extremely goofy and over-the-top, but it all works for the film's benefit. It's always a hoot to watch Margaret Hamilton as the iconic villain, while Judy Garland and the rest of the cast provide much zeal and spirit to their roles. Writing is pretty silly, but it builds the story really well and features some very memorable lines. This production uses some rather limited sets, props, and costumes, many of which are outlandish and very fake-looking, but provide enough of an illusion to craft a vibrant spectacle with limited resources. Music is catchy and memorable.This movie is a must-see, if for no other reason than for its prestige and popularity throughout the decades. Highly recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

She then ends up in the land of oz where she is told by the good witch of the north and the munchkins she had killed the wicked witch of the east. And tells her to follow the yellow brick road to emerald city to see the great wizard of oz in order to get back home.along the way, she comes across the scarecrow,tin man and the cowardly lion while being chased by the wicked witch of the west for her ruby shoes.Now this is one of the most memorable and favourite films I ever watched.The songs are amazing though random at times,the characters are likable and humorous, the effects and sets are stunning to look and has some the most celebrated scenes and quotes e.g. the witch's henchmen and the quote "I'll get you my pretty and your little dog too!".Obiviously, everyone remembers this marvellous film and we will still remember this timeless family flick for future generations to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget about polls and box office records. In real terms The Wizard of Oz is almost certainly the most beloved motion picture of all time. It glitters among the brightest jewels of the most effective movie-making factory in cinema history, in the industry's undisputed golden age.Oz is of course a timeless masterpiece, enjoyed by every new generation that discovers it. However, much of its secret is in how much a product of classic-era Hollywood it is. Rather than simply turn the book into images, the writers and producers' aim was to meld the story around the best elements from contemporary movie lore. The dialogue, and in particular Yip Harburg's lyrics, are full of the wisecracks and wordplay of 1930s comedy. Herbert Stothart's arrangements of Harold Arlen's sublime melodies have the same playful harmonic style that he used for the popular Jeanette MacDonald musicals. Even the art design references the fashions of the day ? the Emerald City looks like nothing less than an art deco hotel! And of course the ingenious decision to shoot Kansas in sepia and Oz in Technicolor expresses the wonder of that vibrant and at the time relatively novel process.But really the most Tinseltown thing about Wizard of Oz is its cast. People like Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr aren't acting in the sense of submerging themselves and trying to become the characters they play. They are doing the reverse; playing the characters in the style of their own persona. Whatever role he appeared in, Frank Morgan always played the part of a lovable charlatan, fumbling his words and bluffing his way through. Billie Burke was perennially fussy and mumsy, and was only ever a wand away from being a fairy godmother. Bolger, Lahr and Jack Haley did not have quite the high-profile screen personas of Morgan and Burke, but they were nevertheless the kind of comedy-novelty players upon which the Hollywood musical thrived.And the directors were not of the arty, individualist "auteurs" that mainstream film theory has reserved for posterity. King Vidor (who directed the Kansas scenes) and Victor Fleming (who directed almost everything else) were professional studio employees. Nevertheless each had their particular strengths they brought to a project, and, even though it is coincidence that the switch was made when it was, each is ideally suited to the material they are responsible for. Vidor was very much the romanticist of the outdoors, and his measured pace and beautiful shot composition give the right note of sentimentality to the place Dorothy calls home. Vidor's delicate camera-work for "Over the Rainbow" adds to the enchantment of the number. He keeps Judy Garland at the centre of the screen, but gently pans and tilts to bring the horizon and then the sky around to frame her, keeping the image moving in time with the music. Fleming on the other hand was a man of action, and he gives a punch and dynamic rhythm to the vivid fantasy world. The Wizard of Oz may be fashioned in the Hollywood style, but studio production was more than just a collection of gimmicks and trimmings. They really knew how to tell stories. The movie adaptation transforms a cute fairy tale into an epic fable about wanderlust, homesickness and finding one's true self. Its appeal is universal and timeless because it speaks so sincerely to its audience. And to do so with such wit and beauty is really what cinema is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern man making myth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Crichton wrote in his 1987 novel Sphere that whereas Greek mythology was "common knowledge" in ancient times, today there are educated people who do not know it. Is it that we have abandoned myth altogether? Maybe not- he goes on to write "Perhaps these are our new myths. Dorothy and Toto and the Wicked Witch..." The Wizard of Oz, the classic 1939 movie, attempts to bring a modern-day, American-made mythology to life. And there's no doubt it succeeded. The film has reached legendary status, to the point where others have referenced it- Oz references appear in various places in my DVD collection, from Arrested Development to Futurama, and from The Simpsons to Gremlins 2.What gives the movie its power? There is some emotion in the movie, thanks in part to Judy Garland who played Dorothy. I felt sad for her when her dog Toto was taken away to be put down. The dog escaped and went back to her, and she ran away to keep the dog safe. Then a tornado hits- and she's lost in a fantastic land. First off, I'll note Oz has great colour- better colour than some movies made decades later. The things we see there are a triumph of imagination: talking trees, a horse of a different colour, flying monkeys. Some of it is twisted- the munchkins celebrate the death of a witch, complete with a munchkin coroner. That's a little morbid, and later the wizard sends Dorothy and her friends to kill the other evil witch. If this is a little dark, well, so was Greek myth.The underlying message of the movie is that "There's no place like home"- don't leave home. Of course, we often do have to leave home when we grow up. And what about Toto? When they go back to Kansas, the dog still might be put down, right? This is a point that may have been too bleak to say outright in the movie- the dog probably will be put down, but that's not a reason to run away. So the "don't leave home" message is aimed primarily at kids, it seems. Maybe there's stuff of interest to adults too- maybe the scarecrow and the tin man represent the common people, farmers and woodsmen, subject to powerful people who can be either good or wicked (the witches- the Wicked Witch's Kansas counterpart is said to be a major land or business owner). Either way, the movie is a landmark in the history of fantasy fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What childhood would be without it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: In almost every way, a landmark in cinema history.After seeing James Cameron's AVATAR yesterday, I think it would be wise to reminisce on the one movie that started it all. Nope, not STAR WARS. It's none other than Victor Fleming's THE WIZARD OF OZ. Yes, all the magic, all the wonders and all the visual accomplishments that we have come to achieve today began in 1939 when Dorothy and Toto set foot on Oz, with the mundane Sepia transforming into pristine Technicolor, as seen for the very first time. Ever since then, THE WIZARD OF OZ has become part of the movie-going culture that it's almost virtually impossible that anyone has not seen it, at least once.I admit it's been a long time since I saw OZ (the last time, I think, was when I was introducing it for the first time to my little brothers), but the memory of seeing it will forever be etched into my mind. Here's a bit of cinema that's hard to forget. Almost everything about it spells "classic" or "landmark cinema". That's a lot to be said about a movie which only started out as a family film, based on L. Frank Baum's books, about a little girl (Garland) and her dog carried away by a freak tornado into a land populated by a good witch, a wicked witch, a walking scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, a cowardly Lion and a wonderful wizard we have all come to know and love.The music has since become part of culture (I can no longer recall how many times me and a friend of mine quite "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" during conversations) and the visuals, although not as flashy today, are still as visibly groundbreaking and still absolutely gorgeous. Indeed, the Ruby Slippers are still a treasure, the Emerald City still as emerald is it was and even that multicolored horse in the Merry ol' Land of Oz still looks wonderful. Among other reasons (not to mention, one of the most cleverest twist in disposing of the villain) makes THE WIZARD OF OZ the classic that it was.Rating: ***** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film still scares the ever-loving daylights out of me. It is a terrific fantasy film. It passed well beyond the other films of its time. The scenery and the costumes really put it above and beyond. The acting is terrific, as well. The film used three-strip technicolor. The detail is was amazing. Judy Garland played a wonderful Dorothy. The flying monkeys still cause me to look away. If you play it side-by-side with Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon", it's twice as good. The shooting and cinematography is great. The splicing of black and white with colored shots is nice. For example, Dorothy sees her Aunt Em on the Wicked Witch of the West's crystal ball; she is then replaced by a vision of the Witch. Aunt Em appears only in black-and-white, while the Witch appears in the crystal ball in full color. It's a cool effect. It's also a good movie. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say that "The Wizard of Oz" is a masterpiece is almost an understatement. It is absolutely beautiful and wonderful. Looking at it here in 2009 it is amazing to think it was made seventy years ago. What an achievement.The star of the show is the transition from the black-and-white of Kansas to the color of Oz. You cannot believe your eyes. The characters are just so right. Their mission makes sense and it is great how it is all accomplished. It is very hard to comment on this film because there is just so much that could be said about it. Sitting here writing this right now is very difficult because my head is racing with ideas and things that I want to say. I feel like I could write a fifty page review on it. It is so clich now for stories to end with "it was all just a dream", but back then it wasn't. Even if this was made today, the dream ending would not seem like a cheap ending because it just fits so perfectly. It is definitely the best one in cinema history. This is a film that everyone should see. It will never become outdated. It is truly perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This by far is my favorite movie of all time. I have never seen anything that would ever surpass it. How wonderful every aspect of this movie is. From the lighting to the costumes to the scenes. Victor Flemming out did himself on this film in so many ways. Even though he made his mark directing films all the way from 1919-1956 this by far I believe to be the best film he had ever directed. (Gone with the wind, Joan of Arc, and Dr. Jekyl &amp; Mr. Hyde are other classics of his- but in my opinion they are not in the same boat as this film!) From the moment the film started you were caught up with Dorthy Gale (Judy Garland) and cant take your eyes off her. So beautiful and innocent. For this film only being 101 minutes long it seems much longer because it was so detailed and vibrant. Even today if you watch the movie you still get caught up in it and end up loving it no matter who you are or what age. I also believed Margaret Hamilton (The Wicked Witch of the West) did such an amazing job. I watched this movie for probably the 100th time in my life and her character still shakes me up a little bit. I loved how the movie went from sepia tone and when the gates of oz opened up then it went into Technicolor. I thought that was such an amazing effect, especially for its time. The lighting and scenes in this movie are totally MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) quality. Each scene, costume, lighting, character, is out of this world cool and back then so expensive. Bright lighting throughout the film showed how much money time and effort Fleming put into this film. Timeless classic, must see, life isn't complete without seeing it. Lions, and tigers, and bears- OH MY! I've got you my pretty! And your little dog too! Follow the Yellow Brick Road---- And who could forget--- the munchkins!!! We represent the Lolly-pop kids the Lolly-pop kids- THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is without a doubt, a HARDCORE classic! It has beautiful scenery, awesome characters, and great effects for that time period. This year, The Wizard of Oz is 70 years old, and it's still going strong! In case you have no idea what it's about, I'll give a brief synopsis; Dorothy Gale lives with her aunt and uncle. She has a pet named Toto. When Miss Gulch takes Toto away, Toto escapes and runs back to Dorothy. Soon, she runs away from home, and runs into Professor Marvel. He's a fake psychic that tells her that her Auntie Em is sick, so Dorothy and Toto run back home, then a storm comes and takes Dorothy and Toto to Oz, a place over the rainbow. She lands in Munchkinland, and the house accidentally lands on Wicked Witch of the West's sister, which pisses her off and Dorothy magically have the ruby slippers on her feet. Glinda, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy to see the Wizard so she can get back home. On her way, she befriends Scarecrow, Tinman, and Lion, who also seek help from the Wizard. Will Dorothy get back home and stop the Wicked Witch of the West? I highly recommend THE WIZARD OF OZ!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wizard of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz (1939) is a fantasy musical film from MGM during its golden years. The actors that play the Oz roles are Ray Bolger (Scarecrow), Jack Haley (Tin Man), Bert Lahr (Cowardly Lion), Margaret Hamilton (Wicked Witch of the west), Frank Morgan (Emerald City Doorman/Cabbie/The Wizard's Guard/The Wizard of Oz), and Judy Garland (Dorothy Gale). Also all these actors and actresses (except Dorothy Gale) play a double role in Kansas and Oz. The Kansas roles are Ray Bolger (Hunk), Jack Haley (Hickory), Bert Lahr (Zeke), Margaret Hamilton (Miss Almira Gulch), and Frank Morgan (Professor Marvel). During the opening of the movie there is a message saying, "For nearly forty years this story has given faithful service to the Young in Heart; and Time has been powerless to put it kindly philosophy out of fashion. To those of you who have been faithful to it in return...and to the Young in Heart...we dedicate this picture." This makes the movie sounds like it's a fantasy for children or more or less for little girls. As the film progresses Dorothy comes in the farm to complain about Almira and how she is being mean to Toto the dog. Later Almira comes to take her dog with a sheriff warrant. As she rides the bike back to town with the dog in the back in the basket, the dog escapes and runs back to Dorothy. As soon as the dog comes back Dorothy realizes that Almira is going to come back and she decides to run away. As she is traveling she runs into professor Marvel, whom she asks if she can travel with him. But later the professor decides that he doesn't want her to come with him some he makes up lies about Dorothy aunt getting sick. As Dorothy rushes back to her aunt's farm there is a tornado by the farm. Locking the animals away the farm residents decide to go underground. When Dorothy arrives the tornado is close to the farm and the trees are flying off the ground as Dorothy runs to the house. This scene doesn't make sense because on average a tree weights more than a human being. Dorothy hides in the house and the window hits her; resulting she gets knocked unconscious on the bed. When she wakes up she realizes she is inside the tornado and she sees Almira riding her bike laughing and Almira turns into the wicked witch. While the tornado stops she realizes she is in some fantasy land (Oz). Dorothy is accused of being the savior of the munchkin people because she fell with her house on the wicked witch of the East that controlled them (munchkin people). The mayor of the munchkins calls it the day of independence because the death of the witch. Later Dorothy goes on a journey wearing the ruby slippers that the wicked witch of the west wants. While on her journey to meet the wizard that can take back to Kansas she meets a scarecrow (that is not scary), a tin man (who needs oil), and a tiger (who is a coward). While they are on the journey the wicked witch of the west plots a plan to put the crew to sleep. It works but only the scarecrow and tin man are not placed under the spell. They start yelling help and the good witch of the north makes it snow and wakes them up. They reach the city and all the residents are wearing green as they freshen up the wicked witch of the west come and scare the residents by spelling surrender Dorothy, leaving everyone in panic. Dorothy realizes that there is no wizard of oz and she breaks down and starts crying; as she is telling her story about her aunt getting sick the emerald city door man hears her and takes her to the wizard. When they see him they are petrified of the great fire and the floating head of the wizard. The wizard decides to grant them their wish only if they bring the broomstick of the witch of the west. Dorothy and the three go and search for the witch in the haunted forest and Dorothy and her dog get kidnapped by flying monkeys. Toto escapes to look for the other three and takes them to rescue Dorothy. Dorothy kills the witch with water, which is one of the worst endings one can think of. The crew gets the broom back and goes back to the wizard of oz and Dorothy discovers that he is a fake. Wizard leaves Dorothy and the good witch of the north arrives and tells her the truth that she can go back whenever she pleases. Then Dorothy awakens with her aunt and friends there and she tells them her story of fantasy. This picture is a little bit childish but it can be easily the movie of the 1940's, because of the color tone added to the black and white picture as soon as Dorothy goes into her fantasy state. The cuts and scenes of this movie are in a proper sequence except for the fact when she is in the tornado and the house falls there needs to be more details. When the house falls the scene doesn't show the witch getting hit and the impact of the house falling. The wizard of Oz is a movie that is remembered and cherish by many younger generations. The lesson learned from this movie is that running away is never good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overcoming One's Own Character Limitations is a Daunting Task</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overcoming one's own character limitations in youth is a necessary but a daunting task. Those who resign themselves to the safe harbor of postponing efforts to take on risks and challenges have their character development set in time. The characters in the movie, the cowardly lion, the heartless tin man, and brainless scarecrow all symbolize the character flaws in Dorothy's real life adult friends back home. To some degree, Dorothy collectively had each one of those flaws. We see in Dorothy an intelligence, courageous, and a good-hearted young lady. When Dorothy suffers a concussion and drifts into a coma, she mentally commits herself to overcoming those flaws. A mental challenge known as the trip down the "yellow brick road." Her initial expectation was to painlessly be cured by Wizard of Oz and sent home. The Wizard, however, prescribed an arduous journey that would put to test all her capacities. She would have to confront evil in the world, in the form of the Wicked Witch of the West. From her trial and tribulations would emerge her renewed self. In the process, she would show care, compassion, and a deep concern for her companion's safety and well-being. It was Dorothy's final act of forgiveness and concern towards one who would do her harm that would put her over the threshold.</fullReview>

The only thing we can hope for is that one day sometime soon someone will aim to achieve a film like this one. While it is true that the oft repeated theme "There's No Place Like Home," is a wishful proclamation both simplistic and conventional, everyone can take pleasure instead in its myriad of sublime details, foremost Judy Garland's performance, indeed, the entire cast's, as well as the unforgettable story, songs, cinematography, sets, costumes, lighting, sound, etc. Hollywood craft at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Logic of "Oz"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times have you heard the words "Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore" in your lifetime? Afterall it's one of the most cherished film quotes in the history of film. The line, although simple, is powerful in itself, and introduces the turn of the film.Let's start from the beginning, and break it down...Exposition: Dorothy is a girl from Kansas who dreams of more than the boring farm life she is used to.Rising Action: One day, a tornado comes along and transports Dorothy and her dog, Toto, to the magical land of Oz, which resides over the rainbow. Upon her arrival, Dorothy meets Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, who directs Dorothy to the powerful, but mysterious, Wizard of Oz. Soon, Dorothy sets out on a quest down the Yellow-Brick Road, to the Emerald City. Along the way, she has a run-in with the Wicked Witch of the West, who is mad at Dorothy for dropping a house on her sister and taking the ruby slippers that the sister was wearing. Dorothy also meets the Scarecrow, who desperately wants a brain, the Tin Man, who desperately wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion, who is in desperate need of courage. They all join together to go to the Emerald City, where the Wizard lives. When they reach the city, and meet the Wizard, he tells them to kill the Wicked Witch of the West, and retrieve her broomstick. On the way to the castle, Dorothy and Toto are taken by the witch's flying monkeys and held captive in the castle. Toto escapes and finds the others. He leads the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle to save Dorothy.Climax: The Wicked Witch of the West sets the Scarecrow on fire, and, in attempt to extinguish the flames, Dorothy throws a bucket of water upon the Wicked Witch and melts her. Triumphed, the four friends set out back to the Emerald City to claim their gifts.Falling Action: Dorothy and her friends arrive at the Emerald City only to find that the Wizard is a big fake with no power whatsoever. He does, however, help the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion realize that they've had what they've been looking for all along. That just leaves Dorothy. The Wizard decides to take Dorothy back to Kansas himself in his balloon. But the balloon departs before Dorothy can climb in, and she is back to square one. Almost right after, Glinda arrives and tells Dorothy that she has always had the power to go home. All she has to do, Glinda says, is to click her heels three times, and say "There's No Place Like Home!"Resolution: Dorothy is home, with her family and friends, where she plans to stay for a long time.So, you see, if you think about it, this movie is very logical, and if you haven't already, make sure to see this movie as soon as possible. You'll find that this film is the definition of a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Iconic, fantastical, loved by millions: The Wizard of Oz should be made compulsory viewing for all under-fives before their minds are polluted by the some of the drivel that passes for children's entertainment these days. Packed to the gills with imaginative characters, lavish set design, impressive special effects, wonderful songs and boasting unforgettable performances from nearly all those involved, what child could resist this landmark of fantasy cinema? As Dorothy and Co. made their way to the Emerald City, battling flying monkeys and wicked witches on the way, my daughter sat transfixed, temporarily transported to the land of Oz in her mind; I sat next to her, temporarily transported back to my childhood, when it would be shown on TV every Christmas. And perhaps that's the appeal of the film for many adults: the magical sense of nostalgia that accompanies every viewing, a reminder of the innocence of childhood before growing up made things complicated, the comfortable feeling that comes from watching an old familiar favourite.If you're the parent of a small child, do them a favour and get this film for them now. Fill their minds with the wonder of Oz?they'll thank you for it when they're older. And give yourself a treat too?watch it with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpieces Of Technicolor: The Wizard Of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard Of Oz (1939): Starring Judy Garland, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Margaret Hamilton, Billie Burke, Frank Morgan, Clara Blandick, Charlie Grapewin, Pat Walsh, Charles Becker...Director Victor Fleming, Screenplay Noel Langley Released in 1939, "The Wizard Of Oz" was not the only film of that time to be presented in the new cinematic Technicolor. "Gone With The Wind", which swept the Oscars that year, was also a masterpiece of Technicolor, and like this film, a classic of America cinema. There is much to admire in "Wizard Of Oz", which has taken its place in cinematic history as America's most beloved family classic. Drawn from the novel by L. Frank Baum, this was not the first version to appear in film. Dramatic silent film renditions were made between 1910-1914 "The Wizard Of Oz" and "His Majesty, The Scarecrow Of Oz" based on the Baum novels. But this was a phenomenal musical version, starring Judy Garland in a signature role. She portrays Dorothy Gayle, a girl from Kansas who lives with her Aut Em and Uncle Henry and seems to have a difficult time fitting in. Before long, a tornado whisks her away to an enchanted world of elfin creatures called Munchkins and a beautiful enchantress Glinda (Billie Burke) who tell her that the only way out is through an audience with the mysterious Wizard of the Emerald City. Dorothy and her dog Toto start down the Yellow Brick Road and encounter a trio of characters which have become household names - The Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), The Tin Man (Jack Haley) and The Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr). The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton in a terrific performance) is after Dorothy, hell-bent on killing her and retrieving the powerful ruby slippers. The unforgettable songs like Follow The Yellow Brick Road, Somewhere Over The Rainbow by Harold Arlen became top American songs of the 20th century. This film is pure magic, unlike anything of its time. When Dorothy leaves behind the dull, black-and-white world of Kansas, audiences are literally transported from the earlier black-and-white films of the 20's and 30's to the new and vibrant world of Technicolor, which is Oz. This film not only represents the Golden Age of early Technicolor cinema, but it is a story that has a powerful theme of returning to one's home, of finding one's identity. Dorothy, far from being a flat character, journeys from awkward, flighty girl to courageous, mature young woman who has acquired a sense of self and, whether we believe she dreamed Oz or lived it, she can now live her life with a renewed sense of confidence. This movie can never go out of style. It remains a classic of American cinema. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're off to see the Wizard, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz..."It's impossible to simply read that line. One sees it and can't help but start humming that oh so familiar tune. Heck, forget humming, maybe you just want to burst out singing. And therein lies the magic of The Wizard of Oz, undoubtedly, and deservedly, one of the most beloved films of all time. Magical, and downright revolutionary in many ways, when it first premiered in 1939, The Wizard of Oz stands the test of time, forever a treat for all ages. What does this film have going for it? Start with a brilliantly conceived, and executed, story. Add in some of the most memorable acting performances of all time. Toss in what for the time was startlingly brilliant color and dazzling cinematography. Don't forget the wonderful special effects, which may seem mundane by modern standards, but which were simply amazing for their time. And oh, have I mentioned the songs? You'll be humming, or singing, for weeks after watching this one. "We're Off To See The Wizard", "Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead!", "If I Only Had A Brain/Heart/Nerve", "Merry Old Land Of Oz", "It Really Was No Miracle"...each a toe-tapping, stick in your brain and refuse to leave treasure. And of course there is what would become Judy Garland's signature song, the incredibly poignant "Over The Rainbow", perfect in every way for the character of farm girl Dorothy in this film and made all the more poignant knowing the troubles which lay ahead for Garland in the years following the making of The Wizard of Oz.Who doesn't know by now the story of The Wizard of Oz? The film takes a little while to get moving in sepia-toned Kansas but those opening scenes are critical in introducing us to some very important people we'll encounter again in different guises later on. Once a twister picks up Dorothy's house and transports her and her dog, Toto, to Oz the real fun begins. When Dorothy opens the sepia-toned door of her house all of a sudden the screen is bursting with the most brilliant color you will ever see. The transition from dreary Kansas to magical Oz is simply breathtaking. And now the real fun begins. After spending some time with the tiny inhabitants of Munchkinland, and encountering witches both good and wicked, Dorothy follows the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where she hopes to meet the Wizard of Oz who may be the only one who can help her return home to Kansas. That journey along the yellow brick road may well be the most magical in film history.While Judy Garland in the role of Dorothy is the unquestioned star of the film The Wizard of Oz is graced with universally brilliant performances from a wonderfully diverse and talented cast of characters. Most notable are Dorothy's companions along the yellow brick road, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Cowardly Lion, played by Ray Bolger, Jack Haley and Bert Lahr respectively. Even hidden behind layers of makeup, these three actors still manage to give their characters tremendous personality, something so critical in allowing the audience to identify with the characters they portrayed. Garland is undeniably brilliant but The Wizard of Oz just would not be the same without the extraordinary, and often overshadowed, talents of Bolger, Haley and Lahr. Special recognition to Bolger, the perfect scarecrow, who twists and turns and contorts himself in such a manner it's hard to believe he has a bone in his body.Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch, Margaret Hamilton as Dorothy's adversary, The Wicked Witch, and Frank Morgan in a number of memorable roles also have key parts to play and they are each terrific as well. And of course there are the multitude of Munchkins who provide a truly surreal beginning to Dorothy's magical journey. There's really not much to quibble with here, everything is almost pitch-perfect. Perhaps the opening scenes in Kansas could move a little quicker and maybe the stay in Munchkinland could be a little briefer, as the tiny Munchkins' cute factor begins to wane just a touch. But once Dorothy sets off on that yellow brick road The Wizard of Oz is undeniably one of the most magical movie experiences ever seen. A classic in its time and a classic for all time.</fullReview>

My favorite character is the wicked witch of the west, though I love all the characters. I love all the singing and music and colors everything is just so alive and beautiful. I think that every one should see this movie. One of my favorite scenes from the movie is when the lolly pop kids are singing to her and thanking her for killing the wicked witch. I love how they built the castle and the horse of a different color. The door man and the face on the wall, everything is perfect.

Once you really start thinking about it, the story is very simple and there almost at times isn't even a clear main plot line. None of it matters though. It's simplicity and charm makes this movie still so perfectly watchable and enjoyable this present day. The story and characters are timeless and than it no longer matters that the sets and other visuals things are outdated. It's a movie that still appeals many, for a good reason.The movie is extremely cheerful and really has this typical pre-WW II kind of innocence over it. The musical and dancing moments are the best example of this. It's typical MGM stuff and it makes this movie so incredibly charming to watch. It's no wonder that this movie is dedicated to 'the Young in Heart'. The young in heart and those with a vivid imagination will love this movie.The movie is wonderfully directed by Victor Fleming, who replaced Richard Thorpe, in the same year as he made another timeless classic; "Gone with the Wind".All of the Kansas sequences are filmed in 'black &amp; white', while all the sequences in Oz are filmed in bright Technicolor. It makes the imaginative world and story work even better and more cheerful. I really find this way of movie-making to be a stroke of genius.The young Judy Garland is absolutely perfect and wonderful as Dorothy Gale. Truly a memorable classic performance.A unique movie that still holds up today, thanks to its charm and imaginative elements. A must see for all who are young at heart.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you remember the first time Dorothy opened the door to Oz and it was in COLOR??? It still makes me excited!! This movie has all the hokey standard Hollywood gimmicks--home is the best place of all, good girl vs evil "witch"--but you still find yourself rooting for Dorothy every time, and waiting patiently for them to get the witch. It never grows old for me!! Even with all the pre-production problems this movie underwent, it is a visually stunning movie (the afore mentioned change to color being the highlight). Judy Garland is perfect as the young naive girl who thinks she can find happiness "over the rainbow", and the rest of the cast is sublime, especially Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch--and yes, she still can give me goose bumps!! Might be a little scary for really young kids, but it's sooooo much fun!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an annual event for me growing up. And I had a children's record and a colorfully illustrated version of the book. Eventually, I realized i had seen this movie so many times there was no point in seeing again. Until my parents finally got a color TV in 1986. I saw this in color for the first time and experienced the movie in a whole new way. And for the first time I got the joke about the 'Horse of a Different Color'. Later, there was a behind-the-scenes special hosted by Angela Lansbury that gave me new insights.In the last several times I have seen this movie, I found new ways to appreciate this movie, and saw things I hadn't seen before. I won't go into all of them here.The real sign of a quality movie: everyone gives a good performance, regardless of how few lines. The head of the Witch's guards had only three lines but his delivery was worthy of the great epic movies. And even the dog gave a good performance!Judy Garland may have given the best performance by a teen in the history of motion pictures. I can't imagine anyone else in the role, even though Frank Baum wrote the book for a younger girl and Shirley Temple was considered. Not only did Garland make Dorothy quite appealing and intelligent, but she could sing like few actors have. It was only in recent years that I truly appreciated the excellence of Frank Morgan. I didn't realize for many years that he played the bumbling guard at the entrance to Emerald City, or the carriage driver, or the frustrated man who wouldn't let anyone in to see the Wizard. He was very funny in those roles, of course, but even Professor Marvel was something special, kindly and caring even as he was being deceptive. The Wizard, of course, was a very fine role, and Morgan portrayed the man brilliantly. Such a warm and compassionate man when he could be, but scared to face other people and reveal who he really was, and somewhat scatterbrained--this was part of his appeal.Just as Dorothy did, I believe I liked The Scarecrow most of all. Ray Bolger did another excellent job, giving the character warmth, humor and friendliness and, yes, intelligence. And he could dance! He had great chemistry with Dorothy and with The Lion. And probably the Tin Man, too. The Lion had a unique appeal. He was very funny because he tried to act tough but was really scared of everything. Fighting for Dorothy, though, gave him courage. Margaret Hamilton made The Wicked Witch of the West one of the scariest characters in motion pictures. Add music, and this movie can be truly chilling. And yet, there was a certain fake kindness in her manner. As Miss Gulch in Kansas, she was also quite evil.As evil as The Witch of the West was, that's how very kind The Witch of the North came across. So compassionate and perky. And The Munchkins were fun. I haven't mentioned The Tin Man much, but he just wasn't one of my favorite characters. But Jack Haley made him such an emotional character for someone who said he didn't have a heart. He cared so much about Dorothy. I can't forget Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. She was a stern but loving substitute mother for Dorothy, and Uncle Henry was comical and not particularly believable as someone who could run a farm (Aunt Em seemed like she ran things). I'd have liked to have known Uncle Henry better.And the music! Not just 'Over the Rainbow', one of the great musical performances in movie history, but also the very funny songs in Oz. And in the 1930s, background music could usually be very pleasant. Even in the tornado, as objects and even men in a rowboat flew by!As I said, I have a version of the book. I have also seen John Ritter's TV movie on the life of Frank Baum. There are times when this movie wavers from Baum's version. Instead of being isolated in a very spartan home, Dorothy's family lives in a community and in a nice house (for their economic status, anyway), with farm hands who showed up later in the movie along with a fortune teller and a troublemaking busybody also not part of the book. The adventure was a dream. No Witch of the South (The Witch of the North appears twice). No green glasses in Emerald City because everything is green. I have no problem with any of these because the movie was so perfectly executed. Is this too scary for kids? The tornado certainly was scary enough, and the Flying Monkeys too. I guess it's up to parents. But this is a wonderful adventure for all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Birth of Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz has given birth and inspired hundred's of fantasy films over the years and above all of them, this is still one of the best. With a colorful cast of characters and actors, a genius screenplay, and writer's imagination, The Wizard of Oz is the mother of all fantasy films and a milestone in film history.Dorothy (Judy Garland) is the loving daughter of a family in Kansas. She is caring and has a small friend in her dog Toto but one day while walking home, something incredible happens. A tornado hits the small town and Dorothy is knocked out by it and awakens in a house which she does not recognize. She walks outside to find tiny people walking about calling themselves Munchkins'. Suddenly the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) appears and accuses Dorothy of killing her sister. Dorothy is saved by the Good Witch Glinda (Billie Burke) and she is told that in order to return to Kansas she must follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Wizard of Oz. Along the way she meets a Tin Man, a Scarecrow, and a Cowardly Lion all seeking the wizard and decide to join Dorothy. But along the way she will be attacked by the Wicked Witch of the West and her evil flying monkeys. Only through companionship and determination will they be able to get past her minions and reach the wizard of Oz.The story is imaginative, it's creative, and it's plain old fun. The designing of each character is phenomenal from the cowardly lion desiring nothing but courage to the munchkins being a tiny clan of singing workers. The Wizard of Oz gave way for the art of story telling and imaginative thinking now present in some films. Judy Garland wasn't exactly the best choice for Dorothy but she held her own with the other actors. Jack Haley is the best of the companions being smart, friendly and in my opinion had the most thought put into. The Wizard of Oz. Starring: Judy Garland, Jack Haley, Bret Lahr, Ray Bolger, and Frank Morgan.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This One Takes Me Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nearly impossible for me to write objectively about the quality of "The Wizard of Oz," so bundled up is it with associations from my childhood. It's like trying to do a critical analysis of "Star Wars." Sorry, can't be done---at least, not by me. "Oz" is such a strange movie, in some ways so creaky and old-fashioned, in other ways so incredibly ahead of its time. Few films I've seen during my lifetime have such a complete vision as "Oz" does---such painstaking care went into the look and design of the film; it's as if the filmmakers really did create a whole other world for this film to take place in. It's odd that during a time in American film history, when movies were being cranked out like cars on an assembly line, a film could feel like such an auteurish product (increasingly odd, since the credited director, Victor Fleming, actually shared directing duties with several others. The same is true for "Gone with the Wind," released in the same year and also bearing Fleming's name as sole director. He was quite a lucky guy in 1939).The plot and feeling of "Oz" veers quite a bit from that of the book on which it is based. The book is much nastier and darker, but the film manages its fair share of grimness for all that. The Wicked Witch is spectacularly scary (Margaret Hamilton admits to regretting the intensity with which she approached this character) as are the Flying Monkeys. There's such a feeling of ominous dread under-laying this entire film. As if the land of Oz is a bit too beautiful and perfect, like a perfectly ripe piece of fruit that at any moment can begin to rot at the edges.Really, despite her scariness, the Witch is the most fun character in the film---it's really a riot to watch this film as an adult and enjoy her sarcasm and nastiness; it's refreshing as juxtaposed to the goody goodiness of the other characters. Frank Morgan in a variety of roles is also great.A cloud of darkness has come to surround this film over the last couple of decades, due to the urban legends about the stagehand supposedly caught on film hanging himself and the truly bizarre stories about the arduous process of making the film (and the many accidents and tragedies that occurred along the way). This reputation may be responsible for the cult status that has arisen around this film and perhaps even for elevating it to the level of admiration it has received.On a side note, an excellent book by Gregory Maguire called "Wicked" offers back story to the events leading up to "The Wizard of Oz," and most particularly focuses on the early life of the Wicked Witch of the West. It's an outstanding book, and I venture that you won't be able to watch "Oz" in quite the same way again after reading it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, how our Morals have changed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is one of the great film classics. Full of Magic, and vibrant Colors, funny creatures, and just a little bit of terror. Or that is how it is seen by most people A great family classic that will always be treasured.Its true, it is a great film. Very well made, and a very important piece of cinema. But lets look at the time period. Hitler was starting World War 2. The movie has something to say about that, with the Cowardly lion mocking the Dictator. But is that all the moral and political insight of the film?Of course not. The making of the film corresponded with major victories and major losses in the women's rights movement. Lets take a look at the setting. First, Kansas. Drab, boring, people love Dorothy with all their heart, but they still don't listen to her it would seem. The mean old woman, Ms. Gulch, wants to kill Dorothy's dog. Right now I would like to point out that the evil woman is MISS Gulch, not Mrs. Gulch.Now, Dorothy goes to Oz and is free of that burden. Her and Her dog can live peacefully. Or so they thought. We have another evil witch out to get Dorothy, who has the ruby slippers she wants. The Ruby slippers were given by The Good Witch of the North. And the only way to really stop the witch from trying to get her is to go home. To do that, she must go find the Wizard.Through the adventure we have the additional characters. AKA the male escorts, each lacking something that would make them a better man. Now, they are on a quest to gain something. Dorothy is on a quest, in a sense, to lose something. After all the hard work, the Wizard is unable to send her home despite giving everyone else what they need (or think they need). Dorothy is once again visited by the Good Witch of the North, who tells her she had the power to go home all along. But the Good Witch needed her to realize that she did not merely have to wish to go home, but accept that home is where she truly belongs.So basically, young girls, your entire life involves staying at home and finally settling down with a husband. Nowadays, people wouldn't give their support to a film like this. This classic, but utterly immoral piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's pop one bubble here, and I don't mean Glinda's transport</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years now, film reviewers (or those that believe they are) have begun articles bemoaning the "fact" that "Oz" was an initial flop in 1939. That is simply a filmmaking urban legend that is incorrect. While the film DID cost an astounding $2.5 million (plus) - equivalent to about $250 million today, in movie dollars - it sold out in roadshow engagements all over the country. Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland toured the nation, hosting these special showings, and the lines wound around the block EVERYWHERE they went. Granted, the second most expensive film at that time ("Gone With the Wind" placing first) would have to do double-time to make back the budget, but at its escalated cost - and with ticket prices varying between only 10 - 25 cents - it was indeed a success. Remember, this was in an era when films were rereleased numerous times, with studio heads expecting an extended life to recoup money, and make a profit.Granted, "Oz" didn't achieve "icon" status until its repeated TV showings, starting in the 50s, but even then it was already considered a draw for whatever network aired it.Unlike 20th Century Fox's Shirley Temple misfire the next year, "The Blue Bird," which was indeed a flop, "Oz" was one of MGM's crown jewels, and successes, of 1939.John Wayne's "The Alamo" also suffers from similar misinformation. The recent 2004 Disney version, with its $95 million operating budget, and approximately $45 million advertising costs, can indeed be considered a bomb, as it has taken in only approx $25 million (and its next stop is a none-to-promising video future). Wayne's 1960 version, however, cost $12 million (the most expensive at that date), and made nearly $10 million during its first several releases. Losses from that film were due mainly to Wayne's delayed production schedule, and not from a lack of public interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen The Wizard Of Oz all the way through since i was a little kid and watching it again certainly made me feel like i was 7 again. Somethings about it were amazing for 1939 and i bet it cost a pretty penny when it was being made. It's nice and colourful but the thing that left me the most impressed was the tornado's in the first black &amp; white segment. How did they put them in there back then? If it was now we would just think that they were CGI. I guess they just filmed a tornado and put it on a screen in the background and because it was B&amp;W you couldn't tell but still very impressive. All in all it's a film that withstood the test of time (unlike Judy Garland R.I.P.) and will still be watched by all ages for centuries to come. Magic. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard Of Oz is MGM Magic. The first film to use glorious technicolour. OK, so maybe it is overacted compared to todays standards but then again, acting isn't really the film's strongpoint. The film get's it's magic in the beautiful and colourful set design and also in the dazzling costumes.The black and white scenes are a little dull, but there is more than enough to compensate. The film's songs are dated, but still highly memorable.(Who can ever forget Follow the Yellow Brick Road). It's very easy to be cynical about The Wizard Of Oz, but it's still the classic it was nearly 65 years ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's No Place Like Home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Perhaps the most famous movie of all time! It's been around for 63 years. The books have been around for 102 years. Amazing isn't it? Our story opens, in black and white, on a farm in Kansas. Young Dorothy Gale tries to tell her Uncle Henry and Auntie Em that Almira Gulch had tried to take her dog Toto away when he accidentally wandered into her yard, but her peers were too busy to listen and merely told her to find a place where she wouldn't get into trouble. Dorothy wondered if such a place existed. Miss Gulch came by the house with a court order to take Toto, and she did, but he escaped so he and Dorothy ran away. They meet Professor Marvel, who's also a fortune teller (or so he says) he reports Auntie Em is sick so Dorothy raced home, but then a tornado had hit! Dorothy awakened in the house being carried off by the twister.  Pretty soon they landed. She then stepped outside into a world of Technicolor. She met the Munchkins and Glinda, the Witch of the North who were overjoyed that Dorothy's house had crushed the Wicked Witch of the East. But the Wicked Witch of the West was furious about this. She vowed revenge. Glinda placed the rub slippers from the East Witch onto Dorothy and told her to seek help from the Wizard who lived in Emerald City, far away. How to get there? Follow the yellow brick road. Along the way, Dorothy met a scarecrow that could not only not scare crows but didn't have a brain, so he joined Dorothy on her quest to see the Wizard. They stop to pick apples from an apple tree, but the tree wasn't too happy about that. There was an ambush and in the midst of it all, Dorothy and Scarecrow meet the Tin Man, who was merely a man made of tin. He had been rusted solid for over a year. They oiled him back to life. He claimed he didn't have a heart and wanted one very much, so he joined the friends on their quest. In the woods, they meet a lion, a cowardly lion. He badly wanted some courage, so he joined the gang.  The Wicked Witch of the West tried to stop them with poison poppies, but that didn't work. They finally reached Emerald City and met the Wizard, who said he would grant their requests upon bringing him the broomstick of the Wicket Witch of the West, so the friends went to get it. Dorothy and Toto were captured by the witch's flying monkeys. Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion got in the castle by dressing as guards. They break out Dorothy and run into a showdown with the witch. She sets Scarecrow on fire and Dorothy splashed water on him, which also splashed onto the witch, who melted! Her minions were overjoyed. So, they brought the Wizard what he wanted but he told them to return the next day. But Toto discovered the Wizard was actually a man behind the curtains. He did grant their requests: he gave Scarecrow a diploma to prove to him he had a brain all along. He gave Lion a courage metal, which proved he was always courageous but never knew it. He gave Tin Man a clock shaped like a heart, and Dorothy: he tried flying her home on his hot air balloon, but that attempt failed. Just then, Glinda appeared and told her the way to get home, so she tried it and it worked. Once back home in black and white, Dorothy was overjoyed and claimed there was no place like home. A very good movie. But nobody from it is still alive. Except for some of the munchkins, among them is the Lollypop Guild guy in green. I'm sure you've all seen this movie, but if you haven't, see it today!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't you just love fantasy movies? The real world is a dark and grim place at times so isn't it wonderful to switch on the TV and be transported away to a magical fantasy land with all manner of strange and interesting creatures? The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and hardly any fantasy film can claim to be as great as it.I have always been interested in fantasy-as a child, I just loved it. Good always triumphed over evil and the fantasy genre was always very moralistic.The story is beautiful as the late Judy Garland plays Dorothy who travels to the land of Oz and meets up with characters such as the Lion and the Scarecrow to have plenty of adventures and to battle the forces of evil.This is a lovely film which can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of age or movie preferences. It is a timeless classic and one which I would recommend to anyone.Simply beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The restored prints of 'Wizard of Oz' available on VHS or DVD are well worth viewing for full enjoyment of this timeless classic. Thanks to the splendid work of all the original technicians, it's a film that stands the test of time with the best of them. Judy Garland is the perfect embodiment of Dorothy, the girl who dreams of being "Over the Rainbow"; lanky, loose-limbed Ray Bolger is the ideal choice for Scarecrow; Jack Haley the definitive Tin Man; and Bert Lahr unforgettable as The Cowardly Lion. All of the supporting roles are expertly played, including Frank Morgan's tender job as the magician who tells Dorothy to go back to Aunt Em before the cyclone strikes. The magic was there in 1939 and has not diminished. Young and old can appreciate the artistry that went into the making of this spectacular children's fantasy, rivaled only by 'Mary Poppins' in terms of artistic merit. The perfect casting contributes to the film's greatness. Add a wonderful script, clever tunes (including Lahr's rendition of 'If I Were King of the Forest'), and Victor Fleming's sure-handed direction and you have a classic to treasure. Some of the art deco scenery may be a bit overstuffed at times but the charm and simplicity of the well-known tale cannot be underestimated. A true classic in glowing technicolor. Indeed, follow that yellow brick road!!</fullReview>

This movie has got all it needs; great actors, great music, great story, great environments, fantastic colours, drama and friendship. Younger people like me will perhaps remember the song "Somewhere over the rainbow" from a much newer Hollywood-movie; the actionmovie "Face/Off", but then the director of that movie loves classic musicals, like the classic "The Wizard of Oz".

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Classic. A Film For All Ages. Remember There's No Place Like Home!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard Of Oz is by now a cult classic. So many themes and principles are present to name a few there's boredom, escape, exploring new adventures, dreamed fantasies, wicked enemies becoming witches, friendship, journey and discovery and finally learning the true meaning of home and family. This movie has been seen by a billion people many like myself have viewed it a couple hundred times. Many good things can be said about this beloved 1939 classic Oz is simply more than just a movie about a dreamy Kansas farm girl who takes an unforgettable trip down the Yellow Brick Road to a magical fantasy world. This film made Judy Garland(Dorothy) a star, just to mention Garland brought a certain sex appeal to Oz she was one of the most beautiful actresses of her time it was tragic her life ended so young. For some unexplained reason I tend to have sexual thoughts and feelings now every time that I now watch Oz I can particularly relate to my own past intimate relationships with females when viewing Oz, but I now see the trigger factor is the beauty of Judy Garland. Margaret Hamilton is perfectly cast as The Wicked Witch of the West her wicked looks use to give me nightmares as a child when I would view Oz, but as time past and I matured the terror went away. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are all lovable characters hey wouldn't it be great to have friends like that on earth to help guide you on your journey of life. This film became a national institution, thanks to perennial TV airings, the Technicolor brilliance of Oz, and the song "Over the Rainbow". Many believe Oz gives a message of a continued journey that travel should be a regular that people should continue to travel and see new lands meet new people and search for answers. I instead take the message of Oz as there's no place like home. I have found this out from my own experiences. The world happens to be a very cold and cruel place as in comparison to home love, comfort, and support which are present. Knowledge can be found at home, and home is where the heart is, and courage is found inside your home. Remember there's no place like home.</fullReview>

I can't think of anything bad to say about it-if you don't like it-you just won't, and that's all there it, pure and simple.**** outta ****, still holds up real well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seek a fine print of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the joys of seeing "The Wizard of Oz" is viewing a pristine print. Over the years the extraordinary Technicolor original quality has been diminished due to old prints, which have long lost their bloom. Seeing a print as close to the original as possible is a unique film experience. Not a restored version, mind you, but one cast from the original negative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very endearing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a bit childish, but it's such a great movie. Plus, childish or not, I think that even adults can enjoy it as much as children. Not to mention that its charm stands the test of time. It's truly one of the greatest films of all time.In many ways, this movie resembles a theater play for children, thanks to its sceneries and backgrounds but also thanks to its unusual characters.Speaking of the characters, the Scarecrow is the funniest, but the Cowardly Lion is funny either. However, the Scarecrow is my favorite of the 3 Dorothy's friends. The story is intriguing. The songs are appealing (I'm not too keen on musicals, but the concept works well in this one). Many lines in the film are funny. The special effects are absolutely unbelievable for 1939 and wouldn't do ugly even today. I'm talking about the tornado sequence and, most of all, when the house gets caught by the tornado and is spinning in the air, followed by the images that Dorothy sees in the storm outside the window. It's a miracle that they could do this in a time when there was no such thing as technology.Another aspect in which the movie is way ahead of its time is in the use of sepia-tone and in the use of Technicolor, instead of the classic black and white. I'm glad about that, for it works so much better for this movie. I think this movie would have been strange if it was in black and white.Judy Garland is great as Dorothy Gale. Frank Morgan portrays 6 characters very well, including the Wizard. Ray Bolger is phenomenal as the Scarecrow, Jack Haley is terrific as the Tin Man and Bert Lahr is also great as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton is very convincing as the Wicked Witch of the West. Terry the dog also deserves praise as Toto, the endearing dog.Title in Portugal: "O Feiticeiro de Oz".</fullReview>

The Wizard of Oz is the Greatest Fantasy and Musical Film of all time. It's a must see for anyone child, and I believe anyone has the right to see this film. One of the most influential films of all time, and the definition of the word classic, The Wizard of Oz will amaze you with its sets, costumes and acting.The Wizard of Oz was made 86 years ago, but there has never been a greater Fantasty Film. The scene in which Dorothy goes from black and white to color is just breathtaking, and was a genius cinematic move by the filmmakers. I am guaranteed anyone will be amazed by the film.</fullReview>

I was so impressed over the film so i went to watch "The Wizard From Oz". And what a movie. You should never believe that this film is from the late 30's. The effects and music fit in the film. It deserve the 2 Academy Awards it has won for Best Music, Original Song and Best Music, Original Score. I found the film pretty funny with all the different character. This is one of the best films from the 30's. You can say many things about "The Wizard from Oz" but this film will never die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard Of Oz : From The Books To Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*This review is dedicated to my parents ,who were born in the 1930s.*I'll start by saying that many here say ,read the books ,they're better. Well, sure they are. I've read the 14 books by Frank L. Baum and they're classic American literature and simply fun to read as well.Frank L. Baum ,was a man with an imagination ,in a time and place in America ,when men weren't supposed to (or sometimes not allowed to) have one ,after they grew up. (For better insight into Mr. Baum and his books ,watch John Ritter's portrayal in the NBC, 1990 film ,"The Dreamer of Oz."The 1st filmed version was in 1925 but was laced with both personal &amp; racial stereotypes. As well as being a bit uneven. Nearly 15 years after that version ,came the film that really ,is the first live action movie made for young people. (Kids were not exactly a priority in the early days of movie making.) Now ,over the years ,many have complained that despite the positive message ,the humor and the happy songs sung in the film...it's very dark in many places. If you stop and think about it ...doesn't that sound like many of the movies ,for kids, made during the last 30+ years? The film's also accused of being 'heavy-handed' in it's attempt to make it's point. The 1930s 'were' a very gloomy time and this being a first attempt at this kind of movie ,it couldn't possibly have come across any other way. The people who went and saw this film in '39 ,not only saw the future of movies (unknowingly) but a reflection of their own era. Dorothy &amp; family live on a farm in Kansas ,in the Depression and are threatened by a powerful woman with money ,who feels she can bully and threaten them because she has more than they do. In that situation (and given that no one takes her seriously because she's a kid) Dorothy ,maybe like many in that time, wishes she could be someplace better and that place must be on the other side of rainbow. This isn't just something little children or kids could think. Adults can feel this way as well. What adult wouldn't want to escape the sometimes heavy responsibilities &amp; problems of life ,that they didn't have to deal with as a kid?Sure ,Dorothy finds problems when she gets to Oz. What kind of movie would it be if there weren't any? It'd be one giant tea party with music. In learning the lesson of 'there's no place like home' and that in seeking one ,'she should look no further than her own backyard' ,Dorothy has to see that no matter where you go, no place is perfect or without its problems....even Munchkinland. The witch is a severe problem. Scarecrow , Tin Man , Cowardly Lion and even the Wizard ,all have problems too. Dorothy's in a beautiful land but wants to leave it ,which is another problem. She got what she thought she wanted but realized ,she didn't. She wanted to be home with her family. With all the 'dark' things she goes through ,she does what most of us would do ,she fights for it! With help from her new friends in Oz. When she melts the witch, intended or not ,it was her passing the last test ,to get herself home.A test as well from Glinda ,because she knew why Dorothy had landed in Oz and she helped her see the reality of where it was she truly belonged. Could she have told Dorothy this ,yes ,but would she listen ,anymore than she'd have believed shoes could get her home instantly? All of the things many love The Wizard Of Oz for ,are either things we experience in our lives or that we wish we could do.This movie isn't just for little children or kids ,it's for everyone,of any age. I've watched it on CBS as a kid ,on video and DVD and in 1998 ,I got the pleasure of seeing it in a special 're-release' to movie theaters ,on the big screen. .... And The Wizard Of Oz , is for anyone who simply likes a good movie ,like I do. That and manymore reasons are why I rate it 10 stars. Aside from the lesson ,the real reason to watch the movie ,is to enjoy yourself. Nothing more or less than that. The characters,the story ,the songs ,the scenery and going from black &amp; white to color in a blink ...all a part of telling the world's simplest story of how there's no place like home. ...and home can be a house or even the real world we live in ,where we take the bad with the good. That's something that's as true today as it was over 75 years ago. {END]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember The wizard of Oz rather disappointed and with some fright. The voice of the Wizard impressed me. I saw it as a ten year old or even younger, on a big screen theater. Spoiler. I was disappointed that the Wizard of Oz was a humbug. I think I had great hopes of watching a wizard doing marvelous things. Spoiler He does not help Dorothy. And he occupies the Title above the marquee. Watching Angela Lansbury on the 70 Anniversary Bluray, it was not surprise to me that she said that the film showed losings. Maybe not many kids could stand the above facts. Angela Lansbury also states that 85 million Americans go in 1939 to the movies every week, and that it was the 65 percent of the whole population, but this was not a favorite. Maybe the above statements were influential. regards</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thinking Spoils This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is a delightful movie for children. Adults can enjoy it too, provided they don't spend any time thinking about it.The first problem that many critics have called attention to is the no-place-like-home theme. Back home, Dorothy is basically ignored and neglected, while she has great friends in Oz, which is a pretty nice place once the Witch has been eliminated. Like many Hollywood movies made in those days, this movie says we should just accept our lot in life, however drab and dreary it may be.This is made all the more outrageous by the reason Dorothy ran away from home in the first place. It's not that she thought the grass would be greener elsewhere, or something frivolous like that. She wanted to save the life of her dog Toto, whom Miss Gulch was determined to have destroyed, and had an order from the sheriff to back her up. Toto is the only friend she has, and saving his life is not only a good reason for her to leave, but also a good reason for her not to come back. As Dorothy lies there in bed at the end of the movie, I cannot help but think to myself that Miss Gulch will be back the next morning with that same order from the sheriff and take Toto away.Some people argue that Miss Gulch died during what the movie calls a cyclone but is really a tornado, because she corresponds to the Wicked Witch of the East, who died when the farm house landed on her. Well, Dorothy may have killed off Miss Gulch as a witch in her wish-fulfilling dream, but there is no reason to think that the real Miss Gulch is dead, especially since in the dream, the farm house landed on the Witch and crushed her, but nothing happened to the farm house in the real world. So there may be no place like home for Dorothy, but it is the dog pound for Toto, at least for a few days until he is destroyed.The sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, the Wicked Witch of the West, threatens Dorothy and her friends until Dorothy accidentally throws water on her, causing her to melt. Once the Witch is gone, her minions, the winged monkeys, are quite happy about the situation. It turns out that they were not evil themselves, but only did the Witch's bidding because they were afraid of her. Now that she is dead, they can be good winged monkeys.Condensing all the evil into a single person, the Wicked Witch, and then eliminating that person is all right for a fantasy movie, but it is simplistic thinking like that that has serious consequences in the real world. I suspect that George W. Bush and his advisers believed that Saddam Hussein was a "Great Man" like the Wicked Witch, and that all they had to do was get rid of him, and the citizens of Iraq would start singing "Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead," as they established a Jeffersonian democracy.Oddly enough, though the movie seems to subscribe to the Great Man theory in its treatment of the Witch as the sole source of evil in Oz, yet it takes the opposite tack in the scene that follows, in which the message seems to be that no one is better than anyone else. The Scarecrow needs a brain; the Tin Man needs a heart; and the Cowardly Lion needs some courage. They hope to get these things from the Wizard of Oz, which is why they have been accompanying Dorothy to the Emerald City. In the end, however, the Wizard of Oz is just a fraud with no special powers, so he cannot give the Scarecrow a brain, the Tin Man a heart, or the Cowardly Lion some courage. Being a fraud, however, the Wizard knows that the people who supposedly are intelligent, philanthropic, or brave are also frauds themselves. College professors are no smarter than anyone else; they just have a diploma. Philanthropists are no more generous than anyone else; they just have testimonials. Heroes are no braver than anyone else; they just have medals. So he gives the Scarecrow a diploma, the Tin Man a testimonial, and the Lion a medal. And now they are just as smart, generous, or brave as any of those so-called professors, philanthropists, or heroes.Once the Scarecrow gets his diploma, he believes the Wizard and thinks he is just as smart as all those college professors. Suddenly inspired, he enunciates what he takes to be the Pythagorean Theorem: "The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side. Oh joy, rapture! I've got a brain!"Alas, this is neither the Pythagorean Theorem nor any other theorem of geometry. First of all, the Pythagorean Theorem applies to right-angled triangles, not to isosceles triangles. But even if we allow for that correction, substituting "right-angled" where he says "isosceles," it is still wrong. It is not the square roots of the sides that are related in that way, but the squares, to wit: The square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. As this is something known by most high-school graduates, let alone by college professors, maybe a diploma counts for something after all.Fortunately, even if you do have a brain, you can still enjoy "The Wizard of Oz," provided you don't use it too much while watching the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz, An American Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is an American classic undoubtedly. The movie makes you feel as if you are in this magical world along side Dorothy, as if you are lost as well. Everything from the characters, music, set design, and story line makes us fall in love. The Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow, and Tin-man seem like old friends and are easy to relate to. They each touch on a fear that most people have on some level. The Cowardly Lion shows fear (in general) and uncertainty. The Tin-man shows vulnerability with oneself and emotions. And the Scarecrow lacks self-worth dealing with intelligence. And even Dorothy, she represents the fear of being lost, and leaving your comfort zone. The characters help the audience connect to the movie more, and become more emotionally invested. Not only is the characterization great in this movie, but just looking at the it all is nothing less than beautiful. The elaborate sets and colorful images makes your eyes dance around the screen. This movie was made when color was first still being introduced, and even though it wasn't the first colored movie, it definitely was the first that really took advantage of the use of color. If you haven't seen The Wizard of Oz yet you missing out on a fantastic movie!</fullReview>

This tell the story of Kansas girl, Dorothy Gale (Garland) who sometimes wishes she could leave. She gets her wish when a tornado heads towards her home and is taken to a magical place, Oz. Soon, she sees strange things and meets new friends, a scarecrow (Bolger), lion (Lahr) and Tin man (Haley) along the way while trying to get back home. She also faces a wicked witch (Hamilton) who wants her ruby red slippers. Dorothy and her friends head to the Emerald City seeking help from a powerful wizard (Morgan) to grant their wishes. I grew up watching this and always enjoyed it. Garland &amp; the cast were great and Hamilton was a terrific villain. I recommend this classic fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must-See for All Generations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are allowed to see only one movie in your life, I would advise you to choose this classic, the Wizard of Oz. If there is any film that deserves the best-ever film position, this film would take hold of it. It's a beauty that every generation can and will enjoy. It makes the old feel young again and the young feel like they can live forever. As for the film itself, it's a skillful film. Judging by today's standards, the special effects hold up very well. The twister seems more realistic than it does in the Twister film. This is very impressive since they had no computers back then.Victor Fleming's film is about the adventures of Dorothy and her dog Toto. After she is whisked away from her farm to the magical land of Oz, she is sent out to meet the wizard himself as she follows the Yellow Brick Road. Along her travels, she meets the Tin Man, the Scarecrow, and the Cowardly Lion. She also has a nemesis in the Wicked Witch.This film has a few stars but no one very famous at the time. It's biggest star is Judy Garland who found fame because of this film. Garland does a very good job and she is what makes Dorothy a classic character.Overall, the Wizard of Oz is the perfect film for the entire family and it will live on for generations to come. My favorite part is how this film masterfully transfers from black/white to color film. Filmmakers hardly used color back in the old days, but I'm glad they did here. This film also makes good use of it's music. Even if you never seen this film, I'm sure you have heard of some the songs. This is one of the greatest films of all time. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film based on a book it is very inaccurate. As a film that is an escape from the bleak greys of real life, the Wizard of Oz shines. It is both a coming of age story about responsibility and being true to oneself and a whimsical adventure. Utilizing the use of Technicolor in contrast to black and white, we see Dorothy come into her own in the world of Oz, a place where trees are offended if you take their fruit, and anything can happen. In the end Dorothy learns that she always had the ability to get home, but had to learn and grow from her adventure to reach that point. When she returns home she is reunited with her family. Sadly Toto's fate probably remains unchanged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched The Wizard of Oz again after not seeing it for a while. It is interesting to see how a movie made back then is still appealing to so many people, and as an adult (I was introduced to the movie as a kid) I can see how some songs like "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" are still recognized by many people, if not as well-known as before. It is also quite common for the movie to be featured in trivia, and when watching it again I noticed how it's made an impact on our culture (I've heard the expression "you won't melt" before, there's a small street named "Yellow Brick Road" in my town). The Wizard of Oz is showing its age (you can tell everything is painted, special effects we're used to seeing in newer movies weren't invented yet, and the entertainment style is old-fashioned). I've noticed a drop in the number of people who know this movie and some of our other classics like The Sound of Music (a movie made during the 1960's that has a story set during the late 1930's), but unlike other 70+ year old movies it hasn't been forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So they all make it back to the wizard having defeated the Wicked Witch of the West. Thanks to Toto they find out the Wizard's just an ordinary man. He bestows open the Tin Man, Scarecrow, and Cowardly Lion their respective trophies to show them they had what they were searching for all along and offers to bring Dorthy home in his hot air balloon. As they are taking off Toto jumps out and Dorthy cases after him so they miss the ride but the good which appears and said she could go home all along by clicking her heels together and wishing to go home. I don't know why the bitch, excuse me witch didn't tell her sooner. I mean it's like she's having Dorthy be her hit-man, killing all the other witches so she can rule Oz with a cotton-candy fist. Anyways Dorthy awakes at home in her bed and realizes that the only place she ever wants to be is with her family at home. What a happy ending... wait a minute I feel like we're forgetting something... that's right Toto is still going to die! Everything that happened here is because Toto bit Miss Gulch and she's going to have the sheriff put him down! To me this is just to big of a plot hole to have. Did they think no one would really notice so they just left the issue unresolved? It seems like Miss Gulch isn't the type of person who'd let this go either. So for me this happy ending was soured by the fact that relatively soon Toto's going to be brought out back and shot. The last thought I had during the film was, "I hope you've had a fun last day in Oz Toto because your about to take one final trip to the great beyond."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more needs to be said about a film that has gone beyond the status of a mere classic to become an enduring part of our national heritage? Is there anyone alive unfamiliar with Dorothy or Toto or the tornado or the Munchkins or the Yellow Brick Road or the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Wicked Witch of the West, the Emerald City, the Great and Powerful Oz, the ruby slippers, or the fact that there's no place like home?Before the age of home entertainment most people knew the movie only from its frequent television screenings (always introduced, in our youth, by Danny Kaye), but seeing the film uninterrupted by commercials (and preferably on a big screen) is the best way to appreciate the fairy-tale simplicity of L. Frank Baum's story and the wealth of his imagination, in no way compromised by the economy of the film's Depression-era 1939 budget. This is one of those rare adaptations that is actually better than the original book: a film that will never grow old, for people who will never grow old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter who you talk to, chances are they have at least heard of this movie or the play that it was adapted from. This was one of the most successful movies of the decade especially due to its elaborate sets and costumes, which were very convincing for the year it was made. This was also Judy Garland's first major film, and it caught many producer's attentions to get her more work and cement her as one of the greatest actresses/singers of the 20th century.The movie focuses on a girl who wants to escape her life, and she ends up in the magical world of Oz. She is on a journey to find a way back home and meets some very lovable characters on the way. The makeup, costumes, sets, effects and Technicolor/sepia usage make this one of the most unique films in history, and it was very advanced for its time. It is by far one of my favorite movies, and I love it to no end. It's one of those films that you look back on and can't really think of your life had you never seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dark Side of the Rainbow (alternate soundtrack review)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>9 Stars for the movie itself, but only about 4 stars with the alternate soundtrack (read on...) The Wizard of Oz / The Dark Side of the Moon soundtrack In honor of the Wizard of Oz's 70th Anniversary, I decided to rewatch it.However, instead of reviewing a film we've all seen 25 or more times, I decided to investigate the myth surrounding the synchronicity of this film to the 1973 Pink Floyd album, The Dark Side of the Moon. The phenomenon sometimes referred to as "The Dark Side of the Rainbow".To begin with, I checked all the 'net sources I could find ? most were in agreement, that proper synchronicity is achieved by starting the Pink Floyd disc as soon as the MGM lion roars for the 3rd time. So, with a big bowl of popcorn in one hand, and a Dunkelweizen in the other, I prepared for a psychedelic experience to outdo the finale of 2001: A Space Odyssey or the first I ever heard "Interstellar Overdrive" (hey, now there's an idea for a pairing).Sadly, I have to say that it did not blow my mind. Twenty years of rumors, and this is what I get? To be fair, I was not under the influence of any unusual substances ? O.K., a couple beers, but I do everything under the influence of a couple beers. I suppose that those who do enough of the right drugs can probably find connections in any DVD/CD pairing (Dude, Britney is totally singing the soundtrack to Shindler's List on her debut album!!!) .I will concede that there are quite a few points of synchronicity between the two. They do in fact complement each other ? to an extent. But the band members have repeatedly denied any intentional connections between the two, and I for one believe them. What then accounts for this seeming synchronicity? I believe I have an answer for that.To begin with, both deal heavily with Freudian aspects of the psyche. That has been a hallmark of Pink Floyd's music from the beginning. Even after demented genius Syd Barrett was institutionalized, the remaining members of Pink Floyd were keenly aware that Barrett's introspective lyrics were a key element of the band's appeal.L. Frank Baum, for his part wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to be a modern update of age-old fairy tales deeply rooted in the human psyche, and the characters themselves are concerned with primary desires of the id ? home (shelter) for Dorothy, courage for the lion, etc. This Freudian connection was deepened by the filmmakers who took an Oz as dream approach, both in dreamlike experiences in Oz (the poppy field for example) as well as the entrance and exit of Dorothy passing out on a bed ("It was all a dream).Second of all, The Wizard of Oz is, let's not forget, a musical. One doesn't need to have more brains than the Scarecrow to figure out that a film based around music is likely to sync up pretty well with another piece of music. And so it does; many of the alleged match up points are song and dance routines. While Dark Side is a great match, I wouldn't be surprised if a pairing with, say, Sgt. Peppers wouldn't provide an equally interesting result.While we're on the subject of myths, I also looked for the other big Wizard of Oz urban legend ? the hanged man. Allegedly a member of the cast or crew who committed suicide can be seen in one of the scenes along the Yellow Brick Road. Maybe it would be different if I saw it on the big screen, but all I saw at the appointed scene was an amorphous shape in the deep background that could have been? well? literally anything! In conclusion I'd say that what this exercise did yield for me was a great bit of nostalgia. It reaffirmed in my mind that both of these two artworks are masterpieces, and deserve undivided attention. I couldn't help but wish I were fully focused on enjoying one or the other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going back to 10 nominations for Best Picture next year. They had that in 1939, and I am sure that is the only way this film got a nomination. It's a great film, but not in the same league as the winner, Gone With the Wind, and even runners-up like Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Ninotchka, Stagecoach, or Wuthering Heights.It did, however, win two Oscars for the music. To hear Judy Garland sing "Over the Rainbow" is worth the time spent. I love that song, and can never hear it enough.It is a colorful, exciting fantasy trip with great music and some fine actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those films that helps define the conscience of western civilisation ? full of those little homilies that the generations pass down. A hundred of them are crystallised here in this film. The theme is wanting things without realising that you have them all the time, a dream whose moral is to stop dreaming. It's still sweet and funny, only occasionally veering too far into the world of cartoonery. I could have done without Toto and the blasted Munchkins ? though the Lollypop Guild trio are worth seeing. Shirley Temple was considered for the part and would have been good, but then the film would have been without its essence, which, on deep reflection, is July Garland's sexual innocence. Dorothy might well have gone to the Wizard asking for desirability, without realising that she was already the hottest thing in the Land of Oz. The Wicked Witch of the West was clearly envious of Dorothy's beauty ? that must have been the real power of those ruby slippers.</fullReview>

And Yeah the big bird is still spreading his wings in the tree. I saw that guy when I watched the Wizard of Oz for the first time as an adult. I remember commenting "Hey they caught one of the crew in the back ground." A few years ago we were talking about it a family gathering some of us had not seen the guy hang himself. We borrowed my cousin's tape and sure enough there was the guy hanging himself in the background behind the big curtain scenery. We played it over and over even in slow motion. And Yeah the big bird was spreading his wings in the tree. When I got home I bought a new Tape of The Wizard of Oz and the bird was there but the man had been digitally removed. Check out an old tape of the Wizard of Oz, probably one from the 80's he'll be there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading many of the comments on this film - both positive and negative. I would like to add a perhaps different slant to this discussion - First, why did it come so popular? Think about the year of its release - 1939. The world had just gone through the Great Depression, the winds of World War II were starting to blow with Hitlter's invasions and the Japanese invasion of China. There were a number of excellent films released that year - Gone with the Wind for example - but why did this one hit a cord? It's fantasy theme, simple story, use of color and (for then) very good special effects (the TV set that was used for the Witch's crystal ball is an example - RCA would display one at the 1939 World's Fair to the wonderment of fair goers)are all reasons why this became so popular. Yes, some of Judy Garland's acting is not particularly inspired - she has basically one look, that of constant wide eyed wonderment and confusion - albeit appropriate for the film, although I cannot envision Shirley Temple, who was also being considered for lead, being able to pull off "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" with the same power.So, in the same way Star Wars would bowl everyone over some 37 years later, this film became ingrained in the culture. To this day, if you say "Toto, we're not in Kanas anymore..." people understand what you're referring to.And let's face it - for a movie its effects and fantasy elements were unmatched for literally decades. Movies in the fifties and sixties still used special effects that were, at best, cheesy - exceptions being 2001 and some of Harryhausen's works - it wasn't until the seventies, with Star Wars, did we see films where the cinematography could begin to match the mind's eye as what we envisioned things should look like.And this is why I rated it a 10 - not because its greatness, or skill, or anything else - but because it has become a cultural icon. It is still popular, although to say that its as popular as it once was is a mistake - in the sixties it was prime time fare, on a major network, now its shown on Sunday morning on a cable channel. Our parents may have seen it as kids, and remembering the joy it brought them, introduced it to us - and hence it endures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I love The Wizard of Oz. I have never met a single person who has not seen this movie at one point or another, but I have met people who have not watched The Wizard of Oz play to the Pink Floyd album. Last weekend, I finally got around to watching it, in silence, play to the "Dark Side of the Moon" album. This was an incredible experience! All you have to do is start the album exactly when the lion is finished roaring and then sit back and watch.One of the most interesting things I have found about this movie is how many directors played a part in the production of this film. There were a total of four directors who played a role in the making of this film. First, Richard Thorpe, then George Cukor, then the credited director Victor Fleming and finally David Selznick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Social Allegory and Classic Fantasy; a Beautiful and Memorable Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is a powerful and enjoyable allegory of the United States under right-wing Republican government at the beginning of the Twentieth century. But it is also a complex fantasy that works very strongly as an adventure. It is a dream Dorothy Gale has; she is a twelve-year-old girl in Kansas, being raised by her Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, poor chicken farmers. There are three kindly workmen also, but her dog Toto is being sought by mean Miss Alma Gulch, who has been bitten by the little terrier. Unable to get anyone to help, Dorothy runs away just as a tornado is coming. She meets kindly Professor Marvel who gazes into a crystal ball and advises her to go home. She does so but as she arrives, the family is in the cyclone cellar; hit by a shutter, Dorothy is knocked unconscious. When she wakes, she is dreaming, and the house has been carried off by the tornado. Objects whirl by, including Miss Gulch on her bicycle from whose basket Toto escaped earlier; only she turns into a witch on a broomstick. But the house lands safely; and a strange land greets her eyes; female voices sing, garish-hued flowers sprout, and amid ponds there is a yellow brick road and a central plaza. A rainbow-colored bubble approaches; from it steps Glinda, Good Witch of the North. Dorothy finds out her house has killed the Wicked Witch of the Munchkins' land. She has to admit she is no sort of witch; but she becomes the little people's heroine for her deed anyhow. Then out of smoke the Wicked Witch of the West, the other witch's sister, appears and threatens Dorothy. Glinda transfers the dead witch's ruby slippers to Dorothy, warning her to keep them on always. Wanting to get home, Dorothy is advised to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City where the Wizard can perhaps help. Along her way, as she goes on with Toto, she picks up three companions--a Scarecrow, a Tin Woodman, and a Cowardly Lion. They all need help too--one lacks a brain, the second a heart, the third courage; so they accompany her, hoping to get help also. The Wicked Witch writes, "Surrender Dorothy" on the sky after trying to steal the slippers when poppy fumes fell the quartet; Glinda wakes them by causing a snowstorm whose chill revives the quartet. In the Emerald City, they gain admittance to the palace. The Wizard, a great talking head, knows why they've come and demands they fulfill a mission first--fetch the Wicked Witch's broomstick from her mountaintop castle. With no choice, the quartet heads for Winkieland and their battle. Flying monkeys kidnap Dorothy and Toto; the others follow to rescue her. The Witch demands the slippers for Toto's life. She tries to remove them from Dorothy's feet and is nearly electrocuted. As an hourglass measures Dorothy's life expectancy in red, Toto escapes. He finds the others, who penetrate the castle and rescue Dorothy. They are recaptured. The Witch starts to execute them, setting fire to the Scarecrow. Dorothy throws a bucket of water on him, splashing the Witch, and she melts to nothing. The people there rejoice that they are free of her. Back at the Palace, Dorothy requests their reward. The Wizard balks. Then Toto pulls aside a drape about a booth, revealing a little man frantically working dials and levers--the Wizard. he admits, "I'm a very nice person, but a very bad wizard." He is able to point out to the three companions that they've already got what they were after; their rescue of Dorothy has proved that. He gives them symbolic gifts. Dorothy wants to go home. He offers to take her there in a balloon--that's how he got to Oz. Leaving the Scarecrow and the others in charge, he takes his balloon up. Toto jumps from the gondola, and Dorothy, running after him, is also left behind. But Glinda arrives and tells her the ruby slippers can help--all she ever had to do was want to go home more than anything. Dorothy follows her instructions and finds herself back at home, lying in bed with her Aunt and Uncle tending her and the farmhands looking on anxiously. She tells them about her dream and says, "There's no place like home!; the film fades out on her radiant face. The Kansas portions of the film, were in sepia tone; Oz was always vivid technicolor.This film as fine special effects and vivid production values. Cinematography by Harold Rosson and the production design by Malcolm Brown contributed to its strength. Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf along with author L. Frank Baum received major credit for the screenplay. The film was directed by Victor Fleming; King Vidor shot the sepia tone sections. Many contributed to the dialogue; Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg wrote together or separately most of the songs included. The art direction was by Cedric Gibbons, sets by Edwin B. Wilis, costumes by Adrian. Judy Garland had to play a twelve-year-old girl; camouflage was required. Jack Haley was not the first choice for the Woodman, nor several other principals for their roles. But the cast included Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion, Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow, Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch and Miss Gulch, Billie Burke as Glinda, and Frank Morgan as a host of characters including professor Marvel and the Wizard. Charles Grapewin and Clara Blandick were the Uncle and Aunt Em. And the feature was also enhanced by the presence of dozens of little people as Oz's denizens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OZ: A Grown Up's Movie That Kids Enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WIZARD OF OZ is a paradox: although made with a juvenile audience in mind, the completed film has an unexpectedly adult sensibility, and children enjoy it on one level while adults find it a considerably more complex experience. Like most fairy tales, OZ deals in archetypes--but instead of merely referencing them, OZ specifies them in a uniquely literal way and transforms them into a brilliantly beautiful yet extremely menacing tale of innocence lost. It is a surprisingly psychological film, and any one foolish enough to scratch its surface will soon find themselves dealing with more "isms" than a roomful of research psychiatrists could explain.Fancy "isms" aside, OZ is a tremendous amount of fun. For one thing, it MOVES: the story begins with a tone of breathless anticipation, and the film somehow manages to maintain that level of energy throughout its entire running time with never a lag. Although one or two of the famed special effects seem a bit dated, most are still exciting. This is particularly true of the famous tornado sequence, the first half of which (in which Dorothy races the storm home) still outstrips any special effects storm footage made to date. The look of the film, from the rich sepia tones of a painfully literal Kansas to the Technicolor vibrancy of a very surrealistic Oz, is as artful as a dozen famous painters rolled into one--and need we really mention the music, so famous that virtually every man, woman, and child in the western world can hum most of the score?But all of this would be by-the-way if not for a truly amazing cast. Judy Garland is a remarkable Dorothy, with one foot in innocent childhood wonder and the other as firmly planted in a very sophisticated and extremely adult sense of humor (watch her very subtle series of double-takes during the Munchkin sequence), and the success of the film largely rests upon the success of her own performance. But this in no way disparages the rest of the cast, which plays broadly but with considerable self-depreciating humor; every one is sure to have their own favorite among the famous performances by Bolger, Lahr, Haley, Hamilton, Burke, and Morgan, and all are equally brilliant.Although the original MGM DVD (now out of print) has been greatly praised, the Warner Bros. DVD is the widely available standard. Whatever its failings in comparison to the MGM DVD, it offers picture and sound quality far beyond anything seen on any VHS. There are also a number of extra bells and whistles that range from the very interesting, such as the Angela Lansbury-hosted documentary on the making of the film, to the ho-hum, such as old newspaper advertisements for the film. But whatever the merits of these extras, the real reason to buy the DVD is for the film itself: THE WIZARD OF OZ is as timeless, fascinating, disturbing, and beautiful today as it ever was and probably will always be. Put the kids to bed and watch the film with a critical eye--and you'll be amazed at what you've missed.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion "The Wizard Of Oz" is one of the best films that MGM has ever made. It is a wonderful film for all ages and Judy Garland was probably and still is the greatest actress there ever was. I don't think there is or ever will be an actress as good as her. "Meet Me In St Loius" is another great film starring Judy Garland and i recommend that those who haven't already, watch it. I know a lot of people who haven't seen "The Wizard Of Oz" and I recommend that if you are one of them then you should watch it. It's one of those films that you can watch over and over again and not get bored.

		<fullReview>Whenever you meet someone who likes this movie, it's most likely someone who loved this as a younger kid and grew up with it. If you ask someone younger than 25, they will probably say they don't like it because it is too juvenile. People who don't like this have no taste for imagination. Just about everyone I know has seen it, and it's very shocking when you meet someone who hasn't seen this movie. Even though this came out almost 70 years ago, it is still a tradition to show this on NBC around Thanksgiving.The movie follows a girl named Dorothy who enters a strange, distant, but jolly world where she must follow a yellow brick road in order to return home. Along the way, she befriends some memorable characters that everyone knows of, and is pursued by the wicked witch of the west.If you somehow haven't seen this, then watch it. It is filled with imagination and younger kids will love it. As far as the older kids, probably not, since for some reason they don't like this type of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campy fairy tale that is strangely heavy-handed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A whirlwind hits Kansas and carries a young girl in to a strange and mystical world.One of those products that you feel slightly stupid reviewing, but I guess a new audience for it is born every minute. Also it a good example of a book and film that, while joined at the hip, are also very different products. The book is light, throwaway and fun while the film gets very heavy and morose almost like a horror movie. Very strange for a film aimed at children.Judy Garland's life was one big rollercoaster ride from beginning to end and seemed to involve an unfruitful search for happiness through people, produce and drugs. How apt that her most famous film should also feature a similar journey and how sad that while reading the script she could not take on the moral: That happiness comes from within and that life is what you make of it. Garland's talent was (and remains through film) immense. What a pair of lungs and what vocal control. A freak of nature that was plucked from nowhere, exploited and then thrown away by the studio system. She died young, but she had lived her show business life already and had no role left to play other than sing to ever dwindling gay audiences. Oz maybe a cruel place at times, but it is no more cruel than the real world it apes.Here we have main characters that are in search of change, but they are living in a "cast" society in which function seems given by the state. Maybe I am thinking too literally, but how does Oz go round? Who paints the road yellow - and why? A road doesn't have to be completely painted to be followed and why brick, very expensive way to pave a road! Maybe examples of how nonsense stands out more in films.Maybe they thought that making this a musical would make it lighter and more fun. But it doesn't really work that way. Fun song and dance is one thing, but this hardly taking away the sense of danger and threat. Wicked witches are killers (or at least potential killers) so how can they be taken lightly or in jest? What is being demonstrated is that making the written page literal goes beyond the original intent. Children are meant to be slightly scared - not petrified as they would be watch this film.Legends have grown up around this film in production. From colour difficulty to the parties that the "little people" threw after filming was done for the day. I am sure most of them are myths and besides, I am sure there is partying and sex after the end of most day's filming on most films.In the Wizard of Oz we are transported to a strange world with great performances from all the leads, especially Garland who has to carry the weight of this giant production on her shoulders. I feel for her, where else is a child (or near child) expected to carry such responsibility but in show business? I guess the only world stranger than Oz is the world of show business. PS Do I get a cookie for not mentioning Over The Rainbow once in the main review?</fullReview>

Young Dorothy (Judy Garland) is transported to Oz during a tornado in Kansas and that is when the magic begins. The film goes from black-and-white to color and then the story takes off from there. Dorothy meets some friends (The Scarecrow, The Tin-Man, and The Lion) and they all decide to find the wizard so they can get something that they wish they had (home, brain, heart, courage).

		<fullReview>Had the great pleasure of seeing WOZ at the Uptown Theatre last weekend. No other film in my recollection has "evolved" with successive viewings like this has: from my first time seeing it on black &amp; white t.v. in 1967 at age 5 (a REAL journey, much longer than a mere two hours!); the realization nearly ten years later that 80% of the picture is in C O L O R; up through a couple of years ago, watching it needlessly truncated on commercial t.v. on a non-Easter Friday night (when the two hours felt like 20 minutes, if that). So I was ready for the "genuine" widescreen, three-strip Technicolor movie-theatre experience.The result: well, it was like having known about "the man behind the curtain" but not accepting it until now. I'm old enough to see the poor continuity (the Tin Man's funnel-hat handle switches sides at least once), the primitive make-up, the once-magical backgrounds that are now clearly movie sets, that Dorothy had quite a rack for a twelve-year-old;-),and so on. And as for "Munchkinland," we won't even GO THERE.But it doesn't matter. Oh, the COLORS: the burnt fuschia of the hourglass sand, the genuine ruby of Dorothy's slippers, the repulsive green of the Witch's skin versus the entire green spectrum in the Emerald City. And there's nothing like seeing it with an adult audience: old enough to know all the lines and all the lyrics, booing and clapping and cheering right on cue (and laughing heartily where we never dared laugh before). WOZ may be one of the very few things this culture has produced that allows you to enjoy it as both a grown-up and the kid you once were -- and maybe still are -- without feeling the least bit self-conscious about it. May it never change.</fullReview>

Before, it was just a family film that I would watch with my cousins every year.I watched it a few years ago out of curiosity more than anything, expecting to cringe at how corny it would be. But I was actually amazed at how realistic the movie feels.First of all, I don't like musicals as a general rule but I didn't mind this movie at all. The songs were quite good actually.The actors were completely believable for the most part. I know some people think they were a bit over the top. But I don't remember thinking that. Judy Garland, at least plays the part of Dorothy perfectly well (remember, I haven't read the book) and is easy to connect with (very important for the main character). I heard from someone that they were considering Shirley Temple for the part but she was under contract with someone else and they wouldn't let her be in it. And I heard that she was crushed so they put her in a fantasy movie of her own called The Blue Bird (I haven't seen it).The sets were really good. Although you can tell they are just sets, they're done so well that it still feels right anyway. I can't believe that Gone With the Wind won Best Art Direction over this movie. Wizard of Oz should have at least won an oscar for that. I think it got Best Song for Over the Rainbow and that was all!Another thing that makes this movie great is it's ability to be heart warming and scary. I was waiting for the Wicked Witch to appear thinking that I'd crack a smile at how silly she was. But to be perfectly honest, she was quite intimidating. She wasn't silly at all and she was very mean and threatening in every scene she was in. I couldn't understand it. This old woman with a green face was completely nasty and horrible without actually physically killing or torturing anyone throughout the entire film. Let's see a modern movie villain pull that off! The movie gets particularly suspensful when they get to the castle.I also liked how Dorothy's companions all have the traits that they're searching for. The Tin Man who doesn't have a heart is a big softy who's always crying; the Scarecrow who supposedly doesn't have a brain is always coming up with the good ideas; but the problem is that the Lion really is a coward! I suppose someone will say that true courage is facing danger when you're afraid of it blah, blah, blah.....but I remember one scene where the Lion actually runs away and jumps out the window. And he also gets more songs than the others too. Oh well, a cowardly lion is more amusing than a brave one I guess.I think this movie is really for adults more than kids. Oh, kids will like it, of course. But there are levels of depth in it that only an adult can relate to (that's what I think). I had to keep myself from getting teary eyed when Dorothy was trapped in the tower with the crystal ball and I don't remember being affected by this scene like that when I was little.I'm sure everyone who reads this review has probably seen this movie a trillion times. But if you haven't, I highly recommend it. And this recommendation is coming from a guy who usually won't watch a movie unless it has a broadsword or a machine gun in it......or a vampire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you watch the TV version, you are truly missing out on one of the most important connections to be made. We all know why the farm hands played the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, but do you know why DOrothy sees MIss Gulch as the Wicked Witch of the West? In the version broadcast in the 50's the movie opened with Dorothy walking home from school as the current version hints at. What viewers don't see today is that Toto wondered off into Miss Gulch's garden and was chased out by MIss Gulch with a broom. She threatens to take the dog or at least report Dorothy and Toto to the Sheriff, which she eventually does. DOrothy runs from Miss Gulch toward the farm and when she reaches the entrance road to the farm, the new broadcast version picks up the story. I understand or was led to believe that this portion of the film was edited for TV broadcast and lost in a fire forever. I consider it to be one of the most important parts of the movie.</fullReview>

She really does work hard to make us fall in love with her, which of course we cannot resist. Here she is quite fat, which reminds us that by now she was already heavy into speed and sex.I met Noel Langley in the 60s and he insisted that he wrote the screenplay to emphasize certain spiritual symbology. The contrast between these two facts fascinates. Why are gays so attracted to Judy? Why do Christian fundamentalists see this as the Devil's work? Is this the eighth gate?</fullReview>

However, I am curious on the size of the budget allowed for production. The difference between todays big budget movies and those from sixty years ago, are today the scripts and plots are pathetic.

		<fullReview>Dorothy Gale is a young girl who lives on a farm in Kansas, but a tornado drag her to a magical land where she will have to go through various adventures in order to return. Directed by a team led by Victor Fleming, this movie has script by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar Allan Woolf and others. The cast is headed by Judy Garland and Frank Morgan.We are facing one of the most famous films of all time, the precursor of musical, fantasy and adventure films. And its no coincidence that many of its scenes were in collective memory. It was a milestone for cinema, and almost all saw it, in movies, television, DVD or any other. The script is very interesting and takes children and adults to the child's imagination, plenty of witches, fairies, beautiful and impossible things. There are no dead moments, everything is perfect. The editing of the film was made carefully and photography, with a striking contrast between scenes in vivid colors and sepia scenes, marked the "border" between our world and the magical world of Oz. All this was innovative for its time.The characters in this film have become iconic. The Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion have become paradigms of the potential untapped of human beings, people who seek to overcome their own insecurities and flaws. Dorothy has been an ideal of goodness and virtue, and her puppy an example of loyalty. In turn, the wizard ends up making the connection between the two worlds. Garland had it so good in this film that just famous and was one of the most acclaimed actresses of the golden age of American cinema.The film also has several special effects, rudimentary and limited to existing technical, but functional and effective. The soundtrack of the film is perhaps one of the most remembered today. It mainly composed by Harold Arlen and has filled the movie with delightful musical moments. One of them, "Over the Rainbow," earned the Oscar for Best Original Song and its an icon even today. The film has also won the statuette for Best Soundtrack and was nominated for the categories of Best Film (1940), Best Color Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Special Effects.</fullReview>

Oz the great and powerful is a little better. The return to Oz is a little bit better. The Wizard of Oz (1914) is better. The Wizard of (1910) is better. But still this is a good movie. It has a great story line. It is kind of campy. But still this is a good movie. Yes a fun fantasy film. I think the flying monkeys are very funny. I can not help laugh at them.

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Ahhhs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mere hours before seeing the latest incarnation of the land of Oz (2013's Oz the Great and Powerful,) I got a chance to see, for the first time since I was a little tyke: the original great and powerful The Wizard of Oz. And, let me assure you: this isn't just a movie, it's an experience.Far before it's time, mostly being in color notwithstanding, the sets, costumes, dialogue and special effects were absolutely advanced far beyond its 1939 release date. With this viewing, and who knows how many there had been, I found myself laughing out loud, enjoying the musical numbers, almost crying due to the genuine heart displayed by the characters and the actual feel of being in this land of spectacular Oz.Since the story has been told dozens of times and pretty much everyone has seen it, it's almost irrelevant to give the synopsis, but here goes anyways: young Dorothy Gale is thrust into a mystical land when she fails to secure herself from a pending tornado (or "twister") attack. There, she immediately makes both allies and an enemy ? the worst and, um, wicked kind, and she sets out to find her way home while meeting great friends along the way.For the three humans left alive that haven't seen this, there's more to the story and a lot of more iconic lines and characters than I probably could post in under a thousand words. Suffice to say, the number one was the world-famous Wicked Witch of the West, the pre-Darth Vader, decades before Anakin donned the mask.Keep in mind, while this does work for adults, this really is mainly for children and I am 100% pleased about this fact. That said, the almost too-scary-for-kids Witch from the West was so well played by Margaret Hamilton, so well done up from face to outfit to evil laugh, that she will ? ah-hem, has ? go(ne) down in cinema's hall-of-villain fame. Scratch that; she is one of the most iconic characters, good or bad, of all time, despite her short time on screen. And I loved every minute she was shown.Okay, she's not the only one that made this movie elevated from just "movie status." Judy Garland and her voice were excellent, the trio of Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley as The Scarecrow, The Cowardly Lion and The Tin Man, respectively, were also smartly written characters that I absolutely loved and respected.I wouldn't call this movie perfect, but dang, it's right there on the absolute edge of perfection. What they did with what resources they had back 74 years ago astonishes me today. While most sets did actually look like sets, it never bothered me. I always felt like I was a part of the action, the adventure and truly in the Land of Oz.Aside from Chicago ? my favorite musical, this film and the great The Sound of Music, I've actually seen very few musicals and it's quite known in my circle of friends that I don't rush to see musicals. That said, I love the majority of songs in this film and who really couldn't? I mean, when Judy sings the best of the bunch, "Over the Rainbow," or you get the timeless variations of "?Off to See the Wizard," or when the bell was rung with "Ding Dong The Witch is Dead," you can't help but remember your childhood and have your heart soar.There's very little to say more about this fantastic ride that hasn't been said before. So, to sum it up and suffice to say: SEE IT!** - Again, that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie works on the multiple levels that great children's literature has. They're both there: the surface story of the girl that runs away from the bad place with her dog to find that beautiful land she's only dreamed of before, and the underlying theme of finding that she can go home and still have that dream in her heart.So is Oz a real place? It was certainly real to Dorothy. Maybe Kansas isn't real? Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu dreamed a very vivid dream of being a butterfly. When he awoke, he asked, "Am I a man who dreams of being a butterfly, or a butterfly who dreams of being a man?" Maybe it was the same with Dorothy.See the special 50th anniversary edition if you can. It has some interesting extras, like the amusing deleted "Jitterbug" scene (which was included in a play I participated in in college).See it for Margaret Hamilton playing the Witch to the hilt. See it for the chance to remember Judy Garland as she was before her personal tragedies (seeing her sing "Over the Rainbow" on the Andy Williams Show was one of the most heart-wrenching experiences I have ever had, as her voice broke on "If happy little bluebirds fly above the rainbow-why, oh why can't I?"). See it for the discovery that "Oz never did give nothing' to the Tin Man that he didn't already have" (from "Tin Man" by America). See it just to have fun. But see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was a little kid. Since then, it's been one of my favorite all time films. Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a farm girl with a little puppy and a great singing voice. At first, the movie starts off in black and white--then it springs into something almost unseen in 1939--color. I love the horse of many colors! I love the Wizard! I love everything about this movie. Along with the songs (Somewhere over the Rainbow was voted the best song of the 21st century), the lovable cast, and the sinister witch--all the movie needs is a batch of popcorn. I've seen this movie many times and the magic is still there when I watch it again. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do. It's one of my favorites--and it could be yours too. I'm almost 20, and the magic has never left for me. By the end of the movie, you too will be saying "There's no place like home." This movie is fun for people of all ages. Believe me. Better yet, see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No film is taken more for granted than 'The Wizard of Oz'. As a Fantasy film, it probably ranks better than any other. As a musical, it probably ranks better than any other. As a family film, it probably ranks better than any other. Any which way you slice 'Oz' you have to admit that it holds its own as a legendary film.The production value for its time was incredible. The musical numbers outweigh any other before or since its release. The choice of the transition from b&amp;w to color is something that will never have the same impact again. The performances are impeccable, including the munchkins and monkeys. I'd say any film that has a midget or a monkey doubles its entertainment value. One of the most memorable heroines and villains ever put on screen.OK. Ninety-nine percent of Americans have either seen this recently or a long time ago. My point is if you haven't seen this in a long time, go revisit it. It is more than just a child's fantasy film. It is so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939)directed by: Victor Flemingstarring: Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Billie Burke, and Margaret Hamilton.plot: Dororthy Gale (Judy Garland) is a country girl living a boring life, hoping for something exciting to happen to her. One fateful day, she runs away from home and a twister sweeps her away to a magical land called Oz. There, she accidentally kills a witch and the witch's sister, the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) is after her for revenge. Glinda (Billie Burke), a good witch, gives Dorothy a pale of ruby slippers which can help her in an unknown way. When she finally becomes homesick, she goes on a quest to find the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan), the one man who she believes can help her return home, while she makes some friends along the way.thoughts: Spending my first six years in Chittenango, New York (the birth place of L. Frank Baum, the author of the novel), I grew to love the movie THE WIZARD OF OZ, since it was advertised all over the town, and there is still yellow painting on the sidewalks (although it is sadly fading away). Now that I am 17, I viewed this film again, and I still love it.It has a great cast that really knows how to act, dance and sing. It has a great director behind the camera. It has great music. It has a great story. And I love the idea of mixing black and white (the Kansas scenes) and color (the Oz scenes).Even though this film is almost 70 years old, it still has no flaws (to me, anyway) and every parent should introduce this film to their children.</fullReview>

You simply have to be swept away by the witty songs, the splendid choreography and the charming dialogue. Even if you don't like kids in movies (like I do) you will be charmed by Judy Garland and the incredibly well-cast inventory of this film (munchkins, scarecrow, tinman and all....) Just realize how influential this film has proved to be (Toto, the dog, inspired the name of a rockband; the yellow brick road supplied us with a very good Elton John - tune...)

		<fullReview>The movie shows two different settings: first was the Kansas setting with backdrop paintings of fields, hays, and lands. It shows a rural, pastoral, unsophisticated life in the farm. Second was the magical land of Oz.The backdrop paintings in the film made it look like a fairy tale movie. It has indeed appeared like a storybook with all other aspects working such as colors, costumes and props. It was like a fairytale that audiences of all ages had come to love.The costumes of the characters, from Dorothy down to the munchkins were all beautiful. Even the makeup of the characters was effective.Having also learned what the cast and crew had to go through in filming this movie, one can't help but admire the outcome of the movie. Their efforts were really worth it now that after 66 years, the movie is considered one of the greatest film ever made and the number one movie for families.Having learned that Judy Garland was 16 years old then and had to play 11 or 12 year old Dorothy Gale, it was not at all obvious that she was portraying a younger role. In fact, audiences would think that it would never be the same if someone else played the role.The movie has lots of dancing and singing, which is good since they kept the audiences' attention. Plus the songs are catchy, that after watching the movie you'll find yourself singing the songs.At the beginning of the movie, the color was sepia tone and actually not black and white. The sepia tone was used to emphasize the kind of atmosphere that Dorothy was living in, a dull, rustic, unsophisticated life at the farm.In the land of Oz, everything was colorful. One would think that he/she is watching an animated movie or a cartoon for that matter.The movie showed recurring shots of roads, both in Kansas and in Oz. They symbolized the journey that Dorothy would undertake in her transition from a child to a more mature person.The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful movie made beautifully and colorfully. At first I thought it was a children's flick but the way the narrative was carefully made got me enjoying the film. It got the kid in me singing, learning and understanding that I don't have to look far because the home is where the heart is.It is a kind of movie that would make you smile after watching it and you would think of the many times you wanted to get away (or even plan) from home. You would just sigh, because you know that Dorothy was right, indeed there's no place like home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was growing up in the 70s, The Wizard of Oz was re-released theatrically. My mother made sure that I went to see it, even though I can't have been over 4 years old. I remember the thrill when Dorothy opened the door of her black and white house, to see the glorious colour of Oz. Each year the thrill would be repeated, as The Wizard of Oz was compulsory viewing in our house when it came on TV during the holidays. I even had Dorothy doll, complete with basket and Toto (I wonder what happened to that...).As an adult, The Wizard of Oz has lost none of its charm for me. There is Judy Garland's incomparable version of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', not to mention one hundred and one lines that have made their way into popular culture - like 'I guess we're not in Kansas, any more, Toto' or 'I'll get you my pretty, if it's the last thing I do.' or 'I'm melting. Melting.' or 'Ding dong the witch is dead.' Don't miss out on this film just because you are now grown-up... go and have a couple of kids so that you can watch this in high rotation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What better movie for a user begin with than the wonderful "Wizard of Oz"? While not entirely faithful to L. Frank Baum's story, it's more than satisfactory: it's a magical treat. It was one of the first movies to be filmed in color (who could not be wonderfully surprised when Dorothy opens the door of her house and it's suddenly beautifully colorful all around?). All of the performers are in top form. Judy Garland we don't even have to talk about. Ray Bolger is delightful as the scarecrow, longing for a brain (and why on Earth was his special dance cut from the film???), as well as Hunk the hired hand back in Kansas. Jack Haley (replacing Buddy Ebsen) is a very lovable Tin Man (where did he get the idea he doesn't have a heart?)and does well with his small role as Hickory, another hired hand. Bert Lahr is ideal as the cowardly lion, in search of courage, and the final hand, Zeke. Margaret Hamilton is the perfect Wicked Witch of the West, as if she weren't nasty enough as Miss Almira Gulch, who wants Dorothy's dog, Toto, destroyed for biting her (My grandfather met Hamilton, by the way). Billie Burke is a lovely, sweet, and charming Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. And Frank Morgan gives flourish and gusto to the character of the wizard. He also plays a coachman and two Emerald City guards and Professor Marvel in Kansas. Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick are fine as Dorothy's Uncle Henry and Aunt Em. Expertly directed by Victor Felmming, the movie has a marvelous musical score, including the Oscar winning "Over the Rainbow", which was recently chosen as the number one movie song of the century. Even after sixty six years, this movie is still as wonderful as ever, a treat for all ages.Famous Lines (I'll be doing this for several movies):"If I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard, because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with." (Dorothy)"Close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times, and think to yourself 'there's no place like home." (Glinda)</fullReview>

It's not going to have ground-breaking special effects (by today's standards), or amazing computer generated sets/landscapes, or superb make-up/creatures. It is a simple film with a beautiful moral and, honestly, what more do you need? Judy Garland shines as Dorothy, coming through as very natural and honest. You believe her, and you believe in her quest. And her voice... it is so filled with emotion! There is a reason why this film has remained so prominent in our culture. It obviously did something right. If not, its songs wouldn't be murmured on the lips the lips of young children to this day. We wouldn't be seeing Oz merchandise in Targets and Wal-Marts all across the US. It wouldn't have a set air-date on huge television networks every year for going on fifty years. It is the ultimate American classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superb art of story telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from Frank Baum's children book "The Wizard of Oz", the movie by Victor Fleming depicts wonderful art of stroy telling.Dorothy Gale, a little girl from Kansas, is swept away to the magical land of Munchkins, by the Tornado, where she is needed to find The Wizard of Oz, who can take her back to her house.According to me, a perfect children story. In the dreams, how the real-life characters affects their characters in dream of a child. Effects necessary for the movie are well shown (mind well, this movie was made in 1939). It's a musical movie, frequently supported by wonderful songs in the movie. "Over the Rainbow", title song for the movie was placed all time #1 Hollywood song by AFI. it snatched Oscar award for best music from "gone with the wind". Judy Garland wonderfully performed the character of Dorothy Gale . She was just superb, well supported by other cast.In short, inspite of 65 year old movie, no wonder this movie is placed at #62 in all time 250 of IMDb. do give it a watch in light mood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my fondest memories from childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember watching this movie every year when it came on network TV (I think it was usually around Easter time) and actually being upset if I had to miss it. This is a fantasy/adventure, full of thinly disguised morals. Considering the time frame the movie was made in, the special effects are impressive (not by today's standards, but hey, it was 1938!)They brought Frank Baum's tale to life in a very magical way. It's a classic to me. The dance routines are great, even if it's just skipping down the yellow brick road (yes...I admit it...I spent hours learning how to do that skip-step they do!).They should NEVER-EVER remake this...this version is perfect just the way it is! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty at its grandest scale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like this bring the world together. A story of love, friendship and bravery. In a way all of Dorothy's problems must be faced by us too. Mind killing witches and avoiding cyclones, but to take on a new journey, a new turn in your life like it or not and the fact that with friends to guide you and the brightness of your soul, nothing can stop you. My childhood began and ended watching this film and its power still touches me deeply. With the new generation of books like "Wicked" and comic books about an evil side of Oz, they've merely lost the entire point of the story and its meaning. Purity. Something simply stated but pouring out with wisdom. With these highbrow professors at there big universitys examining it as a political allegory are in my opinion, heartless, ignorant and prude. Oh! A man made out of tin! A talking scarecrow! NOBODY could have that big an imagination. YES THEY CAN! Someone with that gift should be revered, not dicsected. And to all of the people who ignorantly say "oh I hate this movie!" let me tell you something, you can't be skeptical about everything! To love a film like this, you must find the beauty of childhood in your heart, not like some college grad with a film degree. To all who love this film like me, I salute you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder if imdb adjusts its ratings on a regular basis, as this movie has stayed at 8.3 for a couple of years, at least. Counting the number of stars, however, nine out of the ten are yellow. Doesn't that mean that the movie should at least be 9? Some random thoughts:This movie is an object lesson in how to tell a story. Without every taking itself too seriously, it allows us to. I couldn't disagree more that the "moral" of the story is that there is no place like home. The story seems to me to be about believing in yourself and, especially, about being open to finding friendship from people you might not otherwise have sought it from.A salute to the cast and crew of "The Wizard of Oz."</fullReview>

Oz is such a world and the incomparable Judy Garland is the fortunate visitor, with majestic results. Certainly one of the finest films ever made, "Wizard" is a happy accident resulting from perfect casting and the studio system that faithfully churned out it's product through superior organization despite upper echelon headaches. Garland could not have been improved on, the sets, music and pacing are perfection.

		<shortDescription>This Takes Me Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's nearly impossible for me to write objectively about the quality of "The Wizard of Oz," so bundled up is it with associations from my childhood. It's like trying to do a critical analysis of "Star Wars." Sorry, can't be done---at least, not by me."Oz" is such a strange movie, in some ways so creaky and old-fashioned, in other ways so incredibly ahead of its time. Few films I've seen during my lifetime have such a complete vision as "Oz" does---such painstaking care went into the look and design of the film; it's as if the filmmakers really did create a whole other world for this film to take place in. It's odd that during a time in American film history, when movies were being cranked out like cars on an assembly line, a film could feel like such an auteurish product (increasingly odd, since the credited director, Victor Fleming, actually shared directing duties with several others. The same is true for "Gone with the Wind," released in the same year and also bearing Fleming's name as sole director. He was quite a lucky guy in 1939).The plot and feeling of "Oz" veers quite a bit from that of the book on which it is based. The book is much nastier and darker, but the film manages its fair share of grimness for all that. The Wicked Witch is spectacularly scary (Margaret Hamilton admits to regretting the intensity with which she approached this character) as are the Flying Monkeys. There's such a feeling of ominous dread underlaying this entire film. As if the land of Oz is a bit too beautiful and perfect, like a perfectly ripe piece of fruit that at any moment can begin to rot at the edges.Really, despite her scariness, the Witch is the most fun character in the film---it's really a riot to watch this film as an adult and enjoy her sarcasm and nastiness; it's refreshing as juxtaposed to the goody goodiness of the other characters. Frank Morgan in a variety of roles is also great.A cloud of darkness has come to surround this film over the last couple of decades, due to the urban legends about the stagehand supposedly caught on film hanging himself and the truly bizarre stories about the arduous process of making the film (and the many accidents and tragedies that occurred along the way). This reputation may be responsible for the cult status that has arisen around this film and perhaps even for elevating it to the level of admiration it has received.On a side note, an excellent book by Gregory Maguire called "Wicked" offers back story to the events leading up to "The Wizard of Oz," and most particulary focuses on the early life of the Wicked Witch of the West. It's an outstanding book, and I venture that you won't be able to watch "Oz" in quite the same way again after reading it.Grade: A-</fullReview>

Judy Garland is forever immortalized and rightly so as her portrayal of Dorothy Gale cannot be imagined with no one but her(Shirley Temple??? c'mon!!!no way!!!). To do a remake of this film would be blasphemy for nothing can be added or deleted. The supporting cast of Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley are remarkable as well.

		<shortDescription>Why Isn't This In The Top Five?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched "The Wizard of Oz" for what has to be the 400th time. Of course I watched it every year as a kid when it came on TV (usually in the spring, usually on CBS), and of course it was always a family favorite. But now when I watch it, I try to view it through my "film buff glasses," trying to see how it compares with other films of its day. I'm attempting to put sentimentality aside and view it critically from all angles. Sorry to say, either I'm a "failure" as a film buff, or this is certainly one of the top five movies ever made.First off, the special effects, set design, costumes, art direction and overall cinematography are absolutely astounding. The creative energies that went into the look and feel of the movie are beyond comparison, even dwarfing most of today's productions. Just watch the Munchkinland scene and ask yourself how long it took just to design the costumes. Sure, they're over-the-top and frilly...this is a FANTASY! The use of color is spectacular, considering this was the first Technicolor movie ever made.The set design compares favorably with some of today's blockbusters - check out the scene on the top parapet of the Witch's Castle, for instance, when Dorothy and Company are trapped by the witch's guards. Compare it to scenes in the Star Wars trilogy that take place in gigantic locales like the Death Star, looking down over impossibly huge constructs.It's been said here that the acting was overdone, and again I say, this is a fantasy film. How can you overdo a talking, dancing scarecrow? And if Bert Lahr hadn't overacted as the Lion, would we have had as much fun?(That word "fun" is the keyword here. Film buffs of the world, take off your snooty little librarian glasses and join in with the rest of us - have some FUN watching a movie for once!)Even some of the stunts were amazing. The Tin Man falling to the ground after being picked up by a "spook" - that had to hurt! And the Cowardly Lion's dive out the window would make Greg Louganis jealous.And of course, there's the music. Every song in the right place at the right time, and every one a classic, with gorgeous orchestrations and arrangements.It's been said here that the acting was overdone, and again I say, this is a fantasy film. How can you overdo a talking, dancing scarecrow? And if Bert Lahr hadn't overacted as the Lion, would we have had as much fun?That word "fun" is the keyword here. Fellow film buffs, follow my lead, take off your snooty little librarian glasses and join in with the rest of the world - have some FUN watching a movie for once!I've watched "Citizen Kane" a few times now, and I acknowledge it's greatness, but I don't see how it comes anywhere near this timeless gem. "Gone With The Wind"? Sorry, can't get through it, it bores the crap out of me. So I believe it's time to rethink that list. Mine now goes:1) The Godfather I &amp; II (easier if you consider it one movie in two parts)2) 2001: A Space Odyssey 3) The Wizard of Oz &lt;-- 4) Ben-Hur (shutup, it's my list!) 5) Casablanca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is so hard for me to even begin to put how I feel about this movie into words. Except that it's the most wonderful story ever told. I have literally seen this movie over 100 times and it never grows old. I watched it every single day from ages 3 to 5. I have a huge collection of Oz memoribila, not just from the movie but from the actual Oz stories as well. For the time period it was made in, they did the best effects any movie could ever do with what they had back then. The film was difficult to make, but it trully paid off. This is the greatest film ever made, and has so many lessons that can be learned for all ages. And even though there's evil still today in this world, Oz is place where we can escape to once and awhile to forget about our troubles, but even in the end, no matter how hard things get, there's no place like home, where you have family that cares. I'd like to end my comments with words spoken by Mr. L. Frank Baum who wrote the orignal book over 100 years ago:"When I was young, I longed to write a great novel that should win me fame. Now that I'm getting old, my first book is written to amuse children. For, aside from my inability to do anything great, I have learned to regard fame as a will-o-the-wisp which, when caught, is not worth the possession; but to please a child is a sweet and lovely thing that warms one's heart and brings its own rewards." - L. Frank BaumThank you Mr. Baum for giving us such a wonderful tale.</fullReview>

Oz was never a dream it was real but in this film it is supposed to be a dream. The actors were all good. I wonder why there wasnt any of them who made it really big except of course for Judy. Judy was also good. Some people are complaining that she was perhaps to old for the role. Judy was sixteen playing a ten year old. But this is sort of like a theatre. I remember watching a stage-production of Wizard Of Oz and there was a thirty year old playing Dorothy. MGM wanted Shirley Temple to be Dorothy but she was still with 20th century fox and they wouldnt let her go. Thank God for that. Imagine Shirley Temple sing Over The Rainbow. I dont think so.

		<shortDescription>The Most Beloved Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sooner or later, it was inevitable that I'd do a review for this beloved 1939 classic which I've easily seen more times than any other film: about 4O. Based upon Lyman Frank Baum's 19OO book, this film surely ranks as THE most beloved film among the masses. Rather than go into details plot-wise, I'm just going to "ramble" a bit. First off, Shirley Temple was the original choice for the role of Dorothy (2Oth Century Fox wouldn't lend her to M-G-M, thank goodness). Although Temple was closer to Dorothy's age - and somewhat resembled the W.W. Denslow drawings in the original OZ books - 16 year-old Judy Garland was destined to be Dorothy &amp; the film made her a star. As a little kid, Margaret Hamilton scared me silly as the Wicked Witch of the West - who even came close to her definitive portrayal of a classic Halloween witch come to life? Truly a magnetic incarnation. Billie Burke was inspired casting (that voice kills me) as Glinda - she certainly looked much younger than her 53 years. The film was beautifully directed by Victor Fleming and the musical score is legendary right down to the malevolent little theme which is heard while Miss Almira Gulch is seen riding her bicycle. There are few fun flubs: Dorothy's hair is seen in various lengths during her stay in Oz &amp; the Witch mentions that she's "sent a little insect on ahead to take the fight out them" which makes absolutely no sense, since the song THE JITTERBUG was deleted. And then there's the scene towards the end when one of Dorothy's friends is seen unravelling the tie to the hot air balloon. No matter. This evergreen perennial film is a timeless diversion for the perpetually young-at-heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems fresher every time I see it. Some reviewers here have commented that the acting might seem "overdone" as compared with acting of today. Maybe, but I wonder if the acting might even have seemed a little overdone as compared with acting of 1939, the year the movie was made. For that matter, it's only the acting of Dorothy's three friends that seems a little overdone to me, and that only occasionally. And even at that, I'd say it fits the movie to a "t." As far as Judy Garland and the actors playing Professor Marvel, the bad Witch, and Dorothy's aunt and uncle go, their acting has always seemed to me to be right on the money. Something I admire about the "Over the Rainbow" sequence: The practice in movie musicals at that time was for singers to pre-record their songs in a studio and then lipsync to them once filming started. Now, I've noticed that, in most musicals, there is always an editing cut at the moment the actor is about to begin "lipsync-ing." In other words, the camera stopped filming right before the the actor was to lipsync to first note of the song. I'm guessing that this was done so as to make it easier for the actor to match her lip movement to the beginning of the song once the cameras started to roll again. In the case of "Oz," however, the camera did *not* cut away at the moment Garland had to begin her lipsync-ing. This meant that she had to time things exactly right. In other words, while--and in addition to--listening to the introductory instrumental music of the song, she had to pace herself so that she'd have both finished her lines ("beyond the rain, etc.)" *and* have hit her mark at the precise moment that her pre-recorded voice would start. (No pressure, Judy!) However big a headache it was, I'd say it paid off, as the segue from her talking to her singing is virtually seamless. In addition, Garland's ability to look as if she were singing in real time (rather than lip-syncing to a recording) made her look all that more connected to the song. It helped make the song into a soliloquy.An Oscar-related side-note: Rather than being nominated for a full-fledged "Best Performance by An Actress" Oscar, Garland was merely given a so-called "Special" Oscar; that is, a miniature version of the real thing. This would have been a slight by any measure, but the fact that Mickey Rooney, her senior by just one year, *did* receive a Best Actor nomination that same year, makes it all the more of one. Surely she deserved the chance to make all the other "grown-up" Best Actress-contenders sweat just a little more? :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I watched The Wizard of Oz the fifty-somethingith time during my fifty-somethingith years. However, this is the first time I realized that this movie covered everything great and powerful in the film. It had fantasy, mystery, horror, music and dancing, action, live animation, romance, morale, and special effects. It showed rural life on the farm to big urban development such as in Emerald City or Munchkenland. I was in awe and I always catch something I overlooked or under-appreciated in previous viewings. I have seen this movie viewed through a young hippie-high-on-acid's eye but still enjoyed it as a clean-and-sober individual that I am today. This movie is magical and realistic as it is classically contemporary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great kids/family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz was a yearly ritual when I was younger. It aired yearly on CBS and was a great time to sit with the family and watch a really fun film. It totally achieves its objectives. To the morons who feel it shouldn't be compared with GONE WITH THE WIND or CASABLANCA, get real. THIS IS A FAMILY MOVIE AIMED AT YOUNGSTERS! Stop making every film into a dissection session. This film is meant to entertain families, and it does just that. Movie traditions in families make for fun nights in. This film, along with Miracle on 34th Street (the original) and It's a Wonderful Life (not the NBC version with movie stars pontificating over it unnecessarily) are great family treats that last forever. If your in the mood for a fun family night.....pop lots of popcorn and pop in The Wizard of Oz! Make your own yearly tradition, as CBS became a party pooper and doesn't air it anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Wizard Of Oz" on television every year was as much a part of growing up for me as playing with friends, trick-or-treating every Halloween, walking to and from school every day, and trying to listen for Santa Claus downstairs in the wee hours every Christmas Eve. What a movie! What a story! What great characters! One unforgettable moment after another after another!Pure magic!As for those members who have confronted with popular opinion here by posting those despicable negative reviews of this American treasure, what can I say but -- one out of three ain't too good, people! While these individuals certainly have courage, not one of them seems to have a brain .. . or a heart!Perhaps, *they* should seek help from the Wizard themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie to own of video and dvd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies to buy of video tape and dvd, since it doesn't play very much on tv. But it is worth pulling out $$$$$ to by or rent this film. How can you not like the Wizard of Oz? Plus it a great musical to watch with your family, but some of this movie may scare very young children. Dorothy (Judy Garland) live in Kansas with her Aun Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charley Grapewin). But one day a mean woman named Miss Gulch (Margaret Hamilton) comes to the Gale's house with an order because Dorothy let her dog Toto to go into Miss Gulch's garden and chashes her cats, and has been bite by Toto. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry agree for poor Toto to go. But Toto manges to escape and Dorothy runs away. But a twsiter comes to town and when she has come back because she had a report from a man (Frank Morgon) that her aunt may be sick. (Spoiler Warning) Dorothey and Toto end up in Munckinland when thier house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her and angring her sister (aslo played by Hamilton). Spoiler Warning #2) Dorothey goes to Oz to see the Wizard to find out how to get back to Kansas, and is joined on the trip by a freindly scarecrow (Ray Bolger) a Tin Man (Jack Haley) and a lion (Bert Lahr). This is the just the movie to watch whether the weather outside is nice or not. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for everyone, still looks extravagant and beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to judge a film like this, having grown up with it. I can't tell where sentiment ends and my critical eye begins. Suffice it to say that it is a wonderful rendition of Baum's story, with clever and amusing songs, and people of all ages can watch it. There are the occasional scary scenes of intense suspense and music that may frighten someone under three, but even these pass and are only part of what the screen presents you. The casting is perfect, the set design still amazes me. Dedicated and simple renditions of great ideas will trump the highest technological achievements if that technology serves a flat story or a poor imagination. The Wizard of Oz certainly qualifies as one of the more imaginative movies of all time, and the skill the players and the technical aspects only further its quality. In short, one of the finest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someday perhaps they will make a movie as good as this. It is a movie about realising yourself, your hopes and that what you have really is important. Also I have read the Oz books, and the movie is a compliation of several of them...it's different yes , but it's still superb. See it, treasure it and hold it in your heart for what it is, one of the most beautiful movies of our time. A leftover from a time when innocence was actually a reality in films rather than a stylized dream. Also read the books, if possible even before you see the movie, they are a magical and quite complex world that you will come back to again and again...all 14 of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives "Talking Head" a New Meaning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS. Actually, I suppose the Wizard's manifestation could be called the ORIGINAL TALKING HEAD! Many things could be said about this movie, but for lack of time, one of the most impressive scenes in the movie when I saw it as a kid was the twister. It was the 1st non-cartoon tornado I'd ever seen. Seeing how the periferal winds were already giving the folks a hard time, I even at that young age figured the winds in that ominous vortex in the background must be REALLY INTENSE to contrast so conspicuously against the surrounding tempest. Was surprised in later years to learn the twister was NOT a dubbed in video of an actual tornado, but a very complex(for the time)stage "prop". I think it involved a large windsock. Said to be the most sophisticated &amp; expensive Special effect in the whole feature-&amp; in the B&amp;W portion no less! Very seldom, if ever, b/n WOO &amp; Twister have tornadoes been so realistically been simulated on the silver screen.</fullReview>

I hadn't seen it in years until it was on TNT recently. I wondered if it would hold up viewing it as an adult, but it did. Even the witch is still scary!

Then we recorded it and the tape fell apart literally since I watched it so many times. I have it on DVD now and I love watching it. I let my eight year old nephew (six at the time) watch it with me for his first time when I bought the DVD. What a delight to watch the expressions on his face when he first saw the witch, the munchkins and even more so.. The Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and Tin Man. This will always be a classic and I can't wait to pass it on further down the family. It is so nice to see a down to earth film, yet how much was put into it. The film may have been made back in 1939 but it will always be a timeless classic!</fullReview>

Wizard of OZ will always rule because it's real, real people, real sets, real midgets. Sure I could see the string holding up the lion's tail. Stuff like that gives this film a certain authenticity that films today can barely hold a candle to. And yes I did try the Pink Floyd-Dark Side trick and contrary to what another reviewer stated, it was awesome. If you line up the record correctly, after the lion growls for the the 3rd time and takes a breath start the record, you will find yourself tripping out on the coincedences. There is always a scene change when there is a song change and thats just one of the many things you will notice. Give it a try for a trippy spin on a classic movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She had to learn it for herself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of people have said they've wondered why Glinda would think that Dorothy would not have "believed" her that all she had to do to get back home was click her heels. I've wondered about that too, and have come up with this suggestion: Perhaps Glinda was *not* referring to clicking the shoes when she said Dorothy "wouldn't have believed me." Perhaps she was referring to what Dorothy needed to learn from her adventures in Oz. Consider, if you will: After Glinda says, "She had to learn it for herself," the tin man then asks Dorothy what she's learned. Dorothy then makes her speech about how from now on she's going to look for "her heart's desire" "in her own back yard." She then says, "Is that it?" to which Glinda says, "That's all it is." It's only after all that's settled that Glinda says, "Now all you have to do is click your heels together three times," or something like that. The implication being--to me, anyway--that clicking her heels, while necessary, wouldn't have helped her get home if she hadn't gone through the step of learning what she learned in Oz. And, presumably, at least according to Glinda, Dorothy would *not* have believed that she needed to look for her hearts' desire in her own back yard, etc., etc., had Glinda "told her that before." .</fullReview>

I have seen many of the outtakes, deleted scenes, and the documentary with Angela Lansbury about the making of The Wizard Of Oz, which are all included in the DVD. However, what impressed me most was an audio-only supplement of rehearsal recordings and outtakes. There are so many of these that are very interesting. Also included are two MGM radio shows from 1939, touting the movie. This is well worth the cost of the DVD. The only thing I wonder is if the people who preserved the audio recordings so well would have preserved the deleted video footage, we would have all found some precious gems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz (One of two films made in 1939 by Victor Flemming) is a harrowing tale of gritty realism. Its grainy black and white sequences get right under your skin. This is cinema right from the heart.It is a meditation on how weather can transform lives.Somewhat like Lars Von Trier's later Dancer in the Dark, it is an entirely plausible work of profound drama, with songs. Dorothy (played by a clearly too old Judy Garland) can only escape the dull realities of her Kansas existence by creating a whole fantasy world for herself.It is an extraordinarily effective and affecting piece of cinema that could certainly give Pulp Fiction a run for its money were it released today. But it is certainly NOT for children.</fullReview>

I absolutely love watching this movie about the fantastic world of Oz, which was enriched by reading the book afterward. I do understand why the book had to be abridged for the movie as it would have all been too long to put in there, but it would have been nice to see the Quadlings and the Town of China People in it. Well, I also love the music, which I used to have memorized. Judy Garland was an especially good singer and actress, and every time I sing "Over the Rainbow" to myself or others, I find myself copying her. My personal favorite was, of course, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion (I can still say the "Put 'em up, put 'em up" scene by heart). All in all, it is one for the ages.</fullReview>

The added benefit is that this movie is so well done - forget that it hardly matches the actual story by L. Frank Baum - it gets better with every advance in technology.

		<fullReview>What a pleasure it was to finally see The Wizard of Oz for the first time on the big screen when it was re-released in 1998. This was one of the first films I watched as a child and it became a annual ritual to watch it while I was growing up. Nevertheless, I was surprised by how well I responded to it when I watched it on the big screen some 15 years or so after I thought I had outgrown it. The energy and wonder of the film still hold up and I was reminded of so many movies I have seen in the last twenty years that borrowed things from this movie. The performances by Judy Garland and Margaret Hamilton are still my all time favorite female lead and supporting performances. I've seen this movie maybe 15 times by now but I'll probably see it again before long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's left to say about this film? If you looked up the word "perfection" in the dictionary, you're likely to find it's picture. Judy Garland will always live in this film. Knowing what we do about her personal life doesn't subtract from her performance at all. If anything, her stories of personal tragedy and drug abuse, only makes her more effective. We know that quiver in her voice and the sadness behind her eyes were real. I cannot watch this film with out getting a little nostalgic for her.The rest of the cast, especially Boldger and Hamilton, are also flawless, the special effects are still stunning, and the film's moral will never grow old. My score: a perfect 10! This film never grows old!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I grew up on this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved The Wizard of Oz since I was a kid and I still love it to this day. I always watched it when it aired on CBS annually and I also have it on video. I actually have 2 copies of the movie, the 50th anniversary tape and the Ultimate Oz package.After reading the script of the long version of the movie, I wish all of the outtake scenes were never taken out and destroyed. If the movie actually ran too long, then I think the scenes could have at least been saved. Then later on, they could have all been put back into their missing places. Gone With the Wind was a 3-4 hour movie itself. Why couldn't The Wizard of Oz be? I guess there are many answers to that question.The one final scene that actually still does exist, is the scarecrow dance. I think it is a little odd that every scene would be destroyed except for one. I'm sure there is an explanation for that too. It's still enjoyable anyway though. I have seen it probably 90 billion times and I'll probably see it 90 billion times more. For any Wizard of Oz fan, I don't think 90 billion times would be enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Succeeds becuase it's got a timeless lesson that we can all relate to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every person in America (and most people all over the world) that is over the age of 5, but usually younger, has seen The Wizard of Oz. Just about all of them have undoubtedly seen it more than once, either on video or on its yearly TV broadcast. Why is it so popular and such a part of our culture? My guess would be that it hasn't gotten old one bit, even though it was made 60(!) years ago, and there is a reason for that. No matter how old you are, no matter what generation you're part of, you can relate to Dorothy (wonderfully played by Judy Garland) as she yearns to break free and find something somewhere else, but when she finds that something, discovers it's not so great because it doesn't have the familiar comforts of home. Home is what matters, or to quote it for the umpteenth time, there's no place like home. Everyone feels that way, so we can all relate to her because we all know what it feels like. Yes, it's got marvelous splashes of color, gorgeous scenery and costumes, great acting and wonderful, classic musical numbers, and that's also a large part of its appeal. But, whether we want to admit it or not, when you narrow it down, the main reason it was seen by so many people in theaters, by even more people on TV, and now by thousands of kids on video, (And some adults, too. Admit it!) is because it's timeless and has a lesson that is not dated and has never lost its value. Say you love it cause Judy's got pretty shoes, or because you've watched it every year and it's just a tradition, but when you look deeper, that's the real reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A beautiful masterpiece starring the magnificent Judy Garland as young Dorothy Gale is what "The Wizard of Oz" is, and when I saw this movie as a child, I watched it over and over again, and became a big Judy Garland fan. Judy has a sweet, powerful, golden voice which can echo in the dark and become so unforgettable, and Judy was so ahead of her time during her career. I think it's wonderful that her daughter, Liza Minnelli, who I also adore, carries on her mother's legacy. Liza, too, has an unforgettable voice as well, very brassy, cool, and sexy -- this woman can sing -- her voice is like a kiss! Like mother like daughter!"The Wizard of Oz", however, isn't like any movie that there was back then. It was all life like with the magical land of Oz, the creative imagination that is put into this film is unbelieveable...it just takes your breath away!Sometimes I wonder what this film would be like if it was released today in this year or if it was remade with another cast. Who would play Dorothy Gale? Everyone knows that no one can ever top Judy's performance of Dorothy Gale. Judy's an original. The cast is original. This film is original. One of the greatest movies of the 20th century!!!!!!</fullReview>

The sound and picture quality has been fixed up for this Special Edition version. Dorothy needs to get home, the Scarecrow wants a brain, the Tin Man wants a heart and the Lion wants courage. This is a classic is both magical and enduring. I think it most rightly takes it's place as the Sixth greatest film of all time according to me and the AFI. If you have not seen this movie on the big screen I suggest that you go see it. This is a classic that will be with us forever. I give this movie 5/5. Rated G.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible Writing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This ambitious musical works on every level, despite the fact that it detours quite a bit from the original book from L. Frank Baum. The story, as everyone already knows, centers around young Dorothy (age indistinct in the film) and her search for "home." During her wild adventure, she survives being carried by a tornado and dumped into a surrealistic place called Munchkinland. Here she meets both the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Glinda, already knowing how Dorothy can return to Kansas, sends her on an arduous journey down the Yellow Brick Road, where she meets the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion. Throughout the film, each character clearly shows that he or she already possesses what they covet most, but the realization does not come until the end of the film.I have viewed this film at LEAST 50 times (I saw the original 1956 airing on CBS, and was there for the final showing this past May), and I'm STILL finding something new every time I see it. For instance, did anyone else ever notice that Toto has left some wet spots on Dorothy's dress in the very beginning of the movie when she leans down in the road? For me, however, the greatest joy comes from the wonderfully rich writing ("You clinking, clanking, colossal pile of coligenous junk!") Listen carefully at Miss Gulch's threat to the Gales at the beginning of the movie ("I'll bring a damn suit against your whole farm!") Please set me straight if I am wrong. This film is timeless, if flawed by choppy editing at times. One of MY favorites, though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is widely considered one of the best of all time and rightfully so, because that's exactly what it is. Loved by most and hated by few, that's another thing that this movie is. That's not to say that everybody knows this movie, because there's no such thing as a movie that everyone knows, but its popularity is unquestionable.This is such a charming and timeless movie. It does everything right. It has, like I said, charm. But it has more. It has a youthful feeling that makes it a perfect movie for those who are young at heart from children to elderly people, unusual characters, unique sceneries and backgrounds (both those of Kansas and those of the land of Oz), great lines, comedy, darkness, an inspiring soundtrack, incredible special-effects for the time, the use of sepia-toned black and white and the use of Technicolor."The Wizard of Oz" must have been made in a unique moment of inspiration, while Victor Fleming's other 1939 film, the overrated "Gone with the wind" must have been made in one of the most uninspired moments!Judy Garland is great as Dorothy Gale. So is Frank Morgan in all the different roles he plays. Other great performances include Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow (the funniest of all characters), Jack Haley as the Tin Man, Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion and the dog Terry as Toto. To finish my review, I'm glad that this is on Top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe a little overrated, but still a classic and influential piece of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how many people realize it, but this book and movie were actually written to be a political statement. I don't know what everything symbolizes, but there's plenty of potential for that with the colors and the witches being from the West, North, and East, things like "People without brains do an awful lot of talking", the Munchkins making Dorothy a national hero for doing essentially nothing, and all of the characters already having the things they wanted to ask the wizard for. But that sort of thing is more marketable as a book, so they turned it into a more innocent children's story. Of course, a lot of the current adult generation have stories of how they would always get scared at certain points of the movie when it aired on TV every year, so it's up for debate whether it's really good for kids.There were a number of things that I would normally have had issues with, but I gave the filmmakers the benefit of the doubt in most of these cases. Some of the quality of the acting, scripting, and general mood would be pathetic in a modern movie, but those things weren't as far along in the late 30's. Therefore, I feel it would be wrong of me to criticize them. The whole movie felt more like a play with the musical numbers and the way the actors often moved around the sets. Aside from that, everything seemed overly on-cue like in a theatrical production. Then again, this has been shown as a play plenty of times as well, so there might be good reason for that.All of our characters are rather shallow, but have definite arcs. Dorothy has essentially two moods: simple meekness, and ethically prim anger. I guess this proves how much she really values home since she holds onto the values that have always been taught to her. You can see the other characters' gifts, or lack thereof, emerging throughout the movie. In some ways this seems a little cheesy, but it makes sense if you consider that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are all the way they are more due to self-image than anything else. The Wicked Witch is, if nothing else, a memorable villain, and was probably a template for a lot of Disney villains. The Wizard is sort of an interesting character in his own way. He's a classic example of, and perhaps a critique of, people who lie in an attempt to help others.The story is pretty straightforward, and you probably know the basic idea already. Follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and figure out that there's no place like home and that you have to solve your own problems. Even if you don't know the story beforehand, the song reprisals make it pretty easy to remember the motivation behind everything. There's sort of an ambiguous ending since you don't know whether Dorothy actually went to Oz. It's not mind-bendingly ambiguous, but it's still interesting to see how Dorothy rationalized everything from her own life into Oz, given that it's all a dream.The transition from sepia-scale to color was a good call outside of the technical feat of a color movie in the 30's. The color factor I think accounts for much of the publicity surrounding this film. I've always felt that technical feats are cause for a movie to be overrated, and you don't have to look far to find examples of spfx generating massive ratings. I think there is some of that going on here, but there's also a good deal of literary integrity in the film.I don't know any better way to recommend this than to suggest that you make your own call. Most likely, you already know what you're going to get from this movie, so there's no use in me muddling your own judgment. It's certainly not the pinnacle of entertainment, but there are a few parts where you'll laugh and maybe feel for the characters to an extent. If nothing else, it might be worth watching to better understand the references people make of it. Overall Rating: 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential American Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that few films age well, as audiences grow used the high end production, special effects and various technologies that are integral to today's movies. The Wizard of Oz, on the contrary, remains a true classic, one that withstands the test of time as both an unforgettable visual work of art and a fantastic piece of storytelling. The film is adapted from L. Frank Baum's novel of a similar title, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Although it is not traditionally regarded as fairy tale, it contains several recognizable elements of one, such as themes of childhood and a conflict of good and evil.The film was quite groundbreaking for it's time, being one of the first movies shot in Technicolor. One of the most under-appreciated aspects of the film is its cinematography. The story begins in sepia tone, with the main character, Dorothy. Following a chaotic sequence involving a tornado in which she is knocked unconscious, the movie really starts to get interesting. The camera jumps to a long- shot frame of her house falling rapidly through the sky, only for it to land with her unharmed. Dorothy climbs out of bed, and the screen slowly pans to the right as she walks over to the door. This creates an air of suspense, and when she opens the door to look outside, the audience sees a fantasy landscape bursting with color. The way in which the movie transitions to Technicolor is beautifully done, and could even be described as psychedelic. Now that is how you grab an audience's attention.The Wizard of Oz is a brilliantly scripted movie with a story that all ages can enjoy. There is hardly a dull moment for the entire 101-minute run time, and the tale of Dorothy and the people she meets flows seamlessly. Dorothy's friends, named the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Woodman, and the Scarecrow are all engaging. They are classic fairy tail characters- lovable, but retain human qualities and self-perceived flaws. The dialogue amongst them is quirky and fun, adding humor and comedic relief to a film primarily about adventure. Dorothy is sixteen years old, however she carries the demeanor of a child throughout the story. She is portrayed as na?ve and blunt, and needs reassurance and support from her friends. As with many fairy tales, her end goal is to make it back home to Kansas. Another overarching theme in the movie that is common to fairy tales is the conflict of good and evil that Dorothy gets stuck between, where there is an ongoing battle between Glinda the Good Witch of the East and the Wicked Witch of the West. Without giving away any spoilers, The Wizard of Oz surprisingly includes revenge and death (something native to traditional fairy tales) within this ongoing battle, something you certainly wouldn't encounter in today's world within a movie marketed for children. The obvious influence of classic fairy tales goes over quiet well, and gives the story another layer of complexity, granting lessons for children to learn from the story while providing older audiences themes to analyze and compare to fairy tales they grew up watching.The story of Dorothy's journey through Oz is more than just an adventure with an added fairy tale twist. The Wizard of Oz is a classic film, an American staple, and a masterfully crafted work of art. Everyone, from kids to parents and casual movie goers to film buffs can appreciate this movie. The Wizard of Oz isn't just a must- watch, it's a necessary watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of my favorite films of all time and I will make this a short review.The plot follows the book very nicely and this movie is known for it's use of Technicolor, fantasy storytelling, musical score, amazing songs and unusual characters, but over the years it has become one of the best known of all films and part of American popular culture.The film also featured what may be the most elaborate use of character make-up effects and special effects in a film up to that time.This was MGM's most expense production up to that time, having a budget of just $2 million dollars and earned only $3 million dollars, but due to re-releases, the film has grossed a lot more and has also been showed on TV, as well including Cartoon Network, TCM, TBS and TNT.The story is just wonderful and the 1939 film, follows the book nicely and it was really amazing to see and the song "Over the Rainbow" won an Oscar for best original song and was ranked first in the AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs list.The performances in this film are great. The late actors, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Terry the Dog as Toto, Ray Bolger, Jack Haley, Bert Lahr, Billie Burke, Margaret Hamilton, Charley Grapewin, Clara Blandick, the Singer Midgets as the Munchkins and Pat Walshe as the leader of the flying monkey and those performances are really fantastic in this film.The film is also named the most viewed motion picture All Time in various critics and popular polls including IMDb's Top 250 List and is the source of many memorable quotes referenced today in modern popular culture.It was directed by the late Victor Fleming, who also directed Gone With the Wind and the screenplay was written by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf. The lyrics were written by E.Y. Harburg and music were composed by Harold Arlen.The make-up and visual effects are really amazing, but they are just cool and is fantastic, but really spectacular. The characters are all true to the way they are written in the book. My favorite characters in the film are The Scarecrow, The Tin Man, The Cowardly Lion, The Wicked Witch of the West, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North and The Flying Monkeys. I also love Dorothy and Toto.The way the movie is shot was just amazing and I have no problem with the film's cinematography because to me, this movie does not feel like it ages at all.Overall, I love THE WIZARD OF OZ. It is earned a right to be called "a classic". The film gets a 10 out of 10 and it really deserves to get that from me because I have no problem re-watching this one again also.This is one movie that really deserves to be remade and I would love a chance to direct a remake, or at least write the script and play the Scarecrow because he is a cool character. My version would be a 2 hour and 10 minute movie of the 1939 film and I would love a chance to remake it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining, but also... enlightening</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone knows the story to this classic fantasy from 1939: A tornado rips through Dorthy's home in Kansas and transports her to the land of Oz where she meets a scarecrow in need of a brain, a lion in need of courage and a tin man in need of a heart. They then venture to the Emerald City in search of the eponymous wizard. "The Wizard of Oz" is eminently entertaining for both kids and adults. The message is great to boot. Yes, it's about developing your head, heart, and courage to find your way "home," but its most potent moral is about pulling back the curtain on politics, authorities and religion to expose the feeble phony pulling the levers.Which isn't to say that all such authorities are feeble phonies, of course, just that we need to be ever conscious of the fakes trying to manipulate us by pulling our strings.What a work of brilliance!The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz (1939)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were to ask anybody, the likelihood of them telling you that they have never seen "The Wizard of Oz" is slim to none. As one of the most iconic films in American history, "The Wizard of Oz" is an enchanting film filled with laughter, music, and an intriguing story line that leaves you wanting to join Dorothy and the crew in the magical land of Oz.Brilliantly made, the transition from black-and-white Kansas to the colorful land of Oz is a truly wonderful moment in the history of film. Nobody can forget the moment dashes of color began to fill the screen as everything came to life along the yellow brick road. The characters in this film are somewhat iconic themselves, as everybody knows who the Tin Man (Jack Haley), the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr), and the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) are. They are, of course, some of the most memorable characters ever to skip across our screens.The plot never ceases to amaze, no matter how many times you've seen the film. There is always something new, always something you missed, to pull you right back in just as it had so many times before. As one of American History's most classic films, "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) is a film like no other of it's time. A marvelous cast and an electric plot, there is no doubt in my mind that this film should be at the top of everybody's lists of most beloved movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly love this film. The Wizard of Oz in my opinion is a timeless classic. From the simple yet fantastical plot and setting to the catchy and well done musical sections, this film fully delivers. Dorothy's venture into the land of Oz focuses on the imperfections faced by humans in life, and shows how people are similar in this way and have the ability to unite and search for the answer to their imperfections together. The "creatures" Dorothy encounter throughout her journey are all diverse and interesting in their own way, yet they are relate-able in a sense that they all seek something in common. The land of Oz itself is also defined, as the viewer is shown the bright and positive settings and locale as well as the dark and malicious. I recommend this film to just about anyone. In my opinion, it is a film that sticks within your mind days after it is watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love the wizard of oz! Such a fantastic story with a great message and strongly developed characters that really touch your heart. The cinematography is great, I enjoy seeing this early use of effects such as when Glinda appears from the bubbles, the twister scene, and Oz himself. The costumes are a noteworthy aspect, with each one being so different and so detailed it deserves some praise. Somewhere over the rainbow is beautifully iconic as well as many other aspects of this film, spawning many years of tributes, remakes, spin offs, and parodies even. This movie has secured a huge part of American pop culture in the 20th century. It's got so much heart, and it was a huge step in the beginnings of fantasy as a genre. Definitely worth watching if you have never seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made. The color in this film is the first thing that stood out to me. The transition from the black and white to more vibrant colors like red, orange, blue, and yellows really drew me in and made the movie even more dream-like. Also, the special effects in this film are definitely something to be talked about. Because of the time, the effects are not computer generated. However, this causes you to use your imagination and really engulf yourself into the film to see what the filmmakers wanted you to see. The Wizard of Oz is one of those films that every person should see at least once in their life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Personal Letter To The Wicked Witch Of The East</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear Wicked Witch Of The East,So sorry you died. It seems like getting out of the way of a house falling out of the sky is not a tall order for someone with your noteworthy powers, but c'est la vie. It was those pesky Munchkins, wasn't it? They distracted you, what with their high-pitched singing and their Lollipop Guild. Who gave those shrimps the right to unionize? It was probably the Wizard. That guy is drunk with power...or perhaps with alcohol.Rumour has it you intended to legacy those sparkling shoes of yours to your sister (along with your china hutch and photo albums), but that was not honoured. The Northern Witch stole your glittering footwear and gave them to---irony alert---the very jerk who crushed you. Perhaps a calculated violent response is in order. The young girl's trio of friends should not pose a credible threat. Their total combined IQ might not break double digits.Oh, right, there's a juicy piece of news! The shoe-stealer has made some friends here in Oz, among them a jelly-legged straw man, a metal axe-man, and the biggest pussy of a lion?perhaps ever. All of them are remarkably inept at their jobs (scare-crowing, wood-cutting, and scare-peopling). Lest I forget, the shoe thief also has a small canine companion. Resourceful little pooch. He's great at busting phonies who hide behind curtains.As for your sis, she's, uh, indisposed. She seems to have disappeared and her employees aren't talking. They're singing and chanting, but not talking. Perhaps she left Oz for somewhere vacationy, like Kansas. And why not? I hear there's no place like it.Much love, UsP.S. Glinda is still a jerk.If you got a kick out of this snapshot review, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 40-minute Wizard Of Oz 'cast...and many others.

		<shortDescription>book vs movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got to admit that as a child the book was probably more exciting than the movie, but as an adult the movie has a better effect, since it is more realistic and less fantastic. Oz is not a real place but a result of the subconscious mind, which picks up information from the everyday life, especially in cases of stress or difficulties, like in the case of Dorothy and her feelings of not being appreciated and causing trouble to her family. After the tornado when she gets hit in the head and goes unconscious, we see her mind trying to put together the information her subcontinent mind received prior the accident and made a story out of it and created this magical place in which she learns to deal with her troubles and goes into a journey with her inseparable sidekick pet to solve her confusions and realize that her family and friends love her and she doesn't need to run away because her aunt and uncle need her. When Dorothy regains consciousness she doesn't believe it was a dream, it was a real place and cannot make the connections of the fictional characters with the real ones. Fascinatingly this is how the brain works especially while we have lucid dreams or we are influenced by subliminal messages, mass media advertisements, watching TV, or any other state where we are not aware of our thoughts. So this movie works very well at showing this phenomenon. But this is just one example of the greatness of this film which will remain a timeless classic for ages. I am against remakes for great films, especially after recently watching the remake of Alice in wonderland, but I will look forward to see a remake of the Wizard of OZ with the current special effects technology and a great cast, score and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful film. Watching it on the big screen is truly adds a lot to the film -expecially in Kansas. I watched fellow Kansans smile, cry, and laugh. Dorothy Gale is a Kansas farm girl and pretty tough. I wonder about the Cowardly Lion. He seems a little funny. The monkeys are scary. Yet it all comes back to Kansas. I think about times I've traveled and the flight attendant will say "click your heels three times, you're back in Kansas." Every time it makes me smile. To know that Kansas is known for something that is so special to so many people is very gratifying. Gee, it makes me feel sorry for states like New Jersey that lack the sort of identity that Kansas has. Clerks and Jersey Girl are fine yet Oz is clearly in a whole other category. Truly a classic and one of my favourites.10 out of 10 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is maybe one of the most known films ever, as it is difficult to people to remember a film earlier the 50's this is one that everyone can remember. And the film really deserves it. Dorothy is not understood in her farm of Kansas, she only wants to enjoy her time and she can't, so she wishes to go over the rainbow and travel to another place to be happy. then, a tornado catches her and takes her to the wonderful world of the Wizard of Oz, where she will live great adventures before returning home. With a perfect treatment of colour and a delicious music, the movie is a superb chant to fantasy and has influenced lots of films than has come after (for example "Mary Poppins", does anyone can avoid the likeness being inside the picture and arriving to Muchkinland?). The film is sometimes quite childish (well it is a film for kids), but it is never sweety, it arrives to a perfect level of cuteness than cannot be but congratulated. In addition the songs are really good and, as later has happened with most Disney's films, are never the main part of the film; so the result is great. On the other hand, time has passed and, for example, special effects and make-up have changed a lot, but the film is so good that you will not take this in account. One of the best film in history, really really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say, first of all, that "The Wizard Of Oz" simply isn't my sort of film at all. I thought it was too dated, too camp a musical (*shudders*) for me to enjoy at all. Oh, I understand how important a film it is and I understand why people do enjoy it but I just felt that it wasn't for me. So imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch this before Christmas, only to find that I DID enjoy this film very much indeed. A big slice of humble pie for me, I feel! Just in case you are completely ignorant about film and its long history, Judy Garland plays Dorothy Gale, an innocent farmer's daughter in Kansas whose best friend is her dog Toto. But her life is soon turned upside down when a vicious tornado lifts her home into the sky while she's still inside. When she wakes up, she finds herself in the mysteriously colourful land of Oz surrounded by dancing midgets and told by the Good Witch Of The North (Billie Burke) to visit the Wizard of Oz (Frank Morgan) in the Emerald City. Rather than questioning her sanity, Dorothy soon meets others needing to see the Wizard - a lion (Bert Lahr) without any courage, a scarecrow (Ray Bolger) needing a brain and a tin man (Jack Haley) needing a heart.It is strictly story-telling by numbers, almost pantomime in its delivery and the ending, though well known, feels like the precursor to soaps like "Dallas" and "Sunset Beach". But even today, this still comes across as a massive leap forward for film-making - remember, this was originally released before the Second World War. The transition from sepia-toned Kansas to bright, dazzling Oz is a revelation and sets the tone for the film. Everything in this film raises the standard for films to follow, from the disturbing flying monkeys to the costumes and special effects. And although it naturally looks dated these days, this film is still something special to watch. It's akin to listening to the Beatles or the Sex Pistols for the first time - it doesn't sound as fresh as it did but you still understand why it made the impact it did at the time.I'm still of the opinion that this film is too camp and colourful a musical (*shudders*) for me to enjoy fully but if you enjoy a feel-good classic then you should either watch this film as soon as possible or you will have already seen it. It is undeniably a landmark film and one that should be appreciated as much today as it was then. It isn't for everybody - any fans of stuff like "The Terminator" or Steven Seagal are unlikely to get much from this - but if it melts the cynical old heart of a curmudgeon like myself then maybe, it can for you too. "The Wizard of Oz" is simply movie magic, end of story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest fantasy trip of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like this usually come once in a lifetime. It's been over 60 years and people still watch it in admiration. New generations are also discovering and appreciating its messages of benignity, optimism, and aspiration. The story is simple, Dorothy and her beloved dog Toto are transported to the brightly-colored world of Oz after a tornado hits Kansas. She wants to get home but must first follow the yellow brick road leading to Emerald City where only one person can help her--The Wizard of Oz. Along the way, she makes three best friends in the form of a talking Scarecrow, a heartless Tin Man, and a Cowardly Lion. She also faces wits with the Wicked Witch of the West who is after those magical ruby slippers. Everything about this film is superlative. The cinematography is gorgeous. We start off in a black and white Kansas where the landscape looks dry and desolate. Then the film transitions to an eye candy Technicolor world called Oz. It also has ingeniously-written musical numbers performed by some of the greatest talents of yesteryear. Judy Garland leads a wonderful cast full of paramount performers. Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, and Jack Haley are unforgettable as Dorothy's three sidekicks. Frank Morgan (in 5 roles) is terrific and Margaret Hamilton is wickedly fun as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch of the West. Kudos to the director (or directors) for creating such an endearing film that brings jolly entertainment to people of all ages. This is by far, the greatest fantasy, musical, adventure, moral story of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not a Children's Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting treatment of the human unconscious can be found in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming and featuring Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton, Billie Burke and Frank Morgan. A young adolescent girl, Dorothy, living with her aunt and uncle on a farm in Kansas, is threatened with the loss of her dog, Toto, who is not only her pet but her best friend, confidante and closest companion. Powerless to prevent Toto from being removed from the home (Toto had bitten Ms. Gulch, the town sour puss), Dorothy runs away from home, taking Toto with her. On the road she encounters a kindly traveling salesman who through clever trickery convinces the highly suggestible girl that she must return home at once. Now alarmed, Dorothy rushes back to her home but on the way a tornado is fast approaching the farm. When she finally arrives home, the family has taken refuge in the cellar and cannot hear Dorothy's frantic banging on the cellar door. Now terrified, Dorothy and Toto rush into the house which is shaking violently from the tornado which is now directly over the house. Dorothy is struck on the head by flying debris and is knocked unconscious. She awakes to find herself in a strange new land called Oz where she meets many interesting characters and experiences many adventures as she struggles to find her way back home. She is told by the good witch of the north that she has to follow the yellow brick road. While traveling on the yellow brick road Dorothy's fortitude is repeatedly tested as she fends herself, Toto and her friends against the wicked witch of the west, a violent and malevolent figure who blames Dorothy for the death of her sister, the wicked witch of the east, and has vowed revenge. Finally, after finding the Wizard of Oz, who is revealed to be a fraud, Dorothy is preparing to leave the land of Oz by floating back to Kansas in a balloon. But her plan goes awry when Toto jumps from the balloon and Dorothy follows leaving her stranded as the balloon floats away; at this point she awakes and is disoriented, adamantly insisting to her family and farm hands, who are standing around her, that her dream was real. Dorothy however has changed. At the start of the movie, she is behaving like a frightened little girl, whining and cranky, but after she awakes she has matured and is now aware of the power and strength that was buried deep inside her unconscious and which surfaced in the dream and is now part of her consciousness. Besides presenting a unique and provocative story, what makes this movie particularly effective as a work of art is the strong acting, especially that of Margaret Hamilton whose portrayal of the wicked witch of the west, with her loud, cackling laugh, ugly, distorted sneer, and greenish skin, is the epitome of evil. Far from being campy, this movie explores several psychological themes, including consciousness vs. unconsciousness, developmental issues, inter-familial dynamics, the nature of dreams, and behavioral issues, and highlights virtues such as courage, fortitude and loyalty, delves into the nature of conflict, the nature of terror, provides a credible portrayal of separation anxiety, and explores gender roles and death. Further, a particularly intriguing feature of this movie is that both the protagonist (Dorothy) and antagonist (the wicked witch of the west) are strong female figures locked in a life or death struggle in a hostile, unfamiliar environment. Indeed, the wicked witch of the west directly commands an army while Dorothy directly commands three male figures, including a lion and later the wizard of oz himself. The male characters are portrayed as being dependent, indecisive, vulnerable and subordinate to the females who dominate all facets of the story. And what makes this movie even more impressive is that it was produced not by mental health experts but by a Hollywood studio wanting to create a commercial product based on a book for children written by a journalist. The movie also features several songs that have become iconic fixtures in contemporary western culture and still attracts a large audience, seventy one years after its initial release. The Wizard of Oz may be the most-watched movie in history.Don't let the title fool you. It's not a children's story. Rather it's a complex tale involving a confused and rebellious teenage girl who runs away from home, is knocked unconscious in a storm and has a dream that is essentially one long nightmare, as the terrified girl desperately seeks a way to return home, a home that she had forsaken. In her nightmare/dream she meets many bizarre characters, all of whom are caricatures of people she knows in her real life, and these characters are strange and scary, especially the wicked witch who absolutely loathes the girl, who has no one to protect her except three companions whose inadequacies are a central feature of the story. In fact, the girl would have done better to have avoided these characters -the lion who is a coward, the rusty tin man with no heart, and the scarecrow with nothing but hay inside him - but then there would not have been a movie. The music is catchy, and Judy Garland's rendition of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is truly classic, and the color cinematography is great, so I definitely recommend it. But this movie could frighten young children who do not understand the complexities of the story and characters, and could frighten adults as well, especially those adults who are afraid of screaming green skinned women who fly around on broom sticks and melt when they are doused by a bucket of water.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who has not seen this film does not know what cinema is. The term, "classic" is far too loosely used but I know of no film more aptly designated. I saw it first when I was 6 years old and I can think of no film that so delighted and enchanted me. Munchkintown was a riot of color that left a lasting impression, Billie Burke, as Glinda, Good Witch of the North, was the incarnation of grace and beauty - and was there ever a more hideous Wicked Witch than Margaret Hamilton? - She scared the Hell out of me and gave me nightmares for days afterwards - talk about a tribute to an actress's performance. It's hard to believe that Ray Bolger as a second choice for the Scarecrow - the Studio originally wanted Jack Haley, who, ironically, became the TinMan! The wonderful Frank Morgan, whose kind nature brought such sweetness to his portrayal of the Wizard was a second choice - the studios wanted W.C. Fields, whose sour nature would, I believe, have left a bitter, aftertaste in the role of Professor Marvel which I believe Frank Morgan fulfilled far more capably. A glorious production.</fullReview>

There have been so many different translations and opinions of this film, but honestly, it is one of the greatest films of all time. From the start, you are immediately "sucked" into the storyline, relating to Dorothy in those times in which you were neglected by people. THen as you are transported into this technicolor world, surrounded by short people and talking objects and creatures, you imagine a world that is perfect (except for the wicked witch of course) After seeing the movie, you are captivated by the imaginative world that has been created inside your mind. That is what a good movie is about, it's about being more than just a kid, but the most important person to a group of people. This makes up for the neglected childhood. :D</fullReview>

Both are spectacular and are noted for their classic film scores and magnificent use of deep, rich Technicolor. Both are well-loved all over the planet and always will be! Much has been written about which film would have been the winner of the Best Picture Oscar of the year had "Gone With the Wind" not been released that year. Unanimously, "The Wizard of Oz" would have been the winner. Like "Gone With the Wind", it's great no matter how many times you've seen it. One never tires of Judy Garland.

If you don't know the story, you absolutely must see this film. Don't even read the rest of the review, just go see it! This movie "captured my imagination" when I was a kid, and to see it now, after over twenty years was to rediscover it. Honestly, it was like seeing an old friend. However, I got even more out of seeing it now than I did as a child. Aside from the awe-inspiring land of Oz, the brilliant use of Technicolor to suggest another "world," and the tender performance of Judy Garland, this film contains little bits of Wiz-dom that make it that much more enjoyable years later. Warm performances from Frank Morgan, as Professor Marvel/The Wizard of Oz (among other roles in the picture), Ray Bolger, as Hunk/The Scarecrow, Bert Lahr, as Zeke/The Cowardly Lion, and Jack Haley, as Hickory/The Tin Man, all add to the sincerity of the film. Margaret Hamilton is great as the heartless Ms. Gulch and the sinister Wicked Witch of the West. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially anyone with children. This is a wonderful fantasy/musical! Truly delightful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic cinema for literally all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Victor Fleming's film "The Wizard of Oz" has proven itself to be one of the most beloved films of all time. Nearly all films that prove their quality through staying power (you don't see immediately popular films like "Titanic" achieving longevity) are great films. "The Wizard of Oz" is one of those films. From the earliest scenes in the film, directed by an uncredited King Vidor (see "The Crowd" for more of his great work), there is a magic that accompanies the film. The film isn't just for children or for those who have seen the film before - seeing it for the first time when you are older is a great experience as well.Although there have been many negative comments on the film, those derisively calling it children's fare, the film is actually extremely well made. One has to consider the time period in which it was made (1939) - when all films were meant for families. For those who are still skeptical, there is always Todd Solondz, since you must believe that all great films must be explicitly adult-oriented.For proof of the film's greatness, just watch the great special effects during the tornado sequence, which rival "Twister" for closeness to reality. The acting is not stilted - it's a different form than the Stanislavski/Method form we've been used to since Brando.There never has (or will be) a film quite as uplifting, magical, and well-made as "The Wizard of Oz".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Non-Disney Family Film Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1939, many classic films came out including this one. This film proved that Disney didn't corner the market when it came to quality films for the whole family. The message of this film is quite simple, that home is where you can find it and that running away doesn't solve your problems. This simple message transcends the generations and that is why this film is so popular. On a more humorous note, I'm surprised that more people haven't pointed out the numerous references to drugs (poppies, snow etc.). No wonder a lot of people always say there is a connection between this film and one of the trippiest albums of all time, Pink Floyd's classic "Dark Side of the Moon".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This marvellous film is so much a part of my childhood that I can't really look at it too objectively. But the more I watch it as an adult, the more impressed I am by the sheer quality of the sets, the special effects and the make-up. As a child you take it for granted, but to think all this was done in 1939. For serious Oz fans I would highly recommend Aljean Harmetz's fascinating book, which contains all the background info about the shoot and the planning of the film. The DVD is also good value and contains several scenes which were taken out of the finished version (such as the well-known "Jitterbug" sequence.)Every Christmas I sit down to watch this film, and I don't mind admitting that every time I hear "Over the Rainbow", it brings tears to my eyes. (The songs are, of course, another huge contribution to the movie's greatness.) The scene when Dorothy opens the door and walks into Oz, and the screen is filled with colour for the first time, is another memorable moment.The proverb may say that familiarity breeds contempt, but in the case of this film I doubt I will ever tire of it. Mind you, I am a friend of Dorothy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie, the screenwriters should have read the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Judy Garland, and of course, this is her defining role. The costumes, the songs, and the scenery have now become more than just classic, they're practically legendary. However, a pet peeve of mine is that everybody has seen the movie and NOBODY has read the book. The screenwriters in the 1930s seem to be famous for twisting famous stories around to glitz them up for Hollywood. Please read the book, and find out the differences, for example: Dorothy was certainly NOT sixteen, her slippers were NOT made of rubies, and most importantly, OZ was not a dream! It supposedly really existed, and there are 14 books on what happened after the first one-did anybody know that Aunt Em and Uncle Henry moved there? I hope this review inspires just one person to pick up a copy and read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...well, this is my favourite movie! What do you want me to say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this is the best film of all time. That is, of the movies I have so far seen. I've seen a few movies. I'm only 17 years old, by the way. I've seen enough to identify a "great" film. I only saw this one a few months ago and I have since been calling it my all-time favourite movie. But then there's the all-powerful question: why? Hm! Why indeed...My all-time favourite(funny how we call it that) before this one was "Mary Poppins". This one has basically the same great elements I described in my comment on that film, only better. What more do you want in a kid's movie? I'm sure adults would prefer something of a bit more adult-taste, but that's what makes good kid's movies so great, the sly adult humour!!The best kid's movies have sly adult humour. Just look at the grisly "Babe: Pig in the City" and the "Toy Story" movies. They are subtext-galore! But of course, the secret to a great kid's movie is attracting the kids. Once you've drawn the kids in, you know you've done a good job. Once you've drawn the adults in, you know you've done a great job!"The Wizard of Oz" is great in sooooooooo many ways I will not begin to describe them!! Oh, all right, one way. The black and white(red and white?) beginning and end have more stark realism to them than most adult's movies and the anticipation of the colour brings the hyperactive imagination of this masterpiece forward in joyous splendour!This film is a work of pure imagination, intelligence and entertainment. It enriches you in every way possible and leaves you feeling a sensation that can't be described as an emotion. How many movies can do that to you? Only one!It has been said that no-one can truly lay claim to "The Wizard of Oz". Not even Judy Garland(who isalmost as good as Julie Andrews in "Mary Poppins") or MGM. I think that is a welcome relief to me, after scores and scores of "Alfred Hitchcock's..." movies and "A Film By..." appearing on the screen before a film. This film feels as though it has fallen from the sky or from "over the rainbow". I believe the soundtrack to be the most important thing in a movie and I think this movie has the best soundtrack ever. Don't ever change it! It is fine the way it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm over the rainbow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All things aside, this is still one of the greatest movies ever made. The story is one of the most treasured and well known in the world, its morals are true, its idealisms simple but realistic. And everything combined, undisputed it is one of the immortal classics of 1939, one of the golden years of Hollywood, which is only rivaled by 1941."Oz" is all a fantasy, but a good one at that. Simple story telling, yes incredibly clever, but makes some of the most effective entertainment ever. Some of my high school friends still remained crushed at the fact that after attempting to imitate Judy Garland singing "Over the Rainbow" they did not find themselves in Oz.I admit it, I only first saw the movie when I was twelve. So I missed out on the terrible losses of being afraid of the Wicked Witch of the West at age five. By the time I was thirteen and completely off what I perceived as the sugary, forgotten movies which lacked realism and failed to address proper issues, I disliked anything that was made before the 1990s. After "The Sound of Music", the movie which I previously loathed above any other, I began to rediscover some of the cinematic treasures.And this is one of them. "Oz" was Dorothy's utopia. Her world literally had been whipped up in that cyclone with Miss Gulch on her heels. Most of us have our own "Oz", a place we think that is better as our own, but further in, are we supposed to discover that there simply is "No place like home?"This movie introduced many a new thing to the world. It proved that the public like fantasies. For one, I discovered exactly why everyone rambled on about munchkins or uttered other phrases such as "Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore" or "We're off to see the Wizard".Bert Lahr unfortunately found it difficult getting other castings afterwards other than lions, and it established Judy as one of the forces in history, this performance alone. For in her peak performance, none of her others can be equaled. Watching her as the lost, disheartened, naive Dorothy singing "Over the Rainbow" is heartbreaking. Just that one rendition has conjured up self images of beheading Shirley Temple if she played Dorothy, and only because of the picture's massive budget. Yes, Judy's voice seems too big for Dorothy, but it could not be right any other way."The Wizard of Oz" is a cinematic blessing, a stroke of pure genius. It has everything it needs on its side, with the partial exception of early editing annoyances, but is otherwise an almost flawless conception. The score itself is an immortalised masterpiece. "The Sound of Music" remains my musical favourite, but "Oz" gets a look in there in the top 5. Even "Singin' in the Rain" cannot surpass this one.My only complaint of the musical is that MGM released it in the year on which they were focusing more on "Gone With the Wind". The public reaction was so strong for "Gone With the Wind" receiving the Best Picture statuette that year it would have been impossible for anything else to take the top prize. In 1940, "Oz" would have been a pure breadwinner.The film survives in an era where we are searching harder for 'quality' entertainment. There's no need to look beyond your back yard for this one. It's in the video collection. Or should be.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight...even if some of the songs really make very little sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WIZARD OF OZ is a great film, so please don't be offended and think I hate it--I don't, and have seen it perhaps a dozen times or more. It is truly a classic. However, the last time I saw it, I was surprised because now that I am middle-aged, I finally really listened to some of the songs. While some, such as "Over the Rainbow" were amazingly sublime, a few surprised me because they had great music but the lyrics were, well, nonsense. Try listening to some of the songs and you might notice that the lyrics, while memorable, are a bit silly. Really...and this is the only reason I can't give this film a 10.However, despite this minor complaint, what else is there about the film that could be improved? Judy Garland is perfect and at her best. The cinematography, costumes, sets and everything about the film is first-rate--even if the story, at times, diverges greatly from Frank Baum's original tale. A film that you must see if you haven't. Just try NOT to pay attention to lyrics in songs like "We're Off to See the Wizard" and "If I Only Had a Brain". It might give you a headache. Here are a couple examples:"You'll find he is a whiz of a Wiz! If ever a Wiz! there was. If ever oh ever a Wiz! there was The Wizard of Oz is one because...""I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry, If I only had a brain."Oh, and one other problem. At the end of the film, there is no resolution with Miss Gulch and you can assume she STILL is going to have Toto put down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wizard of Oz, The (1939) **** (out of 4)One of the most popular films ever made is also one I haven't watched in many, many years. I must be honest and say that I never really understood all the hype surrounding this movie when I was young but finally seeing it as an adult made me appreciate it a lot more. Everyone knows the story so there's no point in going over it again but after this viewing I must come full circle and say I understand why this film is so loved and why it remains so popular even when classic movies aren't. I guess what really stuck out to me the most this time around was the brilliant look at the movie, which jumps off the screen unlike many other movies. The Technicolor is downright brilliantly used and the imagination of the colors is so remarkable that it's quite easy to forget you're watching a movie. The trip down the Golden Brick Road brings forward various designs and they are all remarkably done that it's still quite amazing to see them all put to use in one movie. The performances are also excellent with Garland taking most of the fame from the film. There's certainly nothing wrong with that because she is excellent in the film be it her singing or her acting but to me the real highlight of the movie is the supporting cast. Ray Bolger as the Scarecrow and Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion are the ones who really stick out. The way they deliver their lines and make their characters come to life is why this film still holds up so well. The two of them really make the fantasy aspect of what's going on appear so real. Jack Haley, Frank Morgan and Margaret Hamilton are great as well. Another aspect is the actual story itself, which MGM seemed to really capture perfectly. This story had been filmed countless times in the silent era and also as recently as 1925 but the studio taking the story and what it could contain and putting it on a new level is certainly unforgettable. I also think the early sepia tone scenes in Kansas are also very important and set up what's going to follow very well. Then, of course, there are the music numbers, which I'm pretty sure at least half of everyone alive knows quite well. The musical numbers are all excellent and deserve their reputation of being some of the greatest ever written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the message still right?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the late 30's (early 40's) when this movie first came out, the message ("Don't look further than your own back yard") seemed to fit in with what was going on in the world at the time (The Great Depression, World War II, etc.) But in today's world and society, is the message still useful? Is it just me or does it seem to not fit in anymore with all the possibilities that young adults have today? We live in a society where dreams aren't impossible, so, is it a bit condescending if someone (like me who is only 18) watched this movie and heard the message to not reach for their goals and to not try and do something great with their life? Don't get me wrong, I LOVE The Wizard of Oz, and I think it has great characters and let's kids run wild with their imaginations, I just don't think that I agree with the message at the end of the story anymore.Agree or disagree, it's just how I feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the childhood lessons make this a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz offers a variety of messages, both beneficial and detrimental. The film still captures the imagination after over fifty years because of its fantastic images, and dazzling Technicolor, but much of its worth lies within the actual story. The film begins in the bleak and dreary Kansas that is Dorothy's home. She wants to go over the rainbow, a dream world where she follows a bright sunshiny road, at the end of which all of her problems will be solved. She sings and makes friends, and it is so wonderful that she even walks on jewels. But in the end, no one can help her, as the Wizard of Oz is a fraud. Her dream is crushed and she has to say goodbye to friends. She returns to Kansas realizing there is no place better than home. The film presents a classic disappointment of childhood, realizing that dreams cannot compete with reality, and imparts a moral to appreciate what one has already. Literally, the grass is greener in Oz, but Dorothy has her family and friends and love at home, and that should be enough.The film effectively discourages dreams and stifles creativity. After seeing all the horror and disappointment that Dorothy faces, children no longer want to travel down their own yellow brick road. Instead, the film encourages loyalty to home and family despite the neglect that Dorothy encounters. However, many children are told to stay out of the way and out of trouble, and the film teaches that no matter how busy one's parents are, they still love and care about their child. Perhaps this is why the Wizard of Oz has become a childhood classic. Children have fond memories of the film, especially if it is a family viewing experience. This persistent love is a reassuring message; the singing and dancing is not all that makes this a feel-good movie.The lesson that the Wizard imparts to the road weary travelers is also twofold. When he gives the tin man his heart, he says that how much he loves is unimportant, but `how much he is loved by others' that matters. He repeats similar platitudes to the scarecrow and lion. Everything they lack is simply a matter of perception, and he emphasizes the opinion of others over their own. This detrimental lesson in self-doubt and the superficial nature of human merit can also be perceived quite differently. It is very reassuring to know that all four of the wanderers have within them all of the qualities they sought. Everyone feels that he lacks something on his way to self-actualization, and the film presents a highly individualistic message that anything one wants can be found within.The Wizard of Oz is preoccupied with the transition between childhood and adulthood. Dorothy keeps forgetting that they are not in Kansas anymore. As she grows up, nothing is what she as she is accustomed to. She also takes responsibility for her actions, regretting she ran away and eager to return and care for her Auntie Em. During the passage, Dorothy has a negative realization that adults can't or don't need to make things right in the world. Aunt Em follows the law and lets Toto be taken, and the Wizard is a fraud. Dorothy can no longer rely on adults for help. She begins her journey in munchkin land, where she is physically and emotionally looked up to by the patrons for killing a wicked witch. She becomes a position of authority for each successive addition to her journey, helping the scarecrow stand, oiling the tin man, and soothing the lion's feelings. On the other hand, she makes true friends, assuring viewers that there are people one can rely on. They stand by Dorothy even when the witch threatens them, and risk themselves to help her. The message comes across most clearly when Dorothy defeats the witch in the battle between good and evil by simply being true to her friendship, trying to save the scarecrow from burning. In adulthood, she makes friends that are her equals, instead of looking up to a higher authority.The Wizard of Oz lays out important lessons on the road to adulthood. It teaches children to live in reality instead of a fantasy dream world, and take responsibility for home and family and the issues that are right in one's backyard. There is an even balance between the importance of other people's opinions as and faith in oneself. Most importantly, Dorothy is taught to act like an adult. She relies on equals for help from the witch, and herself to return to Kansas. Perhaps this is because in the time it was made, the government could not help farmers out of their troubles. They needed to tend to their own yards and form cooperatives with their neighbors, not look to a higher authority. It is these timeless lessons that make the Wizard of Oz a classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Magical After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see "The Wizard of Oz" for the first time in I don't know how long; I was mostly curious about the restoration, which was very good, not perfect (there were telltale signs of fringing and misregistration probably caused by varying shrinkage in the triple Technicolor negatives or separation masters, not surprising given the age of the movie).What I didn't expect was to be as bowled over by the movie itself as I was; I'd assumed I was a little too old for it by now. I know it forwards and backwards as, I'm sure, did most of the grownups who took their children to the screening at the Cineplex Odeon Uptown in Washington, D.C.It was a surprisingly and delightfully magical experience. Hearing Judy Garland sing "Over the Rainbow" for the umpteenth time and feeling as though it was the first - that alone was worth the price of admission. Oz was simply dazzling in Technicolor. And the special effects held up extremely well, even in this day and age of Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The wizardry of Oz is a reminder that the effects should serve the story, and not the other way around. Which brings up something else that often seems to get overlooked: the film's witty and thoughtful script.(Note to anonymous of Boston, MA: that "TV format" that disappointed you so much was the way the movie was shown originally!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very gorgeous and beautiful - but is it the best?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People have described this film as captivating, the best, most charming film they have ever seen. For some people there are a great deal many films they would prefer, but with no doubt it is likely every person will like this a wee bit in some wee way! One thing to congratulate is the special effects, which a lot of people do not seem to go on about. For the film's time, the special effects were probably the most special since films were invented (to some people anyway). Of course some of the ways they made illusions were easy, but very clever. Others were harder to make, such as the tornado and the flying monkeys.Other good points on the quality of the film are the superb acting, the way it was filmed, the scenes and the way the script was written - despite some points being not completely similar to the book. The characters of the film are very likable, especially the main four: Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Toto the dog is a delight too. The songs are very beautiful and entertaining - so is the fun dancing - avid young dancers may feel they want to get up and dance along with Dorothy, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man as they move their feet! One thing that just about everyone who watches this film will like, is the charm of the story and the characters, which is probably why this film has (sort of) gone down in history. Indeed this film is very likable and pretty captivating, a good job!The film starts in sepia to capture the mood of the setting - an old farm in Kansas and the rather dreary mood. The girl called Dorothy wishes to go to some other place and to help save her beloved dog from the stubborn Miss Gulch - who wants the dog after he annoyed her. When Toto is taken away and then escapes to return to Dorothy, it is the last straw for the girl, she is going to run away... That isn't all that happens, the plot twists and turns in a dramatic way.Enjoy "The Wizard Of Oz"!7 and a half out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am currently having a hard time with many so-called "classics." First with 'Jaws' I noticed the sloppy editing. Then, with 'Double Indemnity', I observed how Barbara Stanwyck has no sex appeal and only Robinson did anything right.This is your only spoiler warning...Here I was particularly disappointed. This is not the layered work of 'Alice', though it is a dream, but rather it's an ancestor to 'Terminator 2.' Just as 'T2' is totally constructed around action, this revolves around music...and it isn't even good listening.With "classics," the common phrase I hear in circles is "good for its day." In case they didn't notice: this is 2004, not 1939. There's a 65-year difference and, excuse me while I build a time machine, this does not hold up. If viewers are so hung up on nostalgia for times they didn't experience, what can be said of the future of film?As with 'Star Wars' we have a totally political battle or, more accurately, a musical 'Lord of the Rings', how ironic. Worst of all, there is no surrealism of a dream world, only the artificial sights (and sounds) of the munchkins and Emerald City. Shallow stage musicals were never so celebrated as here.I lived in Kansas for two years and, by golly, the rest of the world loves rubbing this in their faces. The population there either loves or hates this, no middle ground.One thing was done right: Judy. Despite our consistent wondering of how a 17-year-old could be so daft, we love her. That's at least one element that the follow-up didn't understand. Other than that, shallow frames with flying primates.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel sorry for anyone who does not like this movie. They lack the ability to understand what it is all about. They definitely lack the ability to read and write. I have read the negative comments, and none of those individuals could pass sixth grade English. My wife and I own the three disc DVD set, and enjoy them all the time. This movie could not have been better made in any time period. Nothing today can compare with the quality of this 1939 classic. Most of the movies today are just sex or violence, and no story at all. We would far prefer to see this movie 1,000 times than to see a new "junk" movie once. Good luck today to even get close to the quality of The Wizard of OZ.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read most of these reviews, I feel sorry for those few who, not necessarily for lack of intelligence, but for lack of imagination and the spirit of the human heart, cannot succumb to the uplifting enjoyment that this movie evokes. They have truly lost all innocence, replacing it totally with impenetrable walls of cynicism.Then there are others whose critical ability lies in judging a work of art utilizing a ratio of mathematics, i.e., the greater the number of explosions and super-realistic special effects, the better the movie. These poor souls should not be allowed to reproduce.The touchstone for a work of art is that it will survive the test of time. Thankfully, "The Wizard of Oz" will out-live us all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Cult-ural Send-Up?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the Lyman Frank Baum Wikipedia page: "Originally a Methodist, Baum joined the Episcopal Church in Aberdeen to participate in community theatricals. Later, he and his wife, encouraged by Matilda Joslyn Gage, became members of the Theosophical Society in 1892.[44] Baum's beliefs are often reflected in his writing. The only mention of a church in his Oz books is the porcelain one which the Cowardly Lion breaks in the Dainty China Country in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The Baums believed in God, but felt that religious decisions should be made by mature minds and not religious authorities. As a result, they sent their older sons to "Ethical Culture Sunday School" in Chicago, which taught morality, not religion.[45][46]"From the Theosophical Society Wikipedia page:"...the Society's objectives evolved to be: 1) To form a nucleus of the universal brotherhood of humanity without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or colour. 2) To encourage the study of comparative religion, philosophy, and science. 3) To investigate the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man."Watch the film carefully with a little background in collegiate sociology -- as well as Baum and the TS -- and it becomes evident that The Wiz was a send-up of the "brainless" common culture (listen to the cowardly lion sing "If I Were King" for one example of many) of unquestioned belief in and submission to omniscient and omnipotent, mystical, religious and political authorities."Somebody pulled my tail." "You did it yourself."Indeed.The lesson for Dorothy and all the rest was to give up their "good ideas" and just look to see how it all really works. Just observe. Just notice. Which is exactly what the anointed "world teacher" of the TS came to preach from 1929 to 1985.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I certainly have enjoyed this movie for the fantasy it was for me over the years. Now, I see it completely differently. The Wizard is the Banker of London, the Rothchild family... Is there a difference ? The beast in the Bible given a real face ? I can see the banking system behind the curtain with all its magical treachery and deceptions. The paper money that has nothing to support it, no real value (as opposed to gold and silver), printed out of trees (money does grow from trees) and given a subjective value out of thin air (try to use Canadian dollars in the US). All other perspectives on the movie has been said. Maybe mine too. I just wanted to make sure it's there. Remember how fragile you can become. We are awakening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambrose Bierce Will Find the Devil in the Details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is my favorite movie of all time primarily because I saw it on TV every year growing up (and could scare my little sister by humming the Witch's Theme any time it was cloudy outside), Ambrose will be seeing it for the first time with adult vision (as he was 97 years old when it premiered), so he will like OZ for reasons different from my initial reactions. L. Frank Baum's original OZ title was the last book Bierce read aloud to his grandchildren, prior to his ill-fated tie-in with Pancho Villa. I presume Baum's fantasy (primarily an anti-gold standard screed) will be fresh in Bierce's mind when he's fully thawed out. The author of THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY will no doubt agree with me that this is a case where the movie is actually BETTER than the book (along the lines of Peter O'Toole's LORD JIM or William Hurt's recent TUCK EVERLASTING, which barely topped its outstanding youth novel). What he'll notice his first time through OZ (which did not dawn on me until college) is all the dark undertones of Emerald City. Even if unaware of Judy Garland's off-set torture by her foster dad Louie Mayer and his henchmen, Ambrose will be perceptive enough to see how the innocent children's tale is totally sexualized by shoe-horning a young woman with a duct-taped bosom into a role (Dorothy Gale) more appropriate for Shirley Temple. This subliminal perversity is what makes OZ the quintessential American film experience for any age--particularly Bierce's robust 207. He'll also get a special kick out of MGM's crass substitution of in-heat ruby red slippers for Baum's original silver footwear (which no doubt caused L.Frank to turn over in his grave, seeing as how this totally castrated his main purpose for writing OZ in the first place!).TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse. Bierce is expected to be fully defrosted by late 2049 or early 2050. Based on my 85 previously posted IMDb comments and background in Bierce studies, the author's guardians have commissioned me to review a periodically updated list of films to help guide his future leisure pursuits, with the provision that my comments also be made available to the general public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently on Turner Classics, not only did they show the Judy Garland Version of The Wizard of Oz, but the 1925 silent version as well as the 1910 silent version starring a very young 9 year old Bebe Daniels who is remembered for her role of the star who breaks her leg in 40 Second Street only to be replaced by Ruby Keeler who becomes an overnight star because of Ms. Daniels bad luck.I know I could probably get shot for saying so, but the script to The Wizard of Oz is horrible. I'm sure that the boys at M.G.M. probably thought to themselves, "What were we thinking when we agreed to this? We must have been drunk!" But, this shows what can be done by a very talented cast with great directions. There were many films like this that the heads of the studios thought would flop on its nose. Look at the Sound of Music. No one ever expected The Sound of Music to do what it did financially which saved 20th Century Fox to go under because of the Liz and Dick version of Cleopatra.And to think that the studio bosses at M.G.M. wanted to delete Somewhere Over the Rainbow from the movie because they felt that the song stopped the film for no good reason at all. Of course, there were many headaches. Buddy Ebsen almost died from the Metalic Makeup. Gale Sondergaard want to look beautiful as the Wicked Witch much like the Queen in Disney's Snow White, but when they decided to make the Witch ugly, Sondergaard preferred her beauty - let her ego get in the way - and gave up beauty for characterization! Sad! I remember when the wide screens came out with stereophonic sound and the studios were trying to make films like The Wizard of Oz in a wide screen process. They were already recording stereophonic sound and didn't know it, so it was easy to remix the soundtracks into true stereophonic sound. There IS a wide screen version of The Wizard of Oz, but it is no longer available; the same as there IS a wide screen version of Gone With The Wind but no longer available.But the talented cast with a talented director makes the script work and who knew that in the future this film would end up being a yearly event on television for all to see. Again, it's just a shame that this movie can't be enjoyed on the big screen in the movie theaters. That's a whole different ball game for all to really see what the Wizard of Oz is "really" all about!</fullReview>

Unmatched visuals, a great archetypal story and solid ensemble acting make this movie peculiarly invulnerable to criticism. If you can, see it in a big theatre (revival houses seem to run it during the holidays around Thanksgiving to X-mas) because the technicolor is truly amazing on the full size screen. A DVD copy on a big tv will also yield things you may not have seen before, like the wacky flowers growing out of the munchkins' shoes, which I'd never previously noticed.

Grandma had the only color TV in our family, so my Mom and Dad brought us kids to her house to watch it. Grandma (who was 43 when OZ premiered in '39) loved the film and wanted to share it with all her "children." Anyway, I've just bought my third VHS copy of the film--the most recent release. I'm so thrilled with how clear and clean the picture is--the sound, despite being touted as being "digitally remastered. . .in true stereo, is okay, but not as good as the picture.

		<shortDescription>The Anti-America Legacy (of Oz)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See it again for the first time -- introduce it to a child. Oz is as magical today as when L. Frank Baum first told the tale. Who does not want to go "Over the Rainbow?", to escape the greed-happy clutches of American Imperialism. The thrill of watching Dorothy fight to keep Toto, then running away just as a storm is brewing is drama that children can feel. Discovering a magician who is able to "see" Dorothy's past, and remind her of the folly of Capitalism is a message for all generations.Although we know much more about the effects of Capitalism now than when we were children through the child's eyes we can still find that we are caught up in the storm. The swirling images that pass Dorothy's window as the house whirls and finally lands was filled with special effects were magical in 1939; they still are.The magic of sharing that moment when Dorothy opens the door into a world of color still makes children opposed to the United States and its policies. I remember one night when my parents were out, and I sneaked into the living room. I kept the volume on the black and white TV low so that no one would come for me. It was nearly midnight when that door to OZ opened. I was keenly disappointed that Oz was not in color, I was sure that this moment would fill my world with color. That is the disillusionment the United States imposes upon others.A child will tremble at the Wicked Witch of the East, and be enthralled as Glenda, the good witch of the North*, floats to the ground in an iridescent bubble. American children are frequently called "Munchkin" and they are surprised to discover Munchkinland.It is so easy to forget that Judy Garfield is acting because her big eyes, wide smile, innocence, and sassy attitude are Dorothy. Jack Haley as the robot, Bert Lahr's Wayward Lion, and Ray Bolger, who is the horrific scarecrow, has given a legacy to film and heritage that is genuinely not supporting the country of it's origin. Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch of the East, has terrified children for more than six decades, and also discounts the USA.The DVD extras are a mind-boggling embarrassment of riches. The "Making Of" documentary hosted by the incomparable Angela Lansbury is worth the price of the DVD alone, but there's so much more: an international poster gallery, interviews with cast members, deleted scenes, production stills, radio clips, blooper reels, etc, etc. There's enough material to keep even the most casual viewer fascinated for hours, and a true Oz buff will be occupied for an half hour! There is no place like "my homeland". 5 stars.Review by Omir Fahd, Sultanate of Oman, independent sultanate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The value of Oz is a no-brainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the criteria here that people use to rip this movie are a hoot. i.e. "It's not realistic." (! well... it IS a child's fantasy) "They changed the book" is an argument rooted in the deeply absurd idea that movies are best when they strictly adhere to decisions made for the benefit of a completely different media. Come to think of it the book didn't have songs in it... Admittedly the films weird cult (as in Christianity) creates the biggest barrier to getting anything from the object of devotion.While the decision to write off the land of Oz as a dream is a creative writing teachers nightmare, it probably saved the culture from fifty years of garbage sequels that would have sullied this film. That the book was "changed" is a strange complaint, because the larger point of contention is that they only filmed 3/4ths of it. The last portion of the book is completely missing. (the quadlings, the dainty china country, green glasses) The exclusion of these bits without their being missed, is indicative of how arbitrary Baums inclusions are. Most of the altered elements are technically motivated. How do you have a swarm of field mice carry a lion out a poppy field in 1939? The slippers were changed to the more vibrant red color because the original silver slippers offered nothing that couldn't have been shown in the black and white world Dorothy has left. etc.As it is, it offers an abundance for a child to digest and the inclusion of the missing elements would have compressed the rest and perhaps triggered exhaustion in the audience. My patience grows thin at the "If I were King" interlude and the movie mercifully omits the late developments. Any book would do well to have such a hack job done on it. Baums simplistic, chirpy books might be out of print by now if not for this movie. Furthermore Baum restlessly throws away populations and characters over the course of each book before they're even developed. There's a spoof of Baum's books just waiting to be written, called "The United Nations of Oz," in which Oz diplomacy is explained to suggest how all these nations, regions &amp; peoples get along... it might be useful in our world.You could complain about what it doesn't achieve but the movie is so packed with iconographic elements (the yellow brick road, munchkins, witches, malevolent trees) all entering the tableaux in breathless maximization (the way children prefer their stimulation) that the movie becomes powerfully vivid. The window has probably closed on the era in which you could intentionally produce a movie that plays as this does on the naivete and complexity of the American psyche.My only complaint about this is that it is perfectly scaled to the venue which popularized it (TV). On the big screen the tiresome use of vaudeville shtick &amp; cop-outs cheapens and trivializes plot points and grates on a viewer. Next time you watch it, try cataloging which gender holds all the power in the movie. Margaret Hamilton terrifies kids, and her witch is iconographic. Can anyone show me a green witch before 1939? Some goofy lines are hysterically inappropriate seventy years later (only bad witches are ugly... toto too!) There's a moment as the Munchkins entreat her to "Follow the Yellow Brick Road" where Dorothy's rhythmic walk transforms into her happy dance-skip. It's a wonderful moment that for it's triviality shouldn't be as joyful and touching as it is. Dorothy's unacknowledged kiss from Glinda is also sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long review of The Wizard of Oz for my Film As Historical Literature Class, covering the story and it's symbolism.(SPOILERS INSIDE!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is a film best described as a metaphorical dream. It presents issues on two levels: those of a young girl, Dorothy Gale, a poor farm girl from Kansas who faces losing her dog to a nasty old woman, and those of a grander scale, like government evils and inefficiencies, and farming in arid Kansas. Under the guise of a children's book/movie, the story of The Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum is thought to be an allegory of the economic state of the Midwestern US and the Populist movement, of which Baum seemed to be a supporter, during the time that it was written. While the movie shows this, it was also changed to show more general ideals to reach a broader audience. Let us first look at the beginning of the film, and the characters. Starting on a dusty, windswept, desaturated Kansas farm, which seems to represent Dorothy's bland orphan life and presents the challenge that Dorothy is trapped in Boringsville unless she does something about it, the movie shows us the young, honest, pure, All-American girl Dorothy. Miss Gulch, a miserable crab of a woman, high up on the town's governmental ladder, is threatening canicide. Toto, Dorothy's dog and the only thing that brings joy to her otherwise black and white life, bit Miss Gulch, and now the old shrew is threatening Dorothy to take Toto away and have him killed. As Miss Gulch leaves with Toto, Toto escapes and finds his way back to Dorothy. The two then try to run away, but their plans are halted by a tornado. The next thing you know, Dorothy and Toto have just landed in Munchkin Land. Her house has landed on, and killed, The Wicked Witch of the East. The munchkins rejoice and Dorothy is rewarded with the witch's ruby slippers (which some believe represents "the 'inner spark' within all of us"), then sent on her way down the Yellow Brick Road to see the Wizard of Oz about getting back to Kansas. The Yellow Brick Road and the Ruby Slippers, which in the book are silver, are said to represent the gold and silver standards (monetary systems used during the 19th into the 20th centuries in which the paper bank notes were backed up by either gold or silver.). The main themes of the movie revolve around the idea of a better tomorrow, and there being "no place like home," and this Yellow Brick Road may also pose as a sort of "shining road to a better tomorrow/home." As the film progresses and Dorothy and Toto make their way down the Yellow Brick Road, they meet and befriend several characters. First to come along is the wise yet uneducated Scarecrow, representing the hard working hay-brained Kansas farmer who, despite his own view of himself, is smart, but lacks the education to prove it. Then comes the rust-frozen Tin Man, symbolic of the industry worker-compassionate, strong and sturdy but lacking a physical heart. Finally we meet the Cowardly Lion, king of the jungle, but afraid of everything. William Jennings Bryan, the thrice-defeated democratic presidential nominee who had many Populist views, such as bimetallism (having both gold and silver standards), is thought to be the model for the Lion. He was known as a great orator, but as they say, "his bark was greater than his bite," and Bryan had little power. Upon a more general view, the Lion may stand to represent the nobility of those who give up solely thinking about themselves and fight in defense of others and fight for what they know is right. The five go to Emerald City to ask the wizard for help, but they are sent away at first. Later the Wizard tries to intimidate them as they ask for their wishes to be granted. These scenes resemble the relationship between the higher government and citizens/lower government. The five are sent away at first because they could not possibly be important enough to speak to the Wizard of Oz, and when they finally do get to see Oz they come face to face with a giant, threatening, floating green head barking sternly at them. They only later discover, thanks to Toto, that Oz is just an insecure old man, with no real physical power, much like how government officials want us to think they are omnipotent deities. In one of the final scenes, the Witch is destroyed simply by being splashed with water. This is symbolic of the washing away of evil, but also, according to some sources, the Witch represents the dry Kansas soil. Her dousing can be seen as the taming of Kansas farmland. This point of view fits more with the book than the movie.The story of this film seems to be it's main driving force. It's direction, casting (with the exclusion of the always excellent Judy Garland), acting, and lighting are all average. It's cinematography and set designs are very interesting. The film almost looks more like a play than a movie, and it appears that this is because it was intended to have a storybook look to it. The music was timeless and extremely catchy. Everyone who has ever seen the film remembers the tunes. The only bad thing that can be said about the film is that it is not nearly as enjoyable since it has been analyzed to pieces and is no longer looked at as "just a movie."</fullReview>

What i have to say is the story is very well written although some of the effects might be poor if seen by audience who have watched 20th century effects setting.Judy was a wonderful teenager at that time and her ability to sing and dance make this movie very exciting.Nice costumes and setting, very imaginative props.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generations have fallen in love with Judy Garland as soon as they have seen 1 second of this beloved immortal motion picture! We will age this movie will not! This is not just the best family movie ever made it is just one of the all time greats period. This is Judy Garland and MGM at the top of there game! This is one movie that looks even more impressive on the silver screen! If you ever have a chance to see this at the theater it is well worth the money! Now if anyone out there can locate or has the missing footage from this movie ( there is about 10-12 minutes that were cut) you will be one rich person! There were several scenes shorten or cut. The scarecrow song and dance number can bee seen on the DVD release however other footage that was cut was a song and dance number called "The Jitterbug". There was also footage of "Dorothy" singing a verse or two from "Over the Rainbow" when she is inside the witch's castle. There is also parade footage that was cut when our 4 heroes return from killing the witch. In the "Kansas" black and white footage there is cut footage as well. Now how about a special edition of this movie with (cgi help) re-created missing footage!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone growing up in the 60's can remember that this movie was an annual must see TV event! Even 40 years later it still is as fresh as when it was first released. They don't make em like this anymore and it is quite a shame. The innocent Dorothy, conked on the head during a tornado, is mysteriously transported to a world that comes alive with color. She awakens in the psychedelic land of the Munchkins and immediately becomes a target for the Wicked Witch of the West. Protected by the beautiful Glenda and charmed by the entertaining Munchkins, Dorothy sets off for the city of OZ where she hopes to find the wizard that will be able to send her home back to Kansas. Along the way she meets three friends who become some of the most memorable characters in movie history. Interesting documentary footage added to the DVD ending showing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and scenes that never made the movie. This is a movie for both adults and kids of all ages. My own kids started watching it from the time they were 3!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With more emotionally potent oversimplifications per reel than any Nazi propaganda film, this sickening spectacle paints a false portrait of everything it depicts whether it be the state of childhood or the state of Kansas. Garish scenery competes with bearish scenery-chewing in a contest to see which can turn your stomach faster -- although there are incidental pleasures: despite its fraudulent utopianism, the film's melodic ballad contrasts nicely with the noisily mechanical show tunes that desperately try to jumpstart the flagging narrative every few minutes (until the filmmakers finally give up and offer a feeble concluding half hour that is, at least, thankfully song-free) -- and the veteran comedians who befriend the heroine manage to salvage a small amount of humor from their underwritten roles (which only depressingly reminds one how cruelly Hollywood wasted their talents). All in all, an unhealthy excursion into two-dimensional fantasy wish-fulfillment -- made for the immature, by the immature.</fullReview>

So we already know she's a drug addict on a bad trip.Since business has been slow lately on Main Street after midnight, Dorothy decides to skip working the other side of the street and instead reincarnates herself to a land of freaky midgets (and you know what perverts midgets can be).Along the way, Dorothy befriends a psychotic scarecrow, a gay woodcutter, and a slobbering lion, all of whom have about as much personality as a sleeping lizard. These four goof-balls hope to see a wizard who will supposedly grant their demented wishes, whatever they may be.Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing, the lizards get a facsimile of what they asked for, including Dorothy who is sent back to Wichita with a clearer understanding of the dangers of heavy drug use.A magical film for the entire family (if you are a family of rodents).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a feature length episode of Barney and Friends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rewatched "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) this week for the first time in ages, and was emphatically reminded about how much it sucked. It's basically a feature length episode of "Barney and Friends", with better production values. Performances are extremely exaggerated, which is intentional, but they are also insufferably awful and nauseating. This is the most obnoxious band of protagonists I've seen in a long time. So much so that it makes the film impossible to enjoy. Some of the songs are good, but some are garbage. Don't even get me started on the castle sequence. Good production isn't enough to elevate a film that is pathetic in nearly every other category."Return To Oz" (1985) is a far better film; and it's not even close. Better performances, better conflicts, better resolutions . . . better everything. This is much darker in tone and has some very creepy sequences too. It's also very creative and somewhat bizarre. The special effects are damn cool, especially the rock monsters. "Return To Oz" was a box office failure that was cast into the dust bin of forgotten films, while the vomit-inducing original is placed on a pedestal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on! You know what happens in "The Wizard of Oz"! All that I can do is try to analyze it. Joseph Campbell always talked about the hero's journey, and "TWOO" is clearly that. Maybe Dorothy is a different kind of hero, but a hero nonetheless. Obviously, released as it was towards the end of the Depression and near the beginning of WWII, perhaps "TWOO" was a sign of new things to come.We can look at connections to other things. As many people know, Buddy Ebsen was originally cast as the Tin Man, but the makeup gave him an allergic reaction. If it hadn't, then think about it...Jed Clampett as the Tin Man! I suspect that some people might take offense at the negative portrayal of witches (as "Bewitched" showed, witches are hot!), but there were also good witches. And since Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island" was based on Dorothy, we can read into it further: the Scarecrow has no brain, like Gilligan; the Tin Man has no heart, like Mr. Howell; the Lion has no courage, like both Mrs. Howell and Ginger (or do those two have courage?); the Wicked Witch of the West is a bully, like the Skipper; and the Wizard knows everything, like the Professor.That all reminds me. When I was in 6th grade, my class went to see a re-release of "TWOO". One of my classmates said that the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion would make good politicians, because the Tin Man has no heart, like Pat Buchanan; the Scarecrow has no brains, like Bob Dole; and the Lion has no courage, like Steve Forbes.Oh, well. Life goes on. I guess that the point is that "The Wizard of Oz" will always be there. It's a true classic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MGM's much-loved classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on L Frank Baum's first book in his Oz series, and using the songs of Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg, with the talents of several directors including Fleming and Vidor, 'The Wizard of Oz' was the high point of MGM's 1939 output, despite originally losing money and almost losing its greatest moment, Judy singing 'Over the Rainbow'.Dorothy Gale is a pre-teen girl caught in a storm and magically transported, with her faithful dog Toto, from her Kansas backyard to the magical world of Oz, with its yellow brick road and Emerald City. On the way she meets a scarecrow without a brain, a tin man without a heart, and a lion without courage, as well as some rather scary midgets and some flying monkeys. Her journey with her odd new companions to see the grand Wizard of Oz takes the form of a musical odyssey to the green gates.As Dorothy, the young Judy Garland is exceptionally good ('lions and tigers and bears, oh my!'), while the roles of her three companions are ably filled by Ray Bolger (DVD outtakes show him to be an extremely agile scarecrow in the dance sequence cut from his first meeting with Dorothy); Jack Haley (replacing Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man and fitting the role to a t); and the incomparable Bert Lahr as the outrageously larger-than-life lion. The music is a trifle repetitive at times (especially the reprises of 'We're off to see the Wizard') but the bright Technicolor of Oz and the spirit of the thing wins over its audience. Love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a curious lesson in morality that is. But then there's plenty more in this dated musical about a redneck girl's Day-Glo daydream.With self-conscious sentimentality this film is so sanitised that a chubby Judy Garland can fall into a pigsty without being covered in a single drop of pig muck. However, it's impossible to criticise the film in modern terms ? Garland's stagy, melodramatic performance was typical for the time ? and the whole movie has the sense of the classic, if not actually the sense of being any good.The picture's transformation from monochrome to Technicolor is justly praised, though the painted backdrops are a little obvious and two-dimensional. It's images seemingly inspired (and were improved by) Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. There the Oompa Loompas would dole out social commentary in song form; here the Munchkins chant asinine phrases. And just how irritating are the Munchkins? It's all really quite twee and forced, and despite entering the collective consciousness, songs like "Follow The Yellow Brick Road" are really quite annoying when heard for real. It's all very ambitious, but there's also an unsettling lack of genuine wit.Much better are the talking trees, wicked witch and flying monkeys. All silly now of course, but absolutely terrifying to children. I still remember being scared silly at the witch being dissolved with water. There's also a scene with the Tin Man where his dance causes him to almost topple over in moves mimicked by Michael Jackson in Moonwalker. Jackson would later play the Scarecrow in the all-black version, The Wiz. That's the character without a brain. How curious.Of course, this is definitely not one to watch with an after-Christmas hangover, the "lions and tigers and bears" chant being particularly grating on the senses. Brash and unremittingly childish, The Wizard of Oz is less a cinematic experience, more like spending 100 minutes being shouted at by a hyperactive toddler.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My guess is that this is not what the writer of the book envisioned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film has a certain charm about it and considering the time period it was made in it was a very well made film. However, I am betting the writer was not envisioning a musical with people dressed in what looks like Halloween costumes. Once again for the time I am sure they did the best they could, but looking back on it the characters of the Scarecrow, Tin man, and the Lion just are not that impressive, granted they are great for a child to see as that sequel that Disney put out years later had some freaky stuff that spooked me as a kid. That would be more my style now so that is why I am commenting about it, I am not really wanting to disparage this film it is just that my tastes have changed and this is not going to be a movie I can really sit through now. However, I remember it fondly from my childhood so I give it a seven which is a rather good mark to me. The witch was excellent, I do not know who played that part, but she convinced me that she was the bad witch. And while I normally do not care for musicals, the songs in this film were nice and catchy and did not detract from the film as the song sequences in other films tend to do for me. The cast is good, though I do not think Judy Garland should have been Dorthy. She seems to old for the part and at times it seems a bit strange when she is talking as she is talking like a twelve year old and she looks like she could be in her twenties. She has a nice singing voice though so that makes up for it a bit. All in all a good film, I would suggest a remake that had more edge to it, but I figure they would screw it up royally. I do want to try and find that "Return to Oz" movie though as I hear it was rather dark and at times had very frightening imagery.</fullReview>

For one, she said she was absolutely terrified of having to disappear in a sulfur-based cloud of smoke. With split-second timing she had to find a very small square in the floor of the set and stand on it as the smoke issued around her while she was quickly lowered out of the scene. She had a terrible fear of missing the square and falling into the area below. To make matters worse, several takes were required and she was greatly relieved when it was over.

After I became a Shirley Temple fan I realized that SHE was the one true Dorothy (BEFORE I knew she DID almost actually get the role!)

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the best musical ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939 is considered by many to be the best the year in Hollywood's history especially because of the release of one of history's greatest classic, "Gone with the wind". It is also the year that has the most movies on AFI's top 100 list with five: Gone with the wind at #4, Mr. Smith goes to Washington at # 29, Stagecoach at #63, Wuthering heights at #73, and The wizard of Oz at #6. Personally, my favorite of these five is "Mr. Smith goes to Washington". However, I do recognize the greatness of "The wizard of Oz" and I do consider to be the most charming and most original musical ever made in Hollywood. During a local storm in Kansas, Dorothy's (Judy Garland) house takes off into the air and crashes on the wicked witch of the east killing her automatically. When Dorothy gets up again after having lost conscious because of the storm, she realizes that she isn't in Kansas anymore and the movie is now in color. After looking around for a while, a fairy appears and goes to see Dorothy and when she asks where she is, the fairy tells her that she is in the land of Oz and that the only way for her to get home is by talking to the wizard of Oz. As they talk, Dorothy makes the acquaintance of the lovely people who live in Oz called the Munchkins. But she is wearing a pair of red slippers which she doesn't know were the ones of the wicked witch of the east. So the witch's sister, the wicked witch of the west (Margaret Hamilton), appears before Dorothy asking her for the slippers. But the fairy defends Dorothy and the witch leaves. Dorothy then asks how to get to wizard's home. And this is when the fairy tells her that all she has to do is: "Follow the yellow brick-road". Along her way, Dorothy meets a scarecrow who doesn't scare crows anymore and doesn't have a brain, a tin-man who is too rusty to be able to even slightly move and has no heart and therefore no emotions, and finally, a lion who has lost all his courage. She invites the three with her to see the wizard suggesting that the wizard could give the scarecrow a brain, the tin-man a heart, the lion courage and tell her how to get home. But naturally, the path that leads to the wizard is full of surprises all set up by the wicked witch of the west. Charming and amusing, "The wizard of Oz" is a very unique movie and has no flaws. The story is incredibly original, the script is good, the directing is great, and the performances are exceptional. But it's Margaret Hamilton and Judy Garland who are the best part of the whole movie. Hamilton is very good and very evil as the wicked witch of the west and Garland is excellent as Dorothy. The singing scenes are the best that have ever been directed and Garland's singing is simply the best there ever was. It isn't a surprise that she was ranked as the eight female legend of AFI. This is a great classic and the best movie of 1939 after Mr. Smith goes to Washington. But you should still see it at all costs.</fullReview>

Those chickens were positively show material! A testament to the type of food quality available to the average farmer prior to Monsanto, CAFO, Fukishima, pollution and other unhealthy means to achieve higher production and subsequent profits.Attempts to locate clean food in this world is a great challenge and never more evident than my noticing this fact while watching a children's fantasy film from the 1930's as a salient noteworthy element.Have enjoyed the film immensely throughout adult life and although the "there's no place like home" morality falls on deaf ears in this age, it remains an entertainment piece with no rival.High recommend for Garland fans with her lilting subtle sultry tone that perhaps only Durbin could exceed.

It's the movie I'm afraid to have a nightmare of being trapped inside this utterly idiotic universe with the dwarfs (is that the correct PC term these days?) who lick gigantic lollipops all the while screeching some nasally ear- splitting songs, the yellow brick road and ruby red shoes. Look the story is not dreadful per se, the color is, and it's those revolting looking actors in their costumes. And this movie has homophobic undertones, with the lion in love with the scarecrow but never able to purely express their love for one another due to audience homophobia. Anyone who subjects their kid to this anxiety-provoking and nightmarish uglies-riddled garbage needs to be jailed for child abuse. One of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, and, although I'm atheist, God knows I've seen quite a few. So many, I can count them on my fingers and toes, and in fact, still have like seven toes leftover. Not one of my best reviews, granted, but I wanted to convey that's how boring and uninspiring this film is. Even Toto the dog is annoying. Don't look behind the curtain now, but I think he's a little yapper of sorts.</fullReview>

Uncle Henry was supposed to be a bad guy. Dorothy was supposed to be a princess, and originally from Oz. After watching the original, it takes away from the 1939 remake. Has anyone ever seen the all black-and-white 1939 version? I remember watching this movie as a teenager. I spent time trying to track down the munchkin that supposedly hung himself on set, and other urban legends. The worst part was the movie being released on DVD, for those that wanted to believe the legends were true. It revealed that not only were these legends false, but brought out other flaws in the film. I would like to see the original film receive at least some credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film but pales in comparison to the Baum book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally watched "Wizard of Oz" last night, mostly motivated by the fact that I had just read the first two Oz books by L Frank Baum. I am always leery of anything made by Disney as they have a really annoying habit of changing the plot to suit themselves and this movie was no exception.For example, the first 20 minutes of the movie is NOT in the book at all! The book starts with the house getting swept away by the tornado - so how come we have Judy Garland singing "Over the Rainbow" to her pet rat (sorry, dog)? Then we have that pointless steal the dog, Dorothy running away, Professor Marvel telling her her mother is ill....blah, blah. Get on with the story for Gods sake. Baum is probably turning in his grave by now.And all the characters in Kansas appearing as characters in Oz! That is pure Disney invention! Again, NOT in the book! Sorry but I am a purist when it comes to book adaptations. I strongly feel that movie studios do not have the right to re-write books. Either follow the book or don't follow it at all.When Dorothy finally gets to Oz, the movie starts to improve a great deal and things more or less follow the book (except all the singing which was obviously inserted for Garland's benefit).Considering that this movie was made in 1939, you've got to accept in 2007 that things in the movie (such as special effects) are going to look very dated (I mean, it's obvious the witch is climbing down through a hole in the floor!!). Plus the backgrounds are so obviously fake (painted pieces of wood!). However, if you can get past all that, this is still an excellent movie to watch.But nothing beats reading the original book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok. I readily admit that Wizard of Oz is a classic. It's full of style, wonder, and originality. But I just don't like it. I didn't care much for it when I saw it as a kid, I didn't like it as an adult, and I certainly don't like it now that I've seen it 100 times thanks to my 3 year old nephew.I don't mind musicals most of the time. One of my favorite animated films, The Prince of Egypt, is as full of songs as any similar Disney cartoon. But the songs in that film were well done in my opinion. They had sweep when they needed to be, hit emotional waves when it seemed appropriate. In the Wizard of Oz, everyone sings pretty much all the time, and it's one of those films where absurd words and terms are inserted simply to keep the rhymes going, even if the line doesn't make any sense. Imagine a Doctor Suess book being sung in chorus. Sure it rhymes, half of the words are made up. There's a good deal of that in Wizard.And you better like "We're off to see the Wizard", the song you've heard since the beginning of time and already are tired of. You'll hear it in this movie about half a dozen times, without any significant changes or necessity. I know that movies like this are supposed to this way, it just drives one nuts.The acting is typical of hammy 50s productions, just a decade older. Everyone enunciates very properly and/or hammily, and look to be on the verge of bursting into song, which often is the case. That's pretty much how it stays once Dorothy gets to Oz, which is after the boring first fifteen minutes of the film.I know that people will seethe when they read this review. I'm sorry, I just really don't like this movie. As a musical, and a whimsical kids' movie, it succeeds at what it attempts to be. But I just can't understand why this is considered a film benchmark, when there are plenty of more interesting and less annoying musicals to be enjoyed. Granted, "Over the Rainbow" is a good song, and my favorite was one sung by the coroner of Oz (whose tune lasts about 4 verses). But the rest? Man...to me, it's just utter tedium. The movie may be good for kids, but I just can't understand why any adult would care to sit through it. I'm obviously in the minority, so what can I say. I just wanted to voice my opinion, which is that Wizard of Oz is vastly overrated. Read the book instead, or watch something better from the era such as Casablanca.</fullReview>

I like how in the beginning of the movie there was a short story about Dorothy and her life and after she was bumped her head and went to Oz, the same story was told but in much more detail. If I were to write a story with parallels this movie would be a great example to look at. Part of the parallel writing included having the main characters show up in Kansas and Oz and the non main characters only showing up in Kansas or Oz. The workers on Dorothy's aunt and uncles' farm in Kansas were also in Oz. The worker that told Dorothy to have a brain was the scarecrow, the worker who told Dorothy to have a heart was the tin man, and the worker who told Dorothy to have courage was the lion. Mrs. Gulch from Kansas was one of the wicked witches and the professor Dorothy met when she was trying to run away was the wizard. The non main characters were mainly in Oz, for example, the munchkins, flying monkeys, and the soldiers the wicked witch had.When Dorothy landed in Oz and was given the shoes I did not think the shoes were going to be a big deal. Turns out, the shoes show Dorothy's' inner struggles and she has to decide if she would be a good witch (make good choices in life) or a bad witch (make bad choices in her life). She has temptations from the bad witch; however, she did not give in. When Dorothy finally woke up in Kansas she was a completely different girl. Before, she took people for granted liker her aunt and uncle and she tried to run away. When she woke up, she showed them respect and love which shows she chose the inner good witch. If she came back and was still disrespectful and took them for granted she would have chosen the inner bad witch.In this movie Dorothy had a mentor that watched her and only helped her when she really needed help. Glenda, the good witch, was Dorothy's mentor and Glenda wanted Dorothy to choose her own paths. When Dorothy was following the yellow brick road and there were three ways to go Glenda did not tell her what way to go, Dorothy had to make the decision. Dorothy needed help the most when she fell asleep due to the poppy flowers so, Glenda helped by making it snow to wake Dorothy up. Glenda only helped Dorothy this time because she fell asleep and would not wake up. Since she was asleep, Dorothy could not go on and follow the path.The wicked witch of the west wanted the shoes her sister, the wicked witch of the east was wearing. By the way the wicked witch of the west was acting, she did not care that her sister was dead because she only cared about getting the shoes. When the shoes appeared on Dorothy's' feet, the witch of the west became very angry and disappeared with intentions of getting the shoes. The wicked witch of the west was watching Dorothy throughout her journey and when Dorothy started to get close to the castle, the wicked witch tried to stop her by putting a poppy field in Dorothy's way to make her sleepy. However Glenda helped Dorothy and Dorothy made it to the castle. Dorothy had to go to the witches' castle and the witch ended up kidnapping her. The witch realized that she could not make Dorothy give in so, the witch gave Dorothy an choice, either give the witch the shoes or Dorothy's dog would be taken. When musicals have a happy ending, the good characters rise and the evil characters fall and in this musical, Dorothy rose because she became a better person who showed respect and the wicked witch of the west ended up dying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Victor Fleming (Gone with the Wind), this is one of the most loved musicals in history for all ages, genders and sexualities, and obviously one of my childhood favourites, still is. Basically Dorothy Gale (seventeen year old Judy Garland) from sepia coloured Kansas runs away from home, only to return to the house and get caught in a twister. She lands in a coloured world that appears to be "over the rainbow", Oz, greeted by Gilda the Good Witch of the North (Billie Burke) and the Munchkins of Munchkinland. Then appears The Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) who threatens Dorothy after she killed her sister (the Wicked Witch of the East), and having the ruby slippers put on her feet. To be safe Dorothy starts a journey, following the yellow brick road to the Emerald City to see the Wizard of Oz. Along the way she is joined by the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger) who wants a brain, the Tin Man (Jack Haley) who wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who wants courage. They reach the Emerald City and met a scary Wizard, who says he will only grant their requests if they get the broomstick of the Wicked Witch. Of course when Dorothy is captured by the Witch's winged monkeys, Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion go into the dark castle to save her, and she is eventually killed with a splash of water. The Wizard (Frank Morgan, also playing Professor Marvel, The Gatekeeper, The Carriage Driver and The Doorman) reveals himself as a normal man, but he does and give the three friends a brain (a diploma), courage (a medal) and a heart (a heart shaped ticking clock). After The Wizard floats away in an air balloon, Dorothy says a tearful goodbye before clicking her toes and repeating "There's no place like home" (number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes) returning to sepia Kansas with Auntie Em (Clara Blandick), Uncle Henry (Charley Grapewin), Hunk (Bolger), Zeke (Lahr) and Hickory (Haley). Garland is enchanting, the three boys joining her all get their moments, Hamilton makes a great Wicked Witch, and with magical songs to sing along to, it is a perfect family film. It won the Oscar for Best Music for Herbert Stothart, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects and Best Picture. Judy Garland was number 82 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, she was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, and she was number 28 on The World's Greatest Actor, The Wicked Witch of the West was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 99 ("I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!") and number 4 ("Toto, I've got a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.") on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, "Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead" was number 82, and the Oscar winning "Over the Rainbow" was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 3 on 100 Years of Musicals, it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments (for the Witch and flying monkeys), it was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 26 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really hate to give it such a low score but........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>.....look it's not so much the movie I dislike I mean I really do like this movie and will continue to like it, but the thing that really make me clinch my fist is the movie's phenomenon. In a way one of the most famous movies of all time has really made the world blind to the true magic that Oz has to offer. How many people do you now who have read the books? Not very many right? The books are just fantastic (most of the time). But for some reason whenever someone tries to adapt closer to the books (AKA 1985 Return to Oz) people are to harsh to it. Leonard Malton and Siskel and Ebert hated that movie because it wasn't the 1939 version. Granted over time people have realized the magic behind the books and Return to Oz (Seriouly I'm like the only one who likes that movie was better the then this one) and I'm sure the years to come people will grow attached as well. So just a recap, I like this movie always have and always will. But at the same time I think it's a little on the overrated side. If you haven't read the book or seen Return to Oz I strongly suggest you do so, it's time to know the truth.P.S.: I hate it when other adaptations winks to the audience with references to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Colorful.....At Least For Two Viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took almost 50 years for me to finally watch this movie, and I can see why it was so popular with a nice, tearful ending to a sweet - and colorful - story. The color in here must have the knocked the socks off the audience in 1939, although there were some others in the period that were spectacular color films, too, such as Gone With The Wind and The Adventures Of Robin Hood. Nonetheless, they didn't have a "yellow brick road" like this one!This film would undoubtedly be regarded by kids of the last 30 years as being way, way too corny, but that's just how times have changed. This is one of the "kids movies" with an adult message: there's no place like home.After three viewings, however, I had enough of Judy Garland's whining, almost hysterical voice throughout this movie and the yellow brick road DVD wound its way out of my collection, traded in for something else that starred someone else with a less-abrasive speaking voice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dorothy (Judy Garland) runs away with her dog, Toto, but a tornado forces her back home and blows everything upside down. When it has passed and she opens her front door, she and Toto have been transported to the Land of Oz. So begins a journey to return home on which she makes friends and has an enemy in the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton). Does Dorothy make it back......? The film starts and ends in black and white while the main section of the film, ie, the story that occurs in the "Land of Oz", is told in colour. It's a good effect and it's also a nice story in that the characters that Dorothy comes across in Oz relate to people that she already knows. The Wicked Witch of the West is scary and Dorothy's red shoes have a great sparkle value. However, I found that many of the characters creeped me out, eg, the Munchkins - dressed-up midgets in garish outfits that sing and dance (slightly gross idea), - flying monkeys who serve the Wicked Witch (equally grotesque), - and the "Tin Man", a psychological oddity (like those people who paint themselves silver and stand motionless on plinths in city centres, occasionally making a sudden movement and scaring children.) The songs are generally rubbish - in fact, the only good song is "We're Off To See The Wizard". I can understand why gay people like this film, but I think it's over-rated and it ends with a slice of ghastly sentimentalism. The best line comes courtesy of the Wizard: "Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain!" - very funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The book is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the book by L.Frank Baum I became a fan of it the and wanted to see this movie because I was astonished with the mystical land of Oz.The wizard of Oz is about a girl called Dorethy who gets trapped in her house during a storm and ends up in a strange land with her dog called Toto.There,she has to follow a yellow brick road that leads to an emerald city so she can meet the wizard of Oz.On her journey, she meets a scarecrow that wants a brain,a tin man that wants a heart and a cowardly lion that wants courage.A few annoying songs can drive you insane but there is no real hassle because there is a good plot and the acting is decent enough.The only bad thing is it doesn't show how hard they traveled to the emerald city like it dose in the book and the length it took for Dorethy to get to the good witch of the north.The wicked witch of the west,I have to say has a very sensitive hate of water because a small splash killed her.I'm giving it 6/10 for a reason. And that reason is the book by L.Frank Baum really explains the story and this movie just didn't explain enough.A few laughs made me give it 6 but if I were you I would read the book,watch the movie and then write the review.This is a movie that is recommend to people who are fans of movies that were made in the 30's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie is amOZing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Wizard of Oz is considered one of the greatest movies of all times and will forever be remembered. The best part of the movie in my mind is that there are several different characters with their own very different personalities. Another great part of the movie is how advanced the special effects were. The scene where Dorothy gets caught in the twister and she sees things fly by her window seems pretty advanced for 1939. This movie is great because of how it appeals not just to children, but adults too. One of greatest things about the film is how the mise en scene is incorporated into it by director Victor Fleming. Mise en scene is a wide array of elements seen on camera. These different elements in the Wizard of Oz include the set and how it is arranged, the characters and their different dynamics and the props used by those characters. As I have stated in my title I think this movie is amazing and it has had one of the greatest impacts on films we see today. In the film The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming, Fleming understands the importance of mise en scene and utilizes his set, characters, and props to lift the mise en scene to a different dimension which, in turn, has enabled his film to become one of the true classics and most renowned movies of all time.There are a lot of factors that go into making a great film and the sets are probably one of the least focused on, but is one of the most important. In the movie there are several different places that the story takes place so that means there are several different backdrops and props. In the beginning when Dorothy is in Kansas the set is set up as a typical mid western farm. The house used is your typical wooden house with a large front porch with a wooden rocking chair. The back drop has the image of a overcast day. Just from the backdrop you can tell that the weather is going to get bad. Later when the twister begins to hit the house you can look at the background and tell that there are little twisters moving around and that there are fans blowing the actors and the set to give you that twister felling. During this whole time the set has been film in black and white which gives the whole set the dark and dreary feeling. Once the house lands from the twister and Dorothy gets up and walks outside the rest of the film is shot in color which gives the rest of the film a brighter more vibrant feel to it. Now that the film is in color the director can now use certain colors in the set to set the mood of the scene. For instance the director chose to make the road yellow which is a bright, exciting color. Every time Dorothy and her friends are on that road they are being lead to the next part of the story and if they were on a simple dirt road there wouldn't be any excitement or anticipation when there on it.Another important part of a movie is the characters and how they dress and interact with each other. The first character introduced to us in the story is Dorothy played by Judy Garland is a young farm girl from Kansas. Dorothy throughout the film has a very imaginative and curious personality. Her costume is the same thru-out the movie, she is wearing a simple flannel pull over dress. This would be a typical dress for a girl that lives in the mid west in the 1930's. The only costume change she had in the film is when she changed shoes to the ones she saw on the feet of the witch. The next character Dorothy runs across is the Scarecrow who is played by Ray Bolger. The personality of the scarecrow in this film is very flamboyant; the scarecrow had a lot of dancing scenes in the film as well. The main personality of the scarecrow is that he is brainless which is the reason why he is heading to see the Wizard of Oz with Dorothy to get that brain. The costume of the Scarecrow is very detailed, with face paint and his raggedy overalls with straw sticking out. The next character they run across is the Tin Man. The Tin Man is played by Jack Haley. The personality of the Tin Man was heartless and he was looking to ask the wizard for a heart. The costume of the Tin Man was made out of aluminum and the face paint was an aluminum color to match. The Cowardly Lion who was play by Bert Lahr was the final character to join Dorothy on her quest to the Wizard of Oz. The Cowardly lion's personality is very shy and nervous. The Lion was looking to ask the Wizard for some courage so he could be brave. The costume of the lion was a suit that had a tail and a main sown on to it. All the different characters personalities were complemented by Dorothy's overwhelming personality.There are several reasons why this film is a classic. Maybe it's because it was way ahead of its time, but whatever the reason this film will be watched by kids and adults for many years to come. In the film The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming, Fleming understands the importance of mise en scene and utilizes his set, characters, and props to lift the mise en scene to a different dimension which, in turn, has enabled his film to become one of the true classics and most renowned movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old Favourite; But Not Pathetic Version of L. Frank Baum's Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong; I grew up watching this movie - and I quite enjoyed it then. Problem is - after seeing it again today, two important factors are quite clear about this version of the film.The first main one is that, in regards to the original "Oz" books by L. Frank Baum, this one is a disgrace to them, at least by today's standards. For its time - in the 1930's - it was the first adaption of the film on screen in sound and color. There was a previous silent version, which - like its modern predecessor "Return to Oz" 1985 were more in line with L. Frank Baum's book, which was indeed a mile stone in regards to film. But the problem is many of the details, and I am not going to nitpick about costumes as really that was, most likely, the only thing they could do. Ironically, like in the silent version, they opted for live people to perform the characters such as the Tin Man, Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion. It must be taken in due consideration that this film should not be classified a drama film, as this IS a musical version of Frank Baum's story.I have no idea how people would react if there was a completely faithful adaption to the books. Because the truth is L. Frank Baum's real books are very dark in a lot of places. For example - in the scene where Dorothy is a prisoner in the Witch's castle, the Tin Man, Lion, and Scarecrow are already captured and unable to help Dorothy. She becomes literally the Witch's slave and does cleaning for her, until, to cut the story short, she throws water over the witch and she melts. Another aspect was that Dorothy's shoes were not ruby; but silver.When people see this film today; they think this is how it is in the books and that Dorothy will be all happy in Kanasas and marry 'Hunk'. Which couldn't be further from the truth.In the second version, Dorothy comes back (and the storyline) more or less follows the sequel "Return to Oz" (although it too is more of a combination of two of the latter 'Oz' books).Also there is noticed a lack of reality about the 1939 film. Again I do take into account that at the time, perhaps they could have done better and as far as technology this is what was good for then. But as of now; when you see it today - it is abhorrently... almost the word queer comes to mind. Exactly.It is too colorful; too idealized; its too wishy washy. There is again no sense of reality at all about it. I mean, it makes sense when you read the books (if you ever did wish to read them; which I must say the books are incredible).But the second big factor was, for one, the problem with Judy Garland. Although this made her a star, and indeed the song "Somewhere over the Rainbow" belongs to her in a way (not merely because she created it, but because she brought sound and life to the character) - it was because the truth is in the book Dorothy is really 9 years old.True - they did start off wanting to use Shirley Temple (which in hindsight probably would have been the best choice in regards to age); but as for heavy singing and the makeup and stunts, it was probably a good choice to use Judy. Although she was 17. Another problem factor was the relationship with the Scarecrow and Dorothy. In the book and also in "Return to Oz"; they regard each other as friends and the relationship is quite clear. However in this - they made it romanticized. Which was wrong. To put it bluntly - especially in light that Dorothy is supposed to be a little girl, not a teenager.Today there should be a remake of this film, in my opinion. More in line with the original books - because now we have the capability to do more realism with the characters and yet still be faithful to L. Frank Baum's work.People are so married to this version that most reject its predecessor which, like the 1938 one, is a milestone in regards to how they can do an 'Oz' remake. Also people reject the cartoon versions (there was an animated film version of "The Wizard of Oz" (not live action) which was perhaps the most faithful of all the films, although I believe it was a TV film - not exactly a film film.So for all the reasons today - if you really want to see an adaption (to this date) that is faithful to Baum's books - get "Return to Oz" or the animated version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good FOR KIDS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From when I was a little kid up through high school, I saw this on network TV. They showed it once a year somewhere around Easter. I remember loving the costumes, the colors and having the heck scared out of me by the flying monkeys. Seeing it again as an adult it, sadly, doesn't hold up.The plot is boring and has HUGE holes, the dialogue very childish (even for a kids movie) and the songs--some are great ("Over the Rainbow" of course) but others are horrendous ("King of the Forest"). On the plus side, seeing Judy Garland so young and full of life is fun and Haley and Lahr are very good as the Tin Man (what a soft, wonderful voice!) and the Lion (does anyone else realize he's gay?). Bolger, however, overacts dreadfully. Margaret Hamilton is very funny as the witch--what a laugh! And Billie Burke is a scream as Glinda--I just couldn't take the dress and her voice seriously--and her lines! ("Are you a good witch or a bad witch?" "Only bad witches are ugly." "...and Toto too") In fact, I saw it last night with an adult audience and they were howling at her lines.Also Frank Morgan is VERY good as the wizard--his giving the gifts at the end is a highlight--good thing W.C. Fields didn't get the role--it wouldn't have worked.Also, the new print looks beautiful--sepia tones for the beginning and end and rich, beautiful color. But I was bored and the ending -- "Oh Auntie Em, there's no place like home" PLEASE!!!!! She chooses boring, colorless Kansas over Oz? The plot holes and goofs also bothered me a lot--note how Garland's hair keeps changing.So, good for kids. Adults beware.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do NOT hate this movie, although my post might appear in the "Hated it" section.Aside from the extremely annoying songs, this would be a very good movie. Songs like, "The Wicked Witch is Dead," and "If I Were King of the Forest" are among the most annoying.There is one song that is always worth listening to. It's "Over the Rainbow," which was voted the best movie song ever. I disagree with that, but it's still a very good song.The only other thing that really bothers me about this movie is the fact that it's so predictable. I knew they would eventually make it, and the Witch of the West would somehow "die", and that the Wizard was the same guy who played the doorman and the cabbie (carriage driver.) Frank Morgan, who plays numerous roles, including the Wizard, did his roles very well. Judy Garland and all the others did well, too.Unless you're a fan, don't watch this movie very often. It is Rated "G," but there are a few intense moments.My Score: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was about 7 or 8. When I was younger I never realised Miss Gulch was meant to be The Wicked Witch or Hunk (was that his name?), Hickory and Zeke were Tinman, Lion and Scarecrow. I think Over The Rainbow is a great song but I find it a bit gloomy. I've heard that Shirley Temple was considered for the role of Dorothy Gale, to be honest I can't really see Shirley playing Dorothy. I think it was out of order that Victor Fleming (director) slapped Judy Garland. I loved the dog Toto. I enjoy watching this but I have to say this is overrated compared to other Judy Garland movies (Easter Parade, The Harvey Girls, Meet Me In St Louis, etc)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oz was not a dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes Wizard of Oz is a classic ,however it is only a classic if you have never read the books, and yes Judy Garland made an okay Dorothy except she was the wrong age,the problem with this movie is that if you have never read the books one would think that the story ends after Dorothy's friends get their "gifts" so to speak and she taps her heels three times . Except it doesn't because Oz was not a fantasy dream world Dorothy dreamed up .The movie leaves out a whole lot and gives it the cookie cutter Hollywood ending . So if you want a good version of Wizard of Oz watch one of the cartoons most particularly one of the anime versions since they seem to go by the book. The other thing that is wrong with this movie is how Dorothy's character was butchered in the book Dorothy is this spunky resourceful little girl who doesn't need rescuing but Judy Garland plays her like this helpless damsel in distress and that's not who Dorothy is . The girl who played her in " Return to Oz" did a much better job</fullReview>

The constant singing is just enough to drive anyone with a brain mad we're off to see the wizard is sung over and over again repeatedly with no sense of pacing or movement! Dorothy is really whiny and annoying after a while! The Wicked Witch has always terrified me and will scare any children who watch this! Just do not watch this pile of vomit inducing rubbish it is 76 years old now everyone has suffered through this pile of vomit inducing rubbish enough! There is a better Oz film out there Oz the great and powerful from Disney which does not even need to be compared to this vomit inducing rubbish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not growing up in the United States, my primary reason to watch this movie was because Pink Floyd made Dark Side of the Moon... I guess you know the story.*** The following text primarily discusses the messages this movie has without telling any plot elements. If you consider that a spoiler, stop reading ***About the movie: Well... for my taste the story is way too simple and unfolds too slowly. And, one main message is "There is no place like home". I think there are way too many people living too long with their parents, (possibly including me some day), and those should not get false encouragement. On the other hand "You already have everything in yourself, you don't need a wizard" is useful. Also, a confident woman as the protagonist in a movie, which is not a "love/relationship-movie", is still a rather rare sight nowadays. But, all in all the characters are way too simple for my taste. While they work well for delivering the primary messages of the movie, there are nearly no hidden, underlying, secondary themes or messages to think about, unless you count quotes such as "But sometimes people without brains talk a lot! - Yes I guess that is true..."(When Dorothy meets the scarecrow) . Also, what conclusion is a child supposed to make when it is told good-looking=good, ugly=evil... And, there were more questionable plot elements: - Why put up an hour glass, when it has no meaning at all? - Why are the antagonists so stupid and laugh all the time? - It is extremely unimaginative story wise that Dorothy kills the "bad guy" with luck! And, most importantly: Why does the evil witch need to be killed at all? A peaceful solution would have been way more appropriate. I think this is really sending a wrong message to kids, especially considering the current world situation....Don't get me wrong, I can see that this was a great movie in its time, but I can understand it very well if younger people do not find it interesting, and in my opinion there really are better movies with similar messages out there, for example "Spirited Away".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, lets go over Dorothy's story one last time. She's a flying witch riding a bicycle, her house falls out of the sky into a magical place named Oz filled with lots of "colors" because it's over the rainbow. Oz is populated by a bunch of singing midgets called munchkins and they tell her to follow the yellow brick road where she meets a bunch of wacked-out characters that also sing and she has to fight off an evil witch and talking trees and flying monkeys so that she can see the great and powerful wizard (Timothy Leary) of Oz who can send her back to Kansas (cause it's so exciting there) via hot air balloon, but he fails so she clicks her ruby slippers together and wakes up. Just between you me and the wall I'd say Dorothy's been playing in the old mushroom patch again. This movie is okay when you're a kid but when you grow up you realize that it fits right in with Pink Flyod's the Wall, Dumbo, and Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. I got three little letters to some up this movie L S D. I think you hear me knocking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't that magical to me.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK the reason I gave this film 3/10 is because its not as good as the original books. Personally I like Return to Oz a lot better than this film. I can't stand musicals personally and this is full of musicals. I have an 8 month old daughter and when she gets older I am going to introduce her to Return to Oz instead of this film. I think she would relate and like the 2nd one a lot better than this. Honestly if it was not for the musicals this movie would get an 8 or 9 easily! The actors/actresses are great in this film which make it the classic it is. I do enjoy the story of the film and the characters but it just isn't up to par with the sequel in terms of fantasy. The 2nd one is so much darker than this which makes it much different in terms of what I like to watch. If you have not seen this movie you have to watch it but go rent or buy both films. I am sure your kids would like Return to Oz better than this one.j.d. &amp; the dark empire</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing I can see with this film getting any attention at all is because of the fact that it is the first colour film of all time, yes I admit that is a big achievement in cinema and changed the direction of cinema However that is about everything that's going for it.I know I might actually get bashed for this, I might even be called one of those "MTV McDonalds people that just say they don't like it because they are stupid", or something like that. I am very reasonable and I will say if you like this movie that's your opinion but I have seen this the whole way through and here is my opinion.Unlike other reviews I will not share the plot because almost everybody has seen this. The actors in this to me overacted actors like Margret Hamilton, Judy Garland, Bert Lahr, Frank Morgan and... well pretty much most of the actors in this entire movie were not good actors, more the opposite really, rather that all of the characters seem flat when trying to play whatever role they got to the point where I wanted to turn it off, If they did such good performances then what other performances of theirs have you seen aside from this.Now here is another paragraph attacking a small part, The Munchkin singing. The strange voices that they used got me a headache during watching, That song was also long for it's benefit, it's celebrating and rewarding Dorothy for killing a witch unintentionally and then says to go to The Wizard Of Oz.The use of the effects made everything look bright and happy, even the witch's enchanted castle, with the visual effects and sets made Oz look brighter and happier than anything I'd seen, From a point of view this makes it look fake, people might say "well that's what it's supposed to be" The Genre of this film is a family/Fantasy, There are many films out of these genres that I have seen that don't use this much bright colours.Look I realise this is a film from everybody's childhood but I just am going my way with these reviews, I am not trolling I am only here to say my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable and overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I saw this movie on the same night as 3 other (completely different) movies: the Japanese AFTER LIFE, Kubrick's early work KILLER's KISS and horror-classic DAWN OF THE DEAD. And like many other "classics", this one just doesn't do the trick for me. Right, you have to watch these films(other example: THE SEARCHERS with John Wayne) with an open mind and from the point of view of years ago. I can accept that, as I can also accept the other style of acting and film-making. But what should really make such a film timeless? Right, the story. And this film just has one of the most ludicrous stories in movie history, even for a fantasy: not once have I even smiled(besides with the bits that were later used to parody in THE SIMPSONS, AFTER HOURS, NAKED GUN,etc.), not one moment was there a feeling of suspense(the characters were simply never in danger), not once did you get involved in the story and, most of all, the story was filled with gaps. The film however has some beautiful scenery and though I'm not a big musical fan either, I found the songs rather enjoyable. But, in my opinion, that just isn't enough for a film to be called a classic. "Old" doesn't necessarily mean "good"! 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The moral gets lost in the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having grown up with this movie, I am very familiar with it. However I must say that I find it overrated.A lot of effort went into this movie and it looks very nice for the time, and I must commend the movie movie makers who created this ingenious film. However, I must say that the story is lacking because the moral gets lost in it and because it has certain logical points that are worth exploring.The one major flaw is that the entire journey that Dorothy, herself goes on is entirely unnecessary; Glinda the "good" witch could have flew to the Scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion and told them the things that they went on a life threatening journey to the wizard to find out. She could have told the Scarecrow that he didn't need a brain if he had intelligence. She could have told Tin Man that he didn't need to actually have a heart to have compassion (otherwise he probably wouldn't want the heart to begin with --although I'd also like to point out that the tin man should have asked for a normal body that doesn't rust--.) And she could have told the cowardly lion that courage is about not letting fear get to you, instead of about not being afraid. Most importantly of all, Glinda could have told Dorothy that all she had to do is clapped her heels together and say, "there's no place like home" instead of again sending her on a life threatening journey in which she's being chased by a witch who commands an army of flying monkeys and throws fireballs. And from all of that, the moral is supposed to be, "don't run away from home.I think I have a better moral, don't be ignorant, don't withhold crucial information from people, and above all else, don't write books when you're stoned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revolutionized the media, let's let it go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize that this film was the first influentially shot in technicolor and everything and that it revolutionized the cinema and drama media, but to be honest, I've been drilled with this movie at school and at home to the extent I am not flattered by this film anymore. It's been shown way too many times and honestly, it gets old. Not to mention the fairy tale and "Oz" environment, which, as a child scared me a little, and I couldn't see how any children could find this film entertaining.One of the few definitive moments of film, however, was Margaret Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West. A genuine performance fueled upon stereotypes never ceases to be entertaining. Sadly, I think they blew it when they made me watch it every year in art class during middle school.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banal and shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did this, of all movies, survive for over sixty years? I'm thinking it had something to do with America's fascination with midgets. The Lion was the only good character. Everyone is shallowly scripted. We know the good people are good because they're white, always merry and rosy cheeked. We know the bad people are bad because they are gray (or green)and black colored. The songs are boring. The lessons are commonplace; similar to what you could read in a fortune cookie. The biggest rip-off of all was that Glinda just toyed with Dortothy all along. She could've left Oz anytime. ripoff. Has Dorothy learned anything from this? There's no place like home. yay. The only good thing about this movie is that it lead to Wicked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop being sick on my face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this back in the day when I was single digits and it went in one ear and out the other. I couldn't remember anything about it except the tornado sequence. I watched it again in my 20's and 30's mainly at Xmas as you're forced to at that time. Still I couldn't understand all the fuss. Now, nearly 50 years old I can categorically state this film is aWFul. Yes, it is like a dream, a forgettable one and as a fantasy more like a bad acid trip. There is nothing 'heart warming' about it. Those that find that must be psychopathic. The acting is flat, including the 'famous' Judy Garland and the more she and the other stars over-act the flatter it becomes. None of the characters are likable or interesting and the whole experience is like someone being sick on your face. The fairy from the north is more ugly and disgusting than the wicked witch of the east and the dog Toto out acts them all. The only good part was when the tree slapped Dorothy for pinching an apple. THAT was the only cool thing in it. And that only probably 'cause you wanna slap her yourself for being such a precocious non starter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go for the midgets leave for the tripe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why oh why oh why does this film keep getting good reviews? Ignore everything you've heard from your friends, its not 'timeless' its not 'classic', its not 'a gem', its not 'perfect film making' its not even average. Its sick in a bin, sick that no one has put any effort into hurling, sick that is now worshipped by legions of morons. A plot that your racist two year old thought up in a dream, a cast that would make Vin Diesel vomit in fear, a soundtrack that has you slicing your ears off and salting the wounds, direction reminiscent of Eastenders and a dog that, lets face it just needs putting down.There is a common misconception that all pre 1950 films are in the least watchable; this just isn't the case. It's fans, blinded by the fact that this was the first colour film, the fact that Judy Garland is 'acting' and the fact that it has the happiest of happy endings stoically worship, with unrelenting and unquestioning faith, not even stopping for a second to think that maybe their favourite film is worse than being kicked in the face.So watch The Wizard of Oz, but please keep your mind open. Remember the conventions of a 'good' film and observe how they apply to this one. They don't. We ask don't listen to the hype, the myth or the legend, form your own opinion on this piece of dog mess.The film's only saving grace was the stroke of genius that led them to casting real midgets as the Munchkins which subsequently led to the hilarious tragedy of one the diminutive stars hanging themselves. Go for the midgets leave for the tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good children's musical/fantasy film that was incredible for it's time with regards to it's special effects and production.This movie has to be seen before one turns age 13 to truly get it's hypnotic and magical spell.Even today,this film has that effect on children.A living cartoon with give all performances by all the actors including every bit player extra in it.Garland showed her talents here and the song "OVER THE RAINBOW" is one of the best musical recordings of ALL TIME.If you are into children's book type fantasy stories and are forgiving of 1930's special effects,you will like this one for sure......... </fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wizard of Oz" is great!! My favorite thing about it is the color change from Kansas to Oz. I also love the Scarecrow and the Tinman. Maybe I was the only one who noticed, but I always thought the Scarecrow had a crush on Dorothy!! I also love the little guy who follows Dorothy into Oz from her home: Toto!!"The Wizard of Oz" is such a classic, it has become a part of American culture! So if you've never seen this movie, you really have to! It's a definite "must see!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most overrated films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to rain on the "Oz" parade here. For the life of me, I cannot fathom why this film is so revered, and I know my films. The 1939 "Wizard of Oz" has to be the most annoying, obnoxious, and overrated "classic" and "great" film ever made.The acting in "Oz" is horrible, the sets completely unrealistic always looking like they are indeed on a soundstage instead of looking anything remotely close to real (early Tim Burton syndrome), the characters are all annoying, really this is probably the most "in your face" obnoxious film ever. If it didn't strain SO hard to be a good film, this may have actually have been a decent "B" film, an early cheesy delight along the lines of countless 50's and 60's cheesy sci-fi, horror and fantasy films. But because "Oz" thinks a lot more or itself than it really should, it comes across as a bloated albatross of a pathetic attempt at decent fantasy.Even the supposed "great" song, "Over The Rainbow," is completely overrated. It's a horrible, horrible song, completely unmelodic and painful to the ears. The one lone bright spot in the whole film is the Wicked Witch, with Margaret Hamilton playing the role so well and clever she easily outshines literally everything else the entire film has to offer.But hey, many people like the film, so that's the way it is. But speaking of this film in the same manner of real films like Gone With The Wind, Casablanca, and so many more, is a complete joke. "The Wizard of Oz" is probably the worst supposed "great" film ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand people's infatuation with this film. Come on people, The Wiz is better than this, and that had Michael Jacksn in it. Michael Jackson, people!What's my problem with this? How everybody talks about it like it's the best movie on the planet. I watched it, I wasn't impressed. The lines were delivered alright, but just overall, I wasn't impressed. Sure, back in it's time, it might have been revolutionary . . . but I preferred Predator over this when I first saw Wiz of Oz back in 1995. Sorry, folks, not a lot of evidence to back-up my opinion, but my brain hurts just thinking of this terrible piece of garbage. The only part I liked was when the credits started rolling!My rating: 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked. It is so rubbish not even your pets will be interested. If you want to see what the inside of a baby's mind looks like here is the film for you.My first problem is that the people who made it didn't know if they wanted it in color or black and white, SO THEY USED BOTH! LOL as if we wouldn't notice! Well I noticed and I thought it was rubbish.The little town with all those children was actually played by grown men. It's stupid to think we'll believe they're children. Another thing I hated was that it's telling a story about four people, and three of them aren't even real. One is a bear, one is a scarecrow and one is a robot. All they do is jump around and sing weird songs at each other like morons.Not even a baby would enjoy this, so please don't try making one watch it, no matter who it belongs to.</fullReview>
