		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a truly magnificent piece of filmmaking and remains one of the most fascinating and wonderful adventure films ever made. One of the things that makes this film so intriguing is that it could have been made at any time. I mean, just from watching it, you can't really tell when it was made. It has been one of my favorite films for almost 20 years now, and it wasn't until today that I actually realized when it was made. Watching it again last night, I had convinced myself that it was made sometime in the early to mid 80s, and I was shocked to find out that this year is the movie's 30 year anniversary. Until now, pretty much the only movie I associate with 1971 is A Clockwork Orange, and it's just strange for some reason to find out that this classic movie was made so long ago.At any rate, Willy Wonka is a tremendously imaginative and inspiring film. It's a family film, but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes- the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence: `family' film. On the other hand, this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience, like Cats &amp; Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well, and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids (funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets?) who were at this candy factory, and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory. One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and, even more, the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made, rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films (hey, some of them are really good?). There are, of course, some exceptions, such as `Cheer up, Charlie,' which I have been fast-forwarding through for as long as I can remember, but for the most part, the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candy-making genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory, but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life (`Anything you want to, do it. Want to change the world, there's nothing to it?'), but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable, such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat (curiously named `Wonkatania'), which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later. The dialogue in the film contains some of the most interesting little tidbits in the entire movie. Wonka's lines, in particular, are wonderfully strange and amusing (`A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men.'). He is a truly eccentric and fascinating man, and Gene Wilder captures the character flawlessly, as he delivers the lines from the brilliantly written script. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare movies that comes along and completely changes the way that fantasy films are made. It's all about having fun in life and being hopeful against all odds and, most of all, being able to have fun in life. There are times when you have to let things go for a while and just act like a kid. Eat candy, run around and play, steal fizzy lifting drinks and bump into the ceiling that now has to be washed and sterilized, it doesn't matter as long as no one's looking. That's such a trivial little quirk of Wonka's (who sterilizes their ceiling?) that it becomes obvious that the movie is trying to say that it's okay to break the rules every once in a while. Have fun in life. Besides being absolutely mouth-watering (to this day, I still fantasize about sinking my teeth into one of those gigantic gummy bears), the movie is an uplifting adventure that warms the heart and sends people of all ages away with fairy tale candies dancing in their heads and wonderful songs just behind their lips. It is an always-welcome vacation from reality for people of all ages, and it should always be remembered and loved for that. This movie will ALWAYS be a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Wilder revealed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most excellent works in the arts are seen and enjoyed at a variety of "levels." That is true of this movie in general and of Gene Wilder in specific.Wilder has been known in the circles of movie creators as a creative genius for many years. Here, his acting ability showcases that genius. To be sure, at the level of good fun for kids and Moms and Dads, he comes through. But writers must have loved his work. Watch for the "look" in his eyes. You will see "changes" in them as he speaks or as he listens to the kids. Those unheard, barely seen changes can be read many ways. And that is the genius. They put more into the lines than the words themselves.Art should be clearly and quickly understood. It should also be the tool used to make us wonder a bit. Think a little. Or find meaning we didn't see at first look. In this movie, Gene Wilder's almost imperceptible nuances speak volumes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favourites.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly, Roald Dahl (author of Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory, on which this film is based) reportedly hated this big screen version of his book. There's no denying that the book is sheer genius, but in all honesty this film adaptation is exceptionally well made too. In fact, it comes high up on my list of all-time movie favourites.The Wonka Chocolate Factory is an amazing building from which some of the most scrumdiddlyumptious sweets are delivered to the world's candy stores. Wonka-mania hits the world when five golden tickets are hidden inside packs of Wonka bars - for the winners will be granted a tour of the top-secret factory. Young Charlie Bucket, a poor boy whose family cottage lies within sight of Wonka's factory, dreams of becoming a winner - but with barely a penny to his name, does he have a chance?What makes Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory such a success is the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral. Each winning child is exposed as being rotten-to-the-core, then dealt with harshly and dismissively by Wonka. Seeing these awful brats get their come-uppance is hilarious, enjoyable and - on a serious level - quite eye-opening (it's as if parents in the audience are being told how to prevent their children from turning bad). Gene Wilder was simply born to play Wonka (every eccentric phrase, every bemused expression, and every mischievous glance is judged to perfection). The film's set design is fabulous, with particular high-spots including the chocolate room, the egg room and the wacky corridor which gets smaller and narrower the closer you get to the end. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is simply magic - a film that everyone must see, especially parents whose kids are just becoming that bit too big for their boots!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, my mom made me sit through this a trillion and one times. It's one of her favorites. I liked it well enough back then, but it's only now that I'm older that I can appreciate the true sinister glory of this movie. It's so deliciously creepy! For those who have to whine about how messed up it is, consider the original "Cinderella." Now that was awful. Willy Wonka is the stranger with a bag of chocolate that parents are always warning their kids about, but what he's really offering is a seductive nightmare in a kaleidescope of candy colors, a cautionary tale told with fairy story whimsy. I got it when I was 5, but the thrill didn't register. "A dirty trick on innocent children?" Some people out there obviously don't remember what it's really like to be a kid. Childhood is full of booby traps and the allure of the forbidden, and that which is evil frequently looks divine. "Willy Wonka" is about giving in and seeing the horrors and delights, the choices and pratfalls on the other side. It's disturbing because it strikes a certain primal chord: freedom and danger are entwined, and people have never wanted to associate children with either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone could love this film and I don't see how you couldn't fall in love with Willy Wonka. This is without a doubt one of the most charming movies of all time that is still to this day one of the most enjoyed movies for a family night. Despite it's dark little messages, it still made light of everything and made this movie "satisfying and delicious".You'll see a world of pure imagination and will absolutely fall for Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is a comedic genius who will forever be the timeless Willy Wonka. He played it so well and made it look so easy. All the kids were amazing as well, I mean the boy who played Charlie was so adorable and you felt so awful for him. You just wished for his deepest wishes to come true. The sets are also just fantastic and so yummy to look at. On of my favorite scenes was with the "inventing room", all the amazing gizzmo's. I also loved how we took a peek into Wonka's madness when he throws a shoe into a boiling water pot and says "It gives it a little kick". One of my favorite lines of all time is "Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker".The film is not only great to look at but it has terrific and catchy songs that will be stuck in your head and find yourself humming down the street. This is going to be a timeless classic that I can't wait to show my future children.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorites...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory: ****"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is a wonderful movie that should be viewed by everyone. It is one of my personal favorites. Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is about a poor boy named Charlie (Peter Ostrum). His life is horrible. But one day, he hears the news that Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is sending out five golden tickets and then letting the winners go into his factory. The first four winners are Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner), Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), and Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen). Charlie then wins the fifth golden ticket by luck.Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is visually stunning and cleverly written. The songs are remarkable. The whole movie is a fun journey through the chocolate factory. It is very enjoyable, fun, and clever. The scenery and props are eye candy.The most underrated character in the movie is Mr. Turkentine. He is only in three scenes, but everytime he is on screen he is hilarious. I love the quote: "I've just decided to switch our Friday schedule to Monday, which means that the test we take each Friday on what we learned during the week will now take place on Monday before we've learned it. But since today is Tuesday, it doesn't matter in the slightest." He is very, very funny.Julie Dawn Cole plays Veruca so well. She is so bratty and she is one of those characters that you hate so much you love them. Roy Kinnear (who will be missed) is hysterical as her father. The whole movie is funny in it's own odd and strange way. It is a classic that will be treasured for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply indispensable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the ideas that Rould Dahl puts into his book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" are here in an imaginative visual form appropriate to the time it was made. A lot of attention was paid to the sets and visual effects, clever special effects such as a trap door and miniturization testify to the care that the producers put into making this movie. The theme of the movie is difficult for adults. There are bad children in the world. They come from bad parents, they're not created by emulation, but rather the parents "produce them", much like chocolate is produced in a factory. The factory is populated by miniature people named oomphaloopas that remind the listener at intervals of Dahl's moral points: Too much TV is bad for children, books should be read instead, and children need to adhere to an ethical code of some sort in order to grow up strong. And who knew Gene Wilder had such a beautiful singing voice! The music is some of the best show music of it's time, including "The Candy Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Message In Which Goodness Prevails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie on VHS in the late '80s, I was shocked. A '70s movie with a GOOD message?? I couldn't believe it. The message: kids - be honest and be trustworthy and don't be obnoxious; parents - don't spoil your kids or they'll quickly turn out to be brats.Wow, no wonder liberal critics like Leonard Maltin trashed this film. It was not the normal message being delivered in movies, which usually trashes the good and glorifies the bad. That's what makes this story refreshing, and the same goes for the re-make that was released in 2005.Peter Ostrum plays the likable Charlie and is very good. He's one of the nicest kids ever put on screen and was a fine actor. It's kind of surprising this was the only film he ever did! Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids, especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her.The first part of the story was a good satire on how people sometimes make trivial things so important and how the news media gets carried way with stupid issues. (Wow, look at it now!) The second half of the story is intriguing because of the co-star of the film: Willy Wonka - a no-nonsense candy maker who doesn't put up with the brats - was fascinating to watch. (The critics thought he was too nasty.) Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy. Yes, he has a bit of a mean streak to him but his comments are fun to hear and on the money despite his lack of verbal tact. Most people prefer Wilder's version of "Wonka," by the way, over the bizarre-but- talented Johnny Depp's.This was an entertaining film that should keep your interest. It's also an interesting comparison to the 2005 movie. Frankly, I enjoyed both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it." Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory is one of the best children films of all-time. The characters, you all have to adore, even if their annoying or not. The film is about a boy who finds a golden ticket in a Willy Wonka chocolate bar and heads off to see the Willy Wonka factory with his grandpa and other people. Gene Wilder was great as Willy Wonka and his performance was quite funny and actually kind of weird. The kids were all great especially Augustus Gloop, he was hilarious. Overall, Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory is a classic and should be viewed by everyone.Hedeen's Oulook: 9/10 ***+ A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So shines a good deed in a weary world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world goes on chocolate overdrive when it's announced that famed candy maker, Willy Wonka, has put five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The lucky recipients of these tickets will be treated to a day out in the top secret Wonka factory, where they can see how the sweets are made, and if they are even luckier, they will get a lifetimes supply of free chocolate. Nobody wants a golden ticket more than Charlie Bucket, from a desperately poor family, Charlie has learned to accept his heritage with a grace and credibility not befitting most other children. So when a miracle upon miracles happens, and Charlie finds a golden ticket, it just may prove to be a turning point far beyond his wildest dreams.They say that true love lasts a lifetime, so shall it be the case with Willy Wonka and myself. As a child I was captivated by the colours, the dream of myself being able to visit a magical place where sweets and chocolate roll off the production line purely for my ingestion. Songs that I memorised back in my youth have never left me, and now as a considerably middle aged adult male, I can still embrace, and feel the magic, whilst enjoying the darkly knowing aspects of this fabulous and wondrous black comedy.Roald Dahl was quite a writer of note, and thankfully the makers here have brought his astute morality tale to vivid cinematic life. Director Mel Stuart, aided by his screenwriter David Seltzer, even manage to add to Dahl's wonderful story courtesy of a sinister outsider, who apparently in the guise of a rival corporation, will pay handsomely for a Wonka top secret, morality, greed and power all coming together in one big chocolate explosion. The greatest gift that Willy Wonka gives, tho, is that of the set designs and art direction, where in an almost hypnotically drug induced colourful world, Wonka's factory is a child's dream come true, however, peril is at every turn as life's lessons dolled out courtesy of the scarily cute Oompa Loompas.Songs are provided by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricuse, with the sumptuous art coming from Harper Goff. Gene Wilder takes the lead role of Willy Wonka, magnetic and bordering on clued in madness, Wilder takes his rightful place in the pantheon of memorable performances performed in fantasy pictures. But ultimately it's the story and the way it appeals to every age group that makes Willy Wonka a prized treasure, the kids love it, while the adults watching with them will be wryly nodding and trying to suppress the onset of a devilish grin.Pure magic is Willy Wonka, see it now in High Definition TV to fully realise the dream/nightmare on offer, oh oh I love it so. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet as chocolate!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the brand-new version of Tim Burton coming up, I thought it would be appropriate to watch the very first film-adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children-novella first. Over 30 years old already, but this charming and moralistic fairy-tale still is a joy for all senses, with its likable main characters, exhilarating songs and valuable life-lessons. The movie might start out a little slow and overly dramatic with the extended portrait of the poor Charlie Bucket who has to work in order to support his family and he can only secretly dream about winning a grand tour in the wonderful chocolate factory owned by the mysterious Willy Wonka. But, when the miracle than occurs and Charlie walks into the factory together with four greedy kids, the movie REALLY takes off! The children and their adult companions are guided through the colorful landscapes and ingenious techniques of Wonka-world, where chocolate flows in rivers and candy bars can be taken out of TV-screens. This is a very fun movie and Dahl's rich but bizarre imagination is wonderfully put to the screen by Mel Stuart. The set pieces are magnificent and they really have the true magical feel of fantasy. Typical for Roald Dahl's work also is the slightly sinister and horrific touch, which is perfectly illustrated here in the unsettling boat-ride-through-the-cavern sequence. This particular scene is perhaps the most memorable one of the entire movie because of it's great use of sound and lighting! New surprises and eccentric plot-twists are provided every couple of seconds and Gene Wilder's jolly (but tempered) performance as the extravagant factory-owner really makes this movie complete. I can only hope the 2005 version will be as fabulous as this but I'm quite sure it will be. After all, if there's one team able to re-tell this insanely great tale, it has got to be Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is like a big bar of chocolate: delicious...and you're never too old to enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willy, you had me at "Pure Imagination"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's pretty safe to say that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a timeless classic. Not only does it feature a great plot, fantastic acting and show how movies don't have to be full of computer animation to be good, but it also features some of the best music I have ever heard in a movie.I still remember, almost as clearly as if it were yesterday, the remarkable thing the movie did to me the first time I watched it: It completely changed my mind about musicals! I was about 10 years old when I first sat down and watched the movie. Like a lot of kids, I didn't much care for musical numbers in movies. So when the music for "Pure Imagination" started playing, I thought, "Oh great, a musical number!" I was just about to press the fast-forward button when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) began singing.Within about two seconds, I was completely mesmerized! I didn't think I had ever heard such a beautiful song in my life, nor had I heard too many singing voices that were as beautiful as Willy's. It felt like he was singing that song as much to me as he was to the kids and parents in the movie! That song certainly captured MY imagination, and after hearing it for the first time, I saw musicals in a whole new light.I may be grown now, but I still like the movie every bit as much as I did as a ten-year-old....and I will always have a special spot in my heart for "Pure Imagination" the song that convinced me that musicals can be some of the best movies out there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory' has withstood the test of time. And though quite dated, it is still a widely enjoyed film (with good reason!). This movie had a magnificent performance by Gene Wilder as Wonka, a wonderful story and great art direction for its day as they brought all of the awesome things at the Wonka factory to life (how cool it would be if you could actually go to a place like that), to being a superb musical.The story is that of a famed chocolate manufacturer, Willy Wonka, who's factory is a magical secret that was shut down when competing candy companies kept trying to infiltrate the factory with their spies who wanted hold of the ingredients that made Wonka's candy the most novel and ultimately, the most novel. Of course, Wonka has a change of heart, and decides to hold a contest whereby the people who can find one of the five golden tickets randomly (maybe, all of the winners were conveniently children, four of which had horrible manners) in Wonka candy. It could be anywhere. One by one, it seems that the tickets are being found, particularly by obnoxious kids who are all about the same age. (Veruca Salt, the most horrid and funniest of them all, would later inspire a late 90s alternative band). The selfish British brat, the slothy German boy, the record gumchewer with the sleazy car salesman father, and the boy who lives in front of the television. And there's only one ticket left. Meanwhile, a pathetic, depressed little boy named Charlie Bucket wants nothing more than to get hold of one of those tickets and witness the magic of the Wonka factory. Well, cheer up Charlie, because its about to happen.The trip in Wonka is more than just an invitation for unrivaled fun, however. It is a test. One of Wonka's rivals known as Slugworth, has promised a valuable sum to each of the children who steal from Wonka one of his newest inventions -- an Everlasting Gobstopper-- so that his company might steal the ingredients. Will all remain loyal to Slugworth? This is one of Gene Wilder's best performances, perfectly making the Wonka character his own. This was also the movie that introduced to the world the cautionary cult favorite midgets known as the Oompa Loompas, slaves who were rescued by Wonka to...well serve as his slaves. And, serving as a brief psychedelic inject into the events in the factory, make the lessons learned more obvious than they could have already been. Charlie Bucket's character, however, could not be written to be more pathetic, as though the filmmakers were absolutely sure that this was the kid you had the most sympathy for. From the mother working in the laundry hand-washing clothes, to the bare one room house and the enormous bed shared by all of the grandparents with counterpart names, to Charlie's constantly furrowed brow and curled lip. But, aside from this minor flaw, the movie has so many memorable things about it. I particularly like the Dr. Suess-esque setting. I can see why Tim Burton might be asked to be the next to recreate the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as the original looked like his style to begin with (like the foamy float machine or the bizarre sequence where Wonka appears to go momentarily mad). Nonetheless, may the legacy of the first live on for years to come. It is still one of the greatest family films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horror movie in disguise as a children's movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people put this film in the back of their minds and label it as a kid's movie. First of all, it's very entertaining for all ages and it has some parts which are really scary for kids like when Wonka takes his guests through a tunnel full of nightmarish images such as a chicken getting its head cut off which was actually edited out for television.Wonka is fascinating, funny and often terrifying. The look in his eyes is demented and when he screams, all hell seems to spew forth. Wonka doesn't care about what happens to the kids that get knocked off. He didn't give any warning to that boy not to drink out of the chocolate lake, but starts yelling and running at him once he starts slurping it. In all the excitement, the boy is pushed into the lake and gets sucked up a tube while the mother cries "he'll be grounded into marshmallow." Wonka's response is "That pipe doesn't lead to the marshmallow room. It leads to the fudge room." After the girl turns into a blueberry, he casually says "we'll have to squeeze the juice out of her before she explodes." Meanwhile the father is standing right beside him looking on horrified. When one of the brats does something they're not supposed to do, Wonka gives less of a warning, each time. The last time is nothing more than a softly spoken "No, wait. Come back." After the kids meet their fate, we never see them again, which is the equivalent of what? Death. At the end, Wonka says they'll all be returned back to their "normal rotten selves", but I don't trust that smirk. Besides, how are we to believe him if we don't see the kids ever again? He's a child killer who uses candy as bait. Sure the kids deserved it, but the idea is still twisted.Take a slasher movie like Halloween for example, where all the main characters are killed, except for one who is innocent compared with the rest. Here, it's kids instead of young adults and they all get disposed in some way or another until only Charlie is left to confront the demon Willy Wonka. What I'm saying is that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a horror movie in disguise as a children's movie. Ingenious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks Roald</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reason that is often overlooked on the brilliance of "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is the author of the original book. Roald Dahl not only creates wonderful characters, he has the ability to perfectly capture children's imagination. Aside from Dahl's writing, there are strong performances throughout the movie especially Gene Wilder as "Willy Wonka" who is perfect. Germany's Michael Bollner as "Augustus Gloop" should also be applauded for the delivery of his lines which for him were in a foreign language, although not entirely convincing.Even if this movie was butchered by the director, which it certainly wasn't, it would have been good. The moronic parents in this movie provide an accurate portrayal of how one eyed and disillusioned parents can be of their children. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is a beautiful film which I can still watch today and enjoy.Before I saw this movie I had read the book entitled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl and it was magic. As for this film, it was pure fantasy.Anybody can enjoy this film whether they be aged 10 or 100. I loved fantasy as a child and being whisked off to worlds with magic and wizards and strange creatures. Willy Wonka is set on Earth but not the Earth we know of. Willy Wonka's world is beautiful. Wonka is a benevolent old chocolate maker who invites some kids round to his chocolate factory where they can see all his delights and visit his magical world.The really great thing about a film like this is how it can whisk you off to another world. Forget whatever troubles you've got, forget about those bills you have to pay, forget about sitting in rush hour traffic every morning and just enjoy this magical film which whisks you off to another world, a world where dreams come true, a world where there is nothing but love and magic. I can guarantee that whoever watches it will be taken in by the magic.Simply beautiful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was a film I remember fondly from my childhood, it wouldn't be The Wizard of Oz, but Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.This seems extremely well done for 1971 (Though this was the year of A Clockwork Orange and The French Connection). The beautiful interior designs give the film a sense of imagination,and the shots of Munich and Nordlingen give it that timeless feel. The songs are all classic( even "Cheer Up Charlie" which seems to be often skipped over while watching the film, plus it has the best vocals).The performances are just simply wonderful. Wilder's performance has the perfect mix of pure joy and creepiness. Albertson gives us some classic jokes. Ostrum plays Charlie as one of the most likable child characters in film history.I still recommend this over Tim Burton's re-imagining of the book. Though Burton's film does explain some little plot holes (How did Wonka know kids would get the tickets?) and updates some of the films characters, it still can't compare to this classic.To sum up the film: It's Scrumdidilyumptious! P.S. Depp's Wonka has some funny lines, but the execution is terrible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic and witty film, a genuine treat for all ages. It's been said that the movie never feels quite happy with itself and is occasionally a touch too dark, but that's partly the point-there's some serious messages and themes about greed and family here amongst the candy bars, Oompa-Loompa singalongs and weird gadgets. Gene Wilder is great as Willy Wonka-this is a vastly entertaining and interesting family flick. Great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My review for my Film Analysis and Exploration class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Calling a movie your all time favorite is quite a task. I believe I was around seven years old when I first watched Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Ever since that first viewing, I have been in love with the film and its incredible diegesis. Though the film all together is a wonderful timeless piece, for the purpose of my review I want to start when the winners of the golden tickets enter the factory with their parents. As they travel along the many rooms, corridors, tunnels, and halls of the factory, the viewer learns more about each individual child and, more importantly, what is characteristically wrong with them and their parents. Though Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory captures the viewer through Gene Wilder's quirky character and the sensory delightfulness of the factory, one of the most important things the viewer takes away from this film are morals. More specifically, to be polite, selfless, kind, respectful? everything that our parents are suppose to teach us and are deemed desirable by society. What makes this message so universal is the fact that not only is it meant for children but adults as well. The viewer learns these "lessons" from all of the children as well as their parents, who are partly if not entirely to blame for their behavior. The first child to be taken away is Augustus Gloop, a fat little boy who falls into the chocolate river. Even though Willy Wonka tells Augustus to stay away from the river, the boy is disobedient and even falls in and gets sucked up into a pipe. His fault is gluttony. Three other children all share similar fates, all representing an imperfection in society. The second child, Veruca Salt, is terribly spoiled by her father and demands to have one of the golden egg laying geese inside the factory. She attempts to get one and is deemed a "bad egg" and sent down a chute, followed by her father. She is, of course, greed. The two other children personify stubbornness and rudeness and are both punished for it; one by becoming a human blueberry, the other, turned into a micro-sized version of himself. The protagonist of the film, Charlie, is the only child left at the end of the factory tour. However, since he is only human, him and his grandfather (the only respectable parental figure besides, perhaps, Wonka himself) drink a fizzy soda that makes the both of them float up to the ceiling. Unlike the other participants, their predicament is only temporary. Even so, Willy Wonka is displeased with them and tells them to leave. Being obedient, regretful, and respectful, they exit the factory. Only through their act of humility does Wonka present them with the ultimate prize, the factory itself. This sends an obvious message to the viewer of what attributes are right and which ones are wrong.It was only recently that I realized Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was made in 1971. I knew it was an old movie, but I was shocked to find out it is over forty years old. Once the characters enter the factory, time seems to stop. There is nothing dated in the factory, save for the television, and the characters themselves don't necessarily give away a time period. These elements, along with the very universal message the film is sending, make it sincerely timeless. People in twenty years from today can watch this movie and still take away from it, young and old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Wilder is magnificent, in the original -and, still the best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films - for children, for adults - ever made. It never panders, it can be quite dark. The wonderful performance of Gene Wilder can boarder, at times, on madness, cruelty, but - even when I was little, I loved this, and, I understood. 'Remember what happens to the man who got everything he wanted? He lived happily eve after...'It's one of the last lines in the film, and while it's spoken to Charlie, it's really about Wonka himself. He found someone - someone he could trust with his secrets. And, Charlie learned that, being honest does pay off.Another line from the film; ''So shines a good deed in a weary world,' which while, originally from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, still resounds with much meaning.There are some 'perennials,' in the film, and, this one shines as one that every child, can love, and, grow up, to share with theirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film better than the 2005 remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film was about 15 years ago when I was at school. This is about Charlie Bucket winning a ticket to go to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with 4 other children. As a kid I found it frightening when Violet turned blue when she had that gum that wasn't meant to be chewed. I liked the songs in the film, I used to find the song Cheer Up Charlie boring but I like it better now I'm older. As much as I love Johnny Depp I thought this version was better than the 2005 remake. Roald Dahl may of disapproved of the film but I thought it was great. I think the all the cast members did a great performance. The one scene that I found boring was when Charlie and his Grandad stole fizzy lifting drink and was floating in the air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favorite children's films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just rewatched this film today, and it reminded me how much I loved it. Who wouldn't want to visit a chocolate factory? And for those who don't believe it's a children's film, well, what about The Wizard of Oz? That film scared me way more than Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I admit, it's not a 'sweet' (unless you count the candy - YUM!) film, but most kids aren't that sweet either. Most children over the age of eight should find it a wild and enjoyable ride. And I think a lot of kids would be glad to see the brats get their comeuppance. Remember, these children are exaggerations, so I doubt any kid would see themselves in the character. And last but not least, this is FANTASY. Not to give anything away, but you know how fairytales end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Moral Masterpiece: New Age Free</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The first thing is Wilder's brilliant delineation which portrays genius existentially accurately with its dangerous consanguinity with madness. This was the point of attack, way back here, the tunnel scene, yet is gives the character verisimilitude. This is what genius is like not pasty face fops in a bad fashion statement like the remake. Also, the music is great the songs are uplifting and unabashedly moral like: Cheer Up Charlie. The Oompa Loompa songs make moral judgments negatively about the children which has been New Age disinfected in the remake. The cast is excellent with Albertson excellent as Grandpa Joe. My favorite scene is the final one: the test. Charlie returns the gob-stopper sacrificing wealth to be good. Who will ever forget Wilder's whispered line I use in my writings plenty,"So Shines A Good Deed In A Weary World." The song of hope: Cheer Up Charlie, the belief that virtue and hard work will be rewarded. It is sung so well and full of love and pathos, this moment alone outshines Burton's remake. See, the existential core of the movie is Charlie's goodness; this is what differentiates him from the others. Does he fail, like they do? Yes, but in a moment of truth, he chooses to reject the opportunity for wealth by blackmailing Wonka and Wonka finds that gem he was looking so hard for. When the remake substituted Wonka loathing adults instead of this moral test, it collapsed for this is the moral core of the movie: a childless genius facing old age and death looking for a good boy. Notice when you watch the remake how all the oompa loompa songs are now ethics free; no moral judgments, that is so mean you evil creeps! Who cares if he weighs 500 pounds, she is an annoying brat or the other one has been spoiled into resembling Napoleon? Wilder used his natural eccentricity, with its concomitant brilliance, so well here: this is precisely what he would be like, not a pasty face giant boy with bad shades. Yes, the effects are better in the remake but who cares? It is worth owning when the guy tells the computer he will share the grand prize and it says what would a computer do with a lifetime supply of chocolate? "I am now telling the computer exactly what it can do with a lifetime supply of chocolate."The songs are uniformly good with lyrics you can understand not mumbled to a rap beat with the argot slurred together like the Oompas had been drinking. "Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker." It is full of witty dialog all through the movie; this was made outside of a culture where the bong is a writing tool like in modern America. Unashamedly moral, it has great acting, writing and singing all through the movie. Wilder is the movie; it will always be his legacy. The man made some dreadful movies but when he enters the great hall and sings,"The World Of Pure Imagination," which is so powerful that it is even a great lyrical rendition of the phenomenology of empirical reality, this is good writing. At its core, it always was that search for the good moral child amidst the dross. The epiphany of discovery with Wonka holding the gob-stopper and whispering the words; the relief in his voice, the search is finally over. There is not a better movie to show your children; its morality is within the script it will not beat you about the head and shoulders with it. It remains: It Still Is Full Of Wonder, Goodness And Love. Q.E.D."So Shines A Good Deed In A Weary World."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest children's movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My love affair with this movie started when I was just a child. I don't remember when I watched it for the first time, but I do know that I took it for granted for several years that this was the best children's movie I had ever seen ("Charlotte's Web" and several of the Muppet movies were up there too). Now, as an adult, I watch Wonka every few months and am simply amazed how timeless everything is about it. I know that the new Depp vehicle will be a better version of the book and Dahl's fantastic writing will come to life through Tim Burton, but I doubt if the new movie will ever take away from the magic of Gene Wilder; the acting by the five fantastic kids; and of course, the chocolate. My favorite scene has to be while Wilder is singing "Pure Imagination" in the Chocolate Room. It is timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of the all time greatest films. The adults will get some of the jokes, but the kids will find more than one ways to laugh about it. When I babysit, I bring it with me and I have found that even the youngest of children were entranced by the story.Charlie is a young boy who lives very poorly with his mother and four grandparents. When one day world famous candy maker Willy Wonka sends out five golden tickets hidden in bars of chocolate. The winners will receive a life time supply of Chocolate and will be lead through a tour of the factory. With a little bit of luck and a heart of gold Charlie is taken on a journey through his imagination led by Willy Wonka. I highly recommend this film to everyone who is willing to use their imagination.</fullReview>

The kids (Charlie excluded), are the most obnoxious bunch on the face of the planet (I've always wanted to slap Veruca Salt in the face!). Charlie is your typical poor-boy-with-a-good-heart (And wonderfully played by Peter Ostrum), with a mother and grandparents. Winner of a golden ticket along with 4 other kids, he gets to go on a magical tour of Willie Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Wonka (Gene Wilder, who seems to enjoy torturing the kids).The film still holds up over 30 years later and I still love the ending.But still...Those DAMN OOMPA LOOMPAS!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest family movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great family film based on the story by Roald Dahl (who also authored James and the Giant Peach) is a favorite of mine, whether I have chosen to watch it with my children or just by myself. Gene Wilder almost plays second fiddle to the glowing enthusiasm of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and the character acting of Jack Albertson (who also played a very small, uncredited role in Miracle on 34th Street).The only mystery for me is where the story took place. From the movie, it would appear that Charlie's town is somewhere in Europe, judging from the automobiles, driving on the right (ie, not England), and the typical layout of his town, with the cathedral at the center.This movie is an absolute requirement for any serious video collector.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply the greatest film ever. What it may lack in technical expertise (don't forget, it was made in 1971) it makes up for with a wonderful story, superb script and bedazzling performances from all.Ignore any negative comments on here about this film so far. It is a moral tale showing what happens if you do not pay attention, eat too much, pick up bad habits, are spoilt or watch too much TV (too much tv apparently gives you a pain in the neck and an IQ of 3!). It champions innocence, honesty and childhood dreams. As Wonka says "I couldn't leave it to an adult, they would change things". The factory is a place where anything can (and does) happen.If you've become hardened and desensitised to today's fodder, transport yourself back to your childhood via this film and recapture your glorious youth.Infinitely watchable, wonderful characters - four absolutely beastly children, one underdog; one manic chocolate maker and a host of Oompah Loompahs which were rescued from snozzwangers and vermicious kernids! What more could anyone want.Never forget that "We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A world of pure imagination.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderful story with a wonderful message: honesty cannot be bought for any price, but it is the most valuable gift that any person (child or adult) can have.This is a great film because it appeals to both kids and adults. Roald Dahl packs his story full of all the tasty and grotesque things that children love, while the script includes enough clever jokes and quotations to keep the attention of their parents. It is without question the finest family film ever made.The first part of the film is possibly the funniest. Rather than seeing a group of children searching the world for Golden tickets, we are instead presented with a variety of obsessed adults who seem willing to pay any price for the prizes. This makes the film even more enjoyable for children; they get to see their parents acting like maniacs, the way the children themselves would.But it is five children who find the tickets, and they are hand-picked to be the worst examples of bratty kids: the overfed glutton, the snotty gum-chewer, the smarmy couch potato, and of course the most demanding, spoiled little demon in history (in my opinion, one of the greatest performances by a child actor ever)But the fifth is the golden child, the hard-working, honest little boy who has never had anything. From the beginning he's taking care of his family, trying to be the man of the house now that his father is dead. One can't help but love Charlie, especially as he sadly walks home alone to the sounds of his mother singing him a lullaby.The point of the film is that honesty, innocence, and faith will eventually make dreams come true. Those dreams are brought to life through the Chocolate Factory, a spectacular series of sets and scenery, along with a delightful musical score. Yet all through the Chocolate Factory, it is only Charlie who really seems to be enjoying himself; the others only whine and complain about all the strange and wonderful things around them.I thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It teaches an inspiring lesson, it has many colourful characters, and the scenery is enough to make your mouth water. It's positively scrum-diddly-umptious!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie for the whole family to watch again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (in which the novel was really called Charlie and the chocolate factory) is arguably one of the greatest family movies ever made along with the Harry Potter franchise, Lord of the Rings trilogy, Bedtime Stories (2008),Home Alone, (1990), A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and some of John Hughes' greatest films, as well as Matilda (which was based on a Roald Dahl novel). Some people who may have seen at least one of the film adaptations of Roald Dahl's novels do not get why he treasured children's stories very much, and I was very curious myself without even thinking about it until I saw the film adaptation of Matilda (1996) which was directed by Danny DeVito got my questions answered, and that answer was that not only children can be entertained by his work but teenagers and adults as well. But while I was watching this film which also happened to be based on a Roald Dahl novel made me love the magic of kids movies a lot more than I have before, the film tells the story of an poor boy named Charlie (played by Peter Ostrum) who after school works as a paperboy in order to support his family mortgage, and gets involved in a golden ticket contest for five people and each of the winners gets to bring one family member as well as Willy Wonka (played by Gene Wilder)himself. After everyone around the globe finds out about the contest it ends up to be a race against time to see who five people really are going to be and we find out about each one approximately a few minutes apart from one another (though I won't get too in depth with the film's story). the film is also an excellent way of getting to know Charlie who was the last of the 5 winners in the contest and after all of the five winners were confirmed Charlie brings his grandfather (played by Academy Award winner Jack Albertson), the film also has an excellent supporting cast which includes Julie Dawn Cole as the spoiled brat Veruca Salt, Roy Kinnear as Veruca's Alfred Pennyworth type father who follows every father's philosophy in order to make their own lives as well as their children's lives a whole lot easier is to be happier all the time and he does in the most feminine type of way, Denise Nickerson as Violet who is a huge gum chewer and ironically ends up being one of the contest winners even though she doesn't really eat chocolate, Leonard Stone in a great father like performance as Violet's father (and obviously he is much more manly than Veruca's father), Michael Ollner as the very disobedient and overweight Augustus Gloop, and Ursula Reit as Augustus's mother. Another thing that I noticed while watching this film was that it blends the two genres of both comedy and musical together of which that to me was really neat. This movie is a film that is committed to it's story, characters, and humor that Roald Dahl put into his 1964 novel, this is one of the best movies of 1971 as well as one of the best movies of the 1970s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Up There With "The Wizard of Oz", And Many Other Children Classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much the definitive movie you could watch as a child, and remember fondly as an adult. Roald Dahl's classic book and adaptation is pure gold from beginning to end.Charlie Bucket is a poor kid, who soon competes with every other child in the world to obtain one of five golden tickets into the famous chocolate factory run by the apparently eccentric, but public recluse Willy Wonka. By miraculous odds Charlie gets a ticket, along with four other children who finally enter the factory. From there on, the movie takes on the presence of a proverbial slasher movie, as each child is disposed of through their own greedy faults. Incorporate one of the weirdest tunnels scenes ever committed to film and in all seriousness, it's actually one of the most charming movies ever made.Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka. Obviously he's still a few years away from Mel Brooks's comedy goldmine, but no one can do what he does in this movie and sell a performance like he can. "Pure Imagination" is one of the all time greatest songs from this musical, and the Oompa Loompa's are parodied to death nowadays because they're so darn good.Out of all his stories, this remains my favourite of Roald Dahl's work. Though it may shy away a little from it's source material, this movie blends fantasy, adventure and dark humour perfectly. The factory is so incredibly detailed, and I heard that the chocolate river was two feet deep and became stagnant almost immediately (Poor Augustus).Final Verdict: Another children's timeless classic. 10/10.</fullReview>

I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately.To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?)Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. "We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems." AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods. Word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film of Chocolaty joy for the whole family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film, much better than the 2005 remake. It is nice to see the early 70's sets which seemed much more extravagant as a kid, but you have to appreciate them. The cast is much better than the remake. Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is more of a favourable character than Johnny Depp's and Granpa Joe will keep a smile on your face. The special effects were top of the range back in the 70's and they have had influence on a number of other films (especially the shrinking of Mike Teevee. Everyone's favourite character of the film is Wonka himself, who is a quirky character but seems to be hiding something. Charlie has to be the second (if not joint first) favourite character with his innocence and correct morals (even if some people don't like that he decided to buy chocolate instead of giving it to his family (but those people are just being pedantic), besides he does give some of the money to them). Then there is Grandpa Joe, who is enlightened and re-energised by Charlie. There are also four other children who everyone loves to see get what they deserve. And then there is the small, but wonderful Oompa-Loompas that give the feel of Oompa-Land. All I can say to sum up is that the film is full of great music, it is enjoyable for all the family and it is a film of Pure Imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>already in my twenties in 1971. Imagine a plank who had NEVER seen this movie! That would be me, but I was not at my best thirty years ago.WILLY WONKA is marvellous, a combination of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, DOCTOR WHO, and WIZARD OF OZ. It is a morality tale. It is an eyefull in the best sense before phanstasy movie-makers thought they could -- and should -- carry a film with "effects." As with many lash-up musicals, most of the songs are quite forgettable with the exception of two which make up for it. (The chewing gum song has much to teach the present day.) More or less the theme, the opening number has rightfully entered into popular music. If you can see this performed without a smile, leave the theatre straightaway.The story operates on two levels, a)for the kinder, b) for the elders.a) Help your mother. Love and befriend your grand-parents. Play straight with people. (I did ruddy little of the first two, so it hurt a little to watch.)Then, of course, there is the Ultimate Trip of winding up in a candyland!b) The one-liners and sotto voces. Amid the wit, however, there is a grim note and admonition: Adults as clowns and boors, poor examples. Parents in the post-war era who have raised a race of over-indulged barbarians who deserve to be banished into some Deep Six -- notice who is left standing at the conclusion of the quest, and even he is not without sin. The fabulously self-confidant Herr Wonka is almost undone with disappointment at the poor specimens in whom he had placed his hopes.The final scene did something to this commentator now far into middle age: it made me wish I had had children. WILLY WONKA is a triumph for Wilder, recently graduated from THE PRODUCERS, something boys and girls ought to see. They should duly bring their parents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp is excellent, but Wilder owns this role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka is not a nice man. Yet, somehow, you can't help but like him, at least as he's played by Gene Wilder in "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," the semi-psychedelic, and "psychotronic," 1971 version of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel. Wonka is aloof, sardonic, sarcastic, mysterious, manipulative, and devious--a leprechaun with a hyperactive thyroid and an edge. But, as Wilder plays him, you sense the sweetness behind the wild gleam in his eyes; he's really hoping that one of the five children he's invited to tour his chocolate factory will be a worthy heir to the world of his imagination.Yes, Wonka is a cynic and a misanthrope. (What else could he be after sequestering himself in his own little world for years on end?) But he wants to believe that there is still some good to be found in a "weary world." Wilder captures Dahl's creation perfectly.The rest of the cast is perfect, too, and they make the most of Dahl's often witty script. Peter Ostrom, in particular, is excellent as Charlie.Yet, this minor classic of a movie has its flaws. The production design suffers from a lack of budget. Wonka's "Chocolate Room" looks like an elaborate mini-golf course, with a dirty river running through it, in a brick warehouse. The "Inventing Room" is meant to be a whimsical, magical laboratory, but comes off more like an especially elaborate hideout for the Joker on the old "Batman" TV series. The songs range from reasonably good (Veruca Salt's ode to brattiness "I Want the Whole World") to saccharine ("The Candy Man") to downright wretched (the Oompa-Loompa oeuvre entire, with lousy choreography to match). Wilder's rendition of "Pure Imgaination," an overly sugary confection that could induce diabetic comas in the wrong hands, works thanks to the faraway look in his eyes; he makes it magical. The make up and costumes of the Oompa-Loompas (Wonka's workers), on the other hand, are simply embarrassing.Yet despite these flaws, "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is hugely entertaining and probably the best family film of the 1970s. Think of it this way: "Willy Wonka" is to Burton's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" as the "Batman" TV series (from the 1960s) is to Burton's "Batman." Both are different, entirely valid takes on the same source material. Both are worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence.Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor.This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's.Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Mr. Wonka's famous candy bars are especially desirable these days, because 5 of them have a "golden ticket", the winners of which will be guests of honor and receive a tour of the chocolate factory, along with wonderful prizes.The entire world is watching via TV and everyone follows the news of who is winning the golden tickets. Our hero, poor boy Charlie is the most deserving to win one of the tickets, and he does! The magical tour of the factory is a treat to watch. Then there are the wonderful songs, highlighted by "The Candy Man", which 2 years later became a #1 hit for Sammy Davis Jr.This is a gem of a family movie. Only "The Wizard of Oz" could beat this one to the top of anyone's favorites list. Kids of all ages will treasure "Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory" for generations yet unknown!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that is as good as the day it was made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film again after nearly twenty years, and became emotional, both at its objective quality and at the powerful memories it evoked. Beautifully filmed, directed, cast, scripted and choreographed, it is as good as it ever was, while maintaining the omnipresent edge of danger which was such an important part of the book. As suitable for adults as children. I think the name change (to 'Willy Wonka and ...' from 'Charlie and ...') was because the story of the film had some radical differences from the book, particularly in Charlie's discovery of the golden ticket and the film's ending, and not least because the film was set in the U.S.A., while the book was in England. In my opinion the changes were an improvement, creating a snappier and more credible storyline.The music is infectious; from the days before computer assisted music, the film had to use an orchestra - all the better for it. Diana Sowle's solo, 'Cheer Up Charlie' is another feature of what has, through all those years, remained such a delightful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: this review contains spoilers.You know, for 33 years now I've been reading reviews of this film that deplore the terrible fates that overtake the naughty children. Forgive me, but this is political correctness run riot. Is Augustus pushed into the river? Is the gum forced into Violet's mouth? Is Veruca picked up and thrown bodily into the furnace? Of course not! All the awful things that happen to characters in this film are brought on by their own hideous behavior. It's an eternal truth: for every action, there is a consequence. Eat too much? You'll get fat. Drink too much? Alcoholism looms. And if you over-indulge your children, they will torment you until they're 18, then torture the rest of the world for the rest of their lives. The warnings in this film are similar to the ones seen in Grimm's fairy tales, and just as valid. This movie is not Walt Disney; it's much darker, more textured and, frankly, more interesting. So if you're the type who believes 'there's a little bit of good in everyone', don't watch this film. As one of Oscar Wilde's characters says, "The good ended happily and the bad unhappily. That is what 'fiction' means."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a difference two decades make!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I saw this movie, it was as a nine year old and I remember being absolutely delighted. When an independent theater offered it as a midnight movie, I jumped at the chance to see it again, as did half the population of Milwaukee apparently, based on the crowd. What resulted was an unbelievably delightful experience that was three parts film, one part audience. To experience this film as an adult is amazing ? it is one of the oddest, darkly humorous and surreal films that I can remember outside of the Jon Waters genre. Gene Wilder is nothing short of brilliant as Willy Wonka and garnered many laughs from the audience with his partly over the top and partly wry performance. The entire production is completely surreal from the Oompa Loompas to the unreal boat ride through the horrific tunnel. (This was a children's movie??) I sense that this film is a `children's film' in the same sense that The Simpsons is a `children's show'. Both have elements that would make them appealing to kids, but the reality is that adults will have more understanding of them and therefore are the target audience. Seeing this film again really makes me excited to see what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are going to do with their remake ? I think it is going to be extremely positive.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An allegory for first world exploitation of the underclass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has never ceased to disturb me. First as a child and now as a 25 year old adult. To this day, the boat ride scene showcasing Gene Wilder's penchant for maniacal song and psychadelic freak-outs gives me the willies, so to speak. I've never had a bad acid trip, or any acid trip for that matter, but I'm sure that that scene is the synthesis of such misfortune and has, as a side effect, kept me away from the use of hallucinogens.As far as the actual story goes, I think it has nothing to do with a handful of children learning life lessons at a very dear price. Perhaps on the surface it teaches children to not gorge themselves on bratwurst and the flows of chocolate rivers, or to not chew gum and watch excessive amounts of tv. Couched within these preachy morale narratives is a deeper message; one which puts on display the excesses of the modern world, more specifically the first world and it's exploitation of the third. I'd like to expound on this further, but honestly, nobody cares and I'm at work, so I've already over extended myself as it is. I'm just doing this to hear myself type anyway, maybe I'll add more later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps this film is not a musical in the sense that there are no drag queens singing about grooming products; or better, no half baked story lines filling in the spaces between cheesy love songs. God, what a relief.I have never read the book, and having never read the book, the movie stands on it's own for me. I think it's a wonderful fantasy and it's too bad that there are people out there who are offended by a children's movie with substance. It's simplistic and I love the songs, they are fun and catchy and I love to sing them when I feel blue, instant cheer-ups. This is the type of movie you have to see more than once. You miss so much of the "dark" humor if you don't watch it several thousand times, not only that- you can't memorize the songs in one sitting so you just have to play it over and over again. I think Gene Wilder is fantastic in this role. He could have easily overplayed Mr. Wonka. If there is a new film I can't imagine anyone else in that role. I also can't imagine it without the music, the music belongs there. This film is more fun as an adult than as a kid. I'd rather watch this movie a hundred times than suffer through Moulin Rouge a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, this was the type of films we had for the whole family; a film with charm, imagination, wonderful songs, great characters...and it scared the pants off of you. I still remember the rather horrifying image of Augustus, as he is sucked up the pipe, being shown repeatedly, during commercials for the film. When, saw it at Thanksgiving on tv it was even worse. Between the Ooma-Loompa's and the boat ride, I had more than enough fuel for my nightmares. But, I still loved the film.Hollywood is too afraid to make movies like this anymore. Disney used to delight in scaring the beejezus out of you with their villains. Now everything has to be cute and sappy. Roald Dahl wrote books that children loved. Why? Because he understood that kids like to be scared. It helps them deal with their fears. Now we get films about basketball playing dogs and endless Olsen twins.SPOILERS-This is a great morality tale of a young, honest boy who does what he is supposed to, even when everyone else doesn't. Charlie lives in the real world. Oh, sure, it doesn't quite look like our world, but it's a world that isn't fair. Charlie is good and kind in a cold and harsh world. He doesn't get rewarded for his good behavior; until one day.Charlie is given a chance at wonderment and to make his family life easier, if he betrays the man who gives him his chance to enter a world of pure imagination. Charlie has the most to gain; but, he stays true to himself and Willie Wonka. Finally, he gets his just reward.Peter Ostrum, in his only film role, shows tremendous talent and potential; but, he decided it wasn't for him and walked away. He had people offering him another golden ticket, but once was enough. You have to admire that kind of conviction in one so young.The cast is filled with great performances, from great character actors. Jack Albertson is a treasure as Grandpa Joe and Gene Wilder is not to be trusted.If you get the chance, see it on DVD with the commentary from the former cast of children. There's some interesting stuff there: like the fact that the two girls both had crushes on Peter Ostrum, and traded off being his girlfriend. And fans of "The Prisoner", watch the Oompa-Loompas carefully; you may just see a certain butler.There has been talk of remaking this film, which makes one wonder why? There is no improving upon perfection.</fullReview>

Songs and story that continue to last the test of time.Likewise, Gene Wilder's eccentric and mischievous Wonka is a joy to watch. The true gems, however, are the subtle interactions of the veteran actors portraying family, particular Mr. Salt.Morals and magic abound, captured with such eloquence by Wonka himself with the wisdom, "We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of the dreams."</fullReview>

Are children still being spoilt? As much as ever. Does Charlie give us hope that 'their shines a good deed within a weary world?' Indeed he does.

		<shortDescription>A Movie Good Enough to Eat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Roald Dahl's magical children's ballad comes to life in this smash hit film. By the way, Happy 30th anniversary! It's about a boy named Charlie Bucket. Everyday he watches his school chums through the window of the local candy store. He wishes he could be part of it too.  Charlie's wise Grandpa Joe tells him stories of the goings on in Wonka's chocolate factory. Then one day, word get's out that Wonka's is having a contest. Five golden tickets are hidden in five chocolate bars somewhere in the world and the five lucky people who find them, get a tour of Wonka's factory. The first four children who found them, Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beaureguarde, and Mike Teevee, obviously didn't deserve them. Gloop was a compulsive eater, Salt was a spoiled brat, Beaureguarde was an obsessive gum chewer and Teevee was obsessed with TV. But when the chips were down, Charlie Bucket found the fifth ticket! He wanted Grandpa Joe to accompany him, so for the first time in 20 years, his bedridden grandfather got up and went with Charlie to the factory.  Willy Wonka was a fantastic man. He showed them the miraculous rooms of the factory, starting with the chocolate room, which was the nerve center. Augustus Gloop fell in the chocolate river. Next was the inventing room where Violet got a taste of her own medicine with an experimental chewing gum, Veruca fell down the egg dicator and Mike Teevee was shrunk in the TV room. Finally, Charlie was left and he won! Wonka, Charlie and Grandpa Joe took a trip in the Wonkavator where Wonka gave Charlie the biggest surprise of all.  A very nice family movie. Rumor has it that they had planned to market a real Wonka bar. But it apparently didn't work. But the movie is still around. If you haven't seen it already, you must. I'm sorry to say that Jack Albertson (Grandpa Joe) and Roy Kinnear (Henry Salt) are no longer with us. Albertson died in 1981 and Kinnear followed eight years later. But they will always be remembered in the great films they did, especially this one.-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie to own on Dvd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was born about 12 years after this movie came out, and if you had brought it on vhs, you should start planning on buying this on dvd, because one day the tape will brake. But how would you like to spend a school day, out of school and not be sick or anything like that but be touring a chocolate factory. (spoiler warning) As the movie opens, Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has announced that he has hidden 5 golden tickets, and to the people who find them a lifetime suppy of chocolate, and to tour his locked chocolate factory. And before you know it, one one tikcet is left (they was 5 to begin with). (Spoiler Warning #2), 4 kids has come foward, Augustus Gloop (Michael Boliner), Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregard (Denise Nickerson) and Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen), doesn't his name sound like t.v. (Spoiler Warning #3) a gambler makes up a fake ticket, which leads to a poor boy's named Charile Bucket (Peter Ostrum) family to believe it is really over including his grandfather Joe (Jack Albertson), which leads to Charlie to find the last ticket. Buy this movie on dvd. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film everyone should see!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have indeed seen the movie Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory and I must agree with some of the other comments. This is a brilliant movie, and both actors Peter Ostrom and Gene wilder did excellent jobs to make this movie one of the greatest pieces of film in the history of movies. I believe that all actors that participated in the making of this movie deserve to be recognized, however there are a few that were not mentioned in the credits. There are four grandparents in the movie and only one is mentioned in the credits. The Oompa Loompas are also not mentioned. I just thought that I would bring that to the attention of the many fans of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern comments show up modern concerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is fascinating to read some of the comments here about the "depiction of smoking", the killing of chickens, or Grandpa Joe's selfishness in this film. These comments shed more light on our modern "not in front of the children" attitude, than they do on what makes this movie so timeless.All the worried parents complaining about 'bad behaviour' in this forum are just modern reflections of their counterparts in the film - over-bearing, over-protective and with no sense of humour. Nowadays it is considered "abusive" to punish a child if he does wrong. No wonder, then, that we feel uncomfortable when Augustus appears to drown, or it is suggested that Verucca Salt might be burned alive! Should we be protecting our kids from such horrifying suggestions?Well, if we do let our modern hang-ups get the better of us, we risk denying them one of the most wondrous movies ever made. The colours, the songs, the fantasy of a world where everything tastes sweet, the mind-bending 'Alice in Wonderland'-ness of it all - what child could resist its charms? And, underlying it all, there is a sense of menace as a reminder that the world has a dark side to be wary of.Wonka might well be sued and/or arrested for 'child abuse', looking and acting like he does with apparently such little care for the children's welfare. Ironic, then, that, as the ending proves, he is actually the *only* one concerned about whether they are morally good - in our topsy-turvy new world, he becomes the bad guy for wanting the kids to think of others before themselves.Like old school ma'ams, "worried parent" commentators looking down their pince-nez glasses should be ashamed of themselves and their modern puritanism. This is a joyous story, that celebrates our sense of wonder. It is filled with ambiguity about adult behaviour, as real life is, but to those mean-spirited people who say "what kind of message is this for our kids?" I will let Willy Wonka speak for me: "So shines a good deed in a weary world".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a sort of eerie reminder that there was a time when the evils facing our kids were eating too much, chewing gum, watching TV and being spoilt. If the film were to be set in the 21st century and be reflective of today's youth we would have Augustus Gloop, who sells ecstasy in the playground, Mike Teevee the joyriding carjacker, Veruca Salt who steals from her wealthy dad to buy D&amp;G handbags and chain-smoking single mum Violet Beauregarde with her twin daughters - Kylie and Yasmin. Charlie died after eating a Wonka bar that contained traces of peanut and Willy Wonka was driven out of town after the Daily Mirror printed his name on a list of suspected child sex offenders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT MOVIE - Some people are too critical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to let you all know, for those of you who havent seen it (YET!) there are some discrepancies in what some people are saying and insinuating, I would know, I used to watch the movie EVERY DAY after school during highschool like some would watch sitcoms. (and to note for those who are WW guru's: I ALWAYS fast fwd thru Cheer Up Charlie! I have too! It's like this odd obsession! Like if I hear the second line of the song I'll melt... odd I know but a bad song!) haha, anyway, in the oompah loompah song where it says the parents are to blame, it refers to the type of child that is "spoiled" not troublesome, it's all about being spoiled and you can't say anything else in the world is to blame for that but the parents, even parents who do spoil their kids would admit that. In any case, to clarify the boat scene, there's a clip of someone having a black earthworm inch across under their nose and a clip of a chicken's head getting cut off, which if you look closely is either an already dead chicken or a fake one, and that's the only part that bothers me, other than the fact that willy wonka in this day and age would never touch Mike TV's head! It is a great movie with scene after scene of "moral of the story"s. There are some things I still have not gotten to this day so if anyone knows please post! (hopefully I'll find my way back to this site!) here are some: What is Willy Wonka saying in German before they enter the Lickable Wallpaper room? The french/latin and other ones are easy enough to roughly figure out but I'm totally lost on that one. Also, what was the point of going "up and out"? at the end? for effect? I never got that. anyway! enjoy your movie, you will not be disappointed unless you are highly critical and observant! and even if you do find something wrong with the movie as far as content for children (which you wont!) I doubt they'd pick up on it anyway! Have a good one everyone! ~Missy ;) PS: I named my cat Veruca (b/c she's a brat!) oh yeah, and you gotta LOVE the teacher in the movie!!! LMAO!!!</fullReview>

The Oompa Loompas scared me when I was four years old, and they have the same effect on me even now. Something especially about their blank, unenthusiastic faces as they plod through their moral finger-wagging ditties. Was Willy Wonka guilty of rampant exploitation and labor abuses? The Oompa Loompas were always WORKING, and clearly none too pleased about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film, but a pretty poor adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now before we start, I want to make one thing perfectly clear. I love this movie, I love it, this is one of the films I watched all the time as a kid. It was great when I was a kid, and it's still great now. However, this movie could be one of the weakest book to film adaptations ever made. Granted I haven't read every book and read every movie, but I have read the book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," and yes it does have the same plot and moral, but there are so many changes made.OK, the reason I love this film is because of a few things. The actors are great, every child fits the role perfectly. And Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. The songs are super catchy, and the special effects are outstanding. This film is over forty years old, and it still looks good. And it has a great sense of imagination, always being creative with the names of the candies.However it doesn't work well as an adaptation, they were squirrels in the book, the Slugworth guy was only in a short sentence, they used a glass elevator right after veruca. The Wonka Wash didn't exist. They were allowed to bring two guests. Charlie's dad wasn't dead. And they added songs for no reason.Remember, I love this movie, it's one of my most nostalgic movies, but it isn't that great of an adaptation. If you want a closer version to the book, watch Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. But I do recommend this movie.</fullReview>

For myself, "Willy Wonka" was one I saw and experienced when I was a young boy, and as such, I could relate to Charlie.I loved this movie when I saw it in 1971, and I still do. (It is now 2005 and I have the DVD) Gene Wilder really makes this so delightful. I remember as a kid that at times I really liked him, and in others I was almost scared. Still, I could not imagine anyone else playing Wonka.I know a re-make with Johnny Depp sounds fun, but don't forget about the original. It is a classic, and belongs next to "The Wizard Of Oz".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE this movie. I love it more now, than when I was a kid.The best thing about this movie is that it not only pioneered but nailed - and I mean, absolutely NAILED - the concept of appealing to kids on one level, adults on a completely different level. This is one of the hardest things to do in movies, but if done well is an absolute delight. Kids can watch this movie and be enthralled by the Oompa-Loompas and the spectacle and the effects. Adults can be tickled by the smart, snappy dialogue and by Gene Wilder being a sarcastic wiseacre throughout, in what must be considered the role of his career.All the parts were nailed. You can't imagine anyone else in the roles as they were cast. You hated Veruca because she was just so spoiled. You winced at Mike TeeVee's, Augustus's and Violet's fatal flaws. Especially juxtaposed against this motley crew, you appreciated Charlie Bucket and his Grandpa Joe for their earnestness and unpretentiousness all the more. Truly they were the moral center of the piece.Other movies and shows have done a good job of appealing to both kids and adults on different levels, but this is the gold standard to which all must ultimately answer to.See it. And if you've seen it already, see it again.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about as good as it gets, barring the tedious first 30 minutes before Gene Wilder comes on screen. But all the better, his entrance is perhaps the most memorable one in cinematic history (yes, better than Orson Welles in "The Third Man").Willie Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is NOT a kid's movie. It is saturated with literary allusions (Shakespeare galore), musical references (that was Mozart, not Rachmaninoff!) and a quirky sense of humour that only a mature audience will truly get. For that reason, I can understand why many of the kids today disparage this classic in light of the 2005 version with its CGI special effects and Johnny-the-hottie Depp. But for the purists who enjoy a good, powerful performance without the fluff, this is the film for you.What amazes me about this film is that it is really quite dark and cynical, despite its colorful and upbeat appearance. The candy man Willie Wonka is at times a malevolent and frightening presence with a jaded, almost hopeless view of life. But despite it all, he makes us laugh uncontrollably and sing along and revisit our childhood as only an madman can. Whether this was in the original screenplay or whether it was Gene Wilder's own tinting I don't know, although I suspect the latter. For that reason I'm sure it deviates significantly from the theme of the original children's book. But I wouldn't have it any other way.</fullReview>

The songs are catchy and memorable, and Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka is genius. It's a really enjoyable family comedy and there's not a doubt in my mind that it will hold up for many years to come. Another good thing about it is that there's comedy for children and for adults. Everybody can find enjoyment from this movie. The sets are great for a 1970's film, and it really lets you believe that such a place could exist.

		<shortDescription>dated, but Wilder is just impeccable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the most famous names in children's entertainment. Author of stories like 'The BFG', 'The Witches' and 'Matilda', Dahl's stories have given joy to children for a long time now. With so many of his stories being made into films, it's not difficult to see that Hollywood loves him too. In 1971, one of his finest stories was made into a musical starring Gene Wilder. Magnificantly 'odd', Wilder's Willy Wonka is a genuinely surreal performance. Twenty years on, and an inferior sequel later, and Wilder is still the way to go. The film might be dated, but with a Wonka like this, it's impossible not to fall in love with the film again.Charlie Bucket's (Peter Ostrum) family are incredibly poor. Living with his mum and four grandparents, Charlie dreams of better things. When the mysterious Willy Wonka (Wilder) announces that five lucky children will be allowed to tour his chocolate factory, Charlie has a dream. Receiving one chocolate bar on his birthday however, the odds are stacked against him. Still, this is a fairy tale, so you can imagine what's coming next.Filmed in Eastern Europe and with five children paid on the cheap, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is full of legends on screen and off. Colourful and beautiful throughout, it possesses many amazing scenes.As far as children performers go, the three kids do an alright job. Ostrum and Julie Dawn Cole (playing the greedy Veruca Salt) in particular are singled out for praise as they jump, run, sing and perform for the camera at every possibility. Ultimately though, the children will always be overshadowed by Gene Wilder.Wilder takes insanity to a new level. One moment seeming totally normal, and the next randomly talking and singing to himself, Wilder's Wonka is a man on the edge. You watch him and you just know that he could win your heart whilst simultaneously scare you senseless. You certainly have to wonder what Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) is thinking when Wonka hugs Charlie towards the end. Ultimately though, however nuts Wilder is in this film, it is him who makes it watchable so many years later.Well, Wilder mostly, but let's be honest, another reason for always enjoying this film is the regular song and dance of the Oompa Loompas. 'vertically challenged' (or whatever the PC description is now) individuals painted orange with green hair could just look incredibly offensive and weird. Dress them in weird outfits and have them sing catchy tunes though and automatically they become figures of fun. Yes there are definite indications towards the slave trade, but for family films, the Oompa Loompas are people that children never forget.'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is a film many of us grew up with and love. Beautiful and bright, it is always a joy to watch. Led by an amazing performance by Gene Wilder and the songs of the Oompa Loompas, the film has many treasured moments that you can't help but fall for. By modern standards, the film does look slightly dated, but with so many magic moments, this is easily forgivable. Pure family fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the movie is a little long and silly in the beginning, particularly waiting for Charlie to find his golden ticket, and especially the song Charlie sings with his mother, once we enter the chocolate factory, the rest of the movie is just magical. Though Willy Wonka is obviously crazy, he's crazy in a good way, and he sings two of my favorite songs. (One is about springtime being the ring-a-ling-a-ling time. The other is "Pure Imagination.") The oompah-loompahs also sing songs with real meaning about the behavior of children which most parents should take a lesson from. It's an educational farce about the problems of our modern world coming from the permissiveness of parents who allow their children to indulge in all sorts of selfish gratification. Chewing gum, overeating, watching too much television, and general greed and covetousness are all condemned, and finally, integrity is praised. This is a movie all children should see, and parents who haven't seen it should see it as well, though they might want to fast-forward through the first half-hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What is this--a freak-out?!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl's Grimm-like book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" gets a careful, pointed musical treatment here, involving five Golden Ticket-winning tykes who get to tour a mysterious candy factory--at their own expense. Turns out the journey is a test of their personalities and upbringings, and the film is a little presumptuous to suggest that the poorest kid may be the most noble and honest (as if all rich kids were rotten). The opening moments and TV commentaries on the race to find the tickets are littered with smart satire and a particular kind of dry-ice British humor which may confound kids but should delight grown-ups. Once inside the factory, the film coasts happily along on Gene Wilder's coattails (he's incredibly nutty, occasionally a jerk, but always unpredictable). The screwy Wonkatania boat ride is a highlight, with gross-out flickers on a screen that really are a freak-out. Yes, some of the songs are a drag, but I loved Veruca Salt's number "I Want It Now!" (she really wants ten thousand tons of ice cream??); "The Candy Man" is a classic and, I may be in the minority here, I thought "Cheer Up, Charlie" was a sweet lament. The movie is uneven and a bit grotesque, but it sends kids out on a high and doesn't bore parents, and that's a plus for family films. Critics dismissed it in 1971 (Pauline Kael described it as "Prussians at play," which I'm pretty sure is an insult) and Dahl himself publicly nixed it, but it has bratty kids getting what they deserve, a fabulous looking factory, and wild-eyed, frizzy-haired Wilder at his peak. His performance is like an Everlasting Gobstopper; it will live on and on. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is endearing, but I have to say ... the book is better! Forget the images that come with the movie, your imagination conjures up visions way beyond the limits of any special effects!But still, not a bad version of the book. The actors are all adequate, but Gene Wilder is fantastic, the best thing about the movie - he was the only aspect in the movie which was at least as good as what I envisioned while reading the book, if not better. And watch out for the twinkle in his his eyes! :) This is also one of those movies where knowing the story beforehand doesn't really do much damage when you actually watch it, if anything you anticipate what happens. Really the only thing to criticize - is that the movie isn't as good as our own imaginations. The other criticisms just make me laugh. Granted the special effects aren't that cutting-edge, but hey, this was made years ago and it's OK considering! Also I don't really feel it's too 'scary' for kids... I know lots of children who think that Roald Dahl's stuff are cool, and no, they don't grow up to become mass murderers. And true, there is a dark side to it, but it's got a good message to send. If anyone got traumatized, they probably grew up like a glass bubble. I'm not a kid anymore and I do still know how to enjoy it, perhaps it's even more amusing because you really get to appreciate the intelligence of the absurdity and the fun of the exaggerations that Dahl inevitably dishes out. It's silly, but perhaps that's why you love it. Another thing ... really interesting to watch out for if you're familiar with the great works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde etc ... I haven't read all, but enough to catch some of the quotes from their works deliciously sneaked into the dialogue here. For example, "Parting is such a sweet sorrow" from Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, and "The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts" from The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde, among others.I especially love one of the last lines in the movie where Dahl shows his total ability for sweet innocence (and Wilder delivers it to perfection) when Wonka tells Charlie, "And Charlie: don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he'd ever wished for." and Charlie asks, "What happened?" and this is when you're sure that he's gonna give you one of those righteous, cautionary, adult message of the preachy kind when he says, magically, "He lived happily ever after." *sigh* ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of my favorite books growing up, but surprisingly, I waited until last night to watch this film adaptation. It's unfortunate that what precipitated this was the passing of its star, Gene Wilder, but it was certainly worth the time and money. He exudes charisma and charm seasoned with humor in every scene that he appears. The songs were wonderful, and I found myself tearing up during 'Pure Imagination,' which becomes a sort of leitmotif for the film as a whole. Aside from Wilder, the performances from the rest of the cast were generally good, especially the children who felt like they leapt off the pages of the book. The visuals are bright, colorful and optimistic, occasionally trippy and surreal, befitting the source material. It was such a pleasure to take in. Although this was a spur-of-the-moment rental, this is one that will definitely find its way into my personal collection. WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a bonafide classic that I will be returning to again and again.</fullReview>

I mean, what's not to like about this movie? Most of the negative reviews come from people who can't see that this movie was in the 70s! Of course it couldn't be over the top colourful and vibrant, as they didn't have that in those days. The 2005 one had Tim Burton at the helm, and quite frankly, that movie just looked plain ugly. Another common piece of criticism is Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. Apparently 'he doesn't capture Willy Wonka, who's meant to be a quirky, energetic tout guide'. Erm, isn't that basically Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka? I mean, I suppose he isn't that energetic, but he's better than Johnny Depp's awful psychotic, creepy, deranged, man-child.Ignore what a lot of people say, this version is infinitely better, no matter how unfaithful it is to the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Wilder and the Chocolate Factory.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971): Dir: Mel Stuart / Cast: Gene Wilder, Peter Ostrum, Jack Albertson, Julie Dawn Cole, Paris Themmen: Magical musical comedy about children, candy and what draws them together. Gene Wilder portrays the mysterious Willy Wonka whose chocolate factory concealed five gold tickets within billions of candy bars. Those lucky winners receive a tour of the factory. Peter Ostrum plays young and ambitious Charlie Bucket who has a great family life, particularly with Grandpa Joe, played by Jack Albertson. When all seems lost and hopeless Charlie ends up with the final ticket and offers Grandpa Joe to be his escort. The factory is an imaginary sight to one's mind. Rivers of chocolate, bubbles floating about, gummie bears hanging from trees. It is delicious until the rules are broken and that is where the lesson stems. Director Mel Stuart excites the imagination with this colorful presentation but perhaps it could be interpreted as a tad harsh. The four other children are naughty and are met with consequences when they disobey. One kid falls into the chocolate river. One girl chews forbidden gum and balloons up and turns blue. Julie Dawn Cole plays a demanding spoiled girl whose pursuit of a golden egg renders her a bad egg. Theme regards truth, heart and the sweet tooth of family and the generations to come. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original children's novel by Roald Dahl was a story with good values and intentions; Charlie is the only one to not succumb to greed or vanity or disobedience like the rest of the bratty visitors, so at the end he is declared the winner of the competition and reaps the rewards. Simple enough. There is a different twist here - Charlie and his grandpa also disobey Wonka by taking a sip of Fizzy Lifting Drinks and very nearly meet their grisly fate too, and it is only by sheer luck that they escape this fact. This seems entirely unnecessary to me; it muddles Charlie and Grandpa Joe's characterisation to scold and disapprove of fat Augustus Gloop for not the following the rules and then hypocritically do so themselves. And better for Charlie to remain wholesome and pure because of his upbringing than to force a decision which does not seem fair for him to make. We do not know that Slugworth's offer is just a test, so it does not seem so dastardly to take the money and improve their lives.The film has its fair share of musical segments, some of which are more effective than others. It is a little too much to ask the elderly and youthful actors of the Bucket family to pour out their emotions in song; none of them are particularly good singers and lack the ability or charisma to fully emote through them. Gene Wilder does not have the same problem, and makes everything he touches a delight, from the whimsy and wonder of Pure Imagination, to his very first appearance, where he takes an eternity to hobble to the gate only to stumble with sleight of hand and pop up with a flourish. This was apparently Wilder's own idea; the effect has us questioning each part of Wonka's calculated performance, each absurd fact of his chocolate production, each half sinister joke of the children's demise and held syllable. The Oompa Loompa's bizarre accompaniment further muddle his intentions. What Mel Stuart does add from the novel is actually quite brilliant. He envisions a world so dominated by the quest for the golden tickets that the mania seeps everywhere into daily lives, with hilarious consequences. This is illustrated through several scenes in the guise of comedy sketches; professional psychiatry offices heeding the worlds of insanity, the media blustering all about, the British queen overbidding an auction for precious remaining Wonka bars, even a wife reconsidering the kidnapping of her husband. And there is the presence of Slugworth, like the grim reaper, instantly appearing behind the ears of each winner, tall and dressed in black. He beckons the eerie gates and estate of Wonka himself. And what is within is truly a marvel to behold. There would later be another flashy, garish remake of the same novel from none other than Tim Burton, and a freakishly impeccable Johnny Depp. But it does not match the charm of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow A Magical Wonderful Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is 100% pure theatrical magic. SKIP THE REMAKE. In this version a few minor changes were made from the book but all films do this that are based on books. In case you did not know the story here it goes. Willy Wonka in this film is an unknown man who makes the worlds best candy and of course chocolate. Nobody knows how he makes such wonder candy. As Grandpa Joe tells Charlie: Nobody comes in and nobody comes out. Then one day there is a worldwide announcement. Willy Wonka is having a contest and 5 lucky people will get to tour the factory if they land a golden ticket which is inside his candy bars! Charlie is very curios about the factory and would love to go but his family is very poor and can afford to buy many candy bars but luck seems to be on Charlie's side. The only 2 films that I can think of that are more magical than this is "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins". Again avoid the soulless remake! This film sparkles!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After several years of thinking that the remake was superior I watching this original version again recently.I was amazed at how well it holds up, all these years later. While not truly faithful to the original source text this film is full of charm, heart and features some fun songs.At the centre of its success though is the fab performance given by Gene Wilder. He shows Johnny Depp how Wonka should be played, with just enough oddness and darkness to counter the 'candy man' persona.All five of the children give great performances and ultimately it is the combination of all these things that for me mean that this is the version I will remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good for Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at ten when it first came out and enjoyed it. I have squeezed some nostalgia value out of it since. Gene Wilder is wonderful as Willy Wonka (if perhaps too young to have had all the life experiences discussed early on in the film). Still, to kids, everyone who is not a kid is old.The problem with the movie is the cutting of corners. The movie was originally sponsored by a food company who meant to make a mint marketing various Wonka bars, but that never got off the ground. In other words, it was a big commercial for a product that never came off (though some Wonka products do exist to this day).The story of the movie is a tale of producer David Wolper cutting costs however he can to streamline a budget. Two big stars of the period, Sammy David Jr. and Anthony Newly (who co-wrote the songs) showed interest in playing the candy man at the beginning, and being able to sing "The Candy Man." Both were nixed. Wolper suggested having a big star might interfere with the fantasy--but it also meant paying a star's salary. He might have gotten either for a cut rate, but foolishly rejected them, perhaps damaging the box office and certainly ruining the song, which became a big hit for Sammy Davis, Jr. anyway.Then, according to the book PURE IMAGINATION, some wanted the "Golden Ticket" song turned into a huge production number (see "Consider Yourself" in OLIVER or "Every Sperm is Sacred" in THE MEANING OF LIFE). It's a good song that seems to call for a big production number. But Wolper, no doubt with an eye on expenses, decided it would work better in a more intimate (and more boring) setting.My final criticism is Roald Dahl's fault. His original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY had the oompa-loompas singing terribly moralistic songs that go on even longer than the truncated versions in the films! After they enter the chocolate factory, apart from one song from Veruca Salt, all they have are the repetition of the oompa-loompa's moralistic ditties against gum, television, etc. What a bunch of (if you pardon the term) blue-nosed bores.The film desperately needs an "eleven o'clocker." These are songs near the end of shows (usually half an hour before Broadway shows used to let out at 11:30, and the audience may be tired) that are either comic ("Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" from GUYS AND DOLLS; stirring ("Oklahoma" from OKLAHOMA!; or perhaps martial, with a neat military cadence. Instead, "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" just sort of trickles out to the end, in the Great Glass Elevator.Some scenes do work, but even they have flaws. The "Chocolate Room" takes the breath away on an initial viewing (esp. in the theaters) and the song "Pure Imagination" is arguably the best in the show. But then one wonders--why didn't they decorate the posts holding up the roofs, perhaps to look like candy canes? Was that more cost-cutting? And the chocolate river never looked anything to me but repulsive, even when I was ten and willing to believe.Some of the effects look cheesy in the twenty-first century. Overall, this is a better version than the twisted vision of Tim Burton that came out later, with the androgenous Willy Wonka and the unnecessary backstory that Dahl, for all his faults, never included. In fact, his Wonka is a jolly little chap rather than bizarre as in Burton's tale, or perhaps bipolar in this version.Gene Wilder is mostly restrained for a pretty good performance to follow up his brilliant breakthrough in Mel Brooks' "The Producers." The kids are mostly surprisingly good actors, especially the bickering girls. Three good songs (including "Pure Imagination" and the all but ruined "Candy Man"). The boy playing Charlie is good but his hair is right out of the 1970s and it clashes with the timeless, nameless, old-world village where he lives.Also, keep an eye out for David Battley as the annoyingly hilarious Mr. Turkentine. Tim Brooke-Taylor from "The Goodies" has an amusing bit as a computer operation. And some welcome dark-comedic vignettes during the hunt for the golden ticket should please adults who are trying to persuade their kids a half-century-old movie with shoddy effects is worth the waste of a dull afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mel Stuart took viewers to a world of pure imagination in his 1971 feature Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. In perhaps his most well-known role, Gene Wilder as the eccentric candy man looking to pass on his chocolate legacy created a brilliant film adaptation of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Wilder's exquisite performance proved he could command an entire film, despite him only being in the film's second half. A fun family experience, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory spans generations to bring pure imagination to all ages.Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), candy extraordinaire is well known for being a recluse in his chocolate factory. Fearing intrusion, he has locked himself in his factory free to invent and produce the best chocolate the world has known without threat. When word breaks that Willy Wonka will open his factory to 5 winners of golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars, the world is stunned as they all scatter, ravishing his bars to gain entry into his elusive chocolate paradise. Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) of meager means, believes that he has to win a golden ticket because he wants the prize more than anyone else does. After all 5 of the golden tickets are discovered, Charlie cries in his room devastated to have missed out on meeting the man his grandfather always told him stories about. To console himself, Charlie treats himself to a Wonka bar after he finds some money in the street. To his surprise, just after he buys the bar, the news breaks that the fifth golden ticket was a fake. With the last shred of hope in him, Charlie opens his bar to find a glimmer of gold around his candy bar. After racing home to tell his family the good news, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) prepare for their trip to the chocolate factory the next day. Wearing a purple velvet coat, Willy Wonka greets the guests to his factory walking with a cane, that he gets stuck in a brick and falls forward in a fantastic somersault. From this point on, Willy Wonka's credibility is questioned as he leads the children and their families through his factory where there are "little surprises around every turn". Some of those surprises result in removal of the children from the factory until only Charlie is left to discover Willy Wonka's motives for opening his chocolate paradise. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a sincere treat for children and parents alike. A fun moral movie that is never too overt with its message, Willy Wonka is an experience to have as often as possible. The worst part of this movie is waiting the 47 minutes of well-done build-up before we actually get to see Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is fantastic in the role of the mysterious peculiar owner of the candy empire. He has his perfect moments of emotion, which he is often accused of overdoing the yelling--a criticism I find unfounded. I read that he had to fight to have his opening scene filmed the way that made it into the movie, with his walking being aided by a cane. It was a good decision on behalf of Mel Stuart to relent and film it this way, because, from that moment on, you never knew what Mr. Wonka was capable of, nor did you understand his motives. This mystery was necessary to the story, and a bit of the premise the film depends on upon would have been lost without it. This bit of trivia just further goes to support what an acting genius Gene Wilder is.Always do as your told, follow rules and authority, adults are looking out for your best interests are the easy messages to take away from this film. Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that the adults are no better equipped to look after themselves than their children are. It is an adult that is trying to steal from Mr. Wonka, and get the kids to steal his secrets, it is the adults that are encouraging their kids to do Slugworth's bidding, and it is the adults who find it difficult to resist the temptations around them. Maybe the bigger message is that there's a little childlike wonder left in all of us, as long as we don't try to hard to extinguish it. The adults become just as enchanted as the children when they first enter Mr. Wonka's brilliant candy-filled world. Maybe, just maybe, the underlying message is that we all advance in age as we make it through life, but if we are careful, we never have to grow up. I stick with that message, Willy Wonka doesn't live too bad of a life, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iconic classic for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The author, Roald Dahl, has served as a pool of stories filled with fantasy, wacky but likable characters, and morals fit for children. This is the movie adaptation of one of his stories, very much in the mold of an "Alice in Wonderland", the protagonist being a child and all the candor he manifests, and this film is further testament to the 'Peter Pan' myth that within us lives forever a child, full of a purity and enthusiasm that never die. Willy Wonka is superbly interpreted by Gene Wilder here, and it should be said all the children actors play their roles very well too. Especially, I thought, the little Veruca Salt. The song scenes are very good, the Oompa Loompa song being an absolute cinema classic that'll ring in people's heads til they die. The dialog is excellent, every Wonka line being somehow symbolic or having double meaning. Overall this film is an ode to humanity, principle, but also to the strange: don't be afraid to show your difference, even if it scares some. The boat scene for example, a metaphor of the stranger dimension of eccentric experimentation. Excellent watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Candy Land</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl is one of my favorite fantasy writers because what I loved about his stories was how he brought fairy tales to our modern era and existence, which to me showed that fantasy stories don't have to just be confined to the medieval era but can be in our time frame. Which also further show that in the fantasy genre anything truly is possible and anything can go. This film is another one of my favorite fantasy films of all time and it's also another childhood relic, I've seen this film when I was about seven.I really love the production value, everything is practical they successfully create a great look of the factory, the factory is sort of like the Tardis in "Doctor Who" it's literally a hidden world where you see all sorts of things from the Candy Land which as a kid I wanted to go to because I wanted to chomp on most of that candy. Down to the machines that look like something out of Rub Goldburg cartoons, my favorite machine is that gum machine, which is strange from what it has like crushing tomatoes and a bee hive. The writing is excellent, the dialog is just clever and at times really funny, there are so many memorable lines that it would take more than one watch to hear and get them all.Though like in Brothers Grimm fashion the film can also be kinda dark and a bit scary. From each of the life and death situations the kids stupidly get themselves into. Down to that infamous boat ride from hell scene, that scene is one of the most bizarre and scariest scene I've ever seen really scared me when I was a kid. It's like some trippy experimental film that some doped up film student cooked up as you are just seeing random nasty images.The music is great as there are plenty of memorable songs. Two of my favorites are of course Pure Imagination sung beautifully by Gene Wilder. And my second one is "I Want it Now", that song is just fun and really hilarious as the song is the expression of the epitome of Veruka's greed and vanity.The characters are great, really like protagonist Charlie whom is the everyday kid you've probably passed by or were. He's good natured, never selfish he's selfless as he loves his family and does his best to help them out. He's sympathetic as he really has not much to anything going for his life. I wouldn't say he's so much a kid with dreams but more like a kid whom is looking for something great in life, a chance to taste it may'be be part of it.I really like how you see a parallel contrast between him and the rest of the kids in the group. All of the other kids have been in rich or high class existences which means they had practically every advantage in life but as we see have turned out kinda rotten. Where we see Charlie he's lived on the low end of things but he turned out to be alright as he's smart and kind. It just shows that just because you grew up on the wrong side of the tracks doesn't mean a person will turn out bad; and just because someone grew up on the right side doesn't always mean they'll be good.Veruka Salt she is a kid you just love to dislike. To me she is just the absolute worst of the bunch because she is just spoiled rotten to the core. Her constant bad case of the gimmies can make you both laugh and grown at the same time. But seeing her just goes to show that giving your kid everything he or she asks for is bad parenting at best because your teaching your kid a bad lesson that they get everything handed to them. As Lincoln Hawk once said "Life don't go one way for nobody", Veruka is going to learn that saying the hard way.And of course my favorite character is Willy Wonka played by one of my favorite comedic actors Gene Wilder. This is my favorite role from him, he has some of the best lines ever but he just has just this great amount of energy both physically and comedically, to me Gene really is Willy Wonka. In a way he's kinda like "Doctor Who" as his character has this three dimensional enigmatic quality to him. At times he can be truthful but then he's not, he can also flip on his persona. There's a bit of a good back and forth between both Charlie and him, it's almost a father and son like dynamic as Willy fills in that father figure role that Charlie is sorely missing.One of my favorite moments with Willy is the cream room where it's literally both verbal and visual humor at work. As he is just saying something and then putting his play on words to practice, when he puts some random things in each cream mixture. I always wonder what else does he put into the mixtures.And of course like with most fairy tales this film has a sense of morality, there are a lot of underlying messages without being preachy or heavy handed. Like how it's OK for kids to indulge in the sweets of life but it's more important they get what they need in order to grow healthy and happy. But also about bad parenting, why we need to be better teachers for kids, teach them and give them what's more important in life, to not spoil and indulge them all the time which is practically the equivalent of giving them nothing.This fantasy is full of rich goodness.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie again, many years after it was released. It really has stood the test of time. A lot of creativity went into the production. The acting is great, and the caricatured characters and "moral lessons" very amusing. The use of vibrant colors within the Wonka factory creates a true fantasy land contrasting with the drab surrounding city. And of course there's the nice Dickensian Charlie character...Not sure what to say about the Oompa Loompas. One might consider the use of them in the factory as morally dubious. Are they not slaves? Willy Wonka explains that he has saved them from the depredation rampant in their homeland, where they are in constant danger by wild animals (or something along those lines). So it's supposed to be okay for them to live 24/7 at the factory and work day in and and day out. Question: couldn't they also lead normal lives in the city itself, where none of their natural predators live? At least I did not see any of them running around... For heaven's sake, self-styled moral sage Wonka does not need to keep them trapped at the factory! How would these orange-skinned dwarfs fare amidst ordinary human beings? Unclear.Given the undeniable quality of this movie, I have to ask: why was it remade, when the original version was so good and seems just as modern today? Of course, that's a question I always ask about misguided attempts to create "improved" versions of already classic films. Could it be a sign of megalomania on the part of the later director and cast?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes Gene Wilder does perform in a great lead role both singing as well as acting alike.As The Narrator for the Ad for this in The 1971 had even said The Things in this movie that Happen are incredible.As you watch for yourself you even get to as much enjoy this as you get to catch on to a # of things.Watch also for Jack Albertson as Grampa George and before he was made famous as Ed in "Chico and The Man."If you're familiar with the book before seeing this you can see the similarities too like when in this Veruca is a bad egg instead of a bad nut.The Egg-dicator of which she stands on is activated to dispense her for being a bad nut.Then her Father says "Wait Sweetheart Daddy is coming."Yes even though she'd been a headache to him all of the days of her life.Wanting everything but then after riding in Wonka's boat in conclusion changed her mind saying "Daddy I don't want a boat like this."In The Book Veruca was to The Squirrels a bad nut as they had found out after gnawing on her and so they then had dispensed with her.Just Watch The Movie called Charlie and the chocolate Factory and you'll see how it's more consistent to the book but that this is still even more enlightening and enjoyable.As I told for that film's review here on IMDb along with to also prove it went quickly to a 4 DVD pack.Truthfully,Stephen"Steve" G.

		<fullReview>I'm gonna be 100% honest. I usually only a give 10/10 rating when a movie is close to being perfect, when it does everything right. This is not the case with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, a movie that is flawed, indeed. But the movie is incredibly original, it has a magical feel that I'm not sure many other movies have and has become a part of film and culture in general, that the movie deserves a 10/10 rating.Let's talk about the flaws of the movie first. I understand the film is based on a children's book, but the characters in the film, particularly the parents of the children feel incredibly clichd and extreme in their way of being. Veruca's father, for example: he's a rich guy who gives his daughter absolutely anything she wants. And by anything I mean anything. He's at an extreme with his personality and so are all the other parents and their children. I get that this helps transmit an important message the film tries to send out: that some children are spoiled little brats, but the reality is that they are only a reflection of their own parents, I get it. But I think they could have made it more subtle and not so much "in your face" like in this movie. But that's pretty much it as a movie "flaw", but it takes a great part in the movie.Flaws aside, this movie is wonderful. It still looks amazing after nearly 45 years, the humor still holds up and it's just original as hell. Gene Wilder gives an iconic, hilarious performance that will NEVER be topped. Everything from the chocolate room with the chocolate river to the amazing songs in the movie feel magical. Another thing I love about this movie is the themes it handles. Like I mentioned earlier one of them is the raising kids to be spoiled brats theme and also what it means to be humble, like Charlie. The movie is so bizarre and even really scary at times, it is great.An amazing film, even if it has its flaws, they do not hide the fact that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a film like no other and is, without a doubt, a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based on Roald Dahl's 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's a classic, timeless tale that is also very entertaining.The movie is about this kid named Charlie who really wants to see the factory of this famous chocolateer named Willy Wonka. Luckily for him, Wonka is handing out five special golden tickets in five different chocolate bars that can give an opportunity for people to go into his famous candy factory. Somehow, Charlie gets the fifth and final golden ticket and is allowed inside Wonka's factory. He, alongside four other kids and their parents, get to see how strange this guy's factory really is, including a shrinking room, lickable walls, a weird Wonkamobile, and a crazy boat ride. Due to four of the kids having flaws, it gives them unnecessary consequences (Being stuck in a tube, inflating into a blueberry, falling down a garbage chute and being shrunk down). However, Charlie maintains his grip and manages to come out on top after getting the reward of not only a bunch of chocolate, but the entire factory as well.Friends, this movie was spectacular. It has a great plot, great relatable characters, and a funny yet charming plot. Although it's very different from Dahl's book, (A remake which is more true to the story came out in 2005) it certainly takes those changes and uses them correctly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie works. It's a fun family-oriented film that most who watch it will be able to relate to. How many children won't love a movie that transports them into a magical chocolate factory, and how many adults won't be able to relate to the spoiled rotten kids who are at the heart of the story. So, it works. It's an enjoyable watch. Surprisingly, it holds up pretty well against modern movies, and against the Tim Burton version of the story that came out a few years ago. Sure, it lacks the CGI effects that are now ubiquitous in movie-making, but that's kind of a relief. Let's be honest - who really needs CGI? And, it has Gene Wilder who catches the quirkiness of Willie Wonka well. And the character of Charlie is a likable character, unlike the other 4 obnoxious brats who win the trip to the chocolate factory. So, it works. It can't disappoint.That isn't to say that it's perfect by any means. The story seems a bit long; the opening especially. Let's be honest. All we really care about is the trip to the chocolate factory. Sure, it was nice to learn a bit about Charlie's family. That really makes the contrast with the other 4 kids more powerful. But the search for the golden tickets was too drawn out and went on for too long. One of Willie Wonka's repeated lines is "there's so much time and so little to do." That seemed appropriate, and the extended search for the ticket started to seem like filler after a while. Even the music was lacking. "Candy Man" is a great song, but the actor playing the shopkeeper didn't seem to put much feeling into it. It was a mechanical performance to me; not one that made an impact on me. None of the other songs or singers stood out to me, although I was surprised to see Jack Albertson, who played Charlie's Grampa Joe, singing and dancing. I also wasn't really taken with the Oopaloompas. I didn't find them very interesting.So, it's not perfect - but it's not bad either. It's fine as a family film. Enough to charm the children and enough to keep the adults interested, but it didn't have anything to really capture me and hold me riveted.

		<shortDescription>Roald Is Never Dull!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delight for all ages. Gene Wilder will always be the definitive Willie Wonka (sorry Johnny Depp--not even in the game). This is the moralistic tale that tells us that the selfish undisciplined child will eventually pay a price for his or her transgressions and the good will win out. But like all of Roald Dahl's books, it has a hard edge filled with many surprises. Wilder plays the quirky Wonka as he moralizes and cruelly punishes the little brats for their negative attributes. Even Charlie begins to wonder if what has been promised him has so many conditions that it may not be worth the effort. While the special effects may seem a bit dated, they work well and the factory is a wonder. And then there are those Oompa Loompas, providing employment for the most little person actors since "The Wizard of Oz." I've watched this so many times and I never tire of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought it would be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty insulting title for a review, I know. But I don't like fantasy as a rule, and Roald Dahl's imagination tends to creep me out severely, so there was no point in my seeing this film at any point over the past 40+ years, even though I was the target age when it first came out in theaters. But, it finally came up free on streaming and I figured what the heck, I could always turn it off.I haven't read the book or seen the Johnny Depp re-make (there's another guy who creeps me out severely), but I do like Gene Wilder, he turned in a good performance here, and he was reason enough for me to finish the whole thing. I kept forgetting it was a musical? just a handful of mostly lame, forgettable, awkwardly-inserted songs. To show you how little I knew about this film going in, I was actually surprised to find that the song "The Candyman" originated here. (Back to severely creepy for a moment: whoa, that Candyman guy needs to be closely watched by local law enforcement; he just oozed 'predator'!) The four grandparents in the same bed together all those years was disturbing? thanks, Mr. Dahl, for yet another grotesque image. I can only imagine what some small children might think of the chubby kid getting stuck in the chocolate pipe, the "funhouse" boat ride, etc., not to mention the scary-looking Oompa Loompas? heck, I'm twice their size and I wouldn't mess with 'em! Of course, any tour that starts with the signing of a waiver immediately indicates how dangerous this tour is going to be, so viewers (not to mention the characters) have been fairly warned. Who even *thought* about waivers in 1971? Almost nobody, right? And was I the only one wondering why minor children were allowed to sign this supposedly legal contract instead of their guardians?(Okay, I'm over-thinking this part, but still? that looked ridiculous.) To those who complain that it didn't follow the book: as I said, I haven't read it, so I can't agree or disagree. But I would point out that the "Wizard of Oz" movie wasn't especially faithful to the book either. (Thank goodness? I couldn't stand the book!) Watchable. Not lousy, not good, but watchable(particularly for Gene Wilder fans).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure movie magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reclusive Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is opening his factory after years of secrecy. It's been a long time since he has used people as workers. Nobody ever goes in and nobody ever comes out of his factory. Then he announces that five golden tickets found in Wonka bars will grant five lucky children and their guardians a tour of the factory. Charlie is a poor boy living in the shadows of the factory. He is lucky to enough to find the final ticket. He brings his grandpa along as each child succumbs to some mishap. They are introduce to wild candy magic and the Oompa-Loompas.This is one of the weirdest and yet mostly fun ride. Gene Wilder is pitch perfect as the outlandish master of ceremony of this unique three ring circus. It has one of the most unique vision. Nothing is crazier than the Oompa-Loompas. The funnier thing about them is that they're not necessary cute. There is something disturbing about them. That goes for the factory in general. There seems to be some danger and magical about everything. It is just pure movie magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks More Realistic Than The 2005 Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to really love Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory as a kid. This movie is a timeless movie that you can frequently find on TV, like ABC Family. It's interesting how a movie where the kids are from the Post World War 2 Baby Boom Generation, can appeal to the kids of the next generations. Comparing this film to the 2005 version, I only saw the 2005 version once. While the 2005 version seems to add more to the book, I liked this one better. I liked the kids better in the 2005 version as they're kids from my generation. However, while watching the 2005 version I felt like it looked less realistic, the chocolate and scenery being from special effects, and the factory in the 2005 version looked so unrealistically huge. Watching this 1971 one, the way they show the factory looks more like a realistic Willy Wonka's factory than the 2005 one, even the scenery around the factory and gadgets. The 2005 one seemed more like entering a fictional virtual world from how I remember it. Also, I think Gene Wilder plays a more realistic version of Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. The characters in this one also seem more realistic than the characters in the 2005 version. This movie often times frequently has references from it, like I frequently see pictures online of Willy Wonka during the Everlasting Gobstopper scene with some message. So, this movie has stood the test of time. While it's been awhile since I've seen it, I still think of it as an enjoyable movie to watch and I feel like everybody deserves to see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl's classic book comic to life on the big screen stars Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe. I remember I used to rent this movie a lot at our local convenient store that rented movies down the road from us as a kid. I was even in a play of the movie in the 3rd Grade, I played a blue Oompa Loompa, but I was really shy back then so I didn't try out for one of the bigger roles.Anyway I still love to watch this movie even today from time to time, and it's still as great as I remember it to be, maybe even better. What I love most about this movie is Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. This is the first Gene Wilder movie that I saw and became a fan of his after watching his performance. He is the best Willy Wonka in my opinion. You never knew what he was thinking or what he was going to do next, in fact, Willy Wonka's first entrance was actually Gene Wilder's idea and the reason he decided to do the movie, which is brilliant. As for the other performances, I thought Peter Ostrum did a great job as Charlie, for this being his first and only film role. Jack Albertson was great as Grandpa Joe as well.The songs I actually don't mind all that much in the movie, and I don't think they are a distraction. I think the songs are catchy and timeless, my favorite song has to be Pure Imagination.My only complaints about this movie are kind of small nitpicks like how they don't talk about that crazy boat ride ever again or how we don't know what happened to the rest of the kids in the end, unless they meant for that to be unexplained.Overall this movie is just classic and very enjoyable with great music, set designs, as well as great performances, and funny moments. I highly recommend this movie to really anybody, it's a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by anyone at any age, this movie is simply pure imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about Pure Imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination" as we are guided through the Wonka Factory by the unpredictable Willy Wonka showing that anything is possible with some imagination. A fantastic family musically film filled with inspiration and imagination that everyone would enjoy even with the dark tone. A wonderful adaptation from Roald Dahl (personally he despise the movie)a great cast, wonderful soundtrack good storyline makes a movie worth watching.Willy Wonka thought off a great marketing ploy by opening his factory to the winners of the 5 golden tickets and a lifetime supply of Wonka bars. Wonkamania begins everybody wanted one,as the golden tickets are found we see that the kids except Charlie won are brats. The second half is about Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory hence the title name.The fine-line of genius and insanity is blurred with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and his only role Peter Ostrum as Charlie the innocent kid. The movie is directed by Mel Staurt and was release back in 1971 so it is a classic and filmed in Technicolor.The entire movie most of the color were muted except the color red a few other color but mostly bright red (Charlie sweater).Not only the characters and the wonderful props but the&nbsp;original musical score brings another aspect to this magical movie. Composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley it was nominated for Best Original Score back in 1972.It is indeed a musical with catchy musical numbers and inspiring songs with a message behind it. Starting with the opening credit to the ending credit an instrumental of Pure Imagination sets the tone.&nbsp; There are some dark tone like the how world obsession with chocolate early on (Wonkamania)and the tunnel scene which Gene Wilder did a great performance that people on the set though he went crazy by being in the tunnel. It seems that Willy Wonka planned on getting rid of the kids throughout the film and what really happen to the kids when they disappeared? Overall a musical about imagination and inspiration with a little bit of insanity making it worth watching many times.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory shows a possibility of joy for a poor boy. So what happen to the boy who suddenly got everything he alway wanted? He lived happily ever after. Take the main lyrics and apply it to life."We are the music maker and we are the dreamers of dream".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood favourite if somewhat unfaithful to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 9 and 10, my favourite author was Roald Dahl and my favourite book of his was 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', which was a good enough reason to see this film. My sister and I watched this film at a male friend's house when we were children, which his parents had taped, and we enjoyed it, albeit having parts from the book that were missing (I slightly prefer the 2005 remake because it is more faithful to the book and is more substantial if darker). I still remember calling out, "Come on Charlie! Will he get the last golden ticket?' just before he finds it when I first saw this film. Fairly recently I picked up the DVD of this Film from B&amp;M Bargains in Newport, South Wales, for ?2.99 while I stayed with my family since it was the only bargain DVD in the shop that appealed to me.The best aspects of this film are the charming and nostalgic musical score, most of the songs being memorable apart from 'Imagination,' despite the end credits rendition of it being harmonious and the dialogue that sticks in my mind and had wit and intelligence in certain parts. Most of the factory's interior is vibrantly coloured but a couple of its visuals are odd such as the chocolate river looking more like muddy water and the everlasting gobstoppers not being round (even the Nostalgia Critic pointed out similar flaws to these when comparing this version to the remake). Further to the songs, the best ones are the jolly 'Candyman,' the beautiful 'Cheer Up, Charlie,' the triumphant, 'I've Got a Golden Ticket,' the weird song Wonka sings during the darkest part of the film (the infamous boat ride), the repetitive yet catchy Oompa Loompa songs and the mesmerising 'I Want It Now!' I also liked the uses of scanimation, possibly during the boat ride scene and the lyrics on screen to the third Oompa Loompa number about spoilt brat Veruca Salt. Like the book, the five golden ticket winners have distinct personalities. Augustus Gloop is greedy, Violet is a talkative show-off, Mike is a comically insulting telly addict and Charlie is ambitious. As for the pace, it was rather swift in spite of a couple of the scenes before the factory being a bit boring and I found the ending a tad rushed and felt that there could have been more to it. Another reason I prefer the remake is because you see the children again after their factory disasters as per the book but here once Augustus got sucked up a pipe, Violet turned into a giant blueberry, Veruca fell down the garbage chute and Mike shrunk, you never see them again once the Oompa Loompas attend to them for treatment. I must say that this film has the better Wonka and Oompa Loompas than the remake, whereas the remake has better visuals and the best story due to its faithfulness to the book.Overall this is a delightful trip down memory lane in spite of certain parts being different from the book. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal favourite movie I watched as a child</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! Childhood memories, they can surely lead you to some gems. I have a couple of movies that I have enjoyed when I was about 7 and now when I'm 17. Out of all of them this is my favourite.I first saw this movie when I was about 5 or 6 years old. I loved it, everything about this movie was magical and charming. I took a look at this movie again and found all these little inside jokes that I NEVER picked up on as a child. One of my favourites that I never picked up on as the innocent 5 year old was this: "This piece of gum is a thee course dinner"."Bull--"."No roast beef but I haven't got it quite right yet".Now when I take a look I really laugh at it. This kind of humour is throughout the movie.So the plot is that Charlie Bucket is a poor child. He likes Wonka candy, which remained locked but still producing candy. Soon Wonka opens his factory for five children, they have to win by getting Golden Tickets. Charlie against all odds (because this is a world where Wonka chocolate is the most important thing - As I said you can't take this movie seriously) wins a Golden Ticket.Now I will devote an entire paragraph to Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. I love his characterization of Wonka. He manages to make a way of being the absolute definitive Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp is a good actor but not only does he overdo the job but he was creepy). He manages to be very eccentric, quirky and... well it's almost indescribable for me (or that might be because I'm writing this at 10:30 at night). I don't think anyone could blend into the role of Wonka as well as Wilder does it. I am not kidding when I say he was robbed of an Oscar nod.So if you haven't seen this movie and enjoy family movies then give this a try. If you have kids then this is definitely a movie to show them instead of something like "Cats and Dogs", "Wreck-It-Ralph", "The Incredibles" or "Shrek" which will most likely age horribly. This however I find timeless.P.S- I might be a little biased as you may have gathered. But I'm sure with your favourite movie from your childhood you would type something similar to this (depending on what movie it is). I just couldn't write something without describing how well it has aged on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four of the adults on an exclusive tour of Mr. Wonka's candy factory practically have to be dragged from one room to the next, endlessly complaining, nitpicking, worrying about safety and contracts and health codes, accusing and threatening their host with lawsuits and bodily harm. Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The "bad eggs" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wilder as the Wonderful Wizard Wonka ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl's classic "Charlie and the Chocolate factory" has always been one of my favorite readings. I discovered the book in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether the Wonka bars or other candies, had the same effect than a Kinder ad.Another aspect of the novel captivated me: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built upon the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light. Which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones through the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments.As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book: finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and their natural craving for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid who sets a positive example to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character either, although the two films didn't give him much depth and substance.Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, but all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct.But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: "Wizard of Oz". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable "Candy Man", Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but "Willy Wonka" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave ? or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book.Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression... soon to be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance.I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was perplex regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults.Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Well, let's just say I still prefer the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as family films go, "Willy Wonka" is indeed a "scrumdidilyumptious" treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no wonder why Mel Stuart's 1971 children's fantasy "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is considered a family favorite. I mean, think about it. What kid wouldn't want to go on a tour of a magical candy factory and get the opportunity to test out the factory's latest inventions? Even if there are some people out there who don't for whatever reasons, this film offers something that is "scrumdidilyumptious" for everybody. Despite the film's title making it sound like it's the story of the candy factory's leader Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), he actually isn't the main character. Our main character instead is Charlie (Peter Ostrum), a young boy who has to take care of his poor family by delivering newspapers in his town. When he hears that Willy Wonka, the world's greatest candy manufacturer, has hidden five golden tickets in five of his candy bars and that the lucky five who find it will be given a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate, his seemingly crushed hopes are restored and he takes part in the worldwide search for these tickets. When he finds one of these golden tickets, he and his beloved Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) join the other lucky four for the tour of a lifetime. The other four kids include one who eats excessively, one who chews gum constantly, one who keeps wanting more and more things, and one who watches television all the time. These other kids are very spoiled to say the least and let's just say they deserve whatever unusual punishment they get from Mr. Wonka and his employees, also known as Oompa-Loompas. One of the aspects about "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" that's always stood out for me, and I assume others as well, is the film's music. Just like some of the best children's musical fantasies out there, this picture is filled with timeless songs, chief among them "The Candy Man", "Pure Imagination", and the Oompa-Loompa songs. These songs written by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse have a wonderful melody and witty lyrics which will definitely help them last a long time. The production design and the way the filmmakers bring this magical factory to life is nothing short of inspiring. Even though a few props like the lollipop-shaped balloons are obviously fake by today's standards, I didn't mind since I still respect the lengths the filmmakers were willing to go with certain visual details of the production. For example, I thought the area with the chocolate waterfall and the candy garden along with Wonka's office where everything is in half were really cool. The acting by the ensemble cast is also worthy of mentioning. The child actors playing the lucky five children who tour Wonka's factory do an exceptional job at bringing these characters to life and convincing me that they really do have these certain qualities and/or extreme tendencies. No other actor but Gene Wilder could have brought the eccentric genius known as Willy Wonka to life any better. The same thing could be said for Jack Albertson's portrayal of Grandpa Joe in terms of convincing me that he's still got it after lying in bed for 20 years. I even liked Roy Kinnear's performance as the father of the kid who always wants more since his character doesn't take his child that seriously and yet he always gets her what she wants. There are a few criticisms about this picture that I need to address. One is in regards to the film's first half which isn't quite as good as the second half. Even though this part of the film is good enough in its own right, I think there was too much time spent on the worldwide hysteria of this golden ticket search. Additionally, considering that this is a kid's flick, I found a few details regarding the ending to be needlessly complicated. Without giving anything away, I felt that there were a few plot details that it didn't prepare us for that well. Here's another thing I need to get off my chest. It isn't regarding the film so much as the audience's reaction to a certain scene in this film. I'm talking about the famous tunnel scene where Wonka and his guests are on a boat and the boat goes through a tunnel with objectionable projected images. This scene is referred to by some as one of the scariest scenes in film history. While I agree that this scene comes out of nowhere and I do believe it's a cool scene, I disagree with the interpretation that this scene is "scary". I personally just think this scene wasn't supposed to be frightening as most people are making it out to be since it felt like the purpose of that scene wasn't necessarily "scaring us". But that's just my personal take on the scene. As for the film as a whole, "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is unquestionably a real treat. For its timeless soundtrack, great ensemble cast, and phenomenal production design, this family film is worthy of repeated multiple viewings. I know I'm personally not done watching it yet after seeing it at least 25 times, and I'll look forward to revisiting it again sometime soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the ultimate kids movies out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all these years, I feel that this movie still hasn't lost any of its charm or power. It's one that should really speak to every kid's imagination and to those who still have a little child hidden somewhere inside of them. And isn't that basically being everybody on this world? I absolutely still have some problems with this movie but I feel that none of this makes this movie any less of a great and fun experience. In essence it's being a very simple and straightforward movie, in which just a whole bunch of random insane and wonderful stuff happens, the moment they step into Willy Wonka's factory. This is a movie that doesn't need to explain anything. It can let things simply happen and it shows that fantasy has no limitations. You could wish whatever you want from and sometimes dreams come true, as happens to little Charlie in this movie.It's a wonderful, imaginative, fantasy movie, that besides is a great looking one. It has wonderful visuals and colors in it and most importantly, it doesn't look fake! It all looks as if it could be part of the real world and it looks as if every machine really works and all the candy is eatable and tastes wonderful as well.It really looks like Gene Wilder had a great time playing his role. He goes all out, without coming across as insane. It probably is a more subtle performance than most people give him credit for. He is a great comedy character, who besides is capable of placing himself in a kid's world and their fantasy. This doesn't feel like a movie written and made by adults for kids but more like one that in fact got made by kids.It's definitely thanks to Roald Dahl's writing, who of course also wrote the book this movie was based on, that this movie comes to life. He manages to put really a lot into the movie its characters and overall atmosphere. It besides provides the movie with some absolutely great dialog and at time it wants to make you rewind the movie, just to check if you really heard things right. But as I said before, it's being still far from a perfect movie, for me. I have always felt and thought that the beginning of the movie goes on for a bit too long and might be a bit too boring, for young kids especially. I also always thought it was strange that the movie never showed what happened to all of the other kids and what happened to Charlie and his family. The ending feels a bit too rushed and also comes far too sudden. There is no real good buildup to it and it might even be a bit confusing to those who aren't familiar with the book.But despite of all these minor issues, this movie remains a perfectly watchable and fun movie to watch for children and those who still are in touch with their inner child, or have a rich imagination.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the 'all-timers' in kids pictures, a happy blending of fun, music and even drama, if seen through the eyes of a youngster. In the days before everything was animated, this picture and "Bugsy Malone" (1976) were favorites of my two oldest children - and let's face it, it's a great premise for a kid's movie. The plot has been rehashed many times on the website, but a story about a man who owns a candy factory? Made to order for the younger set. Personally, I enjoyed the Hoompa-Loompas and their catchy chant.Gene Wilder, who I always think overacts when given the chance, is pitch perfect as Willy Wonka and plays the climactic scene at the end just right. The songs are good and memorable for young minds, as does the moral of the story, which is that greed and selfishness will make you a loser at a candy factory giveaway - or something like that. Incredibly, Tim Burton directed a remake which was inferior to this one - but then, remakes almost always are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A children's classic with a few strange and scary twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It started out as an infomercial, as Quaker Oats wanted to launch a new "Willy Wonka" chocolate bar, which ironically failed. It melted too easily when shipping it to stores! It was produced by a man better known for his low-budget documentaries than movies (David Wolper). That being said, there is very much to like and dislike about this "children's classic movie." It is badly edited for pacing as the first half of it (finding the Golden Tickets) drags on forever. It is not until half-way through that we finally get to the wondrous factory where the second-half is almost "golden"--with a few flaws. The movie was obviously filmed in a foreign country. I always thought it was England, but I believe it was Germany! Flaws: 1. The "chopped chicken head" doesn't belong here even though it is in a nightmarish tunnel scene, along with snakes. Luckily, my kids never ever noticed it, but I always knew it was there. 2. There is a cruel-edge to what becomes of the gum-chewing, TV watching, gluttonous and spoiled children-but no one actually dies. (Whew!) The indoor candy factory sets are wonderful and the glass "Wonkavator" flight ultimately saves the film. 3. Not at all true to Roald Dahl's book, but most adaptations are not, even The Wizard of Oz! 4. Gene Wilder plays Willy Wonka in a rather strange and peculiar way. He shouts too much at Charley while telling him that he loses the contest after tasting "fizzy-lifting" drinks, as the bubble chamber needs to be re-sterilized. Most of the songs are pretty good. I actually like "Come with Me to a World of Pure Imagination" better than "Candy Man". Brilliant songs co-written by Leslie Bricusse ("Oliver"). A very compelling, unusual and strange little children's movie that I thoroughly enjoy, to this day. I don't like the 2005 remake, although Johnny Depp is even creepier as Willy Wonka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Family Film Classic!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and Peter Ostrum star in this 1971 musical fantasy based on Roald Dahl's book, "Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory." Charlie (Ostrum) is a boy who lives with his mother and 2 grandparents. They don't have much and soon notice a contest to meet famous candy man, Willy Wonka (Wilder) and visit his factory. After 4 other bratty kids find Wonka's 4 of the 5 winning golden tickets, Charlie hopes to be the 5th winner and does. He decides to bring his grandpa Joe (Albertson) along with him and they all meet Wonka who gives them a tour of his magical factory where odd things happen. I've liked this film since I was a kid and Wilder is great in it. I recommend this family film classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At any rate, Willy Wonka is a tremendously imaginative and inspiring film. It's a family film, but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes- the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence: 'family' film. On the other hand, this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience, like Cats &amp; Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well, and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids (funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets?) who were at this candy factory, and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory.One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and, even more, the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made, rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films (hey, some of them are really good?). There are, of course, some exceptions, such as 'Cheer up, Charlie,' which I have been fast-forwarding through for as long as I can remember, but for the most part, the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candy-making genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory, but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life ('Anything you want to, do it. Want to change the world, there's nothing to it?'), but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable, such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat (curiously named 'Wonkatania'), which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wilder is sensational as the cheerfully eccentric, enigmatic Willy Wonka, the world's most talented candy maker who invites five lucky children to tour his one of a kind factory. Ostrum is perfect as Charlie Bucket, an indigent but immensely warmhearted young boy fortunate enough to be among the five. Although in the company of a spoiled brat, a greedy glutton, an obnoxious couch potato, and a loudmouthed gum chewer, Charlie never takes for granted the essence of his kind and unselfish heart. Delightful adaptation of Roald Dahl's book is a sweet, funny, good-natured fantasy with an unforgettable cast of characters, imaginative ideas and effects, clever songs, and a credible message about human love and kindness. A warm, winning, and memorable adventure for all ages, one you can easily enjoy again and again. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best children's movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl's classic children's book translates well to the screen, due to a strong cast and clever screenplay adaptation.Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is the greatest candy maker of all time, but he and his candy making operations are shrouded in mystery. Legends about what happens behind the always-locked gates of his factory abound. One day, to everyone's delight, he issues five tickets, hidden in candy wrappers, for a personally guided tour of the factory and "a lifetime supply of chocolate." The early part of the movie, dealing with the world wide scramble for the tickets, is inspired and hilarious. The main characters, a group of children, are introduced one at a time this way. Charly Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is a poor kid who desperately wants to meet Wonka, but despairs more with the news of each found ticket. He's the underdog for the audience to identify with and root for, and you do.The tour of the factory takes up the second half of the story, and provides plenty of laughs and surprise action. Wilder's performance as the colorful and eccentric Wonka is brilliant. He formulates the character to be both scary and funny. The movie benefits from a great assembly of child actors also; each one brought out the spirit and flaws of their characters well. There were also some recognizable faces among the parents who escorted them; notably Nora Denney and Jack Albertson who were great in their supporting roles. You can see why the kids act as they do, as the adults' personalities mirror the children's.You will also meet Wonka's helpers: the Oompa Loompas. They were a great addition, and served a variety of purposes in the story. Their songs were clever, fit the plot, great to sing along to, and just plain fun.It's one of the great children's' movies ever, that has enough going on to engage the interest of adults which makes for fun family viewing. It provides some clever insights about child/parent relationships as well, without bashing you over the head. A true must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory on DVD it is a wonderful movie that takes you away to a wonderful and fantastic place. The factory is every kids dream. And for me Willy Wonka is amazing. Gene plays the character sincerely sweet. He is nice to the kids and unlike Johnny Depp he doesn't make Willy Wonka look stupid in any way. I love the character of Willy Wonka cause of his sweetness and he is such a gentlemen. The story has really good morals behind and it is true to the story. The technology that was used back was pretty good. The sets was amazing especially the chocolate room that was just beautiful. It was also amazing because they the people who made it were on a tight budget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished viewing this movie with my 4 year old daughter, and she loved it! I remember watching this movie over and over as a child growing up in the 70's, and I'm sure my daughter will show it to her children. This movie is truly a classic, with Wilder (a fellow Wisconsinite)giving an amazing performance. I refuse to see the remake because I just don't see how anyone can outdo the original! I find myself agreeing with Wilder's comment regarding the 21st century remake; I also believe the primary motivation behind the remake was money. I realize that this is the entire premise of Hollywood; however, they should learn when to leave well enough alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the first time that I saw this movie was at a drive in theater. My father spent most of the time outside the car with a friend of his drinking beer having never been a fan of fantasy and subsequently reported to my mother that the film was stupid.I, of course, did not find it so. It is one of my most wonderful memories from childhood, and the sheer delight that I get from watching it remains when I watch it even today.I read the "Charlie" books after this, but I have to confess it is the movie that sticks in my head. I will always see Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe. I loved the song "Pure Imagination" and have used it to inspire myself from time to time through out my life. I think this film to a pleasant diversion that everyone should take.</fullReview>

Whoever finds them will be allowed to enter his factory. Amongst the winners is an average boy named Charlie. Charlie and others are led by Willy Wonka through a world of imagination and wonder.This is absolutely one of the greatest children's movies ever created. Not only does it please the eyes with its fantasy world full of imagination and vibrant colors, it contains great songs that you will be singing for a weeks to come. Gene Wilder portrays Willy Wonka brilliantly by being crazy and unpredictable. This is a must see for anyone looking for a movie that is both entertaining and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let's face it, this movie is an out and out classic. I know bad movie reviews are much more fun to read, but I just can't think of any thing bad to say about it. Well, except maybe the special effects, (the elevator-on-a-string) but they did OK considering it was before CGI. It could've been worse. And everything else in it kicks ass!!! Gene Wilder rocks as Willy Wonka, constantly coming out with odd quotes/comments/songs at totally random moments and just generally freaking everyone out. The songs are all brilliant(except maybe "Cheer up Charlie" which is OK in moderation but gets a little tiring after a while)I mean, come on, "Pure Imagination", "I've got a golden ticket" Verruca Salt singing "I want it now", and obviously, "The Candyman". And no matter what anyone says, I love the boat scene. i know the special effects are crap(none of them get splashed, their hair isn't even blown back!) but Gene Wilder's weird spur-of-the-moment song sends shivers down my spine. (He's the best actor EVER!!)Overall, i would say, go buy this classic movie. Now! Go on! You're not gone yet! What are you waiting for? you heard Gene Wilder's in it, right?? GO!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has long been one of my all time favorites when it comes to children movies. The more I think about it, though, the more clear it becomes to think that this movie isn't only for the youngsters, but adults and teenagers alike. The humor that melts off of every single action and event, the zaniness of the story, the setting for which the film takes place in... all of it adds up to a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The book that this movie was based off of, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is also a favorite of mine, if not because Roald Dahl wrote it. That brings me to one of my biggest reasons why this movie was such a hit success: the man truly behind the story was not necessarily the director, but Dahl, who made up from scratch every nook and cranny you see. He also wrote the screenplay, as a matter of fact. From the almost loony Willy Wonka - - played perfectly by none other than the legendary Gene Wilder - - to the chocolate factory itself, it's hard not to take notice and admit that Mr. Dahl played an important role in the movies glory.So let's get down to the meat of the movie, shall we? The lead character of our story is a young boy by the name of Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Peter Ostrum) who lives in a lower-class neighborhood alongside his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) and several other ailing family members. Sweeping into town comes an announcement from behind the doors of a mysterious chocolate factory: five lucky children will have a chance to get a tour of the also mystical Willy Wonka's factory! The chase is on, and all chocolate factories from one end of the street to another are jam-packed of kids wanting to find the lucky golden ticket that holds the "key" to the tour. Before anyone knows what's happened, four kids have got their tickets. Sadly, all of them are spoiled rotten brats. This pattern changes when Charlie finds the final ticket, and he's ecstatic. Bringing along Grandpa Joe, Charlie embarks on the tour with high hopes. What he gets is more than a little unexpected, I'm sure.I can't help but take notice of the amazingly beautiful background that this film is saturated in. Yes, perhaps they are dated, but for a movie that was filmed in the early 1970's, the producers and what not did a superb job of making the whole "fantasy candy land" a reality, and I applaud them sincerely. I actually think it's better that this movie is so old, as it gives it a very surreal aura. I also cannot forget the acting! Throughout the movie I found myself honestly intrigued with every character that was thrown my way. Every actor made their persona as believable as possible, especially Gene Wilder who I have to tip my hat to. I first saw the man in Young Frankenstein, and he never ceases to surprise me with his unbelievable top-botch portrayal of zany characters. His job as Willy Wonka is no exception.Willy Wonka is a part of pop culture, it would seem. It's hard not to notice the effect that it's had on the States. Whether it's constant references to people turning into blueberries, the constant jokes about Oompa Loompa's, the memorable Marilyn Manson video where he imitates one of my favorite scenes in the movie... it all gives more reason to check this movie out. As I said before, this is a total family movie. Not just confined to the age-old "child" or "adult" categories, Willy Wonka crosses the border and becomes a classic that no one will forget any time soon. Check this one out now for good laughs, an intriguingly eccentric story and character line-up, and extraordinary acting to boot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eating loads of candy and singing along with Gene Wilder on drugs seems like a good time to me, and along with other cool features of the film(the sets, midgets, songs, boat ride)I found this movie pretty fun to watch, and decently memorable. The acting isn't that bad, and and the old man that plays the dad or grandpa or whatever, is really funny. That whole song where he forces himself out of bed was really cheesey but really silly, and I love silly stuff. The costumes and and special effects were cool. The scene where the girl turns into a blueberry scared me when I was young, but the bad guy who turns into the good guy was kinda cool.And there is an especially good part when the son and dad must burp to save their lives. It's not a favorite of mine, but it still remains a great movie. *** outta ****</fullReview>

Anyone can relate to this tale of wish fulfillment and human morality, the story of a poor boy who hits the jackpot by "staying the course" and avoiding many traps and temptations that are placed before him.Sure, the production values are dated, and there was really no need to pepper the film with song-and-dance numbers (although a couple of them, such as "Pure Imagination" and the Oompa Loompa chant, have reached legendary status). Nevertheless, WILLY WONKA ranks among the best live-action family films of all time.  </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Allegory in Child-like wonder form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory is a movie that can be viewed on many different levels. Not only is this this a film that still today delights children the world over, it is also an allegorical tale of greed, good deeds and immediate consequences for decisions made.As a child I loved the flights of fancy that created the "Candy Room " and the lickable, flavored wall paper. I used to dream of being the child who won the golden ticket and had the unbelievable chance of a lifetime to own her own candy factory. The darker undertones of excess and greed escaped me, delightfully, for years.As an adult, this film resonates as an allegory for the vices that humans beings toil against daily, whether they be child or adult. It fits into a category of "dark humor" that includes such wickedly delightful films as "Little Shop of Horrors" and the more recent "Heathers". This is a genre of films that tickles the dark underbelly of the brain where we all like to see " those people.... get what's coming to them". The fantastical setting of "Willy Wonka" and other such films is the, only slight, attempt to appease the more delicate sensibilities of those watching the film for mere child like entertainment. In reality, these types of setting are what allow magicians like Gene wilder to create their most irreverent and unforgettable characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how to tell how excited I am now. Dumb-dum-dumbbbbfounded... 173 comments on such well-researched IMDb webpages? Oh, I am so ignorant. Anyway, I should forgive myself because I am not living in the western world. I don't realize that the movie still attracts attention after all those years.The film was produced when I was two. Memory is something interesting, if it does not betray me, I should have seen it in 1975 or 1976 on TV in black and white. At that time, not many Hong Kong Chinese families could afford a colour TV. The Cantonese voice-over was done by a big team of talents voice professionals, one of them, a veteran, is named "Tam Ping Man".Vaguely the show left joyful feeling in my heart, that's the only thing I still keep. I didn't who know who Roald Dahl + Gene Wilder were (even I have watched "The Woman in Red" in 1984, I still didn't remember he was the eccentric owner of the chocolate factory). Then, around 20 years later in 1993, when David Tang of the world famous Shanghai Tang recommended this book for a local radio channel as one of the ten best books of that year, I suddenly recalled some scenes which matched his description. Everything then demystified.What was so powerful about this movie that I, who was only six or seven when I saw it for the first and only time, would keep those scenes in my mind? The success can be attributed to the luck Charlie Bucket got, the magic that his bedded grandparents suddenly could walk, the razzle-dazzle of the happy scenes with somersaults, delicious sweet chocolate and the happy young faces. No one can deny these elements attract not only young hearts but also the mature ones.I don't have any intention to see this old production again yet I am looking forward to the one which scheduled to be released in 2005 bearing exactly the same title of the book. Those were the kid days and it's gone, nostalgia is momentary, pressing forward is eternal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Boy, Rich Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Mel Stuart did an outstanding job of portraying a poor child's everyday life while reaching the realms of fantasy and imagination in the movie `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'(1971). Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), the owner of the chocolate factory, is a very mystifying man who shut down the factory due to paranoia, so the world goes crazy when news goes out that Willy Wonka is opening his chocolate factory to five lucky winners of `golden tickets' that he hid in his Wonka bars. The first four winners just happen to be four spoiled rotten children, but the fifth one is a poor boy named Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum). Charlie doesn't have everything handed to him on a silver platter like the other children in the movie. He has to work to help support his mother and his bed ridden grandparents. Charlie can only take one other person with him to the chocolate factory. He chooses Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). This is an old man who has been confined to his bed for years but when Charlie finds the `golden ticket,' he inexplicably is able to jump up out of bed and sing and dance. Throughout the movie, Slugworth (Gunter Meisner) tries to persuade the children to steal candy from the factory for a monetary reward. Slugworth needs to convince the children to do evil for him in order to profit. Even though the viewer never hears what Slugworth says to the children, an automatic assumption is made that he's up to no good. All of the children, except Charlie, are only worried about themselves. They begin doing things that they are told not to and in the end they get their just reward, but Charlie could quite possibly fall into the same trap. Will Charlie, knowing that this would be a way to provide for his family, surrender his self-respect to Slugworth or will he stick to his morals of what is right and make his family and Willy Wonka proud of him? This is a must see for all people, young and old, who believe that miracles can happen. This movie mixes fantasy with reality, imagination with realization, and good with bad. It's a movie with an underlying meaning that's important to all. And most importantly it's absolutely `scrumpdillyicious.'</fullReview>

They remember the scary boatride, and how incredible the songs were, but Willy Wonka is one of the best examples of stories that can work on more than one level (Simpsons are always the best example). Willy Wonka is a giant allegory for Judeo-Christian thinking. Willy Wonka is a God-like figure, and his giant chocolate factory is supposed to be this universe. Charlie, representing the 'meak' inherits this chocolate factory world with good deeds and pennance, regardless of being tempted by Mr. Wilkinson/Arthur Slugworth. The idea behind Willy Wonka is truly religious and I will explain by showing what the names could mean. Slugworth is supposed to be the devil, but his real name Wilkinson comes from son of 'welkin'. Welkin means the firmament or heaven. Thus Wilkinson/Slugworth is supposed to represent the devil tempting these chilren away from God/Wonka. The amazing thing is that Wonka is the one who actually employees him, just like Judeo-Christian belief about the Devil (Hasatan). Grandpa Joe is a good example of Charlie being a Jesus figure. Where is his dad? The book has a reason, but the movie purposely doesnt, and highlights the fact that Grandpa (Joseph-just like Jesus' 'dad')Joe is his main father figure. This is but a quick look into Wonka, and I could tease more, but I think it is suffice to show how the movie Willy Wonka takes Roal Dahl's great book, and purposely highlights the religious sentiment. Willy Wonka in my opinion is the greatest movie ever made. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark comedy masquerading...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as one of those old 30s children's musicals about candied immigration, is actually a post-modern farce that revels in the bitter apathy of the 70s teenage wastelands.Everyone has a generation they're from. This is the Broadway representation of my generation, the 70s hippies who came of age after the original 60s hippies. Gene Wilder's Wonka adds the perfect smirk for the period. With more than a little bitterness and social conflicts in our laps and without a clue to address the worst of the issues (war, draft, racism etc.), a Let It Be philosophy was embraced. Hence, the birth of the post-modern smirk. This musical semi-farce was a preamble to the comedy farce which I regard as the bible of our (early 70s) generation: Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles, also starring Wilder. When Gene cynically over-amplifies, with that far-away Wonka gleam in his eye, `He's so strict,' that pretty well sums up the tongue in cheek humor of the hyper-liberal early 70s. Wonka's one of my favorite films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was five when I first saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as I'm sure everyone else was. And now, at a ripe old age, I still think it's an enjoyable farce. It's quite obvious that it's dated over the past 30 years. People don't go into a fit of hysteria when they hear that a chocolate factory has re-opened, anymore. But, rather like The Wizard of Oz, the beauty of this film doesn't lie in the script or the acting, but rather in the glorious set designs. Yes, it's quite obvious that much of the `candy' is a bunch of inflatable balloons, but they are a real treat for the eyes. Looking at all the chocolate is also very pleasant. (Mmm chocolate). But, then again if you've turned into a cynical snob, don't bother with this. But I think that Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory is very impressive. It's not groundbreaking, but it's whimsy and enjoyable. And that's good enough. 7.2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for those with an imagination and dreams of riches.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, a terrific children's movie with an original plot. Back when the movie came out, the set looked fine enough for kids to enjoy, but with today's technology some of it does look sort of cheesy and cheap. Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Willy Wonka, the holed up genius responsible for the factory's success. Wonka has personality and charm, but also backbiting humor. He is looking for an unselfish child to run his factory one day. He puts every winning ticket child to the test by inviting them to visit his factory so he can see their true character and motives. He sees right through people's selfish motives and the accidents they cause in his factory are all the children's doings (or undoings).As a child, I didn't pay a lot of attention to the message of the oompa lumpahs and spoiled bratty kids. I wasn't allowed to watch much TV and we didn't have much money so that's probably why I didn't think they were singing to me. Adults will get the message and appreciate it. A movie about good kids finishing first is always uplifting. Many baby boomers and generation x-ers look fondly back on the movie and the effects the fantasy had on their childhood. My boyfriend never saw the movie and I know he wouldn't enjoy it as an adult (he particularly loves car chase movies). It's a movie that's best seen for the first time as a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a very vivid memory of seeing this movie on my 6th birthday in 1971.Like many kids, I enjoyed it for the fact that it was based on candy and showed kids getting their run of a chocolate factory (I even saved up coupons from cereals and got a "Willy Wonka chocolate making kit"). Watching the nasty kids get their just rewards and seeing the good kid win in the end was quite satisfying. Even the so-called scary stuff was fun....it gave you a nice jump during the movie.As I grew up and became more educated, the movie became even more entertaining and enjoyable. I came to appreciate the wit and sarcasm present in Roald Dahl's original book and in the story and performances of the film.An excellent morality tale for people of all ages.P.S. - Why do they always excise "Cheer up Charlie" from the television viewings? This is the most poignant song in the whole file. Thank goodness for unedited DVDs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Treat for the eyes and ears...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Wilder is magically whimsical in this visual and musical tour-de-force, which many have rightly noted may be the high point of his acting career. Make sure you have a good color set, as the factory scenes feature arresting and riotous color changes. You go from the brilliant flora of the candy-making room and the journey of the "Wonkatania" boat ("she's tres jolie") to the starkness of the "candybar TV" studio.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the movie scary or too intense for viewing with my youngsters. You just have to keep things in context and play along with the joke, because, as Willy says at the end, nobody is harmed and they remain their same old selves, selfish or kind, according to their nature. Besides, someone as gentle and kindhearted as WW would not allow ill to befall his guests.I also liked the musical numbers. The Oompah-Loompahs reminded me of the Munchkins (without females, at least as far as we are shown, so how do they keep the line going?) and their memorable lyrics and midget-choreographed routines. Fans will recognize the wonderfully distinctive singing voice of composer Anthony Newley on the opening number (Candy Man), lip-synched nicely by actor Aubrey Woods as Bill the candy store proprietor. And a nod goes to Gene Wilder for his rendition of Pure Imagination, although he struggles to hold the concluding note. But, that's no big deal considering its a comedy actor doing a song.The child actors are quite good, with "Charlie" being the good-hearted poor boy, whose relationship to "Grandpa Joe" is touching. Julie Dawn Cole is perfect as the nasty and selfish spoiled rich kid, and the others delightfully annoying and over-the-top in their own ways ("Mike Teevee", and "Augustus Gloop", come on!).Its a fun film and a visual treat. Give it an airing for a fun couple of hours of distraction and relaxation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If SHE'S a lady, I'M a vernicious kanid!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How well I remember my mom reading `Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory' to me as I lay in bed with bronchitis or pneumonia as a youngster. Some time later, I took the book to school and my teacher (second, third, fourth grade? I can no longer recall which year) read it to the class, bit by bit.When I saw the movie later, it seemed only a natural extension of the book. Both have remained favorites of mine. Although I have not read the book in at least 25 years, the movie is still very enjoyable to me.I won't give a full-fledged review/analysis like I normally do. Suffice to say, it is still a classic. The cast is great, from veterans like Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson and Roy Kinnear, to the interesting group of child actors. Only Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt) would go on to post anything that remotely resembled an acting career. Most never stood in front of a camera again, including the star, Peter Ostrum (Charlie), now a vet. Yet, considering the tragic lives of many child stars, this is certainly no unhappy ending for the kids. They each made their only film appearance a good one. The Oompa Loompas were wonderful and had the best musical numbers in the movie. And, of course, the movie and book taught some lessons to parents and children, such as: don't be greedy, avoid nasty habits, don't spoil your kids, and don't fry your brain watching TV.The choice of Wilder to play Wonka was perfect. With the possible exception of Victor Frankenstein (FRONKenSTEEN), this WAS Wilder's role. He captures all the nuances that come with a Roald Dahl character and is charming in his little asides of Mr. Salt (Kinnear), Mrs. Tevee (Alice Ghostly clone Dodo Denney) and others. The myriad of literary quotes added to Dahl's screenplay later lend a wonderfully detached, Alice in Wonderland feel to the film. When the Dahl in Wonka comes out (in the `cures' for the children who fell into mischief in the factory, etc.), it seems merely an extension of the bizarreness, rather than anything cruel. (Hope that's no spoiler!)Of course the nonsense language-again, a throwback to Alice in Wonderland-helps to promote this surreal feel, too, and results in some cute lines, like Grandpa Joe (Albertson)'s `If SHE'S a lady, I'M a vernicious kanid!'This is another of the great 1960s-early 1970s children's movies. Of course, as I've said in over reviews, I am a child of that era, and probably prejudiced. A child of ANY era (and an child at heart of any age) would love Willy Wonka, though. I hope watching Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory makes you go right out and read this review. WAIT! Strike that! Reverse it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like millions of children I loved this magical film. It is a joy for the young and young and heart. I still enjoy it even as I am fast approaching middle age. It is a wonderful family film. Everything about it is sheer joy from the beautiful songs (especially Pure Imagination, if that song doesn't touch your heart you have none) to the candy garden in the factory. Gene Wilder is wonderful as the magical candyman (Robin Williams could have played this part, I don't know why I am thinking this). Peter Ostrum only made this one film and never acted again,which is a shame because he is wonderfully sweet as Charlie. Jack Albertson was the consummate character actor. He is wonderful as Grandpa Joe. This movie is still as wonderful and good today as in 1971 and that says a lot. BY the way, there is sort of an inside joke in the film most people don't catch. There is a scene where they are talking about a Wonka ticket being found and then the story is a hoax. The picture of the hoaxer on the newspaper is a picture of Martin Bormann. He was one of Hitler's henchmen. He disappeared from Berlin at the end of WWII and was never seen again. By the way, the scene where Grandpa Joe and Charlie drink those fizzy drinks and rise up to the ceiling and then come back down by belching was all wrong, they should have farted instead, it would have been funnier!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory is possibly one of the last pure hearted movies created in our time. So many others are filled with perversion or violence it's difficult for one to simply sit back and enjoy the movie. The film features a small boy who lives in impoverished conditions and because of his deepest desires wins and opportunity to visit the famed `Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory'. The movie points out very valuable lessons for children and adults alike. Avoid the snares of greed and dishonesty. Avoid the mind rotting affects of watching too much television. But of course the most monumental lesson in this movie is that the pure of heart are rewarded in the end.If you haven't seen this movie, I can only ask this one question `What are you waiting for?'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was Gene Wilder's movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the great Jack Nicholson lent a bit of his soul to that hack Stephen King in the "Shining," the wondrous Gene Wilder made a relatively stupid book a damn fine film. As a child, I read most of Dahl's fare and found most of it pretty lame (PARTICULARLY his really stupid sequel to "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," what was it called, "The Great Glass Elevator," or something like that?) The only thing he ever wrote that even remotely creeped me out was "The Magic Finger." He should have written that and only that and then gotten a day job. One of the big laughable things about "Willie Wonka" is the Dickensian thing. When not at home Charlie appears to live in the prosperous 1960's USA. But at home, he appears to live the life of Oliver Twist. His ma took in laundry and stirred it in a large cauldron. They hurt for every penny, ate cabbage soup. Where was DFACS? Did they not get food stamps?And Jack Albertson's character should have been really ashamed of himself. He hadn't been out of bed for twenty years? Once up and about, he seemed quite robust to me. The only thing that makes this movie worth a damn is Gene Wilder. He is a dark master. SPOLIER ALERT!The ending was different also. In the book, Charlie did no wrong. In the movie, he stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks. In the book, Willie Wonka (who had no dark side) suddenly noticed that Charlie was the only one left and declared him the winner. In the movie, he had to pass the final test. (Making the movie superior.)In the movie, the Oompa-Loopmas were orange. In the book they were black. (Making the book racist, but not the movie.) The movie improved upon the book. Roald Dahl was a hack. But at least he had the sense to marry Patricia Neal. As a child, I had a crush on Julie Dawn Cole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So says Aubrey Woods as the world's most psychologically disturbing sweet shop owner.While Roald Dahl is renowned as a fine children's book writer, his screenplay abilities are often overlooked. Possibly the best - certainly one of the most underrated - James Bond films has his name as screenwriter, (You Only Live Twice) and this movie is equally delightful and grand in scale.The first half of the film is a curiously old-fashioned, child-centred piece, where a whole nation of adults alter their lifestyles for a chance to win a "Golden Ticket". "Class dismissed" calls one teacher as he rushes out to buy a potentially winning chocolate bar. Another scene sees a bed-ridden cripple, perhaps slightly offensively, get out of bed and dance after winning a ticket. Good-natured yet packed with racial stereotypes (including greedy Germans, arrogant Americans and Charlie's grandparents who are, for some reason, Jewish) the film can be saccharine-coated but that is all saved by one man: Gene Wilder.Charlie, meanwhile, is the kind of selfless martyr that really deserves a slap, if only to dislodge his halo. (And he's a litter-dropper, too: look at the scene where he inevitably finds the final ticket. Come to that, he's a thief: he finds money yet doesn't hand it in to the police). Things notably improve in the second half, if only the quality of the songs. This is the half where we go from drab to ultra-imaginative, with Wilder's enigmatic ? if disturbingly tactile ? Wonka steals the film. His total sense of disattachment at the various downfalls of the children adds an interesting depth to the character; and a refreshing counterpoint to the somewhat self-righteous attitudes of Charlie, his grandfather and the Oompa-Loompas.Highlights of Wonka's chocolate factory include the "Repulsion" ?style coathangers, candy packed with gelagnite and a man-sized teleporting chocolate bar. For a film that's reaching its thirtieth anniversary these effects still stand up remarkably well. Best though is the social conscience. There's the odd nod towards war and ecology, but what about the Oompa-Loompa song ? the best of six in the film ? where they philosophise over what causes deviant behaviour in children? "You know who's exactly to blame," they conclude, "the mother and the father".As with all works of Dahl, what really makes the film is his wonderful sense of almost malicious perversity. A dark, almost sadistic, air echoes just beneath the surface. Just one question though: has anyone ever got round to reading the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator?</fullReview>

Well, except for the candy, I still have pretty much the same opinion of it as I had then. Now, though, I appreciate it even more, having read the book and grown old enough to understand the more subtle jokes. I also think now that Gene Wilder was a perfect Willy Wonka. He played the perfect weird genius. I can see why people were afraid of it as kids, with all the weird stuff that happened to the bad kids and everything. However, I was raised on Disney movies and the like, not the horror movies "Willy Wonka" has been compared to, and I still liked it, so I wouldn't say it's unsafe for all kids to see. I would recommend that those who were afraid of it as kids see it again now for the good in it they may have missed out on then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie again recently when it was shown at a local theater - and fell in love with it again. However, as an adult, I was surprised to see how sadistic the movie can be - kids die in a number of ways. Nothing violent or gory, mind you - but still unusual for a "children's movie". Comparing it to Seven, as some reviewers have done (kids die for their sins) is a large stretch.That being said, this film is just pure, pre- packaged imagination. It is a visual treat, and Wilder's performance is perfect. As a child I wasnt able to enjoy the bitter sarcasm he presents. He's hysterical! The movie is as magical as I remember it from my childhood.It's a sweet movie both kids and adults will love, for the same and different reasons.</fullReview>

And Charlie's mother was not a washerwoman! As regards her singing, this could have been omitted... The kids, instead, are just as we imagined them: thoroughly disgusting, except hero Charlie of course. Gene Wilder is the perfect Mr Willy Wonka. The Oompah-Loompahs are maybe not quite what we imagined, but they were very effective. Their songs are far more memorable than Mrs Bucket's sloppy effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although thoroughly entertaining and one of my childhood favorites I couldn't rate this movie a ten. A slow first half (I know, build characters) grinds to a halt with the sappy ballad sung to Charlie by Mrs. Bucket. It takes the appearance of Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) to get things moving again but momentum is lost a second time as the movie slows down after the "fizzy lifting drinks" scene. The middle third of the film, though, makes everything forgiveable. In all, a timeless movie to be enjoyed by everyone. Best viewed as a double feature with "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" in an evil-film-disguised-as-a-childrens-movie theme.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roald Dahl is an author many adults find unsettling. They hate the idea of their children reading books in which the grown-ups are so consistently portrayed as stupid, cruel, and out of touch with the really important things in life. His earlier work is a lot less harsh, but the attitude is basically the same: most people are cruel idiots, and the exceptional few who are not are justified in doing what they like to the many who are. Not a nice point of view, but it makes for interesting stories which -- crucially -- place the eccentric characters above the "normal" ones._Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ was a favourite of mine as a child, chiefly for the factory itself, a creation which ranks with Wonderland as a magical realm in which reality is ever-so-slightly skewed. The film is different in many ways to the book -- what film adaptation is not? -- but it has a power all its own, derived from the hallucinogenic imagery and the witty songs as much as from Gene Wilder's absent-minded-professor performance as Wonka. The characters are slightly different, as is the plot, and Dahl reportedly hated the film, but so what? A book is not a film, and vice versa. The film's story and overall tone is faithful to the tone of Dahl's book (and, in some ways, the sequel _Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator_) and it has essentially the same moral: you can't get something for nothing, even by magic, and if you want to get you want it is sometimes necessary to think in spirals.On top of that, the film is never dull, always entertaining. I have watched it as a child and as an adult and enjoyed it more with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>classic, funky modern fairytale and fable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the greatest children's stories are slightly dark and feature a maniacal hero that only kids can accept without applying cynicism. This Roald Dahl story is far less cruel and sadistic than the book, unfortunately, yet still transports you into a magical world of fantasy. Both a modern fairytale and trippy fable, this is a film that I watched on rotation as a child. It both speaks to, and awakens your imagination, and now as a young adult, it is still one of my favourite films, and it's moralistic approach always has me returning the metaphorical everlasting gob-stopper.Made in 1971, this film is definitely a product of its time. Colourful and highly kitsch, I can just imagine a flat of students, sitting down to watch this as a fail-safe cosmic experience. The scene with the hallucinogenic tunnel is scary when you are little, the Ooompa Loompa's, amusing, yet when you get older, they both become equally terrifying and yet incredibly captivating and call out to a part of you that you thought had fallen asleep when you hit puberty.Gene Wilder excels as he plays a pure caricature of an eccentric magician with a sky-high intellect and equally vast plans for his golden ticket winners. This is not an easy task, but is executed with complete style - a totally classic performance. Veruca Salt's dreams of a bean feast are also a delight everytime. Julie Dawn Cole expertly plays the role of psychotic ?exorcist-style' brat from hell with a twinkle in her eye and a sardonic smile. This child of Satan also went on to provide a name for a rather average but fun band, as well as perhaps demonstrating the first signs of dangerous girl power to a generation of Spice Girl parents.Each stage of the film is memorable, playing with your mind and teasing the senses. That is the beauty of this film. Suspend all rationality and ignore the messy confines of logic. Instead, look into yourself and be reminded that the most important thing to be, is a good person. Or something like that. That, and it is always good to eat a lot of artificially coloured confectionery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way kid's movies were meant to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this again on the weekend with my daughter, and it still holds up remarkably well. Gene Wilder is perfect as Wonka, and his one liners are still side-splittingly funny. Some parents get concerned about the message this film sends out to youngsters, but my daughter certainly gets it. Charlie doesn't get away with stealing fizzy lifting drinks, as was suggested by another user, but rather makes up for it by returning the Everlasting Gobstopper, and that's why he gets the factory in the end. The Oompa-Loompa songs still get stuck in your head for days after, and the kids do a very good job of playing kids, who can be, to quote Hobbes, "nasty, brutish, and short." Do yourself a favour and see this movie. I hear a remake is in the pipeline with Nicolas Cage as Wonka. Somebody'd better hurry up and correct this error before principal photography begins; it's not that I have anything against Cage, but he's totally wrong for the part. Better to do a remake that hews more closely to the book and cast someone like Rowan Atkinson as Wonka. He's supposed to be an odd little man, not a brooding action hero. The other frightening possibility is Will Smith, who again is totally wrong for almost the same reason. Unless you're going to do it right, don't bother.</fullReview>

Besides, is there ANY other children's movie where you can witness a chicken's head being chopped off?Now, don't go running into the living room and shut off Junior's videotape! It's fun for the whole family! And what's more, there are literary references that can be explained to the kids and make them more well-rounded!The music numbers are ones you'll remember for a long time, catchy snappy ones written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. "The Candy Man" made Sammy Davis, Jr. famous!If only all kids movies could be this smart, and not play down to kids as if they were drones of society!Gene Wilder ends the movie with his line: Such a good deed in a weary world. My good deed was to write this review, so when you're weary, pop in Willy Wonka. It's a sweet treat without making that trip to the convenience store!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wicked irony, dark humor, and truckloads of wordplay - not things you ordinarily find in children's movies. This film comes about 90% of the way to the sparkle of the book.Roald Dahl's "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was one of those rare pieces of children's literature that didn't pander to its audience - no soft, safe goody-two-shoes story, but rather a rich, wry, giddy whirl, full of barbs and gleeful prankery. The film (retitled for the main character) gets about as close to Dahl's manic irony as a children's movie has ever come or is ever likely to. I can almost picture a young Tim Burton watching it over and over. (For some examples of less-successful stabs at bringing Dahl's children's work to the screen, see "Matilda" and "James and the Giant Peach.")It's too bad they don't make them like this any more. I enjoyed it as a child because it had wit and cunning, and managed to be moral without preaching (which seems to be beyond the capabilities of today's children's filmmakers). I enjoy it even more as an adult just to revel in its delightful edginess and smile at the puns and wordplay.I have this to say to those worrywarts who wring their hands and natter about this film supposedly causing psychological damage to kids: get a life. Children are not fragile little soap bubbles that will burst at the touch of a sharp wit, unless you make them that way. They're people too, and they can appreciate cleverness when they see it. Let them.</fullReview>

Rocky Horror, Star Wars, and Willy Wonka have achieved the cult-following status, which, in my humble opinion, is the highest honor a movie can achieve. Having nation- or world-wide organizations of devoted fans versus a little 1-foot gold naked dude who'll either break or get lost.

To win the tour, you have to find a golden ticket inside your Wonka chocolate wrapper...Sweet, wonderful, imaginative movie with some great moral themes. Good fun for all ages with some subtle yet great profundities and some quite moving moments too. Quite funny at times as well.Good special effects, especially for 1971. The effects and sets do great credit to Dahl's imagination.The creative plot, clever dialogue and great special effects are aided by an excellent performance by Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.

		<fullReview>I would think that children would be more apt to enjoy WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY more than parents or any adult viewer, but the Lesley Bricusse/Anthony Newley score is easy to like and Gene Wilder's central performance as the candy-maker is a pure delight. He obviously got into the spirit of the role and his interaction with the children (mostly obnoxious little brats) is commendable.The sets look luxurious although I suspect that today's use of CGI would even improve on this factor and the color photography in the WideScreen version is a rich palette of mouth watering colors.Somehow I missed seeing this film when it first opened and don't recall what the critical reception was--nor was I aware of all the hoopla regarding its status as a children's classic. Whatever, it seems to merit praise as a modestly successful musical fantasy that has enough wit and charm to make it diverting entertainment. I haven't seen the recent remake with Johnny Depp, so I'll make no comparison.Frank Albertson is especially good as Gramps and Peter Ostrum (as the only likable child in the cast) does a nice job in his only screen role. The antics of the other children are sufficiently objectionable to understand why Willy Wonka disposes of them (and their parents) the way he does. In many ways, the story serves as a cautionary tale for parents and children.The lyrics are clever and the music has a decidedly pleasant way of advancing the plot although I definitely wouldn't call it as memorable as some other children's classics I can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb family movie that's bound to leave viewers in a good mood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first of two big motion picture adaptations of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", one of Roald Dahl's popular children's books. I first saw it during my later childhood years in the late 90's, which was also when I read the book. This was before the second adaptation was made. I went to see that version on the big screen, and by then, it had been years since I had last seen this one, so I didn't know how they compared. It's been a few years since the release of that remake, and I don't think I've seen it since 2006, the year after its theatrical run, but I have finally seen the original "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" for the first time in probably over a decade. I still remembered it clearly, and was well aware of its reputation as a classic family movie, so I was expecting it to be great, and was not disappointed! Charlie Bucket is a poor young boy who lives in a shabby old house with his mother and four bedridden grandparents. His father has passed away. Charlie loves chocolate, but since his family is so poor, he doesn't get to eat it very often. There is a mysterious chocolate factory nearby, owned by a mysterious man named Willy Wonka, where very popular candy comes from. One day, it is announced that the factory owner has sent out five golden tickets, each of which could be found inside any Wonka bar wrapper anywhere in the world! Anyone who gets one of these tickets will win a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate! The first four ticket finders are a German glutton named Augustus Gloop, a dreadfully spoiled English girl named Veruca Salt, an obsessive American gum chewer named Violet Beauregarde, and an American television addict named Mike Teevee. It seems all hope for Charlie getting one of these tickets is lost when news spreads that the fifth one has been found in Paraguay, but this turns out to be a fraud, and just after the boy learns that, he opens the wrapper of a Wonka bar he has purchased with money he found, and inside, finds the last golden ticket! However, on his way home to tell his family the good news, he is stopped by a sinister-looking man who says his name is Arthur Slugworth, the owner of a rival candy company who wants Charlie to bring him a sample of Wonka's Everlasting Gobstopper!I wasn't sure how entertaining it looked like this film was going to turn out to be right at the beginning, with the opening credits showing the process of chocolate making, and then showing a shopkeeper singing "The Candy Man Can" to kids in his candy shop, though this part certainly isn't bad. However, it quickly became very intriguing to me as we see Charlie's loving family for the first time, and basically stayed this way for the rest of the film! Maybe not every scene is that great, but most of them are, and it's a great story with well-crafted characters, including Charlie. They found a good child actor to play him, even though Peter Ostrum never appeared in any other films. Grandpa Joe is another one of these characters, played wonderfully here by Jack Albertson. These are both very likable characters, and their bond helps keep the film steady. The other four main child actors all do a good job as well, playing the poorly behaved kids. Gene Wilder's charming and often humorous portrayal of Willy Wonka is another highlight, and I think it's easy to agree with that! The filming locations in Munich, Germany and the sets made for the chocolate factory scenes are also elements that help make the movie so good. As a musical, the film doesn't overdo it with the songs, which are generally very good songs, even if they're not all equally great.Next year will mark forty years since the original release of this very famous "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" adaptation. And yet, it's still a very popular family movie now, which it certainly deserves to be! Many describe "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" as timeless, and I have to agree with that. Roald Dahl wrote the classic 1964 children's novel AND wrote the screenplay for this 1971 film adaptation, and he certainly did a great job helping to bring one of his imaginative stories to the screen! Director Mel Stuart, the very talented cast, and the rest of the crew obviously helped as well. There's really not much else I can say about this classic family film, and there's probably not a lot I've said about it which nobody else has at some point during the past 39 years. That would likely be the case with any classic movie like this. It's one of those films that can appeal to kids and adults alike, generation after generation!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" was only a modest success at the time of its release but it has since gained cult status through years of TV broadcasts and home video sales. Tim Burton's 2005 remake (titled "Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory", like the book) revisited the source material but I feel that the 1971 adaptation is still the best.Roald Dahl adapted his own novel here and the script also received uncredited work by David Seltzer (best known for "The Omen"). The resulting product is highly imaginative and also shows a slight touch of the darker side of the screenwriters. As a result, the story has the distinct feel of a cautionary tale.The acting is generally good. Gene Wilder gave what is by far the film's best performance in his role as eccentric candy-maker Willy Wonka. Past Oscar winner Jack Albertson lent the film some further credibility. The children's performances are generally good, with some better than others. The remainder of the supporting cast is made up of unfamiliar faces who nevertheless perform admirably.The direction by Mel Stuart isn't particularly impressive but the colourful production design makes up for any deficiencies there. Some of the special effects are a bit crude by today's standards but they get the job done. The film's original songs are all memorable, save for "Cheer Up, Charlie", which I suspect few would miss. The film's score was deservedly nominated for an Oscar (the film's only nomination).In my opinion, "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is a family film that holds appeal for old and young alike. Wilder's Wonka is iconic and the story's deft use of 'pure imagination' makes for an enjoyable ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While some may argue that this version of the story is not as faithful to the Roald Dahl book as Tim Burton's recent remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is still a far better movie.The story of an eccentric candy maker named Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) who has offered a tour of his very secretive factory along with a life time supply of chocolate to anyone that finds one of the 5 golden tickets hidden inside Wonka Chocolate bars.One young boy Charlie Bucket can hardly afford to buy a single bar but dreams of finding one of the tickets and taking his Grampa Joe (Jack Albertson) with him on the tour.The interior of the candy factory though done on a limited budget and without the benefit of modern CGI was and is awe inspiring, particularly for children. Apparently to achieve the look of wonder on the faces of the children they were not shown this set until filming began.One standout aspect of this film was certainly the music, to this day the songs from the film remain captivating. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score. One of songs written for the film was The Candy Man which would become a standard for Sammy Davis Jr.As good as Johnny Depp is as an actor; the role of Willy Wonka was handled more effectively by the very talented Gene Wilder. Unfortunately the Depp portrayal comes across as a bit too creepy.Another aspect of the film where it exceeds the remake is the portrayal of the Oompa Loompa's. Instead of eerie miniature digital recreations of a single actor we have a group of little people including at least one female, and most of whom could not speak English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hugely enjoyable film, based upon the book by Roald Dahl. The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all due respect to the great Johnny Depp. Chocolate Factory was a dud and Johnny Depp is nothing more than Michael Jackson in that film. Sorry Johnny I love you in most of your other movies. In a nutshell, Gene Wilder is the only Willy Wonka that matters. A strong person with vulnerabilities that are better left unrevealed. This film is about virtue, fantasy, and life ... Not necessarily in that order. While it is unfair for me to judge Depp. For hes just following bosses orders. The criticism must stick. Willy Wonka is a movie that disperses lessons as much if not more so than a candyman disperses sweets. The ensemble of music is just so magical. Learning new lessons from the Oompahs with no computer generated oompahs I might add. Yes at times the lessons are corny...but so what. This is a fine movie that makes us realize that riches come from within . Fantasy has never been better. I cringe every time Wilder does that somersault. Despite the fact the Wonka Factory looks eerily like the building used in Hostel , as its torturing headquarters... I still love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This used to be my favorite film when I was in about fourth grade. I loved the book as well, but I enjoyed this film even more. No one element of this film makes it great; it is everything about the movie that makes it so lovable. Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Willy Wonka, going from calm to outraged as well as he later did in "Young Frankenstein." Most of the kids manage to fit their roles well, though some come off as a bit too put on, but that doesn't bother me much here. The original songs are a great idea, especially "Pure Imagination," "The Candy Man," and "Golden Ticket." It was an ingenious idea to turn this great story into a musical. The chocolate room is still an enchanting scene, even though I am grown up now. The scene still makes me want to try all the kinds of candy in the room. Above all, I think it is the lovable, moral story that makes this film so great. This film can teach kids good lessons about selflessness and thinking of others. The ending is perfect and touching. The film remains a real treat for young and old alike. I can't deny it. Absolutely perfect.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How anyone can prefer the new film is beyond me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is in my opinion the greatest musical of all time and I am sure that I am not the only person that thinks this. Pure Imagination is a classic, so is Candyman, cheer up Charlie even I want it now is brilliant. It is wonderful, magical and there is no other film like it, including the new film. I would give the new one 2 out of 10 as it is a disgrace to the old version. Just because Roald Dahl didn't like this film it does not mean he would like that one. Gene Wilders performance is spectacular. This is the classic and it can't be beaten by any crappy performance by any actor no matter how famous. Each song is the equivalent (sorry for spelling!) of the best song in any other musical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very good movie to watch for the whole family. Gene Wilder is a very fantastic actor as Willy Wonka. Jack Ablertson is very good at Grandpa Joe. Peter Ostrum did a wonderful job as Charlie Bucket. The end of the movie was perfect. This movie is about Charlie Bucket was looking for Wonka's Golden Ticket so that he wins and gets to see the Wonka's Factory. Finding the Golden Ticket is to look for any Wonka Bars. There are about 5 Golden Tickets to allow five children to his factory to win. Charlie Bucket won the Golden Ticket. So he runs home and tells the family that Charlie won the golden ticket. But then Slugworth showed up to Charlie to do not forget to find an Everlasting Gobstoper. This movie is the best you will really like this movie and Gene Wilder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Indescribably Delicious Musical Comedy....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WILLIE WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY was the 1971 musical loosely based on Roald Dahl's book CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY that despite its enormous differences from the book, still makes an entertaining musical that continues to entertain new generations of young filmgoers. Gene Wilder turns in a delightful performance as Willie Wonka, a reclusive candy manufacturer who decides to send five golden tickets all over the globe, wrapped inside five of his candy bars, and offers the ticket finders a year's supply of chocolate, a tour of his factory, and a special "surprise" to one of the winners. Peter Ostrum is wonderful as Charlie, the young boy who got his ticket through a miraculous stroke of luck and is accompanied by his grandfather, energetically played by Jack Albertson. The other four ticket holders turn out to be insufferable brats who in varied ways, get what's coming to them. This colorful and imaginative musical is endlessly entertaining, especially for the pre-teen set. The musical score by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse includes the classic "The Candy Man" and "Pure Imagination". In 2005, another adaptation of the story, starring Johnny Depp, materialized that was darker and closer in feeling to the book, but not nearly as entertaining as this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not a big fan of singing and dancing. But this movie brings it out in everyone. After I got the DVD of this film, it quickly became my practice that at the end of a bad week, I'd come home on Friday, put it on, and watch the world's worries leave. I'm a great fan of escapism, and this film is the best thing I've ever found to help me achieve it. No matter what happened that week, on the weekend i can dance all day, whistling away.The scene in this movie that best sums up its effect is "Pure Imagination". Children running everywhere in a room filled with sweets - any child's dream. And that is why this film is so perfect. It shows us all our childhood dreams come true for Charlie, allows for that little while to believe it could happen to us. But more importantly this film, and especially this scene, shows us life through a child's eyes, full of wonder. If that doesn't cheer you up, there is something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable movie for the whole family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tim Burton's recent version of the classic Roald Dahl story may have been more faithful to its source material, but this 1971 musical adaptation of the much loved children's classic, directed by Mel Stuart, is still well worth watching as it manages to accurately capture the feel of the book and is a whole heap of fun.Gene Wilder plays eccentric sweet-maker Willy Wonka, who allows five children to tour his amazing factory after they find lucky golden tickets hidden in winning bars of Wonka chocolate. Of the five, only Charlie Bucket is truly deserving of such an honour and, as the tour progresses, the other children suffer from a series of bizarre mishaps.This movie is a colourful, candy coated treat with a deliciously dark comical centre. Wilder is excellent as the slightly sinister recluse who welcomes the (mostly) obnoxious children and their equally awful parents into his world. His factory is a brilliantly realised surreal wonderland and is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach!). The music, for the most part, is pretty memorable with standout tunes being 'I've got a golden ticket' and the Oompa Loompa songs.The wonderfully bizarre characters are all perfectly realised by the talented cast, from poor little Charlie (Peter Ostrum) to the spoilt kids (in particular, the brilliantly brattish Julie Dawn Cole as Veruca Salt) and their parents (including the great Roy Kinnear).My only gripe with the movie is when it strays too far from the original story. I'd have loved to have seen the squirrel room from the book, rather than the geese, but I guess that this was probably too hard to translate to the screen in 1971 (however, this scene does appear in the recent Burton movie). I also disliked the introduction of Slugworth and the whole everlasting gob-stopper 'test'. In the book, I always thought that the children were being tested as soon as they entered the factory, and that when they broke the rules, they had failed that test. In the book, Charlie abides by the rules and becomes the deserving winner, but in this telling, Grandpa Joe and Charlie also break Wonka's rules by stealing the lemonade. Why were they spared the kind of nasty fate suffered by the other rule-breakers? Had Wonka already made his mind up to choose Charlie at the start?If you haven't read the book (or as not as much of a purist as I am when it comes to adaptations), you will adore this film. Although not perfect, I think it is a very good movie which will appeal to adults and children alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>simply awesome, Wilder's apotheosis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People are fond of saying "the book was better," particularly when they haven't read it but strive to sound erudite. In this case, it's true: by providing more detailed anecdotes expressive of Willy Wonka's encyclopedic knowledge base and earth-shattering sense of humor, the book scores eleven whilst the movie scored only ten. We all know how talented Wilder is--particularly, when he writes, not only when he acts, witness the astonishing creativity of "Young Frankenstein." This movie provided a vehicle for Wilder to sing, dance, jest, wisecrack, and even display the rare dramatic moment, typically centered around the emotion of love (even when seemingly busting on some child's self-imposed torment, e.g., blowing up like a blueberry or being micro-miniaturized during electromagnetic transport). Even Jack Albertson got a chance to sing and dance, but--as you may not have been aware--there was a time when a (young) Jack Albertson was nationally renowned as a soft-shoe dancer and vaudevillian. I frankly think that Charlie could have been better cast in a less humdrum figure than Peter Ostrum: certainly, he did not rise to the level of brilliant characterization that we discern in, say, Mike Teevee or Veruca Salt (BTW, quite apropos, as 'verruca' is Latin for 'wart'). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Plus, the occasional quotes from classic English writers are immortal: "We are the music-makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams," or perhaps, "Where is fancy bred? // In the heart, or in the head?" Bravo, Gene!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has been a favourite of mine since i was a kid. I enjoy this movie because it brings out the child in all of us, and you really want to be apart of it all, no matter how old you are. This movie is about a poor child named Charlie Bucket that wants nothing more in the world than to find a golden ticket and have the chance to go to Willy Wonkas chocolate factory. Something that a poor child would not get to experience under normal circumstances. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. Even if it doesn't interest you, and you've never seen it, i think you should watch it at least once, then you can make the decision whether it will become one of YOUR favourites or not!!! :) :) :)</fullReview>

Although when it does come on TV we will still rush to watch it anyway!!! For it's time it is so cleverly filmed and the songs i.e. The Candyman are catchy songs that you remember - they make you feel happy!My daughter's favourite bit is when the Oopma Loompas come on! She absolutely loves them and goes around singing "Oompa Oompa ooobidy Odo I've got another puzzle for you"! The film is almost 30 years before my daughter's time and yet she and her friends find this lovely film as magical as my generation did. It isn't dated and the colours in it are amazing!I have always loved Gene Wilder in all of his films and believe that he is truly brilliant as the wonderful 'Willy Wonka'!It is a wonderful feel good film that you can enjoy with all the family and I would recommend it on behalf of myself and my daughter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In defense of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Tim Burton has claimed that his remake is closer to the book, it is purely superficial. Mel Stuart did add some original songs, changed the title, and swapped the nut room for the room with the golden geese, but the integrity and heart is intact. (granted that Burton did add his own subplot about wonka's childhood) Roald Dahl's books are not simply dark fantasies or absurdist romps, but are moreover sensitive and warm in a rather odd way. Dahl's conception of Willy Wonka is more reflected by Gene Wilder, who grounds himself in both worlds of fantasy and reality and moreover is warm, caring and somewhat aloof. This is something that Depp couldn't channel in his interpretation, and actually helps to cause Burton's film a breakdown. There is a quality to the original that cannot be reproduced. It is a far simpler film that doesn't try to be high and mighty. The acting is superb, the effects are simple nearly seamless, and the screenplay is dead on. This film has attained the status of a classic without trying very hard, and will not be forgotten. It needs no on screen antecedents, and I feel that the remake was made more or less to cash in on Burton's swiftly declining originality, and the fruits of the box office. Simply put, the original is far more genuine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I say, the book is always superior to its film. In this case, my philosophy proves correct. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory was a brilliant book with great characters. Willy Wonka, was personally my favourite character. He had an evil, twisted side to him. Quite cynical at times, and a very sadistic individual. "My chocolate! My chocolate! Look what this child has done to my chocolate!" Wonka shouted, as one of his guests began to drown in a pool of chocolate sauce.In the film, he proves very similar. Gene Wilder is the best part of the film, and there's no doubt about it. And there's no doubt that Charlie deserves a candy cane through the head. The film has bad actors (overall), a decent array of script and effect and um-pa f*****g lump-as. The um-pa lump-as ruin many aspects of the film, and everything seems too childish all the way through. The glittery music and bright presentation didn't impress Roald Dahl, and it didn't impress me.If you were to class this as a kid's movie (As it is) you'd rate this well and give it to your children for their enjoyment. But, don't expect too much. Wait until Tim Burton's adaptation is shown in the cinemas, and then make up your mind what's better.For other alternatives, I'd recommend something like Toy Story or the Lion King for your kids.</fullReview>

Was it really a stretch for George C. Scott? He really came across as an innocent, wanting a better life for his family. If Haley Joel Osment could be nominated for the Sixth Sense (yes he was very good), so should Peter. Can anyone say Honorary Oscar? I think it may be time we got a grass roots movement together to get this guy some kind of recognition for his acting. My particular favorite, and most touching moment is when he and his grandfather open the candy bar while everyone is sleeping, no golden ticket. His response..."I bet it makes the chocolate taste terrible"...Remember this was his first and ONLY movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On adaptations, the creative process and individual tastes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there will be a discussion of the film, this will mostly cover other points that bear on the creative process in general and Roald Dahl in particular and related observations. Abandon all hope ye who enter this comment.WWAtCF is a reasonably good film, with weak spots, to be sure, but Gene Wilder does a great job and delivers some rather acid lines. The script is decent, even good in spots. Not a great movie, but not future guitar picks either. Has more than a few moments. Enjoyable, but has somewhat sharp teeth in spots. End of film review.Now as to film adaptations of work done in other mediums. Gather 'round, children, as the next few points are moderately significant: One: a film and a book are different critters. They have different requirements, strengths and weaknesses and some of these are almost diametrically in opposition. Thus, an adaptation (in either direction) HAS to be different. Both can be good, bad or mediocre. But anyone expecting them to be the SAME is mistaken, as they can't be.Two: any work that is released into the wider world and is intended for an audience has two sensibilities involved-the creator(s) and the audience. Every person reading, hearing and/or viewing anything brings themselves to the table. You bring your own viewpoint into the equation. Who you are has a great deal to do with how you see things. Bear this in mind when reading anyone's opinions (including mine). Most commentary says as much (often more) about the commentator as it does the purported subject. In other words, you see what you largely expect to see.Now, as to Roald Dahl: from all reports, Dahl was less than enthralled with the adaptation. I suspect that it's because Dahl's work had teeth to it, generally speaking, and the incisors here have been blunted and softened a bit. I read an interview a good many years ago and came away with the impression that Mr. Dahl thought much more highly of children than he did most adults, whom he viewed as incompetent at best and malign at worst, particularly most parents or surrogate parents. The core of this runs through his work. The hardest job anyone can have is that of parent, the entrance exam to become one is all too easy, the effects (good and bad) are far-reaching and too many people botch it up in spades. Watch Willie Wonka again or read Dahl's book. One other thing: when viewing, hearing or reading something, think about your reactions. Everyone has hot buttons. It might help if you can recognize what yours are. After all, it's only a movie, isn't it, now?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka is perhaps the epitome of family entertainment, full of fantasy, music, humor, morals, and plenty of scrumdidleyumptious fun! It was passed over when it was released in 1971, but showing it on television and releasing it into the home video market transformed it into one of the greatest family classics of all time.Gene Wilder, in his prime, plays the delightfully eccentric Wonka, who invites five children to visit his whimsical candy factory. But the adventure seems to be more of a test of everyone's fundamental honesty, and one by one, the children are eliminated from the tour, due to their odious behavior, until only the truly honest one remains.The movie boasts some wonderfully whimsical sets, and is brought to life by a host of marvelous performers, including character actors Jack Albertson and Roy Kinnear, not to mention the marvelous child actors (Julie Dawn Cole, who plays the fuming Veruca Salt, is so convincing, it's scary). Even the bit parts are classic, namely David Battley as the hilariously nonsensical school teacher. And the songs, written partly by Anthony Newley, are beautiful and reflect the fanciful mood of the picture.This is a classic in its greatest form, where honesty is rewarded, bad behavior is punished, and a golden ticket makes a golden day!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having just seen this film again tonight on ABC I must utter that most hackneyed of phrases: "they don't make movies like this anymore."This movie speaks to children as well as the kid inside every adult. It doesn't talk down to kids and isn't afraid to be even a little frightening at times. Everything in the movie seems perfect: the script, the set, the songs, Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson, even the child actors. Only a jaded adult without an imagination would not enjoy this movie.And another thing. This is a story that isn't afraid to moralize a little. As Gene Wilder says in the documentary, the movie tells kids that there are limits, which is what they want and need.One gets the feeling that this movie was lovingly made. If you haven't viewed this movie in a while (or ever), do so. The DVD is an excellent transfer as well and looks every bit as good as the High Definition broadcast on Disney (ABC) I just saw. It is worth buying, even if you don't have kids.</fullReview>

A delicious touch of early 70's psychedelia adds a lot to the film (especially for adults) and there is a strange emotional depth to it all that can really frighten, astound or delight. "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is one of those film rarities that comes along only about every 25 years or so, maybe less often -- with something for literally everyone, yet manages not to lose the magic. And now it can be enjoyed on DVD with a truly wonderful (in fact astoundingly good) restoration.Now, everything else has already been said by someone, except this: *Why* do so many people hate and/or skip over the "Cheer Up Charlie" song? I think it's as good a song as any other in the film, and I really like the melody especially (needless to say, I don't skip it over). Any psychologists out there who can answer?10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a classic. Based on the **excellent** book by Roald Dahl, it truly captures the essence of Willy Wonka's fantastic world. Five children are chosen to have a tour of his chocolate factory. One will be rewarded beyond his or her dreams. It's not hard to choose who it will be, but the point of the film isn't "Who gets the prize?", it's "This is amazing!" Gene Wilder is a perfect Wonka - charming, bizarre, and more than a little creepy. The boat ride juxtapositioned against the sweet candy-floss factory was a stroke of genius. The songs are enjoyable and easy to whistle, but the true talent is in the dialogue. Peppered with litery references and a beautifully terrifying poem on the boat, the guest's bewilderment and Wonka's cool control, wit, and occaisional non-sequiter comment are delightful to listen to. This is a masterpiece for all generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a crazy movie with even crazier characters. And that alone makes it more realistic than most of us realize. We all have some aspect of each of these characters inside us. Both the greedy kids and their equally greedy parents are unfortunately just like us. However, there is hope for our world because inside each of us is a bit of the virtuous Charlie, struggling to succeed.But Willy Wonka is the truly magical character of this movie. He has the creative mind and flamboyant nature that we all have, but rarely show. He lives in a paradise of his own creation. He lets his imagination and desires dictate what he does, without succumbing to the sin of greed.But this is all subtly delivered to you. You don't have to analyze this movie to enjoy it. You have so many fantastic characters that parallel the school teachers, news reporters, psychologists, and scientists of the world to laugh at again and again.It's a movie of two halves: The first is the outside world where five golden tickets are found. The second is the fantasy world of the Chocolate Factory where imagination comes to life. What this movie does so well is combine the two worlds, suggesting we add more fantasy and creativity to our repetitve and greedy everyday lives. Use your mind to warm the world up, so you can get out of bed without worrying about a cold floor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A romp that's a quirky 70's picture of childhood innocence, it ends with a position gently anticipating adulthood and responsibility. Although uneven (the trollish Oompa Loompas are truly demented), Gene Wilder plays the center of a whirlwind of activity, an anchoring performance of a style one wishes more writers would write for him - or anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are alot of reviews telling you about this movie, so I am not going to do that. I am just going to say that this movie was released the year I was born, and 30 years later, it still is timely. The morals of this story hold even in 2001, and will in 2071. If you for some reason did not see this movie, I urge you to do so. It is such a pleasure to watch. It really is a great movie. Children and adults alike will enjoy it. The music is good, too; who can't help but sing along with the oompa-loompas!!! I own the soundtrack, VHS tape, DVD, and probably will end up getting the special edition 30th anniversary DVD also. This movie airs plenty on the Fox Family Network so if you are a bit weary over a certain part of the movie (which other reviews have touched upon) you can catch it on there since they cut out that scene completely, which is a shame because it really is a good scene. Creepy yes, but me as a child was not affected by it and believe me I am the worst when it comes to that kind of stuff. In fact, I never even noticed it til I was much older, and saw it 100 times (no exaggeration). Children will most likely be so absorbed in Gene Wilder's singing and the effects of the scene than the actual stuff going on in the background, but if you haven't seen it yet you can always watch it first. I highly recommend viewing. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastical books, particularly children's books, can be daunting to show on the big screen. This film is so well done, that any plot divergences can be overlooked when the overall effect is so magnificent, as it is here. Considering that beyond Gene Wilder and Roy Kinnear, this is a cast of little-knowns, it shows what a great script can do for any cast, given the belief in it. The designs are superb, both inside and outside the factory, there is almost every kind of comedy, from verbal to visual, and the dramatic device involving deception (and a certain sweet) is almost secondary to the wild adventure which Charlie Bucket undergoes. I thoroughly enjoyed this film as a child, and as an adult, it loses none of its charm. Also, the ending is not disappointing. Which perhaps means that it is a fairytale after all.</fullReview>

I own it on video today. d) The Wonka chocolate brand still exists in this, the most cutthroat consumer market ever (2001) and if that's not a testament to the staying power of a movie, I don't know what is.And now, I'll get down off my soap box.

		<shortDescription>My favorite movie of all time, forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This winter I went into a wave of nostalgia, and Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory was the biggest thing from my childhood that I remembered and loved. This is undoubtably my most favorite movie of all time, forever. Despite all of the shallow comments by some saying this movie is 'horrible' and 'disturbing' I grew up on this movie and loved it. So did my friends, and my family. To this day if I go out and wear my shirt that has the Wonka logo on it (yes, there is one ^_^) I get a barrage of comments on how that's their favorite childhood movie. It remains a treasured childhood memory to this day for me as well. As a child, I was captivated by it's colorfulness, the thought of so much candy, and by the humorous characters. Today, I'm captivated by it's true depth and moral meaning, and the depth of the characters. The kids are hilarious because we can all relate to their faults and hate brats. Charlie is wonderful because we always root for the underdog. The Oompa Loompas are a subltly humorous and wise touch, and my all-time favorite, Willy Wonka, is a mix of charming and eccentric, funny yet sarcastic, and gentle yet harshly wise. To this day he remains my favorite and most inspirational movie character. Gene Wilder did a completely fantastic job as the eccentric candyman- they couldn't have picked a better person to display Wonka's wonderful wackiness. ("If the good Lord had intended us to walk, he wouldn't have invented roller skates!")All in all, definitely give this movie a try. I wholeheartedly agree with someone who wrote not to listen to the people who say this movie is 'bad' or 'disturbing.' I'm not bashing those who don't like the movie, but those who make ridiculous assumptions about it. This movie, despite it's little bits of intenseness does teach an important lesson on where greed will get you and what a kind-heart will ultimately win you- you just can't be too shallow with it or you'll miss it. (And no, the children don't die when they fall into their own traps. At the end Wonka assures Charlie that they'll be perfectly restored to their old selves, but perhaps a bit 'wiser for the wear.') When you watch, don't think too hard or criticize, just sit back and enjoy a trip through Pure Imagination!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing I really dislike about this film is the saccharinity - Charlie, Grandpa and the rest of his family combined with the whole 'perfect poor kid gets lucky' scenario. Oh, and some of the naffer musical numbers.But, I realise that without this, they would never have got away with making the film. Look deeper, and you see the dark, satirical, hallucogenic fantasy world with no small amount of social commentary, a healthy dose of cynicism and - it has to be said - overtones of paedophilia, almost in the same vein as William Blake's Innocence/Experience poems.This will easily delight an audience of children or the elderly, and will hold their attention but the rest of us can see beyond the healthy family stuff, and watch this film for sheer escapsism value.Notice for example Gene Wilder's portrayal of the eccentric recluse - the beguiling stranger that kids are told never to talk to - and Julie Dawn Cole as spoiled brat verging on seductress. It's not just about interpretation either, I'm sure the film-makers knew exactly what they were doing.The morality tale that was at the core of Roald Dahl's novel is merely there to take the curse of an experimental and enjoyable film: take from it what you will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You either got to love this movie or hate it, but I think the ones who love it out-number the ones who hate it. I have read several people critique this movie for being scary and showing kids getting hurt, but don't forget, those were nasty little monsters who got their "just desserts." Did you ever notice that Wonka knew specifically where to find traps for these kids. I especially got to feel for Veruca Salt [more the actress Julie Dawn Cole than the role]; I had such a crush on her when I was a kid because she was so cute. Today, I bet she's got to look like Emma Samms. Nowadays, the movie is less of a kid's flick to me and more of a satire on commercialism and consumerism. There are several other idiosyncrasies in this plot: How did Slugworth know where to find the kids that would get the tickets ahead of time ? He's already on the scene just as Charlie and Veruca get theirs, did he set them up? If Mike Teavee watches as much TV as he seems, how did he manage to get a ticket in the first place ? Why didn't at least one adult not get one ticket when they could have refused to give their kids their allowances ?How did the computer programmer program his computer by just punching the same two buttons over and over ad infinitum ? And why are several of the back characters and the Oompahs not identified in the credits ? Still, this is one chocolate factory I'd love to visit, but for a chance to enter the candyland room. Don't forget your imaginations !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is my favorite movie of all time! It was the first VHS tape that I purchased for myself and will be the first DVD I buy in a few weeks. But enough about me... This movie has everything you could ask for in a clean, family movie. It has hilarious comedy, a suspenseful storyline (though almost everyone knows what will happen), great special effects (for 1971), well-developed, unique characters, and of course, a story that any sweet-toothed viewer can relate to. This movie is perfect for viewers of all ages. I've watched it with wide-eyed 5-year olds, perverted teenagers (they love the Oompa Loompa scenes and the boat ride), adults, and the elderly, and all of them enjoy the flick. It is truly a classic movie, despite being underappreciated at the time of its release. Grab a handful of Gobstoppers and sit down to enjoy Willy Wonka!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does'nt even deserved to be called as low as a movie. Yeah, him trying to find the ticket might be a somewhat tedious process, but the changing of scenes here and there keep you going, wanting to see more. And it starts out with a great song, and a great actor, and an overall great scene. It starts off as a masterpiece, and just when you think it might be dragging along...BOOM! Out comes another great song/scene.Then, the Chocolate Factory itself...Let you imagination run wild! "Surprises around every corner but nothing dangerous!". The cast, man. A great cast if ever one has seen one. They all fit their part perfectly. Violet was the least believable one, but even she was TOTALLY believable. Get my point? The song, the very first song sung by Willy Wonka, has to be the greatest movie song ever, and be the greatest scene ever, esp. what he does at the end of it. It's so cool, and you never expect it. Any of it, through out the whole movie. The monologue/song in the boat, the umpa loompas, the many, MANY changing expressions of Willy Wonka. Man. Gene Wilder was so great in this movie, words cannot describe him. Want to just forget about everything? Forget about your worries, your doubts(were have I heard that before), your fears? Just let it all go? Then watch this movie. Imagination can be a one's greatest tool in this fight called life, and it comes in one form "Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory".Describing how great this movie is and why would take forever. Just rest assured that if you ever hear about this movie coming on the TV or see it at a video store, that you can watch it, and then want to watch it again...and again...and again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very amused by the comments about how this movie is too dark/sadistic for kids, and saddened (as another person was) that a movie like this would not be made these days (and would certainly not receive a G rating, if it was). Nowadays, kids have to be shielded from this evil, dark, horrible world... at least until they reach elementary school age and find out where their parents hide their gun, so they can bring it along to school with them to make sure the drug deals go down the way they're supposed to, or that another kid with a bigger gun doesn't kill them first. Oh, and these poor, poor kids that were "traumatized" by this wonderful movie as a child... I'm literally rolling on the floor laughing with amusement. This movie illustrates just how much society has deteriorated since the early 1970's, how people are all too ready to run, to hide, to shield their children from the real world and instill their own fears into their kids, fears of reality. And the moral lessons... oh, the horror! HOW could such a horrible movie like this exist? After all, everyone knows that morality is relative, right? What a destructive film! Better to send Junior to his/her room, where they can take some bong tokes and get on the Internet and get to the sex sites fast!Suffice it to say, I've loved this movie since childhood, and everything in it brings back my childhood like it never left (some of the songs even bring tears to my eyes). I really have to wonder, will seeing "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" again do the same thing for our kids 30 years from now?Tim, born in 1964 and feeling lucky he was...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this in 5th grade. I thought it was a fun show. But, last night, I saw it again on TV for the first time in 5 years. Now that I'm older, I see that the "children's" movie has some devilish hints to it. Such quotes as "Candy is Dandy, but Liquor is Quicker" and "Well, the furnace only lights every other day, so they might survive"made me wonder if Willy Wonka *really* liked kids. Personally, I didn't like the Oompa Loompas either. THEIR basic message is that if children don't behave, they should be disposed of. Now, isn't that a bit mean-spirited for this kind of movie? What's going on here? Makes you wonder just what happened to all those children taken away by the Oompa Loompas. Maybe that's just Gene Wilder humor, but if it is, then he shouldn't have been cast for this innocent, child-loving role. No matter. Despite all this, it's a fun movie and I liked the Grandpa.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. I do know that my sister and I watched this so many times as kids that we must've worn out the VHS tape we had of it. There are just so many funny moments in this. The scenes with Mr. Turkentine are some of my favorites. This was a particularly good piece of writing. The scenes where the rush is on to get Wonka Bars are great too. Especially where the lady has to think about whether or not to give up a case of Wonka Bars to save her husband's life. The kids were all good in this, the parents were all good in this but the real shining star would have to be Gene Wilder. I'm a fan of all his movies but this performance was exquisite. His sarcasm humor, his wacky behavior and his one-liners are funny even by today's standards. Having seen the 2005 remake, there is absolutely no comparison. This is a clear case where the original is FAR superior to the remake. Favorite lines would have to be "Speak a little louder, I'm a trifle deaf in one ear" and of course (the rebuttal to spitting being a dirty habit) "I can think of a worse one". Combine that to all of the scenes (no exception) where the kids do something stupid in the factory that results in the consequences we all remember. "Don't, Stop, Come Back!" "Always when they get to the desert" That's Funny! This holds up today as a good one. The Oompa Loompas were good too. I'm amazed at how well they were able to coordinate seeing as how many of them spoke different languages, very impressive!Like everything that Gene Wilder plays a leading character in, he really embodies this one. You can watch this one over and over and you have to admit that he really nailed that one. Perfect 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's always something magical about going to grandma's house. So many leftovers from when your parents were your age to explore. My grandmother had two videos from that time I would watch over and over with my sister whenever we came to visit- Willy Wonka was one. Everything about the movie oozes, pops, and dazzles with charm. And the greatest thing is, it only gets more hilarious as I get older.I remember how incredibly bad I wanted to win a golden ticket and make my way into that goodie-filled candy factory. Each scene was decadent and filled with as much eye-candy as real candy in a way only the 60's and 70's could do it. I loved the songs because they weren't sung by singers. Yes, they weren't all that great, but that's what was so amazing. Real human voices that didn't come out of the synthetic can. Plus, they didn't make me sound like crap when I joined in. I also like that none of these people (excluding Gene Wilder) are very well known. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen any of them outside this film. It helps make the characters all the more real.The humor is amazing in the film, and it works on so many levels! I used to think this movie was hilarious because of all the silly situations, but now I listen to what Willy Wonka is actually saying, and I can hardly stop laughing. Its genius.As I said earlier, the cast was really genuine and great, but the absolute gem of the film is without a doubt Gene Wilder. He IS Willy Wonka. Wild, fun, just a tinge of darkness, and INSANE. No matter what film I see him in, I always first think Willy Wonka. His every nuance is perfection. On the basis of seeing him alone, I'd recommend this to anyone.</fullReview>

If Grandpa joe could sing and dance, he definitely could have helped the mom with her chores. Charlie was a selfish little brat for inviting grandpa joe and neglecting his mother. Just goes to show that even little angel, Charlie, thought that a woman belonged in the home. If I were Mrs. Bucket, I never would have forgiven charlie for the choice he made, and I always would have despised grandpa joe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastical children's classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory was the first feature length film adapted from one of Roald Dahl's books. Since it's release in 1971, it's become a cult classic, and is widely appreciated by children and adults alike.It is also a film I've studied in great detail. Observed from every angle. I'm not really sure why. It's almost as if there' a mystery at the heart of it I want to crack. Why is it so popular? Why does it seem so effortlessly enjoyable? Roald Dahl officially hated the film when it was finished. He thought it strayed too far from the book and was not menacing enough. Personally I disagree. I think it recaptures perfectly what made the book so engaging. Granted it didn't need to alter the title, but it's still a fantastic yarn and continues to entertain even today.The film made the wise choice of properly introducing the character of Willy Wonka at least 40 minutes in. Which is also when we see the Chocolate Factory itself. It builds the anticipation steadily. Beforehand, we meet the plucky young Charlie (Peter Ostrum), and the rest of his obnoxious companions who all gradually find the five Golden Tickets.There are quite a few people who think Willy Wonka is slow to start. I've never felt that way. I enjoy every scene before we get to the factory. There are some marvellously funny sequences, such as Charlie's pompous schoolteacher, Veruca's hilarious petulance, and the reactions of people going mad searching for the Golden Tickets. There is a hidden subtext here about the greed that overwhelms people, and Charlie gets a Ticket without really looking. Because he truly deserves one, where these other people don't.The film also benefits from excellent direction from Mel Stuart. We meet each one of the horrible children in brief vignettes, and we already learn enough about them to side with Charlie, and pray they'll get what they deserve. The one major difference between the film and the book is an added subplot concerning the Everlasting Gobstopper. A rival of Wonka's, Slugworth, approaches each one of the children, and offers large sums of money in exchange for the secret recipe. I thought this was a nice touch because it adds a little ambiguity to Charlie's character, and is a departure from his squeaky clean image in the book.It's at this point we meet the person everyone has been dying to see. Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder was an interesting choice, and proves to be a total revelation. Wilder is not always one of the easiest actors in the world to watch, because of his annoying habit of screaming things out endlessly. But from his memorable first appearance walking slowly with a limp to doing a somersault, his dynamic energy is instantly engaging because it's so carefully precise. And when he does go over the top, it's entirely in character. Willy Wonka still remains Gene Wilder's finest hour.In regards to the chocolate factory, I still believe it's an astonishing array of colourful dimensions, bizarre confections and beautiful sights. There's everything here from chocolate waterfalls, candy striped meadows and sweet inventing rooms. All populated by the Oompa-Loopas, little dwarfs who carefully maintain the factory.Underneath the sugary sweet veneer, there is an undeniably sinister aftertaste. Each one of the kids disappears through their own selfishness and greed, and in another departure from the book, where we saw them at the end, here we don't. We never do find out what happens to them, especially with oblique references from Wonka such as boilers, furnaces, taffy pullers and juicers. Wonka is hilariously unconcerned with their dilemmas, which gives the film considerable kick as a cautionary tale without ever becoming too preachy.Despite the bizarre fates that befall them, this is undeniably Wonka's show all the way. He is completely in control, and it's always a wonder listening to him come out with philosophies, tactics for boosting his products, and half-hearted warnings. With a chocolate coloured hat, chocolate wrapper coloured coat, a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step, Wilder turns Wonka into a fully rounded character who keeps the audience captive. He's also got a fine singing voice to boot.As events draw to a close, it's quite shocking when Charlie nearly loses out on the grand prize through a careless mistake. Naturally he convinces Wonka of his worth, but the fact that he nearly didn't only shows how ambiguous Wonka is. It all ends nicely in the Wonkavator, with Charlie inheriting the empire, and ensuring a new life for his poverty-stricken family.Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory still remains the best of the Roald Dahl screen interpretations, and is a template of the perfect children's film. One that appeals to the child in all of us, but still touches base with the adult so it never becomes patronising. Tim Burton's remake was a respectful incarnation, and succeeds on it's own merits, but the original still resonates with audiences as the classic it has become, and deserves to be.</fullReview>

However the film is nicely cast cast with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and Jack Albertson as grandpa Joe and introducing peter oestrus as Charlie and is a great family ideal for children and a nice magical ride film worth renting a nice children's film. but however the film has a boat ride scene with some violent images whit ch you may not want children under the age of to view. as good as the new remake by Tim Burton and starring Jhonny Depp 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can they re-make this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1971 children's film is a classic. It's funny, fun, mysterious, and even a little scary. The performances are wonderful, the music is timeless, and it is quite a good rendition of the classic book by Roald Dahl, granted Mr. Dahl wrote the screenplay. Now a re-make of the classic film is slated to be shot. I find this hard to believe-- just like re-making Psycho-- what is the point? Re-making films in the era of video and DVD seems silly. In the earlier days of films, the older versions were not readily available for the public, so it seemed fine to re- introduce the world to the stories, but now I just don't understand the point in re- making films that are classics. The new one may be a fine rendition-- I have faith that Johnny Depp is fully capable of playing a wonderful Willy Wonka, but it's a role that I think was already extremely well portrayed by Gene Wilder. What a magical movie this is, what a wonderful story-- every child should see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, the original, the classic...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) stages a contest by hiding five golden tickets in five of his scrumptious candy bars. Whoever comes up with these tickets will win a free tour of the Wonka factory, as well as a lifetime supply of candy. Four of the five winning children are insufferable brats, the fifth is a likeable young lad named Charley Bucket (Peter Ostrum), who takes the tour in the company of his equally amiable grandfather (Jack Albertson). In the course of the tour, Willy Wonka punishes the four nastier children in various diabolical methods one kid is inflated and covered with blueberry dye, another ends up as a principal ingredient of the chocolate, and so on because these kids have violated the ethics of Wonka's factory. In the end, only Charlie and his grandfather are left. Willy Wonka is a classic, a good story, and fun of all ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Can't Forgive It for Not Being the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version of the Roald Dahl classic has always weirded me out, and not in a good way. I don't like the way it looks - gangly and ugly - nor the liberties the screenwriters took with the book. I would borrow "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" from my little grade school library, read it, and as soon as I got to the end of the last page go right back to the beginning and read it over again. It was imprinted on my wee young brain, and I simply cannot accept any deviation from it.Gene Wilder at least has fun with this, though he reminds me way too much of my loser ex-brother-in-law for comfort. The thing I remember most about this movie, as many others probably do as well, is the catchy anthem sung repeatedly by the Oompah Loompahs.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonka is God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory as a child and as a young adult I appreciated it's whimsical appearance and it's fantastic story. Not until recently did I discover the religious symbolism that runs throughout the film. I've never read the book which the film was based upon so I can't say if there are any similarities regarding religious symbolism in the book. The Religious spin: Wonka represents God The Chocolate factory represents Heaven or Eden Slugworth represents the Devil The everlasting gobstopper represents the soul The story essentially tells the tale of how mankind is offered the opportunity (the golden ticket) to reap Heaven (Chocolate factory). The opportunities are few in a world littered with corruption. The adults of the world are portrayed as cynical, untrusting or untrustworthy. The golden tickets find their way into the hands of children. Charlie, the protagonist of the story, is shown to be the kindest and most humble. Upon receiving their tickets the children are immediately confronted by Slugworth (the Devil) who whispers temptation into their ears. The first impression we are provided of the reclusive Wonka (God) is that of a prankster, as he shyly limps out only to tumble forward evoking both shock and delight. Throughout the film the Wonka character expresses a gamut of emotions to the point of knowing what he is like but not understanding him. He's both structured and chaotic. Upon entering the factory the guests are provided rules (some visible while others are practically invisible). The guests are instructed to sign that they will obey the rules (Symbolic of Adam and Eve). During the story each of the children fall prey to a number of the deadly sins; Augustus (gluttony), Veruca (greed), Violet (envy/vanity), Charlie (envy), and Mike (vanity). In each case the sin brings shame and disastrous results. One of the most famous quotable lines from the film is the Wonka statement,'We are the music makers. We are the dreamers of dreams'. Wonka (God) is stating 1. The relationship between He (God) and his guests (humans) exists when expressing We and that they each share the ability to create. And, 2. that the infinite is possible. With Wonka (God) all things are possible.Throughout the story appear the Oompa Loompas (Angels) who do the bidding of Wonka and provide sage advice for those who've fallen prey to sin. At one point in the story the children are each offered Wonka's greatest invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper. He informs them that this special treat will last forever and instructs them that it can never land in the hands of Slugworth (Devil). The children and their parents eye one another expressing their understanding of it's significance and of Slugworth's desire for it. In the end only Charlie and his Uncle remain at the conclusion of the tour. Wonka shows them the door and turns away to go about his business. Confused, they inquire about the chocolate and they're rebuffed by Wonka who scolds them for disobeying the rules. At this point Wonka (God) appears cold and distant. Charlie's Uncle, experienced to the corruption of the world (and victim of his own slothfulness), suggests to Charlie that they deal with Slugworth. Unswayed, Charlie, expressing remorse for his actions, offers the Everlasting Gobstopper (Soul) back to Wonka. Wonka turns to Charlie with a look of gratefulness and forgiveness. He tells Charlie that he did it. He passed the test. He returned the Gobstopper without letting it fall into the hands of Slugworth. Moments later, Slugworth enters the room. At first Charlie and his Uncle are taken aback by his presence, but, they are informed that Slugworth actually works for Wonka. The ominous presence previously embodied by Slugworth dissolves as he provides them with a congratulatory smile. In the final climax Charlie, having received the Chocolate Factory, takes a ride with Wonka up into the heavens. Much can be derived from the symbolic nature of the film and what it potentially is suggesting. Most notably the idea that the Devil actually works for God for the purpose of providing man with temptation in order to test his/her trustworthiness. To some that conclusion might appear to place man at a disadvantage. But, certainly not more so than what original man (Adam and Eve) had to face. Mankind still has free will. The Slugworth character (Devil) can be perceived much the same as a tool, albeit a dangerous one. A tool that enables men to act out poor choices. Similar to the adage that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The tool in the wrong hands can be a dangerous weapon but if it's ignored it's harmless. What I found most satisfactory about the potential symbolic nature of the film was that beneath it's whimsical appearance and fantastic story lie a moralistic teaching. It is a story meant to be seen by children and beyond entertaining them provide them lessons (some visible and some practically invisible) on how they should conduct themselves. And, potentially save themselves. I don't suspect that the soon to be released remake, directed by Tim Burton, will provide such lessons. The last and most intriguing question that I have regarding the Religious spin of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory is by who's design does it occur. Was it the author of the book? The screenwriter? The director? Or, by some other providence??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice gentle family feature, back in the days when "HR Pufnstuf" on TV and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" in the cinema were the heights of children's imagination. Roald Dahl's mild cautionary tale on the pitfalls of consumerism, greed (still relevant today in our mass - advertising, obesity-conscious society) is presented pleasantly for the cinema and has a winning turn at its heart by Gene Wilder. The children can't quite act their lines but the adults support well (with a fair smattering of British comedy staples like Roy Kinnear, Tim Brooke Taylor and others on board). The music is fair, certainly not up to "Oliver" standards, with the well-known "Candy Man" standing out in a less than brilliant vocal performance by the shopkeeper although, to be fair, none of the lead singers is particularly exceptional. The special effects are okay, fine for the time, a bit dated now especially considering the wonders of Tim Burton's big - budget remake, and not too much of the confectionery looks truly scrumptious, to borrow a phrase, but some of the shots (especially the process shot above the rooftops at the end) are embarrassingly processed. The Oompa Loompahs, I suppose, evoke the Munchkins of Oz but are less characterful and really just act as decoration only. I'm struggling to get away from words like nice, pleasant and I suppose bland - it seems to me, all in all, to be one of those films you remember better from your youth than when seeing it again as an adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Meek Will Inherit the Chocolate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a message behind the darkness of Willy Wonka's wacky chocolate factory here, and that is if you are a glutton, a gum chewer with a massive ego, a spoiled brat or a television addict, you will not inherit the Kingdom of Willy. This is one of those strange stories that is probably not for infant children, maybe best for 10 years and up, and probably better for mature adults who can look back at this years after first seeing it to determine what Ronald Dahl was trying to say in his story of gooey goodness. There's no gooey feeling about the story. This is purely adult fare with visual treats for the kids, and a few scary moments as well. Willy Wonka in a sense appears to be a metaphor for some spiritual being utilizing a rather materialistic method in order to find out who will be the grand prize winner for his kingdom. In a sense, he's a bit like God, as some literary critics and movie historians have determined Frankenstein's monster and Edward Scissorhands to be a metaphor for Jesus.Peter Ostrum is Charlie Bucket, one of five lucky recipients of the golden ticket, and he is indeed a sweet, unselfish child. The four other winners range from horrid (Veruca Salt) to grossly obese (Augustus Gloop) to obnoxious (Mike Teevee) to somewhat of a braggart (the more likable Violet Beauregarde) and their parents are just as horrid. Charlie takes along his beloved grandpa Joe (a wonderful Jack Albertson) who was bedridden along with his wife and Charlie's other two grandparents (think of "Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice" meet "Cocoon" and Maude, as in "Harold and..."). The visual of the four elderly in-laws in the same bed is probably enough of a nightmare in itself let alone what Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has in store for them.The Wonka factory is a fun house in itself, with coat and hat racks that literally can grip what is being placed on it, an "Alice in Wonderland" like tiny door that opens to a world of pure imagination, a beautiful steamboat run by orange faced little people that goes into the tunnel of hell, a goose that lays golden chocolate eggs, a piece of gum that turns little girls into giant blueberries, a room filled of gas filled liquid that threatens to carve its drinkers into sliced cold cuts, and a television like machine that shrinks big things into little things, like bratty children. Of course, Wonka's garden is the most beautiful of these segments, and in each one, sin is dealt with as each nasty child prepares to get their come-uppance.Some critics may call Charlie too perfect to be real, but there are indeed children out there with his sweetness and love, and that is what Willy Wonka's God-like character is searching for. Each child is given the test because of a villain named Slugworth, and it is easy to see who will pass, who will fail. The Oompah Loompas are a "Harry Potter" like version of Oz's Munchkins, and after each child fails their test, these wisened little men sing the moral of what that child needed to learn. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse features one of the top movie themes of all time, "The Candy Man" (made into a hit single by Sammy Davis Jr.; sung by a candy store clerk here), and "Pure Imagination" is equally as memorable.This takes on what some of the Disney musicals lack, and that is an appealing lesson for adults to pass on to their children. As Willy Wonka says, it is possible that some of these children will come out a bit better than they were before, although you can lay odds on the nasty Veruca Salt turning into a British version of either Leona Helmsley or Monica Lewinsky in her selfish quest for "I Want It Now!".</fullReview>

Charlie(Peter Ostrum) and four other children(along with their selected family members) find the Golden wrappers, and get a tour that they never expected, and will never forget...Based on Roald Dahl's story, and directed by Mel Stuart, this children's favorite is an engaging(if uneven) fantasy/musical with good songs and an elaborate set of Wonkaland(complete with Oompa Loompas). Good performances by all, though has moments of cruelty and harshness(the fates of the other four children, and Wonka's "tirade" near the end) that are most jarring. Still, an uplifting finale and overall air of fun and imagination overcome these faults.</fullReview>

The children are all stereotypes which is really funny and you could almost translate that into today(wait they did, in a bad remake). I love Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka. The songs are memorable, almost like Disney songs. Just those songs that everybody knows. The remake took a stake and jabbed it into my childhood. The sets are dated, but that makes them even cooler. The film has a pretty good supporting cast and added to the film, unlike the Buton version. Burton did a good job with his sets, but it hails in comparison to the original Wonka.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking for a fun film for all the family with nice song? Then this is a good choice. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based on the Roald Dahl children's story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The basic story is Willy Wonka has placed five Golden Ticket in his chocolate bars and five lucky children will get a free tour and a life time's supply of chocolate. Charlie is a poor English boy who lived in a small house with his mum and grandparents. He is also a very unselfish child who works as a paper boy and uses his money to help his family. Charlie also wants to be one of the children who get one of the golden tickets. Charlie gets lucky and finds one of the tickets and get to go to the factory. The four other children who find tickets are Augustus Gloop, a very greedy German child, Veruca Salt, a very solid English child, Violet Beauregarde, a self-obsessed American and Mike Teavee a TV-obsessed American child. When all the characters get to the Chocolate factory they find a surreal place which offers the children everything they could want, but one by one all of them get weeded out because of their selfishness. The whole point of Willy Wonka is that it's a morality tale about being good and avoid being selfish.This film has some nice little songs; the ones that I think our best are 'A World of Pure Imagination' and 'I Want it Now'. I feel that the mood is just right and go for children of all ages. It is more lighter then the Tim Burton version which I think is better. The Oompa-Loompa are also great in the film and you can't help by like them. They have been parodied in a number of times, including in the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. I think that they are a lot better in this version then the Burton version. Gene Wilder was also perfectly casted as Willy Wonka, getting the role just right and I think his version is better then Johnny Deep's.All in all Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a nice little film for all the family which shows it classes by being parodied. This film is better then remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Humor - the times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1971 our 6th grade class read the book, Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory, and that year "Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory" came out. The shameful war was still on in the far east. There was still a peace movement happening. Woodstock was fresh in the mind &amp; opposite of what PBS tries to make it look like now, that concert was about peace. Much of the humor in our society was dark. Lyrics from innumerable songs were protesting the war machine &amp; the criminal powers that be. This movie with Wilder and what people like to call a low budget, was very well suited for that time period. For those who say that this movie was sick and evil, it was a FANTASY! Life was serious then, as it still is, and people escape in various ways. I loved the movie, in spite of its imperfections; as if life is perfect.?. Veruca Salt was my love, at least I wanted her to be. "And by the way..." the movie is funny in most of the scenes. I was rolling in laughter then &amp; even now. People of now who can't find humor in characters like eccentric &amp; possibly perverted rich old men take life too seriously. Obviously, Wonka's a freaky old self-centered corporate leader. It's good for kids to see this so they can know what to avoid. The book is great. The movie is great, but they're different. I know this movie doesn't lead people to do what these FANTASY CHARACTERS do. I'm not happy with the politics of factories, rich owners, workers struggling to survive (slaves). But, this movie shows the evils of corporations, in my opinion. Kids need to understand how evil the corporate money machine can be.... The movie is a fun fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delight for children and the young at heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl's magical children's book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is brought wonderfully to life here in Mel Stuart's 1971 comedy-musical. The production wisely makes use of a screenplay adaptation from the author himself, ensuring the tale loses very little of its enchantment in transferring to the silver screen. Casting is indeed very astute, with all the players impressing, especially a young looking Gene Wilder as Wonka.Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley have written some very catchy tunes for the film's musical numbers, "Candy Man" and "Imagination" being two of the highlights, and Art Director Harper Goff gives the film an extravagant look.A most enjoyable fantasy about a young boy's dream come true, with some telling messages about gluttony, television, spoiled children and chewing gum, all delightfully delivered by the midget like Oompa Lumpas. Not to be missed by adults and children alike.Friday, May 6, 1994 - T.V.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my younger years, I was one of the millions of children who would settle down in front of the television on a quiet Saturday evening and descend into the magical world of Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory. Not since 'The Wizard of Oz (1939)' has a film so perfectly captured the imaginations of adults and children alike, and I know I'm not the only one to have dreamed of visiting this world of edible landscapes, wacky contraptions and surprises around every corner. Tonight I watched 'Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (1971)' for the first time in a number of years, and I found it even better than I had remembered. Despite having seen the film more than a few times, I was once again drawn into its colourful world of sugary imagination; it was as though I was seeing it again for the first time. This is the mark of a true family classic.Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is the film's main protagonist, an honest and hand-working boy from a poverty-stricken family. Whereas other children are waste their money buying chocolates, Charlie dedicates his meager newspaper-delivery wages towards providing bread for his overworked mother (Diana Sowle) and four bed-ridden grandparents. However, one day there is an announcement that sends the world population into a frenzy: the reclusive but brilliant chocolate-maker Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has hidden golden tickets in five bars of his product, and the lucky winners will be treated to a tour of his magical factory, as well as the grand prize of a lifetime's supply of chocolate! One by one, the tickets are discovered by a selection of disagreeable children, but the fifth winner may well be the most deserving young boy of all. The film was adapted from the story "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" by British author Roald Dahl, who was famously furious about the alterations made by screenwriter David Seltzer.When Charlie and his Grandpa Joe (played with warmth by Jack Albertson) arrive at the chocolate factory to attend their tour, the real fun starts. Willy Wonka is the most fascinating of film characters, completely unpredictable from the outset. Emerging for the first time, cane in hand, the seemingly frail Wonka limps painfully towards the waiting crowd before tumbling into a lively somersault. Once inside the factory, the eccentric genius can be funny, musical, sarcastic, rude and even a little sadistic, spouting off quotes from Shakespeare, O'Shaughnessy and Allingham as the naughty children around him systematically receive their comeuppance. The chocolate factory is operated by a race of little people known as Oompa Loompas, who celebrate the departure of each disobedient child by singing of the evils of being gluttonous, greedy, spoiled, or ill-behaved {these particular sequences are the only ones, I think, that have aged poorly over the last 35 years}.Despite a generally-positive critical reaction upon its release, 'Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory' was a box-office failure, though time has allowed subsequent generations to discover the incalculable magic that the film holds. The musical numbers ? ranging from "The Candy Man" to "(I've Got a) Golden Ticket" to "Pure Imagination" ? are all touching and joyous, and there is even a peculiar psychedelic boat ride that slips into the realm of surrealism. The visual effects are decidedly remarkable for the era, and I was particularly impressed with the Fizzy Lifting Drinks sequence, in which Charlie and Grandpa Joe become weightless and float perilously towards the fan spinning high above them; there is not a supporting wire to be seen. The film was nominated for a single Academy Award, for Best Music, but it's almost criminal that Harper Goff's art direction went unrewarded, despite Willy Wonka's chocolate factory being one of the most amazing film sets I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Wilder is the epitome of perfect casting in his role as Willy Wonka. His sincerity, coupled with the character's profound sadness, and Wilder's innate quirkiness mark this as an all time classic children's movie.Chocked full of zany goodness, sprinkled with intricate quirkiness, endearingly odd characters, and some great stories carefully woven together to craft a lasting memory, what is now known as "Wilder's Wonka" is among the most beautiful of all children's tales.This is a timeless classic, which still holds up to today's scrutiny.This is among my all time favorites, and rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Musical(SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSLike I said before, I liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a little bit better, but this is still a great musical film. It has very memorable songs that everyone loves, well, except for the Oompa-Loompa songs. Speaking of Oompa-Loompas, they are positively creepy. They are orange with white eyebrows. They are just plain disturbing. Anyway, this is a good film. I can't believe Gene Wilder was Willy Wonka. He was great as him, but he normally does Mel Brooks films.I told you the plot in my comment for Charlie. A kid wins a Golden Ticket to go to Willy Wonka's factory and all the other kids are punished. However, the ending is just a bit different. Willy Wonka goes into his office and Charlie gives back his Ever-Lasting Gobstopper. Wonka is delighted and the film ends in the Great-Glass Elevator, which is pretty abrupt. This is also the soda room. Charlie and his grandfather are levitated off the ground until they hit a fan, but they belch to get down.Overall, this is a very fun film to watch. It has great songs, catchy tunes, good acting, and more. Although it may not be very faithful to the novel, it is still great. In the novel it ends with the Great-Glass Elevator crashing into Charlie's house, but int this it ends in the Great-Glass Elevator. Anyway, a lot of people can and will enjoy this 1971 flick. There is one thing I'd like to mention, the boat ride is really bizarre. Anyway, this is a nice film.8/10Recommended Films: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this film because it was showing that kids are suppose to be kids and they need guidance not maids from their parents. This film really shows that parents need to take in charge otherwise their kids will not learn and will think that the world around them will be on a silver platter. I was sort of surprise what Charlie did at the end. I could see his character has a good heart, but I didn't know it was really a golden heart coming from a kid. I suspected that Willy Wonka will do something like that at the end. I just couldn't believe how the other kids was acting. If I noticed that my kid is starting to act like that, I will just disown them. I haven't seen the one with Johnny Depp but I'll see it soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most other commentators here, I too am a long term fan of this classic, primarily because of of its attendant virtuoso performance from Gene Wilder, as well as its super-charged Technicolour treatment of the subtly unsettling source material.It is here we find the dichotomy of Wonka: is he really a benevolent eccentric, or does this surreal exterior mask something more sinister? Who knows? That the film itself manages to neatly sidestep the more moralistic overtones of Dahl's book is testament to its innate sense of wonder and purpose.So, for kids of all ages, this is 'scrumdiddleumptious', and one can only hope Burton's latest take on the story lives up to it's predecessor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forever a sweet gem of a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory I was in the third grade (1990-1991). The film became an instant favorite with me and I have never gotten tired of it. This is a movie that can easily captivate both children and adults with its wonder, excitement, and magical elements. The most mesmerizing moment in this movie gem is the chocolate room sequence where the children, and their guardians, eat almost everything in sight. Ever since I first saw this picture, I have had the dream of being in such a wondrous, colorful atmosphere where the sweets are dominant. I love to eat sweets so its no wonder that this movie is such a favorite with me.This family film is vastly amusing and will want to be viewed over and over again by children who practically live for candy and other sweets. This movie also delivers a few strong humanitarian messages. Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory, without a doubt, has a secure place in the realm of family entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the film deviates from the book, it is a wonderful story. Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, is a very quirky, unusual character with a sweet tooth and an interesting way of teaching moral lessons. The film is colorful and lively and it definitely captures the imagination. There were a few moments in the movie that were disturbingly weird like the part when the characters took the boat down the chocolate river through the tunnel. The pictures on the tunnel wall and the almost psychotic look in Gene Wilder's eyes added a level of weird that interrupted the flow of the movie. But overall I thought that the film was enjoyable. I loved the characters and the vibrant colors and I think that a better film couldn't have been made, especially for that time.(Eastern Michigan University)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willy Wonka is a classic that will never be matched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was made to promote the Wonka Chocolate bar. The movie upon release was a total flop. The chocolate bar upon release; melted before getting on store selves. Now the movie is a family movie classic. Who can not love the Oompa Loompas. Gene Wilder is simply amazing as the extravagant, yet creepy Mr. Willy Wonka. It almost seems he doesn't care whether the kids live or die. The scene in his office is an amazingly well acted scene. While Wilder's acting was amazing, Peter Ostrum's (Charlie) acting was very sub-par. His bad performance cannot take away from the greatness of this film, which will be a major part of my movie collection for decades to come.Positives: The sets of this movie are amazing Gene Wilder's acting performance the songs THE OOMPA LOOMPAS! negatives: Peter Ostrum's acting performance Grandpa George (the other grandpa who is only in the house scenes he looks really weird)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree that Mr. Turkentine is the most underrated character in the movie. I love his humor and his quotes, especially the one where he asks Charlie to come to the front of the class and help him with an experiment, "Well, of course you don't know. You don't know 'cause only I know and if you knew and I didn't know then you'd be teaching me instead of me teaching you and for a student that teaches teachers it's presumptuous and rude... do I make myself clear?" he-he:) The way he presents himself is so hilarious. Another that is hilarious is when he's trying to teach the class about percentages and he asks Charlie how many Wonka bars he'd opened and Charlie replies "2" and Mr. Turkentine responds by using 200 and then when Charlie reassures him it's only 2, Mr. Turkentine replies that he can't figure out "just 2" and then says to pretend Charlie opened 200. he-he. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film, possibly because I have a three year old who becomes totally absorbed in the story whenever he sees it. I've rediscovered the eye-popping delights of a secret world dedicated to the guilt-free invention and sampling of scrumptious chocolate and sugar confections. It's a cautionary tale of course - a concept my son has yet to grasp, bless him - warning against the evils of excess and over-indulgence and celebrating virtue and honesty. I love the three main characters - they all play their roles to perfection, particularly Gene Wilder who was just perfect casting. His Willy Wonka is, naturally, a reclusive oddball who, in the course of the factory tour, proves to be an intriguing combination of secretive, controlling, unpredictable grown-up and candid, excitable, mischievous, capricious child. Dated special-effects and appalling singing included, this film is a joy from start to finish. The saccharine ending is the icing on the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gret movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1971, Dahl's screenplay follows his book's basic storyline fairly closely. Mel Stuart's direction however takes some parts of the movie in a slightly darker direction than the book. One sequence, the boat ride on the chocolate river, in hindsight shows the obvious influence of psychedelia.It was not a full musical in the usual sense, featuring only six songs. Some were notably well received, including "The Candy Man Can", and "The Oompa Loompa Song". "Cheer Up, Charlie" is regularly edited out of TV screenings, presumably because the song is widely (but not universally) disliked.Still a great movie to boot!There are some great games made from the game characters at www.freegamezone.org</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched it, probably the first time since becoming an adult, And I loved it as much as I did when I was a kid. Spellbinding, psychedelic, Strange(in a good way), uplifting, imaginative, witty, and guaranteed to induce munchies. Gene Wilder is outstanding as the eccentric confectioner, managing to be dry(His half hearted attempts of stopping the brats getting into trouble for instance) and compellingly odd. Peter Ostrum is also perfect as humble, shabbily handsome Charlie Bucket(Trivia: Peter Ostrum gave up acting shortly after making this film and became a Vet). The Chocolate Factory itself is a low tech miracle and although the sets were obviously made on a shoestring budget it just looks right(Even the spray-gold(tm) shopping cart doesn't look outta place with a bright orange, bright green haired person of limited stature pushing it). The films musical score is on the whole energetic uplifting and catchy, with the meloncoly "Cheer up Charlie" being the exception. The film has some sinister elements to it, the main one for me was the brilliantly cast Mr Slugworth(Gnter Meisner) but friends and family had their own opinions on which bits they found weird.WW&amp;TCF has aged well and I personally feel a remake is an unnecessary step but hey what do I know it might be good but it would have to go some to be beat the original for me, but the youngungs will probably lap it up.

		<shortDescription>Not Just For Kids...a Movie With True Cinematic Emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you would like to watch one of the greatest and saddest moments in cinema, watch the scene in which Charlie and Grampa Joe open the second chocolate bar. When Charlie says 'I bet that golden ticket makes the chocolate taste terrible' he is summarizing every false word of consolation any poor child in history has ever heard or said. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is an everlasting movie, one that exudes surrealism in every frame; yet it is so human it's hard to imagine a world without little green men that make chocolate and sing morals. Please watch this movie again if you found it frightening, confusing, or dull when you were a child, it's really not for kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Still Hate This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen bits and pieces of this film over the years (usually only the parts in the chocolate factory, oompa loompas, etc.) and never liked any of it. Today I saw it right from the beginning, which I'd never seen before. The first part is okay - too bad they had to ruin it with the second half. For a movie made in 1971, the set and effects are terrible - the Wizard of Oz is more believable and that was made in 1939! The chocolate river looked like brown colored water - they could have done better than that, thickened it up so it looked real melted chocolate. I mean, how hard could that have been? And Gene Wilder is absolutely creepy, and the singing is horrible! The boat scene, forget it - I had to turn it off this morning, it is so stupid, along with the dumb song he sings throughout it. And the ooompa loompas - I hate them most of all. What a waste of a film, for kids and adults. I hope to never see it again.</fullReview>

Who can see this movie and NOT be insanely jealous of those gaining entrance into The Chocolate Room? Or giggle at Violet Beauregarde's sassiness, Veruca Salt's tantrums, or Wonka's many mind-bending one-liners? Gene Wilder is absolutely perfect as the leading role, which gives Johnny Depp EXTREMELY huge shoes to fill if a remake is indeed made.

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good, But . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good retelling of Roald Dahl's story, tightening some loose screws. The idea of making it a musical was good, considering the songs. Two classics ("Candy Man", "Pure Imagination"); two good songs ("I Want it Now" and "I've Got a Golden Ticket"). Unfortunately, what it needs is an "11 o'clocker" -- a song closer to the finale that lifts the mood. A little patter song by Willy Wonka, perhaps, about the loss of the children. In the second act, after "Pure Imagination", "I Want it Now" is all we have except the wearisome Oompa-Loompa song.Gene Wilder is a marvel. It was dangerous using an actor not so well known and not bringing him in for forty minutes of building him up. He doesn't disappoint at all. He captures Willy so perfectly one is surprised, re-reading to book, to find Wonka is short.The children are actually quite good, too, especially the ones playing Charlie and Veruca.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever get the feeling when you see a movie you really like, yet there's one thing that really brings it down? That's the feeling I have with this one. I mean look at the chocolate factory--the Oompa Loompas, the chocolate waterfall, the wonka-vision, it all looks great. And all the kids--Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Augustus Gloop, Mike Teevee are all fun to watch. What's wrong? Charlie and his grandfather. Not only do they have no personality (Well, if poor counts), they're two of the most boring characters EVER. As a kid, I always liked everyone else more, and now that I'm older I realize why. He's poor, and then became the happiest boy in the world when he won the ticket, yet why don't I feel happy for him? It was the best day of his life! Probably because I really didn't care at all for him. If someone else was like him and his dad (Say Veruca and her dad) it wouldn't have been a big deal. Yet this is a comedy with Gene Wilder, in one of his best roles. He basically carries half of the movie. And it is a musical as well. Ms. Salt is no singer herself. Yet the shots are good, the movie is so damn creative, and it is a cult movie--which I can see why. I do remember being part of it as a kid, but my film taste has matured now. It's still fun to watch (but obviously not as more), and Gene Wilder is still hilarious. 7.5/10. I usually don't rate movies in the middle of a number, but I can't decide if it deserves a 7 or an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very successful film of Dahl.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite the cult film these days, "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" deserves its plaudits, as a well-judged translation of Roald Dahl to film. Dahl's books for children are phenomenally successful in this country; a kind of dry, larger-than-life misanthropy comes through in most of books, along with some moralizing, that tends to exclusively take the child's side. He is a very skilled writer, and adapts his book with pretty much all of the black humour and colourful anarchy intact.Yes, some musical sequences are a trifle stilted; "Cheer Up Charlie" just doesn't work in any satisfactory way. In very much a 60s-early 70s musical way, Bricusse and Newley's "Candy Man" and "Imagination" work, but are not especially brilliant, or enhancing. The Oompa Lumpas' songs and Veruca Salt's precocious, petulant number are pretty good, mind, and really develop the film's moral basis.Set design is truly the strength of the film, appealingly and at times surreally visualizing the Chocolate Factory. Of course, Gene Wilder is the other coup d'etat of the production; coming over as a maniacal, wondrous and deadpan presence. Much of the appeal this film holds for older viewers has to go down to Wilder's wonderfully pitched Wonka: he really defines the part and defies one to think of anyone else in it. Julie Dawn Cole is the most impressive of the juvenile actors; coming over as the ultimate petulant, nigh-on demonic brat of a child. Her comeuppance is lovingly signposted in her musical sequence and then the dispatching. Each child who fails the test is amusingly and quite disturbingly dispatched by a diffident, sardonic Wonka, and then we are given quite sublime little epigrammatic songs by the Oompa Lumpas stating the moral. Some heady stuff for a children's film - "Who's to blame?"/"It's the MOTHER AND THE FATHER!"Some eccentric aspects of the book become a little odd on film, like the whole family set-up of the Buckets. Grandpa Joe, as enacted in the flesh, comes across as an increasingly questionable figure - his past laziness seems incorrigibly absurd, and he's seen to touch up some other female attendant of one of the children, when they are in a lift - "What are you doing?!" she says. Very curious stuff! Charlie is a simpering bland child who I suppose will do; really it's what you'd expect in a story which has to portray a quite simple idea of virtue and goodness. His being a blue-eyed Aryan child and Grandpa Joe and the rest of the lethargic family being quite obvious American Jews is slightly singular. The setting of the film is another thing; where is Wonka's factory and where does this American Bucket family live? The direction, by Mel Stuart, is maybe at times pedestrian... this is an area where maybe things could have been furthered, but it's an inoffensive, acceptable direction of the film really.As sure as Alastair Cooke being on the BBC, I liked this film. I can find few flaws as to its achieving what it sets out to do. The original book and concept maybe has its flaws to an older viewer, but it's damn well delicious stuff for any child, and there are too few films of which you can say that. The set designers and Gene Wilder really deserve bounteous praise for great efforts which lift the whole thing to its quality.Rating:- ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this film since childhood, and like all good films that children like, it has stood up to the well-earned cynicism of my adulthood. That is of course because it is good on binary levels; that of a beloved kid's movie and a sentimental disportment for adults. That is why it is not only endearing, but enduring.An entertaining mix of irony, camp and charm, it is made of the stuff that produces dreams in the young and a longing for insouciance for the old. Who could resist this fantasy world within the walls of that enigmatic candy factory where the wallpaper is edible and rivers flow with chocolate? Who could not hum along with the crafty music numbers (mega kudos to songwriters Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley)? And of course who could not love the homunculin Oompa Loompas? The child actors/actresses are great. They serve to provide a certain satisfaction to the audience because in truth there is a reticent schadenfreude in seeing bratty kids get a comeuppance or two. And not enough can be said about Gene Wilder. He is brilliant in this role that has a underlying Oscar Wilde wit to it. In fact his appearance is a demarcated turning point in the movie in both tone and irony. I'm not sure who else could have pulled off this unique mix of lovability and acidulousness.</fullReview>

For those who have read the book it is a treat to see this new interpretation, for those new to the concept it is spellbinding from start to finish. It is hard to decipher this movie from a kid flick or a horror movie. The kids are probably among the least annoying child actors I have ever seen, which is always a plus.

I never get bored with watching it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to subject their kids to the slick, multi-million-dollar hype machines being passed off as family entertainment these days. Gene Wilder is every bit as eccentric, whimsical and likeable as he was in THE PRODUCERS, and he is perfectly cast as the ultimate candy magnate. The rest of the cast are also very good, and there are a few familiar faces from British comedy dotted through the film, including the wonderful, much-missed Roy Kinnear, Tim Brooke-Taylor doing an inventive spin on his weedy Goodies persona, and the terribly underused David Battley as Charlie's mildly dotty schoolteacher. In places, the film has the freewheeling feel of a U-rated CARRY ON film, which is never a bad thing.I have a few reservations, however. The previous reviewer's gripe about the Grandpa Joe character...fully justified, I think. He's supposed to be a loveable old duffer, yet his song and dance routine around the bedroom after twenty years of sloth-like inactivity instantly singles him out as a malingerer who has obviously been leeching off Mrs Bucket. When Willy Wonka 'tests' Charlie in the film's closing sequences, at first refusing him the lifetime supply of candy, Grandpa Joe's fiery display of geriatric rage and threat to march off and spill the beans to Wonka's 'rival' Slugworth is genuinely disturbing. Secondly, the film seems to be set in a weird nowhere-land placed at some point in time and space between pre-industrial America, Great Britain in the 1950s, and 19th-century Europe. There's a bizarre mix of architecture, accents, road signs and dialects - wherever the Bucket family live, it's probably the most cosmopolitan small town in the world!Finally, the much-debated scene where the kids take a terrifying trip down the tunnel. The chicken beheading just does not belong in this movie. Kids have a taste for the macabre, and I found the scene mostly satisfyingly creepy, but including a documentary clip of an innocent creature being killed was a thoroughly irresponsible move on the part of the film-makers.The songs in this film are fantastic. 'Cheer Up Charlie' is a sweet lullaby, 'The Candy Man' is mesmerizing and the oft-repeated 'Oompa Loompa' song is so maddeningly catchy, you'll be humming it for weeks! The set design inside Wonka's factory is so restlessly inventive, you can only sit and shake your head in wonder. To this day I still want to drink from a chocolate river, and have lickable wallpaper in my room! Some of the special effects may look a little crummy now, but remember these were the days before all that CGI nonsense. And kudos for including perhaps the funniest couplet in the history of musicals - "What do you get from a glut of TV? A pain in the neck and an I.Q. of three!".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandpa Joe Quandary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an awesome movie. I recall seeing it in the theater as a kid and have loved it ever since. There is something disturbing that I have noticed lately and is what I call the Grandpa Joe Quandary. I dearly loved Grandpa Joe as a kid but now he seems less likeable and selfish. Lets look at the facts. He lay in bed for 20 years while Charlie's mom worked like a slave to keep them all in poverty. His only luxury was a bowl a week. I wish I had that much!! At one point he gives Charlie a Wonka bar and everyone is mystified as to where he got it. He said he quit smoking but if the young slave in training Charlie nor his Mother purchased it, who then?. Perhaps there is more to Grandpa Joe's sinister side. When Charlie finally does get the golden ticket, Grandpa Joe is not only the first to stake his claim to it but can mystically rise from the bed in which he has been imprisoned for the last 20 years. Within minutes he can sing, dance and run around. Perhaps greed is the driving factor. i.e. "I've got a golden ticket" not we have a golden ticket. Listen to this key evidence and you will realize that Grandpa Joe is seemingly only in it for himself. Not once does he offer to care for the elders while Charlie and his Mom go to the factory. Grandpa does have a need to indulge his perverse side when convincing Charlie to steal Fizzie Lifting Drinks as well, knowing the potential outcome of this crime. Perhaps this was his way of training Charlie for his future, whatever that may have been if it were not for Willy Wonka. Grandpa Joe is quick to foul mouth Mr. Wonka when confronted with his improprieties and eager to join Slugworths minions at the first sign of trouble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor boy and his grandfather take a tour of a chocolate factory in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another great movie. You have to watch out that you might get hungry for some chocolate. Charlie's teacher (David Battley) has a real problem. One day he tells the class that he has switch the Friday Test to Monday before the class learns what happens during before the week before they learn it. Now is that silly. Then the children hear that the Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has hidden 5 golden tickets and the 5 people who find them will tour his gate-locked chocolate factory. Which catches the attention of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) whick only opens 4 chocolate chocolate bars and finds the last golden ticket when it was supposed to have gone to a gambler which only makes a fake golden ticket. Chalie brings his grandfather on the tour. His name is Joe (Jack Albertson). A must watch and a must buy for your dvd or video collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Children Beware!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although overall this is a lovely movie for the entire family, there is a rather disturbing and out of place scene when the boat goes down the chocolate river into the tunnel. There are obvious images of a chicken being decapitated and what appears to be a millipede crawling across someone's mouth. Other than that, this film is a joy and I had totally forgotten about it until my girlfriend saw the video on display at the grocery store and had to have it. We got home and started to watch it and I became a fan all over again. Gene Wilder's calculated craziness is so funny...(the combination to the lock to the factory is "99..44..100% pure", a tribute to Ivory Soap). See this movie, it's wonderful but fast forward through the boat trip if you have little ones watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Roald Dahl book-to-film adaptation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is, in my opinion, the best film adaptation of a Roald Dahl children's book, and the best fantasy film since "The Wizard of Oz." The characters, sets, and dialogue are priceless. The set designs of the chocolate factory, in particular, are stunning, just like the sets of Munchkinland in "The Wizard of Oz." Gene Wilder (famous in a lot of Mel Brooks movies) is perfect as Willy Wonka. In fact, to me, he IS Willy Wonka. I've heard some rumor that he's least proud of this movie than some of his others, and that's something of a shame, because this is the role I will always remember him for. He has a lot of funny lines of dialogue where he sings to Veruca Salt's father. My favorite characters are Willy Wonka and Charlie Bucket, one of the five golden ticket winners. My favorite scene is when Wonka, Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Mike Teevee and his mother are in the television room, WonkaVision. This long sequence is all in white, and makes for a wonderful psychedelic experience. The whole movie is, in fact, a kind of psychedelic trip to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, and a fantastic one at that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILER WARNING*****I read from someone else on here that they too noticed the part showing the chicken getting its poor head cut off in this, of all things, a children's movie. I thought I was the only one who noticed that and I still can't believe it every time I see it. What in hell possessed them to include that in the film? I heard there were some interesting scenes shot for this movie that were scrapped because I guess when they showed them to a test audience, the audience didn't laugh when they were supposed to laugh so they left out the scenes...I think one was something about a traveller going to see an old wise man guru and the punch line was, "Life is a disappointment"...anyway, even if these scenes did not work, I sure wish they would release them in a special edition of this movie with unseen footage-it would be facinating to see. Characters were great-I loved the school teacher, Veruca Salt, Violet, and Charlie's mother especially, and Gene Wilder was perfect for the role! I just think they shouldn't have included the chicken part.</fullReview>

Gene Wilder is great and the songs are just right to pad-out the story.Like most of Dahl's stories for kids there is a slightly dark ,cruel side running through the story but mostly it's fun and chocolate all the way through.Oh yeah, Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe brought back fond memories of Chico And The Man.

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but less faithful to the book then you'd expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was a good movie, but it is not faithful to the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Davis Seltzer(who I suspect wrote the shooting script, because R.D. said that he didn't like the final script), did too many changes to it. For instance, the Oompa-Loompas sang really bad songs "Oompa-Loompa do-pe-de-dah, I got another puzzle for you", was one of them. If you want to see movie versions of other Dahl books, you should see the way-more faithful movie versions of James and the Giant Peach and Matilda. Although this is a good family film(in line with Star Wars and E.T.), it is a bad adaption of a great, fun book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was seventeen the first time I came across this movie a few years ago. First I didn't like it, much for the same reason people have labeled this movie traumatising and sadistic for kids. I agree to a point. Had I been ten years younger I would've been really frightened by this movie, especially by the tunnel scene. And yes, it is somewhat dark. After seeing it a couple more times however, I came to like it more and more, and now it's one of my favorite movies. Why? Because it 'hits the spot' in every way a children's movie should.It's about a poor little boy who gets to live out the dream of every kid in the world. There's a choco-river, humor, music, fun props, candy, enough to make even an adult's imagination run wild. WWACF is an enjoyable escape from reality, and is actually very well made. Adults can also pick out the brilliant humor imbedded in the dialog.Apart from a few unnecessary songs and questionable scenes, Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory is a great classic. Highly recommended for everyone, except sensitive little kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the comments on this movie center around the so-called disturbing aspects of the Wonka factory. Oompah Loompahs have been called creepy, Wonka is lambasted as sadistic, etc.When this film came out, I was eight years old. Other than the images projected on the tunnel wall as the boat went through, I didn't find anything particularly scary. Mostly it sparked my imagination and made me laugh.In my opinion, this was the best "children's" film of my generation. It wasn't until _Babe_ that a children's film of comparable quality was released. (Not surprising, _Babe_ was criticized by some for being too disturbing for children.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is an unconventional children's story that refuses to become watered-down or P.C. It manages to be great family entertainment without too much watering down of Raul Dahl's disturbed ideas (although Mr. Dahl did not enjoy the film version.) The child actor isn't too annoying, which puts it ahead of most children's movies, and the songs are pretty good. What gives it the extra edge is the LSD inspired visuals and Gene Wilder's brilliant performance of the eccentric Willy Wonka. There are a few moments that only adults will get, a few moments only a kid could love, and a few scenes which are rather disturbing (The legendary "Boat Scene"). All in all a great movie (but make sure your kids are old enough, this film can cause some serious mental health issues late in life, I should know!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Family Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I think it is a great family classic which might age more over time. This is based on the Roald Dahl novel "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory." I first read the book when I was a child and some time later I watched the movie at school and, since I happen to not be a Dahl purist, I liked it. I also liked Tim Burton's more recent version, but I like this one better.Out of either Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder, I have to admit that Gene Wilder did a better job on capturing the character of Willy Wonka. I know this movie is like a mediocre version of Dahl's novel and failed upon its original release, but does a movie have to be perfect to the novel it's based on to be great, no matter how beloved the novel is (anyone apart from purists)? Seems not. But time has become kind to it to make it a beloved cult family classic. While Tim Burton's movie may have done a better job on the book, it is no way as good as this movie (well almost).I think this movie is what one of the songs in this movie describes it: Pure Imagination. It's a shame Roald Dahl despised this movie (because of the liberties this movie took), but it is quite imaginative, sweet and (in terms of chocolate) scrumdidilyumptious. The songs also made an impression on me too, including the aforementioned "Pure Imagination." Your family would want to experience this minor classic over and over again and I would recommend it for anyone. If you're a purist, however, stick with Tim Burton's more recent adaptation. My rating: 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version (unlike the remake) is an absolute classic. After you have seen it, it will be with you forever. Gene Wilder as Mr. Wonka was superb. His character goes from being sooo odd to almost creepy and then back to a caring man about teaching kids to do the right thing. All of the characters in this movie really play their parts sincerely which only adds to the full impact of the movie's message. The movie has an aw and wonder about it that leaves one feeling a real experience has happened (real story with coherency). I haven't seen the remake but I know that no actor could replace Gene Wilder in the role of Willy Wonka. The music, the orange people, this is movie magic! Just another example of David Wolper productions at it's finest! (Roots etc...) You really can't remake a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply sweet and full of pure imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a fan of the original Willy Wonka since I was 12 years old, which was way back in 2000-2001. It is my all time favorite movie and the newer remake will never replace it, even if the remake is just OK. The movie is about when the crazy candy maker, Willy Wonka sends out 5 Golden Tickets for a chance to win a tour through his amazing candy factory, run by the mysterious green-haired, orange-faced Oompa Loompa elves, and also win a lifetime supply of chocolate. The children who find them are a spoiled brat named Veruca Salt, a loudmouthed TV addict named Mike Teevee, gumchewer Violet Beauregard, gluttonous Augustus Gloop, and Charlie Bucket--a poor boy who lives with his mom and 4 bedridden grandparents in small house. 4 of the children get their demise thanks to their usual behavior, except for Charlie, and is promised to win a lifetime supply of chocolate, but is almost not given it because he and his Grandpa Joe broke one of Wonka's rules by drinking Fizzy lifting drinks and almost getting chopped to bits by a fan on the ceiling and dirtying it when they bumped into it. However, after Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe, Charlie gives back the Everlasting Gobstopper candy that he gave each of the kids earlier. The gobstopper was Wonka's most secret recipe and he finds out that he passed Mr. Wonka's test of honesty and is given the factory because Mr. Wonka couldn't work there forever, and he wanted to find an honest loving child who can be told all of Wonka's most precious candymaking secrets, and take care of the Oompa Loompas. My favorite parts are when Grandpa Joe does his victory dance "I've Got a Golden Ticket," surprisingly after being bedridden for 20 years, when Charlie finds the ticket and runs home, the psychedelic boat trip, Augustus Gloop falling into the chocolate river, Violet Beauregarde turning into a blueberry thanks to some very special gum, the group first seeing the Chocolate Room, (while Mr. Wonka sings Pure Imagination) when Mr. Wonka leads the group through the beginning of the factory (MR. SALT--Is this some kind of funhouse? WONKA: Why, having fun?) the Wonkawash scene and the very end, when Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Willy are in the Wonkavator. I know I have more but that's all I can think of. All I can say is, this movie is pure magic, and full of pure imagination, for young and old. So what if it doesn't have fancy computer effects like the 2005 remake? This movie is all real. The 1971 version will always be the best to me, because it's simple, fantastic, magic, funny, and Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. Maybe this version isn't true to the book like the 2005 version but this version is special in it's own way. It will remain my favorite movie of all time, with The Muppet Movie probably being second on my list. To end my review, I will say my favorite(and final) line from this movie. "Don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wanted?he lived happily ever after." That line sums up the sheer brilliance and innocence (OK maybe a few parts are a little dark and scary) of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the 2005 version, but not that much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I had a chance to watch this movie, which is a popular and beloved fantasy/musical among children. Because this is the original film, naturally I had big expectations that it would be much better than the 2005 "remake". It is certainly superior to the 2005 "remake", but not as much as I imagined. While it certainly isn't a tremendous film, it is perfectly watchable, entertaining and without much bad stuff. But I found it just okay. I didn't find it good enough to consider it a true classic or good enough to add to my movie collection.Now, seriously. The movie is for sure much more elaborate and appealing than the 2005 "remake". The sceneries are much more natural-looking and way more pleasant to look at (for example, the factory looks beautiful outside, especially with that church-like tower with a clock, and the factory itself is so much nicer inside than in the 2005 version). Frankly, Gene Wilder makes a much better and more likable Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is exactly what Willy Wonka is supposed to be: eccentric and enigmatic, but without being a weirdo and also without that horrible haircut and without a dark sense of humor. Johnny Depp, on the other, makes a too weird and eccentric Willy Wonka with a dark sense of humor and an awful haircut, in a controversial combination that resembles Michael Jackson. The ending of this movie is very different (and better) either.In this movie, even the "bratty" kids aren't that annoying. Except for Veruca (the spoiled and selfish girl), the others aren't excessive. Violet, for example, isn't as irritating as the same character in the 2005 version and the same happens with Mike Teavee. In fact, only in one or two brief scenes Mike Teavee proves to be rude. Otherwise, he's funny for his cowboy-like clothes and attitudes. Charlie Bucket is, naturally, the nicest kid.Like I said, Gene Wilder is great as Willy Wonka. Peter Ostrum was great as Charlie Bucket (his only movie role ever), Paris Themmen is pretty cool as the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee and Jack Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe. Mel Stuart made a much better job by directing this movie than Tim Burton in the "remake".Another attribute here is the soundtrack. The songs are charming. Besides, the movie is made in an old-fashioned style, another reason why it is superior to the modern version.I like the scene when Grandpa Joe and Charlie are floating in the air between balls of soap, but I think it is too much what happens to Violet when she tastes something she shouldn't. Besides, those Oompa-Loompas bug me for some reason - I don't like them any better than those from the 2005 version, but at least here they always wear the same clothes, unlike that balderdash we see in the recent film. Looking at this movie, almost everything seems so fake and artificial in the "remake".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, it may not be faithful to the book (then again, has there ever been a novel based movie faithful to the books?), but it's still a lovable film with charm and character.The special effects in this film are rather realistic looking. That's kind of ironic, because this is one of these films where the special effects are more realistic than the ones in the remake. And the remake was made in 2005! What does that tell you? The plot is rather good too. Sure, like I said, it strays from the book in some ways, but the characters seem to be more faithful to the book. Charlie is a normal human boy with flaws like everyone else. Violet isn't a tomboy and has a feminazi mother, Veruca throws tantrums and screams and the TV addict boy is smart as well as smart allecky. And Willy Wonka seemed more likable in this version as well.My favorite parts are the Oompa Loompa songs and the creepy boat ride scene. Come on, who wasn't freaked out by the boat scene when they were little? Sad that they don't make movies like this anymore. I recommend this movie all the way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the best kids films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willie Wonka is the crazed solitary genius who lives in a mega-chocolate factory on the hill, where nobody has ever been. When he issues golden tickets to visit his factory, poor but dreamy boy Charlie is among the winners, and visits Wonka's magical world...Dahl apparently hated this version of his generation-transcending tale of greed and gluttony in a magical candy land. Viewers need not be alarmed however: a book is a book and a film is a film and each should be its own beast, and authors are often the least people who should tell how the film version should be (to note: every Stephen King novel adapted by King has been an artistic failure, when the adaptations he disliked - mainly Shinning - were great), and this is a case study of the phenomenon.Who better than Gene Wilder to play the manic, reclusive and unhinged Willie Wonka? He bravely carries the whole film on his shoulders and is assisted by a very competent young cast. The general tone is just as wonderful, as, unlike the newer version, things aren't spelled out for us (the factory's logic, Wonka's origins), because the film trust children to understand its internal logic, a brave and fulfilling move that is too rarely seen in today's film output (and probably earned the film some scorn from bewildered parents, which would explain its initial box-office failure).This version is the one to see, and Gene Wilder's ambivalent psychopath soars beyond Johnny Depp's gloomy creation. Unlike Tim Burton's mismatched mess, this world brims with colors, the Umpalumpas are a touch sinister and there is that touch of underlying darkness (the demented boat ride). That this gem's ratings have gone up since Burton's misguided version was released only attest further to its staying power and greatness.So, in fewer words, let go of your adult arrogance, allow yourself to be a child again, and dive into Willie Wonka's magical world. You're in for a rare thrill!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory/1971/****Main Stars: Gene Wilder Jack Albertson Peter OstrumI know I had taken a while to review one of my all-time favorites (which is this film) but I was trying to save this till the last minute. But I decided to review it now since there is nothing else to do. I have finally decided my favorite movie I have seen so far in my lifetime and that would not be this movie but the movie I reviewed before this and that movie is???????????????????? "The Untouchables" and I realize that "The Untouchables" is R rated and is very violent but who cares? I liked it anyway and that's that. Going on? this movie is another spectacular film of its time and it is starring Charlie (Peter Ostrum), his grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), and Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder)! Let me define this movie and I know almost all the lines by heart since I've seen it about a thousand times. Okay, Charlie hears about golden tickets (5) being put into (obviously) 5 Wonka bars being shipped all over the world. Charlie does not have confidence that he is going to win but yet he? (You know the story). He discovers an amazing chocolate factory from a chocolate waterfall, to a dark tunnel, to an inventing room, to an Oompa Loompa, to a HSAWAKNOW (which is WONKAWASH spelled backwards), to a Wonkavision room, to another Oompa Loompa, and so on? I did not list all of the things Charlie and the other brats saw because I'm too lazy. Going on? Charlie (according to Willy Wonka) is the best most docile person inside the factory but Charlie doesn't know that. Then Charlie seems to have more confidence in himself because all the other brats are all gone except for him at the end of the movie. You find out the ending and by now you should know that without me telling you. This film was remade with the same people except Charlie's dad was in the remake. The dad was dead in the original film "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". The very quirky Tim Burton directed "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I'm a fan of him but when it came to seeing that movie, I was not too fond of him. Later I went to see "Tim Burton's Corpse Bride" and that was a great movie so I changed my mind again about Tim Burton. Okay?! Got it?! Why did I like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"? Because I thought the story was very unique (duh Roald Dahl) and because it had good acting esp. by Gene Wilder and it was overall entertaining. Movie directed by Mel Stuart.</fullReview>

Yeah, the Oompa-Loompa's "sang" in the book, but the words were completely different. And there was a Mr. Bucket, Charlie's father, in the book. But he wasn't in the movie at all. What's up with that? I haven't seen the remake yet. I'm sure it's just as good, if not better, than this film. But I know it's not a musical like the original. (At least I hope it isn't.)My only other problem is how it ended. Mr. Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe were in the Great Glass Elevator; (although Mr. Wonka calls it a "Wonkavator") the last part was them flying through the sky.In the book, they actually go back to Charlie's house and pick up the rest of the family. They don't do it in this movie. Why? Other than that, it's not bad. I just wish they hadn't turned it into a musical.My REAL score: 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think most of America, at least, has seen this movie. It's considered a classic in our society and a rite of passage for every American kid. I obviously have seen this movie but I thought it was only just OK. I thought the book was worse but the movie is far from great. The scenes with the Wonka-obsessed adults I thought were presented in a way that was hard for children to understand. I felt like I was watching an adult movie. I have to say this for the book: it did a better job in that department. If anything, this movie wasn't a very good adaptation. Plus, I thought it was a little out-of-character when Wonka blew up at Charlie and his grandpa. That was another element I thought was too grown-up. However, this movie has its winning points. I'm glad that unlike the book, the kids brought one parent each instead of both of them. That makes for less crowding. I also like how they added in Slugworth and his everlasting gobstopper test. All in all, this is just an OK movie. Its atmosphere was just a little too bizarre for my taste. It's still better than the book and mildly enjoyable to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film not without flaws, but fantastic nonetheless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory" has divided critics and moviegoers alike since it was first released. Doubtless there are some who would not enjoy this movie, as with any movie, but it is certainly among the best kids movies ever made, that is also enjoyable for adults. The film deals with a boys journey through the chocolate factory of the eccentric Mr Willy Wonka. It is an adaptation of a novel by acclaimed children's author Roald Dahl, and as such, the plot is whimsical and engrossing. I have no complaints with the plot, except for Charlie visiting his mother at the laundry, an intrusive device to allow the inclusion of a song that is boring at best. The song was supposed to give some emotional impact, and give us a look into the relationship between Charlie and his mother. The only thing this achieves, is to leave the viewer wondering why Charlie did not even consider asking his mother to accompany him to the chocolate factory, instead of his bedridden (and lazy) grandfather. Aside from this small complaint, I believe the plot is excellent.The casting of the film is superb, leading to some great acting. The obvious standout is Mr Gene Wilder, who gives the performance of his lifetime as Willy Wonka. He is charming, eccentric, dark and a little bit scary. Of course no small amount of this is due to a script that gives him some great lines. Still, we must take nothing away from Gene Wilder, who gives a performance that most actors would give their right arms to equal. Other characters are also memorable, such as; Charlie's teacher, Veruca, Veruca's father, Violet, Mr Slugworth and the candy store owner. All of the actors playing these parts give exceptional performances. In regards to the characters, the only real complaint is Charlie himself. He is noticeably the weakest link in the chain. This is not entirely the actors fault, though he must shoulder some of the blame. The character, as written, is weak. He is given nothing memorable to say or do. He seems to be your classic goody-two-shoes (despite the "fizzy lifting drink" episode, obviously added to try and combat this problem). Charlie is supposed to be the "straight" character, in that he is the normal one. This is to give the other characters someone to "bounce off" if you will. However this idea was carried much to far, to the detriment of the film. Such is the problem that every second Charlie is on screen, we wish for the camera to focus on a different character. Other than this, the characters, and acting, are great.It may seem that this review is rather critical given the rating (10/10). This rating was given in response to the amount of enjoyment that one can get from watching this film. The movie is flawed, yet it is a great movie nonetheless. No movie is perfect, despite what some fans might say. But a great movie is enjoyable in spite of its flaws. This is a must see movie. Please, before seeing the new Tim Burton version, watch Mel Stuart's version, as it is one of the great films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Traveling in a world of my creation"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sit down to watch a movie I want to be transported someplace else and I want to walk away feeling SOMETHING. When I sat down to watch 'Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory' (after many years of not seeing it) I still loved it, I still felt happy at the end and I still believed that there was that golden ticket out there for the taking. The viewer is carried away into a world where good is rewarded and evil is punished (or sent down a garbage chute!). In the end you walk away feeling that good begets good and all is right in the world...if only through the course of the film.Even though the film was made in 1971 it is not dated and the effects hold up. Gene Wilder plays a quirky chocolatier who randomly slips into the erratic but guides five children into a world of pure imagination. His performance is infallible and unfaltering. Along the way the viewer is able to see what behavior is unacceptable, thanks to the Oompa Loompa's musical morality. The film does leave some questions unanswered. The most glaring being where are Charlie's parents? If you as the viewer can dismiss reality and all logical explanation for just a few hours...you're in for a wild ride.The sign of a "classic" film is one that holds up through time. This movie is perfect for families needing a night's entertainment. The same is true for adults wanting to recapture the first time they stepped through the doors of the mystical factory, golden ticket in hand. David Seltzer was able to take the basic premise of Roald Dahl's book and create a timeless screenplay that transcends the years. He may have digressed but the end result is a movie that many generations can view and still enjoy with bright-eyed innocence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is tell all of every child's dream. To not only go to what is marveled, in the movie, all over the world by each and every child who eats candy, but to WIN the place too? Hello!! Win it because you found a dollar in the gutter, amidst on being down in the dumps because you of all people really, really love WIlly Wonka candy. Then, to be put into a position to screw him over when you think you're getting the shaft, and to NOT do it because you admire and respect everything this chocolate maker does is an incredible story line. But that's not all, because you were so true to your beliefs, you now OWN the factory yourself. How awesome is this? Put that together with the line of all movie lines... "Charlie, did you hear about the boy who suddenly got everything he wanted? He lived happily ever after." Hallmark moment!!! NO matter how old you are, this movie has the storyline and sub-plots for you. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why a remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie! Gene Wilder was awesome as Wonka, and the original movie is a kids classic. Now there is a new movie coming out directed by Tim Burton. He makes such interesting movies and is a creative director, but I wonder why he couldn't have moved forward with one of the other Wonka stories. Certainly Johnny Depp is an "odd enough" and versatile actor to play the recluse of Wonka, but would have much preferred they left Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory for Wilder and let Depp play Wonka on The Great Glass Elevator. Still, will go see the new movie and see how Burton has "darkened" the Wonka character. I'm hoping it will still be a lite enough movie for younger kids, but am guessing this will not be the case. If you get a chance, check out the trailer by doing a net search for the new movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be remade as a horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie as a child, but looking back on it today it is almost a step or two away from being a horror movie. The strange red-faced people, children meeting with unfortunate accidents, and that boat scene...whoa! In the end though this was a pretty good movie for kids even if it didn't really teach them very good lessons. I mean come on; three of the kids weren't exactly that bad...only the spoiled brat deserved some punishment. In this movie though it is apparently evil to want to be a TV star, a fat kid, and someone who chews gum. The story is about a contest to get into the chocolate factory and of course the kids above win a chance, and so does the poor kid Charlie. Though considering how many kids have accidents in the factory they would have been better off in a knife warehouse. The red-faced dudes are a bit annoying, but Gene Wilder turns in an excellent performance...but what the heck is up with that scene on the boat? All in all a good movie for children...one question though, how much stuff in that one room full of candy was actually edible?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good dark chocolate, but no Lindt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a musical. Every so often a character will start singing, but this is because (a) the film falsely believes that it's a musical, and (b) it's worried that its musical guild membership will lapse if too many consecutive minutes pass without a song. Admittedly, the Oompa-Loompa song isn't, and arguably contributes something; it would contribute more if it were the ONLY song, and thus evidence of how unusual and surreal the chocolate factory is, but since so many people sing such weak songs elsewhere in the film the effect is lost. (And isn't "Cheer Up, Charlie" DIRE?)I can't believe that there are people who think this enjoyable concoction is too dark. Too dark for children to enjoy? Who cares. Too dark to be any good? You can't be serious. It's several tones lighter than "Citizen Kane", itself not a particularly grim movie, so stop complaining. We're even told that the four nasty children emerged from their ordeal unscathed, which was an aesthetic mistake - we ought to have been left in doubt, with a strong reason to believe that one or two of them had perished or at least been permanently injured. What's the point of introducing us to the perilous side of the chocolate factory if all the perils turn out to be harmless? When Veruca was sent down the garbage chute, we took pleasure in this because we thought there was a very real chance she would be killed - and then we felt guilty about our pleasure, so Willy Wonka tells us at the end that nothing really happened, which enables us, so the theory goes, to have our cake and eat it.One more complaint: there's a failure of surrealist imagination inside the chocolate factory. It isn't THAT marvellous a place, and we don't really see how Willy Wonka manages to produce the best chocolate in the world - in fact, between you and me, I don't believe he does. But this is a letdown largely because the long lead-up is so good. It's hard to know what to make of a film so uneven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a child when this film was made and I know it's considered a classic. And there's no denying that the sets and the props are outstanding. They truly created a dream world, a child's image of what a chocolate factory would be like. And there are important lessons about how to behave. But the unrelenting meanness of this film was too much. With the exception of the hero, the children are overly obnoxious. What are the odds that of all the winners of the contest, all but one would be among the worst a parent could raise? Julie Dawn Cole is absolutely brilliant in her role as an obnoxious dbutante and the other actors do well. Also, the musical numbers are well-written and performed. But it seems as if the naughty are being set up to do bad things so that Wonka can have an excuse to see them suffer. Willie Wonka at times seems to lure the children into misbehaving so he can enjoy watching them get punished. The unrelenting nastiness permeates the entire movie and as a result, I never enjoyed it as much as I wanted to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really funny thanks to Gene Wilders performance and some production design gadgets. For this is a real pity that Mel Stuart direction be so anodyne. He doesn't has style and he is incapable to provide the movie with style and real atmosphere. A possible fantasy gem is lost. The mise-en-scene is rather bland and flat ala Disney. The strange elements of the story (the subtle "perversity" of Willy Wonka, the boat ride scene, the "insinuations" to different substance addictions ...) seems reduced to like-a-joke ingredients. The movie is to enjoy like a kid for its whole shameless tone but without the cinematographic rigour that could rise the movie to a real artistic value.Newest Roald Dahls book adaptation is much more incisive and technically professional respecting Tim Burton direction but also it is much less winsome than Stuarts movie. The aseptic CGI effects and horrid musical numbers ruined the possibilities of a pure Sense of Wonder.Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolat Factory (1971) - 5.5/10. Charlie &amp; the Chocolat Factory (2005) - 4.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching Movie But i hate Wonka!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie very touching until they got to the factory.(Warning Contains spoilers!) Charlie Bucket is a very poor boy who has a love for chocolate. He lives with his mum and four grandparents (of which he favours grandpa Joe) who have been in bed for 20 years. He lives in the same town as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory which hasn't been open for years. One day it was announced that Wonka will let 5 people in if they found the gold tickets. The first 4 were found by naughty greedy brats first Ourgust Gloop a greedy German boy then Vereca Salt a spoilt brat whose rich father forced his factory workers to unwrap Wonka bars till they found one. then Violet Beeruagard a gum chewer with bad manners then Mike Teevee a TV lover and a pain in the neck.Then the miracle happens Charlie finds a golden ticket and his dream comes true he and his grandpa Joe go to the factory.Oh dear then we meet Wonka a Weired seemingly friendly chocolate factory owner. though he dosen' care that Orgustus nearly drowns in his chocolate river or that violet turns into a blue berry by his dangerous products, then he doesn't cared that Vereca falls down the eggdicater or that mike Teevee shrunk by sending himself be television though all their parents were worried sick. In the end Charlie gets the chocolate factory because he was the only one left, which i was very pleased about but a definitely hate Wonka. But i was very impressed by Gene Wilders performance he played a great Wonka</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood can't figure out Roald Dahl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it disgraceful everyone likes this movie. Yes, I know which Chocolate Factory I'm reviewing, and no, I did not like it. Roald Dahl is the greatest children's book author ever. His stories are filled with wonderful characters, smartly crafted story lines, and pure creativity. But Hollywood cannot get his vision right. What is Gene Wilder doing in this movie? He clearly doesn't understand what Willy Wonka is supposed to be like. Willy Wonka is supposed to be mysterious, quirky, fun, and full of delight. Here, he's so bland that there's hardly any appeal to him whatsoever. Oh, and don't forget the dumb score, which is very forgettable, very dated, and has no understanding of what Roald Dahl intends to make audiences feel. Yes, I know that Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay. But what you don't know is that he didn't like Gene Wilder in that role, that another writer wrote the script behind Roald's back, and that he didn't get to contribute much. He had every right to be unhappy. The writing is so unfaithful to the book I want to throw the TV out the window, not to mention how they changed the great-glass elevator into the Wonkavator. I hate how everyone loves this movie. People don't understand the brilliance of Roald Dahl, and it's a shame that they're being taught an faux vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" was based on Road Dahl's book "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory". It's about a young boy named Charlie who gets a Golden Ticket. This ticket allows him and a parent to enter the Chocolate Factory owned by Willy Wonka. There, we get something similar to a horror film-children are picked of one by one. Why? Because they are bad children.I enjoyed this film, but I can't see why so many people like it. I thought the music was fantastic (ecspecially the "I got a Golden Ticket" song.) I thought it also had some good jokes, but I forgot what they were.My only guess is that this-and the fact that it may be heart-warming to some is why people like it. For me, it was too weird and kind of overdid it. "Being John Malcovich" had a style of inventiveness, but this just seemed like many other films being called original; It's an adventure film with weird things that often appear.I enjoyed it, but I never found it heart-warming.Fans of this will like "Singin' in the Rain" (1952) and possibly "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

		<fullReview>by Corey Duncan.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is the most fun-filled movie ever been made for TV or the movie screen. So rent this movie today because it will have you laughing. I think Willy Wonka is the best movie made to have ever been seen on a movie screen.Willie Wonka has a few funny scenes in it. The first funny scene was when Augustus Gloop fell in the chocolate river and got stuck in the tube. Another funny scene was when Peter Guff got shrunk into a microscopic boy. The last funny scene was when Violet ate a piece of candy and turned into a blueberry.The next part of the movie was an action-packed part. Charlie got the golden ticket and everybody tried to get it from him. Willy Wonka freaked out when Charlie and his grandpa were the last ones left to finish the trip. The elevator scene was action-packed because you didn't know if they were going to have enough speed to break through the glass ceiling and fly.The third part of Willy Wonka was the scary part. Charlie and the rest of the people were on a boat going through a tunnel. They saw all those pictures pop up in front of them. It was pretty scary! The last scary part was when Mr. Slugworth kept following Charlie everywhere.The last part of the movie was the suspense part. The first suspense part was if that man was going to kill Charlie. The second part was when Charlie opens up the candy bar and there was not a gold ticket inside of it. The last suspense part was when Willy Wonka himself gave Charlie the chocolate factory for him to operate. So now Charlie owns the chocolate factory in the new movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</fullReview>

If, on the other hand, are curious to find out why this 1971 outing is considered a cult movie, give it a try.The story is well known:five kids,including Charlie Bucket(Peter Ostrum) find the Golden Tickets and get to visit the local chocolate factory,where they will see weird inventions,the charming Oompa Loompas and,most of all,the man behind the whole thing,Willy Wonka(Gene Wilder).There are only two things both versions (Mel Stuart and Tim Burton's, that is) have in common:the Oompa Loompas singing after the bad kids are "punished",and,in a certain way,the opening sequence.Charlie's relationship with Grandpa Joe gets more attention than in the remake,while on the other hand there are more musical numbers,which actually are the one thing I don't like about the movie(people complained about them in Burton's version as well, but at least Danny Elfman's work had some appeal).They're beautifully choreographed,that's true,but the dull, obnoxious songs aren't exactly like in Disney films. In fact, they make the film more childish and less Dahl-likeWilder's Wonka, the best thing in the film, is sweet, funny, unpredictable, but still human, the exact opposite of Johnny Depp's crazy lone wolf.This movie is suitable for everybody, no matter the age(Burton's version isn't something 4-year olds should watch), and, despite a few differences between film and book, and the musical numbers,quite enjoyable.If,however,you're a purist,stick with Johnny Depp, but you have to admit Gene Wilder is great too.Sweet viewing,children (and grown-ups)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Weird, Original, but not for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a Gene Wilder movie, that's for sure. You've got word play, metaphors about life, double talk. It is also rather "magical", at least for 1971.The thing is that it didn't really impress me. It is a musical, which for me ruins all the fun in a movie, then it is so unintuitive that only somebody very passive could enjoy watching it. I mean, most movies about people in situations so weird that they can't even recognize, so forget about controlling them, are dramas or psycho movies. Their role is to feel you with hopelessness while watching them. This one, though, it's a slight comedy with a moral. I found these two things irreconcilable.I watched this movie because it is the original film for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, with Johnny Depp, which I am going to watch one of these days. It is my own "Now and Then" show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploring the Chocolate Factory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looming upon us, I think it's time we explored the original one more time.One commentator whose review of this film was totally hostile got a lot of the elements of the production's backstory utterly incorrect. Thank goodness that Mel Stuart, the film's director, set everyone straight with his recently published book, "Pure Imagination: The Making of 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'." According to Mel, his then 12-year-old daughter, who had read the Roald Dahl book, was the person who first suggested the idea for the film, and that her father take the idea to his then boss, producer/presenter David L. Wolper. After Mel did exactly that, Wolper in turn took the idea to executives at the Quaker Oats Company."Quaker Oats? That's not a studio, that's a food company," Mel told Dave. But that, oddly, was exactly why Quaker wanted to get into the movies to begin with: to promote a candy bar to be made by its then confectionery division. The irony: even when the Wonka movie was completed, Quaker never got around to manufacturing its proposed candy bar, let alone promoting it.Yes, the film was released in its original theatrical run by Pararmount, but the initial deal called for that studio to hold onto the U.S. distribution rights for seven years, at the end of which time said rights would revert back to Wolper Pictures, Limited and the Quaker Oats Company, who, after all, were the joint copyright holders of the film. Paramount was anxious to relieve itself of that 7-year deal anyway, and was therefore not willing to renew the terms of the deal. In 1977, David L. Wolper sold his namesake Organization to Warner Bros., at which point he then joined WB's Board of Directors, ultimately selling to Warners his own and Quaker Oats' 50% shares in the Wonka movie.The Stuart book explores the terms of the deal in greater detail than can be shared here; suffice to say, the incident shows us just how unwilling we sometimes are to get all the behind-the-scenes facts straight. It seems to me, friends, that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in its 1971 version was a film reeking of sweetness and magic, yet created specifically as an infomercial for a candy bar that in the end was neither manufactured, marketed or distributed. Today, any movie with a candy bar as its centerpiece would not be burdened with such problems; movie dealmaking today is more covering every base than skipping certain loopholes.Besides, I think the Burton remake represents a perfect opportunity to celebrate and re-examine the Wonka legacy.

		<shortDescription>Willy Gay or Not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the *#$@! This was one of the most freaky movies I have let my eyes befall. If you study symbolic meanings of literature and movies, like I do, you'll see the freakiness (is that a word) of Willy Wonka. I wonder how many viewers knew that the Oompah Loompahs were actually a representation of the African-American community. If you look at how they are "different" colored and subservient, you'll see the racism behind this movie as I and many others have. The same with The Wizard of Oz, which is a symbolic movie about the United States Government...but that's for another day. By the way, has anyone answered the question of whether Willy Wonka is gay or not. That purple outfit was out of style at the time, and a tad bit too flamboyant. Another thing is...does he resemble Michael Jackson---I think so. He might just have molested Charlie, but no one will ever EVER know. Thanks for listening. And Goodnight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame that I am really no fan of Gene Wilder! In most of his movies he simply gets on my nerves! This is pure irony because Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory could never have succeeded as the classic that it has become WITHOUT the superb performance of Gene Wilder!In the original novel by Roald Dahl "Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory"(actually currently remade and due for release in 2005) the "Willy Wonka" character was an eccentric elderly genius.Perhaps a little "odd" but nonetheless refined and "sane" in his approach to his visitors to his factory! In "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" Gene Wilder pulls out ALL the stops! His "Willy Wonka" carries the film with a vigor and a sense of mystery that the viewers cannot even figure out until the ending! This is clearly the role Gene Wilder wanted to play all of his life.And he does it his own way..like no one else EVER could!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has anyone noticed that in the movie all the adult couples have common names; Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, Grandpa George and Grandma Georgette, Veruca's parents, Henry and Henrietta. I always thought that was kind of interesting. This movie is so great. I do agree in some ways that it is more of an adult film with all the satire involved. I also wonder what did Charlie's Grandparents do about using the restroom if they occording to Charlies Mom had not been out of the bed in twenty years. Wonka says to Charlie at the end of the movie that only an adult could take over the factory because an adult would want to do things his own way. Plus I think that Wonka pre chose the winners, how else would Mr Sluggworth know were all the winners were as soon as they found the golden tickets???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, especially without "Cheer Up Charlie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the first to say it, but the song "Cheer Up, Charlie" is horrible. It's painful to listen to, and when this movie was shown on TV while I was growing up, I always left the room when Charlie's mother sang it. It doesn't help that the song adds nothing to the film; every other song in the production gives us exposition or mood. "Cheer Up, Charlie" just makes it drag and tells us what we already know: Charlie's sad that he hasn't won a golden ticket. Thanks, Mom.Thanks to the magic of VHS and DVD, however, I haven't had to put up with that awful song for years. Now I can see the rest of a beautiful, funny, scary, magical film that I first saw at age 6 in 1971 (!) It truly is watchable again and again. Compare this to, say, "E.T.", which seemed good the first time I saw it and awful every time since.Gene Wilder is brilliantly cast and does an excellent job of playing an eccentric just-this-side-of-loony Willy Wonka. Jack Albertson also turns in an excellent performance, as do most of the child actors and parents, not to mention Mr. Turkentine, Charlie's teacher. Peter Ostrum (Charlie) does a fair job; his role is the deepest and most difficult to play of all the children and I can't fault him for not being a ten-year-old Robert DeNiro.Was I scared, age 6, watching the decapitation of a chicken? Sure, but for.. what, 3 seconds? The movie (save for "Cheer Up, Charlie") moves fairly quickly. Who has time to think about chicken butchering when there is exploding candy to be seen?Roald Dahl is famous for bizarre stories involving children and cruel or incapable parents/caretakers ("James and the Giant Peach", "Matilda"), but he always puts the blame where it belongs and the deserving are rewarded. "Willy Wonka" is a worthy, if slightly different, adaptation of Dahl's book.I give the film a 9/10. Without "Cheer Up, Charlie", make it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another One of Those Films That Killed the Musical Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" is another one of those films of the late-1960s and early-1970s that killed the Hollywood musical. The film is long, tedious, and disjointed in too many areas to be a success. Gene Wilder stars as the titled character and he invites five kids to visit his famous factory after they find lucky tickets in their candy bars. Of course all the kids, but one, are total brats and the film tries to convey messages on how to rear children to be outstanding adults. That is about it for a sorry screenplay. The direction is poor as well. This is a good-looking film though as the production values are extremely high. Jack Albertson is priceless. He almost makes the film succeed all by himself, but not quite. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*The first time I saw this movie I was six years old. I remember watching it with my babysitter and I was very scared during parts of this movie. What happened to those children scared me and grossed me out. None of the children deserved what happened to them. Big deal they were greedy when it came to candy, like all children. They DID NOT deserve to blow up or get stuck in a pipe full of chocolate. That's just gross. It took me many years till I would watch this movie again. Last week I watched this movie for the second time on HBO. It wasn't as bad as I remembered but I still believe Willy Wonka hates children. The Oompa Loompas are another story. They're just plain scary looking. They belong in a horror film or as Halloween decorations or something.The only thing I liked about this movie were: the big candy (that was cool), the songs, the chocolate river, and little Mike (because he was really cute). I'm glad Charlie won the factory because he was poor.I give this movie 6/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', about to be remade, seems ripe for reappraisal. Two schools of thought - one thinks this film is inventive, timeless, and worthy of a place in the best kids movies of all time; the other thinks it is embarrassing trash which didn't work and which should be ditched for a much better interpretation.For me, it falls somewhere between the two extremes of good and bad. There's no denying that Gene Wilder's performance is irritating, but isn't that what Willy Wonka was? The horrible kids are just that, and completely deserve their fates within the walls of his gloopy sugary factory. And Charlie is a cute little hero.Anthony Newley's songs may be an acquired taste but I bet you go away from this film humming 'The Candy Man' or the Oompa Loompa song. The story is a good one - a toffee treat with a lot of bite. Will the remake be any better? I doubt it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shameless Horror-Propaganda, or Twisted Genius?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SICK SICK SICK, but either a sign of the times when such brazen brainwashing and homogenizing was the norm, or twisted-genius. Akin to those identity-stealing `educational' (read: propaganda) shorts, they teach you that everything you do is wrong and you are only slightly LESS wrong by denying individuality. One can only guess the true intent.Were the children cast as more villainous characters, one could almost rationally excuse and/or condone their ghastly fates. But they were mainly just being kids with their typical personality quirks, which many of which grow out of with proper care. And the so-called `hero' of the story is no less a meddlesome troublemaker, by the standards set by the other children, as illustrated in the bubble room.The lessons learned...? No children can resist sin, and all of them are evil? Affluence is evil? Only poor kids are worthy of a second chance? Evil masquerades in bright colors, and sings funny songs? Candy is bad?And that's just the underlying barely-subliminal wrong-messages (I didn't even touch the possible Freudian suggestions). Some OBVIOUS red flags should be the glorification of an unchecked crazed despotic slave driver with Svengali-like control over children and the media, breaking the laws of nature and physics (and probably many other laws), housing a small personal army, and endangering children in hopes of finding an heir.Good grief, is there a SINGLE positive message?Most other children's movies and shows are drivel, but are far less harmless. I wouldn't recommend this for ANY children you hope to grow up well adjusted. I DO, however, recommend adults to watch this. It's either a work of twisted-genius, or just a really bad kids movie. Either way, it's fun to analyze.</fullReview>

Knowing the book by heart I got pretty disappointed. It didn't quite follow it, and I don't know why. It's basically a very uncomplicated and short book that easily could have turned into a movie. And I just can't see why they have turned Willy Wonka from a strange but eccentric man (book) to a rambling nutcase (movie).But still. If you haven't read the book I can strongly recommend that you see this movie. A movie about dreams coming true, worlds that just exist in your imagination (and on film) and great humour. But for the real deal: Read the book. It's one of Roald Dahls best and don't forget to catch the second book (yes, there is two of them)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but with weak musical numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willy Wonka has long since locked his factory doors and operates in seclusion to produce wonderful chocolate without the risk of industrial spies. However he decides to open his factory doors to 5 lucky people who can find the golden tickets hidden in 5 of his bars. Charlie is a poor, honest kid who longs for the chance. When he finds a ticket he and 4 other children from around the world get the chance to enter the weird world of chocolate production with their guide, Willy Wonka himself.Based on the Roald Dahl book `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' this film is a wonderful little piece of imagination and whimsy. It is fun to watch for adults and children mainly because of it's endless imagination ? it simply doesn't draw the line at anything, it is colourful bright and fantastic. The film has plenty of jokes that only adults will get but also much for kids to appreciate ? I know that is the norm nowadays in kids films but remember this was 1971!As implied in the title, the film takes the focus off Charlie and puts it on Wonka himself. This is good because Charlie, bless him, is quite a dry little so and so! Putting the focus on Wonka is a good move and doesn't stop at the title ? Wonka is the sole of the film and much of the humour comes from him. Wilder is the only choice for the role and he pitches it perfectly, being understated and not going over the top at any real point. His dry style of humour is used well and he is as flamboyant and unusual as his surroundings. Albertson is good as Joe and Kinnear is recognisable as Salt. Overall the child actors all do good work being as horrible as their characters require. I felt like Ostrum got the short straw as his character is far too moral to be of great interest, I felt like I was only rooting for him because the rest were so horrid.Some of the music is quite poor. No, scratch that, the majority of the songs are poor or just lack lustre. None of them are really catchy or funny and none are that well choreographed. Only the Ompah-Lumpah song really catches my ear. It's a shame because the songs near the mid point really serve to slow the film down a bit. However despite this I still found it fun to watch.Over 30 years old and this is still a lot more fun than the CGI filled, soulless live-action kids films that seem to be doing the rounds of late (yes Harry Potter I'm looking at you).</fullReview>

My sister liked this film and has made me sit through about 50 showings of it and i feel ashamed to say it but i could probably recite the whole script to you. The actors were ok, i suppose, especilly gene wilder, who is just a fabulous actor any way in any movie, but certain points of the movie and just the plot itself made me cringe with disgust. What annoyed me the most though was those delighful orange faced, fluffy shoed umpa lumpas and there wonderful little rhymes. They haunt my day dreams and my dreams when im sleeping because them horrible little faces cannot just be forgotten and again the question of "why" popped up in my head. So all in all this movie has got to be the worst and most annoying movie i have ever seen and i would certainly not recommend buying it or even thinking about buying it unless you enjoy pain or are looking for a quick and easy way to end your life. I give this 2 out of 10 as i do find the complete stupidity of it quite humorous at some points.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a " Neverwhere " type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always liked this film. Despite the new film (which I like even more), I still enjoy the old fashioned aspects of this film. For 1971, it's pretty good children's fare--much better than crap from the same era (such as CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG and DR. DOOLITTLE). Some may find all the singing annoying or complain that the songs are not the ones Roald Dahl wrote in the book (which appear in the remake), I still found them catchy and cute. In fact, I have no major complaints other than the stupid sequence where they are on the boat. All the awful and pointless images projected across the screen look cheap and gratuitous--unlike the rest of the film.However, I think that the BEST thing to do is to watch this and the recent remake and think of them as totally different movies. The 1971 film is a bit saccharine and kitschy but is still fun and memorable. The new Johnny Depp version is much darker and full of modern special effects. And, as a result they are so different, it's worth watching them both and DON'T compare them--just enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistatke, "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is not a very well made movie. Since I never read the book, I have no idea where the story took place but the on location filming in Munich, Germany gives the movie a surreal feel. Maybe it was intended that way but I get the feeling that it was done for cost purposes. Even as a kid, I remember feeling that it was "foreign". You can tell the extras aren't Americans. They have that stiff look of people who were simply hired as background. The songs are pretty lame and sung terribly too. And the cinematography is washed out. All in all, it's not a pretty thing to look at. BUT...there's a lot of invention going on here that today's films lack and despite the casting of Johnny Depp and Director Tim Burton, the remake will lack as well. Sure it's cheap looking, but the film makers give it all they've got. The one clear thing the elevates the movie is the cast. Yes, Gene Wilder is great but it's the inspired child casting that makes the movie memorable. As Veruca Salt, Julie Dawn Cole never loses her brattiness. There's no attempt to ever soften her attitude and she's great throughout. As much as people would like to think of her character as a cartoon, anyone with children like me knows there are kids who act in this same way. And, like the movie says, it's the parent's fault. Not that the movie's "lessons" are important. They're simplistic blather. It's just that the casting is so memorable. It's the element that makes the movie so watchable. I never got scared as a kid watching the "boat scene". The scene that always bothered me was the one where Augustus Gloop got sucked up the pipe. And the fact that we never actually see any of the kids again.</fullReview>

It misses the mark, but it's not the worst of the game. After all, it has Oopmaloompa's, doesn't it??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst films of all time. Though very well put together and a good storyline I thought it was cheesy at the same time. And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own. This movie along with E.T. and The Wizard of Oz go down in my book as horrible movies and one I would not recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do like this movie don't get me wrong but I like the 2005 version better because it is more accurate to the book. the 2005 version tells the story the way Roald Dahl wrote it and Tim Burton did an awesome job directing it. The 1971 version changed a lot of things from the book like the Oompa loompa songs, Charlies dad being dead, Veruca's disappearance,etc. those are a few things that Mel Stuart should not have changed in this 1971 movie because it is not his story to change. It is Roald Dahls story so I am really not surprised that he hated it. I do like the singing in this one though except the Oompa Loompas. I especially liked Julie Dawn Coles singing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparks the Imagination, That's For Sure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fantasy sparks imagination, and in a film like "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," that's probably a good thing, because applying any sense of logic to this story will give you a brain tumor.The film centers around a small, poor, basically-homeless boy named Charlie. In his world, there is a chocolate company named Willy Wonka (which now does exist because of this movie), owned by a mysterious man with the same name: Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder). Wonka has started a worldwide phenomenon as he states that he has put five gold tickets in candy bars around the world. When all five are found, he will invite all the ticket holders into his mysterious candy factory, and show them his wonderful world, filled with a room made completely of candy, and Umpah Lumpahs, little short orange men with green hair.But Mr. Slugworth, who owns Slugworth Candy, wants to put a stop to Wonka's newest creation: The Everlasting Gobstopper (which is now made by Willy Wonka chocolate). After each ticket is found, he visits the ticket holders and tells them who he is, and that he wants them to bring (steal) back the Everlasting Gobstopper so he can study it and beat Wonka at his own game.So as Charlie finds a gold ticket and goes to Wonka's chocolate factory with his grandfather, he is tempted to steal one of the gobstoppers, but will he do it?I didn't always like this movie very much. I always liked the scene with the edible room and the Umpah Lumpahs, but everything else seemed odd and slow-moving to a certain degree. It's like taking Lewis Carroll and putting him in a room with Gene Wilder. That's what you get out of author Rohald Dahl's book, and the same can be said for the film. It has an odd sense of reality and twisted sense of humor.For example, all the children get whisked away one by one. For being a childrens' movie, this is quite odd, because I do not often see children being taken off screen like they are dead, especially in a childrens' story. One boy gets sucked through a tube of chocolate, to go into the boiling room; one girl turns into a giant balloon, and one boy gets transported into a television and can't get back out. All interesting but nevertheless deeply strange scenes.Gene Wilder was the perfect choice for the strange Willy Wonka--he fits him like a glove. Wilder doesn't seem to appear in films much anymore, but I guess he ended on a high note. "The Producers," "Young Frankenstein," and "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" all on his resume, I'd say he has quite a good one. I looked at his most recent films, and in 1999 he appeared in and wrote a made-for-TV film; after that he hasn't really been in much. I guess that's because he sensed the bad films coming and wanted out before he started appearing in more TV movies.But anyway, Wilder is perfect. He seems to state the odd as if there is nothing odd about it. I love the scene where he talks about the Umpah Lumpahs and where they live, and the geography teacher in the room says, "I'm a geography teacher, and"--he cuts her off, saying, "Oh, good, then you know all about the bad place? Why, the [somethings] would eat ten Umpah Loompahs a day and think nothing of it!"His tale is odd, yet strangely entertaining.I've never really been one for tales of oddness. I like "Alice in Wonderland," but even that is a bit too odd for my taste. I seem to like realistic films (well, at least films that take place in our world). I like comedies, action, drama, sci-fi--the works; but I've never been one for fantasies.But if one film has ever sparked imagination, nothing has as much as "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."3.5/5 stars - maybe 4 -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry Spanner In The Saccharine Works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm clearly out of kilter with the public mood on this one.I thought WWATCC was the most boring kids' movie I've ever seen. It was slow, patronising and contrived from the outset. Unfortunately; if you'd read the book, you knew pretty well what was coming next. And the trouble then was that the sets and props never lived up to the imagination.Tempo inside the choc-works didn't improve. The 'Oompa Loompa' song just about saw me dozing off. As to Gene Wilder's Wonka; I couldn't mesh with him at all, not even as a fantasy character. His mood-swings were actually a wee bit scary. And when he was being meaningfully nice, it really made me rather cringe. Much too sweet for my tastes. The sets were as colourful as a kids' fantasy movie could be, but they never stopped looking cheap and stagy. The dialogue was trite, the surprises unsurprising. Frankly; I think 5 stars is a generous award.The ancient 'Wizard Of Oz' could kick this into a sweet-vat with a glass slipper. It is superior by any evaluation. At first, I thought this was because I'm not a Wilder fan, but there's been a recent remake employing Johnny Depp in the Willy Wonka role. Sadly, that one didn't do anything for me either.I dunno; everyone seems to love it but me. I'm an outcast and a pariah. But I won't apologise for thinking it's crap.Peter Cooke &amp; Dudley Moore should have starred in it. Then again; maybe not.Can't Recommend A Purchase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This screen adaptation of Dahl's classic is a insult to the great man's name. Firstly it is very badly Americanised, Charlie did not come from Alabama he was British for goodness sakes. Secondly the acting is poor. Whoever played Charlie was clearly miscast and the grandparent's look as if they are fit as a fiddle not couped up in bed for 20 years. The Chocolate Room is a real case of Technicolour vomit and how can this be classed as family viewing when there are images of a man with a leech crawling over his face and a chicken being decapitated. Also I don't recall Dahl using the term 'Great Glass Wonkavator' Wonka this Wonka that, it really ruins the book. The songs are god-awful too. The only redeeming feature is Gene Wilder apart from that don't bother with this try The Witches instead</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Product of a SICK MIND!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roald Dahl is a man with a SICK MIND!!! What kind of man would have a kid nearly drown in chocolate milk, get sucked up through a pipe and sent to a fudge processor? Or have a kid fall through an egg weigher and get dumped into an incinerator? Or turn a kid into a giant blueberry? Or have a kid's atoms blasted to oblivion leaving him the size of a Ken doll, then sending the mini-kid to a taffy puller to have him vivisectioned? No matter how bratty those kids were, nobody deserves that to happen as a child.Such violence is fine when enacted on culpable, evil adults in Quentin Tarantino/John Woo/Robert Rodriguez style movies, but not in a movie supposedly aimed at children where the children are made the targets of this violence. This movie should be rated PG 13 in my opinion due to this stuff. I'm not going to let my daughter see this movie until she's in middle school because of these outcomes. Roald Dahl needs to be sent to an insane asylum!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (1971) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Charlie (Peter Ostrum), a poor boy, gets one of five winning tickets to take a magical tour through Willy Wonka's (Gene Wilder) factory. Here's a popular film that had escaped me over the years but I finally tried it since my girlfriend was wanting me to see the remake. There's a lot to enjoy here and a lot to take in but at the end of the film I can't say I had a great time. There's certainly a lot to enjoy here but the second half of the film really left me bored to the point where I was struggling to stay awake. The greatest thing for the film is the incredible production design, which gives us all sorts of great sets with the best being the river a chocolate. The four naughty kids go through all sorts of strange tricks and gags but I didn't really find any of them funny and it didn't really give me any drama since it's rather clear how the movie is going to end. Another thing that does work are the three leads led by Ostrum who is extremely good in his role. To me Jack Albertson really steals the film as the boy's grandfather and he also gives the best musical number in the film. Wilder has become a legend since making this movie and there's no doubt that this is one of his most memorable roles. He does a great job with it and turns in a fun character but I must say I didn't think it was the best of his career. I might be the only one to think it but I found the first half of the film to be a lot more charming, thoughtful and entertaining than what actually happens in the factory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Changing the original title of the book, this is quite good for a classic musical with some memorable songs and a good leading actor. Basically, a chocolate factory in the town Charlie Bucket(introducing Peter Ostrum) lives is sending out millions of chocolate bars worldwide, five of them contain golden tickets for a trip to the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. One by one the tickets are found, and eventually, Charlie gets his. This ticket takes them into the magical world of the highly imaginative and bizarre chocolate factory, with the great eccentric Willy Wonka (Golden Globe nominated Gene Wilder). Obviously all the nasty kids go one by one. Fat and greedy German Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) up the chocolate tube, gum chewing Violet Beauregard (Denise Nickerson) turns into a blueberry, spoilt rich bitch Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole) falls down the bad golden egg shoot for being a bad (not the original idea in the book) and telly loving Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) is shrunk by the Wonka Vision laser. A slightly more accurate (to the book) remake by Tim Burton was made in 2005, with the original title of course. This version was nominated for the Oscar for Best Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Music for Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley and Walter Scharf. It was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a mixed bag. As an adult I'm always moved when, after a wonderful twist, the virtuous, deserving Charlie wins his golden ticket. The first half hour in the Wonka factory is filled with strange wonders that will provoke a childs imagination. After seeing it multiple times, and noting it's preponderance of dumb problems, it's easy to forget that Peter Ostrum who plays Charlie is really quite good.While there are terrific scenes for kids, Roald Dahl's sinister tone and Wonka's dry observations of children in peril make it more suitable for adults who like childrens movies. As a kid my parents would never let us watch past the boat/tunnel sequence which is, admittedly, quite bizarre.Some of the melodies are OK, but the lyrical choices and the way words are metered is really heinous. Your ears will cry out in pain. It's like Anthony Newley wrote the whole thing in half an hour while poking a cat with a fork. "I Want it Now" is as bad as anything in the worlds worst musical (Peter Pan - "I'm flyin..." ) It's also much too long, like other kids musicals of the era (The unmercifully paced Chitty Chitty Bang Bang).I also wondered why they would remake it, but watching it this afternoon, I can see much, much room for improvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This lame and terrible adaptation of the first book I read as a child should be burned and forgotten. So many pointless changes where made, terrible songs where added and the magic was drained from the original prose. Even as a very small child I did not understand why they gave the movie a different title, then I realized it was because it had nothing to do with the book.Very little of Rould Dahls story is here, instead we are flooded with cheap sets, chocolate that looks like dirty water, bad acting and the some of the worse songs ever. I've seen several trailers for the new adaptation, and I'm hyped to see the great glass elevator fly at last! Pass on this one, go with Tim Burton's film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone knows this movie, what with the endless supply of candy. It's hard to believe that Dr. Fronk-en-steen played Willy Wonka, or that "The Man" from "Chico and the Man" played the grandfather. I've read Roald Dahl's book, which didn't have a bunch of songs (except those from the Oompa Loompas).I will be eager to see what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp do with the remake, as they are both people whom I trust. Granted, Gene Wilder has always been good (especially when co-starring with Richard Pryor), but this version of "Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory" was pretty hokey. Still, the scene where the girl turns into a blueberry was kinda neat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Willy Wonka, as played by Gene Wilder, is the grown-up stranger all parents warn their kids not to talk to. He's smarmy. He's a little TOO friendly. He's horribly frightening. And to my utter astonishment, he turns out to be deadly. If I were 10 years old and I encountered Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, I would run screaming from his presence as fast as my terrified little legs would carry me. I certainly wouldn't accept an invitation to visit his hellish chocolate factory where small children are slurped to their demise in giant vats of confection. This is supposed to be a CHILDREN'S film? It belongs on a double-feature bill with "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." What a perverted, hateful movie, and what a dirty trick to play on innocent children.</fullReview>

I recommend the new &amp; improved version directed by Tim Burton &amp; composed by Danny Elfman. Johnny Depp was great and much better then Gene Wilder. Freddy Heighmore also did a better job in my opinion then the other actor who played Charlie in the 1971 version. The ompa loompa's were much better in this film. I feel they had more of a purpose in the new film,Deep Roy did a great job playing the ompa loompa's. Definitely go rent the 2005 film "Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory" instead of this 1971 movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly the worst movie ever made. Every second I was watching it my eyes were being burned out. First of all, I thought that the book was OK. It had its charm, but wasn't a great American classic. This movie is not the book, they took the same general concept and then put their own bad spin on everything. I don't mind if they change some things like the squirrels to geese, because they did not have the technology to do squirrels. But changing the song lyrics and adding their own songs, that was bad. The Ommpa Loompas were all wrong, how anyone could even come up with the idea of making their skin orange and hair green is anyone's guess. I could have done with out the demonic chanting when their on the boat. Have you even read the lyrics? Wonka &amp; Cast: Round the world and home again That's the sailor's way Faster faster, faster fasterThere's no earthly way of knowing Which direction we are going There's no knowing where we're rowing Or which way the river's flowingIs it raining, is it snowing Is a hurricane a-blowingNot a speck of light is showing So the danger must be growing Are the fires of Hell a-glowing Is the grisly reaper mowingYes, the danger must be growing For the rowers keep on rowing And they're certainly not showing Any signs that they are slowingThis is scary. Is Wonka trying to kill these kids? And they say that the new movie is dark. At least Wonka warns them, and not in the weird way Wilder did. Sure, he has not been around people in a while and he obviously cares more about his candy than the kids, but he should still care a little. Do yourself a favor and never see this horrid movie.</fullReview>
