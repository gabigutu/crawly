		<shortDescription>The passing of the old ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other reviewers, aside from seeing this as the end of the classic western, saw the plot as myth granting to one man that which was rightfully another's. I disagree. I see TMWSLV as a tale of a man stepping aside for the sake of a better man and a better world, at great personal cost.I view Tom as someone who has lived a cynical life--kill it before it kills you. With the advent of Ransom he recognizes that there is a better way, and that Ransom, by defying evil from a position of weakness, is far braver than Tom, who has merely defied evil from a position of strength. Additionally, Ransom brings about an answer to the question "must the sword rule forever?" with a resounding "no," a denial that at first seems foolish to Tom, but who then realizes that things really should be Ransom's way.And so Tom, knowing that one of them is the better man, allows that better man to receive the fame attendant to heroism; and in fact Ransom, for daring what Tom never did dare, is the true hero of the tale. Like all honest men must, Tom steps aside for the better man, knowing what it will cost him to do what is right.An earlier reviewer said that the depiction of the politics was a parody; in fact, the politics of the early portion of the republics was even more lively (read: pugnacious) than is depicted in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend". - Maxwell Scott, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance In John Ford's most mournful tale, the legendary director asks the question "How did this present come to be? Just how did an inferior race of men whose only weapon was that of law and books defeat the old gunslingers of the great West? Just what exactly happened to the Western heroes portrayed by John Wayne when law and order came to town? How did the wilderness turn into a garden? In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, John Ford depicts a world where everyone has got everything they wanted, but nobody seems happy with it? sound familiar to anyone? Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arrives to Shinbone on a train with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to visit the funeral of an old friend named Tom Doniphon (John Wayne, remarkably the film opens where this iconic star is dead). The newspaper men have never heard of him, so why would such a powerful political figure visit the town to attend this funeral of a "nobody"? Through the use of a flashback, Stoddard tells us the tale of how he came to the town as a young lawyer but was immediately attacked by the psychotic villain Liberty Valance (terrifyingly played by Lee Marvin) who teaches him "Western law". The rest of the film tells the tale of how the man of books eventually defeated the race of the gunslinger and what sacrifices had to be made for that to happen.In truth, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is more of a melodrama than a Western. Gone are the vibrant landscapes of Ford's landmark movie The Searchers six years earlier, which was so proudly promoted as being in VISTAVISION WIDESCREEN COLOR and instead the film has given way to a bleak, claustrophobic black and white tale, with so many enclosed sets and not one shot of Monument Valley.There's a lack of a real bar scene, lack of shots of the landscape, lack of horses, lack of gunfights. It's a psychological Western, probably unlike anything ever filmed until maybe Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven.Why is this movie so good then? In basic terms, it's about the sadness of progression and without giving way too much away the film tells a remarkable tale which truly does examine what Ford's view of the West as promoted in his earlier work truly meant. It's a tragic and pessimistic movie but it's a rewarding one, with huge replay value and one that leaves you with so many more questions than it does answers.Do we prefer the legendary tale of our heroes or the truth? Are tales of people such as 'The Man With No Name' just more interesting than Wyatt Earp? Is living a lie as a successful guy better or worse than quietly dying as a hero? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the most complex Westerns that has ever been put on film and is a remarkable film when you consider it was directed by a guy who made his living telling grandeur tales of the American West. Well acted, very well written and is one of the most rewarding Westerns for replay value in the history of the genre.Matt Holmes www.obsessedwithfilm.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford's Last Big One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sad movie in many ways. Ford is closing the book on his meditations on progress here. The black and white photography itself is rather depressing -- most of the scenes, including all the important ones, seem to take place at night, in the dark. And what do they show us? As Edmund O'Brien puts it, the West began with Indians and buffalo and the only law was survival. Then the cattlemen moved in and took the land over and the law was that of the hired gun. Now the West has been settled by hard-working farmers and turns into a garden, once the power brokers are out of the way. But it's a wistful garden. The cactus roses have disappeared and been replaced by turnips. And the rowdy, raucous, plain-speaking heroes and villains have been replaced by pretentious blowhard politicians of th e sort that Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) has become.The framing story begins with Senator Stewart and his wife, Vera Miles, coming back to Shinbone for the funeral of the uknown Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). "Where are his boots?," Stewart asks upon seeing Wayne's body laid out, "Put his boots on." (Ford claimed this incident was borrowed from Tom Mix's funeral.) A few of the old crowd are still around but the streets of Shinbone are empty and are a tired gray. Everyone is now old. Stewart patronizes Wayne's old retainer, Pompey (Woody Strode), giving him a handful of bills and saying, "Pork chop money." Some "garden"!Ford could be a sadistic director. He asked Stewart what he thought of Woody Strode's old-age makeup: the white fringe of hair, the overalls, the slouch hat. Stewart said it looked okay, but Ford prompted him for criticism until Stewart finally admitted that, "Wahhll, it's a little Uncle Remus, isn't it?" It's what Ford was waiting for. "I designed that outfit myself, and that's exactly what I had in mind." He called everyone over -- cast and crew alike -- and said, "Mister Stewart here thinks there's something wrong with Woody's wardrobe. Maybe he doesn't like Woody's wardrobe. Maybe he doesn't like Negroes!"Well, if the present is filled with nostalgia, the past is lively enough, and the flashback, which is to say most of the film, is full of action and gusto. People just don't eat in John Qualen's restaurant. They eat huge platters of steaks, beans, potatoes, and deep dish apple pie. The steaks come sizzling from the vast greasy grill and are large enough to hang over the edges of the over-sized platters. Lee Marvin and his henchmen (Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin) enact their villainy with relish. John Wayne is, of course, the hero of the tale. You can tell because, in addition to his John Wayneness, he wears the only black and white outfit in the cast, which draws attention to his figure whenever it is on screen. In fact, though, Wayne does a reasonably decent job of playing Doniphon after his fall. When he enters the political meeting toward the end, banging open the swinging doors, staggering slightly, bearded, shabby, his magnificent white hat replaced by a battered gray one, slightly bleary, he looks and acts like a man who has been defeated but has not yet died, putting up a brave front with nothing left behind to prop it up. He's not bad in this scene. For the most part, though, he plays John Wayne, the resolute, proud man of principle. Edmund O'Brien is the comic town drunk and editor, the Thomas Mitchell part, and is given some amusing lines, including quotes from Henry V. (Actually O'Brien was pretty good in MGM's "Julius Caesar," as Casca, making Shakepeare's lines believable enough.)The principle Doniphon represents, however, is O'Brien's second stage of the West's development. He's not only a rancher but a gunman, soon to be replaced by farmers and lawyers, but it's only at the final shootout that he realizes it. He saves Stewart's life the old-fashioned way, then gives up any plans of marriage to Vera Miles, gets drunk, and drives himself and Pompey back to the ranch he'd planned as a home. He burns the ranch down. He and Strode had a problem shooting the arrival at the ranch. Wayne lost control of the horses and Strode reached over to help. Wayne pushed him brusquely out of the way and Strode fell from the wagon. Angry, he threatened Wayne, and Wayne responded the way Wayne would respond. Strode, a former fullback, was several years younger than Wayne and in good shape. Ford stopped the altercation by shouting that the movie needed Wayne's face in one piece.For all its darkness, however, the movie reflects some of Ford's prejudices in his comic way. A pompous orator at the political meeting (John Carradine) announces in his stentorian public voice that he came here with "a carefully prepared speech" but is going to disregard it and speak the truth. Here he crinkles up the speech and throws it contemptuously to the floor. Someone picks the page up and uncrumples it to find it blank on both sides. The rhetoric is extremely funny -- "The bullet-riddled body of an honest citizen?" -- recalling Donald Meek in "Young Mister Lincoln." During a carefully choreographed spontaneous demonstration after the cattlemen's candidate has been nominated, a band plays, a cowboy rides up onto the speaker's platform and twirls a lasso, and there is a brief shot of the Chairman staring appalled at the cowboy's horse lapping water out of the chairman's pitcher.But it's still a sad comment from Ford. His earlier work brimmed with hope for the future. Here, the future has arrived and it makes one long for the past. It's the way an old man might feel about life in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest, unpretentious and deeply moving...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nostalgic, sour and powerful, Ford's "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is one of the most memorable of all his Westerns... It's triggered off, and that's the right phrase, as it turns out, by flashback... The old device works well in the hands of the master... In fact, John Ford couldn't have got the feeling he's after in any other way... Ford seems to be mourning the Old West... It's a mixed feeling?composed of pride, regret, and a sense of the inherent injustice of life, and certain forebodings about the future...When a famous elderly Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart), looking every inch the revered veteran political figure, gets off a train at a small Western town with his good lady (Vera Miles) you can tell by the way his eye roves for and rests on bits of time remembered that this is very much a sentimental journey? He's come to pay his last respects to a friend of the long, long ago?a small rancher in those days, played by John Wayne...Dissolve into the distant story?presenting young tenderfoot lawyer Stewart, eagerly intent on bringing Eastern law-books to bear on the problems of the West? His first taste of the West is a sound beating up, by a man called Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who is a gunman employed by powerful cattlemen who oppose statehood for the Territory...Nor does Ranse find any real custom even among the law-abiding... He starts his career, in fact, as a kitchen hand in a café where he's been taken by Tom Doniphon (Wayne) following his nasty experience with Liberty... Ford is at his 'domestic' best in this café which is run by a Swedish pair (John Qualen and Jeannette Nolan) and where Ranse's wife-to-be is one of the employees... Stewart, wearing an apron contrasted with Wayne, pure frontiersman, is something to see in that kitchen... And there's always an edge to their meetings...It isn't hard to guess that before long the waitress, Tom's girl, is going to fail for the injured tenderfoot who takes on her education... Ranse eventually hangs up his sign in the office of the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, a typical 'character', played by Edmond O'Brien, and from then on it's the story of a territory growing up and seeking statehood, with Ranse Stoddard maturing, too, as the natural leader of 'civilized' law and order aspirations...But none of it could have happened without the removal of Liberty Valance... Ranse confronts him and the bullets fly but the bullet that actually drops him comes from another Winchester in the shadows... Ranse goes to Washington on the strength of ridding the territory of Liberty Valance, but he knows that the shot was fired by another man? It's another film about the right man being in the right place at the right time in order to advance the course of Western civilization... Skillful, undoubtedly, but in this case the right man never gets his just deserts?if he ever wanted them, because the Wayne character in his way is just as much a part of the Old West as Marvin...Herein lies the bitter essence of the film... Wayne, at heart, is as contemptuous of what Stewart stands for?talk and conferences and thick legal tomes as the gunman is? And through him you feel Ford saying that the hard men who had it the hardest on the frontier are soon forgotten, and some of the frontier's simple virtues have been buried with them?"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is honest, unpretentious and deeply moving... In no other Ford Western does the audience feel so involved... The playing is brilliant?from the smallest role to the beautifully interpreted ambivalent relationship of Wayne and Stewart...Their acting style are quite different... Stewart had developed a standard repertoire of mannerisms that his public had come to cherish... Wayne's style was spare, clean and unadorned; he stood tall, very much himself... Certainly this film exemplifies a wonderful blending of three great talents, Ford's, Stewart's, and Wayne's, and their seamless mutual chemistry is one of the salient aspect of it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford's chamber Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are slow to give up their secrets first time round and need some time to elapse before they are revalued. An opportunity to see "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" after a gap of several years turned out to be an unexpectedly rewarding experience. It had never been one of my favourite Ford films; indeed I was always puzzled why many rate it so highly in the canon. Its rather plain black-and-white visuals smack of low production values and it has little of the grand operatic sweep of many of his other Westerns. I can now see that I was rather missing the point: "Liberty Valance" is that rare thing, a chamber Western, a quiet and elegiac reappraisal of the legends of the West made almost at the end of Ford's creative career with "Cheyenne Autumn" the only Western still to come. A U.S. senator played by James Stewart returns with his wife (Vera Miles at her most attractive) to the small Western town, where, as a young man, he tied to set up a law business, to attend the funeral of the man (John Wayne) who saved his life when he tried to rid the community of its villain, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Ford's Westerns had always been the stuff of legend. Now, towards the end of his career, he began to take the legend apart. The hero is not the one who goes on to become one of the town's most illustrious sons but the quiet man who fades into the background. It needs more than idealism to overcome evil, the film seems to be saying, Brute force has to be countered by brute force; moreover, true worth is not always rewarded or recognised by society. It is a bleak message that Ford is giving us. By homing in on character and plot to a far greater extent than usual, he gives us an experience that is often more akin to filmed theatre than cinema. There are unusually long sequences in studio built interiors, the diner, the bar and a theatre where an election adoption meeting is taking place. Outdoor sequences are few and far between. Instead of a large collective enemy such as marauding Indian tribes there is just the one baddy and his pair of sycophants. The pivotal action scene where Liberty Valance receives his just deserts takes place in a dark street and has none of the climactic sense of drama to be found in such shootouts as "My Darling Clementine" of Zinnemann's "High Noon". I can at last see that those very limitations that for so so long prevented me from appreciating "Liberty Valance" give it a sense of concentration and strength that the Western rarely achieves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's 1962 film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is an ode to the end of the classic western. It is a satiric look at the civilizing of the once wild American west where Ford deliberately uses stereotypical characters and situations to undermine and reexamine the very myths that he helped create. Ford's world is one of moral certainty and untamed villainy where legends are born and cowboy heroes ride free amidst the broad natural landscapes of America's West. In the west of Liberty Valance, the hero is not made nor born, but manufactured by the media. As the editor of the Shinbone Star says; "This is the West. When the legend becomes the fact, print the legend."The legend concerns lawyer Ransom Stoddard, played in typical earnest aw-shucks fashion by Jimmy Stewart. Stoddard has been brought, bruised and beaten, to the western town of Shinbone following an altercation with a gang of stagecoach highwaymen, led by arch-villain Liberty Valance. As played by Lee Marvin, Valance is deadpan and over-the top evil. His uncompromising performance is one of the pleasures of the film. With his lethal black whip and his giggling and glowering henchmen (played by Strother Martin and Lee VanCleef), Marvin is unabashedly nasty and taunting at every turn. His nemesis is that stalwart icon of the heroic west, John Wayne as Tom Doniphan. His code of honor is as solid as his skill with a six-gun. Doniphan knows that might rules the west, and will inevitably vanquish evil. But Stoddard's mission is to see that justice is done through the more civilized rule of law. Of his nemesis Valance, Stoddard says; 'I don't want to kill him, I just want to put him in jail!' Not likely, in John Ford's west.Into the mix come a parade of character actors whose vivid stereotypes have enlivened westerns for decades: Edmond O'Brien as the drunken but noble newspaper editor; Andy Devine as the whimpering, good-hearted, but cowardly sheriff; Woody Strode as the silent, noble black man, backbone of the west; and last and most essential is Vera Miles as Hallie, for whose heart our heroes compete. It is in that romantic triangle that the real heart of west may be won. In this way the Hallie, like the cactus rose she carries to Doniphan's funeral, becomes a bittersweet symbol for the loss and the hope of the new west.Ford makes Liberty Valance into a western that seems to examine itself as a western. He removes the window dressing to focus on the intricate play of characters and symbols. Gone is the Technicolor of the Searchers. This is in stark black and white. Gone are the outdoor landscapes of Ford's west. Most of the film looks like it was on the back lot, and many scenes take place indoors. He moves his camera in on faces not vistas. The world of 1960's America was changing and beginning to reexamine the usefulness of certain cultural mythologies. The new decade was about people; the grand ideals of postwar America were being reexamined and were about to become even dimmer with the assassination of President Kennedy. America was beginning to be about recognizing unique individualities, about embracing change, about individual rights, strong women, sensitive men. Ford didn't like that much, I imagine. The film's characters are flawed and cartoonish. I suspect his film was a wry satire on his own mythology and a critique of what he viewed as a softening of American society. Some critics didn't get it, while others consider this one of his more remarkable films. There is no doubt that it is nothing short of brilliant the ability to balance the elements of satire and seriousness, comedy and melodrama.As the train leaves Shinbone, the truth forever gives way to the legend. The conductor leans over to light Stoddard's cigar saying; 'Nothing is too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.' In that moment we are incredibly moved. This is, after all, about the creation of stories. But in those stories there live truths about human nature that are universal and forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's The Better Man Here? Answer: Neither.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read the comments of someone from August 30, 2004, who had reached the conclusion that John Wayne's character had stepped aside "for the better man," played by Jimmy Stewart. From my view, nothing could be farther from the truth. For all Ransom Stoddard's disdain for frontier violence, in the end, he was left with no choice but to pick-up a gun to finally silence Liberty Valance, something Valance knew better than to do with Wayne's Tom Doniphon. Call Stoddard the idealist and Doniphon the realist, but don't call him the better man. In 1946, John Ford directed My Darling Clementine, perfectly blending Wayne and Henry Fonda with his usual cast of characters to create a masterwork. Sixteen years later, he put Wayne together with Stewart (plus all the ol' gang) and made another peerless film. There was a time I didn't really "get" John Ford and John Wayne. One day, I awoke and now, the greatness of these two giants of the cinema is undeniable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring the greatest actor ever in Jimmy Stewart and the man who defined Western acting in John Wayne, one knew the movie was going to be good. But this movie tops them all. The movie continues through many great plot twists and unexpected events to arrive at a moving and stunning conclusion. Love, violence, politics, law, law-enforcement: this movie has it all. It is a western drama with action and even a little mystery topped off with a few comedic moments. Start to finish, you won't find anything like it anywhere else. Make sure you see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne as Tragic Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford was the first to see the potential in John Wayne and helped shape his image in a series of a classic westerns, including Stagecoach, Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and The Searchers. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is the most subtle treatment of Wayne's character, and represents one of his most fully realized roles, approaching the tragic in its depth. The film deals with the passing of the American West's values of freedom and independence. In many ways it is a summation and re-examination of the whole notion of the West as promulgated by Wayne and Ford. The story begins at the turn of the 19th century. Senator Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart), is traveling by train to Shinbone, the town of his youth, for the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Stoddard is a senior senator with presidential aspirations. Doniphon is an unknown. Stoddard and his wife, Hallie (Vera Miles) go to the undertaker and stand before the plain box that holds Doniphon. Enter the local press. They must know why the Senator has gone out his way to attend the funeral of an unknown cowhand. There is an old stagecoach on blocks at the undertaker's?a reference to the stagecoach that marked Wayne's breakthrough role. Stewart hems and haws, dusts off the old stage. It looks like the one that brought him to Shinbone decades before. And so the retelling begins. It is the 1870's. Stoddard is a young lawyer journeying by stage to make his fortune out west. Bandits waylay the stage and Stoddard is beaten by the eponymous Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Stoddard is the symbol of eastern civilization, impotent in the face of Valance's lawlessness. In the next scene we see Doniphon entering Shinbone with the beaten Stoddard thrown into the back of his buckboard. Between the impotent Stoddard and the lawless Valance is the figure of Doniphon, the only man whom Valance fears, and pillar of the town, friend to the newspaper editor, beau to Hallie, and foil to the inept marshal (Andy Devine). Shinbone is a dysfunctional town. Legal authority, as embodied by Devine, is cowardly, gluttonous and corrupt. Stoddard, the man with the intellectual ability to bring law to the town, is devoid of authority. Doniphon, the man who has the physical power and respect of the town to give force to the law and bring order to Shinbone hews to a code of individualism that keeps him from committing to the notion of a civil society. The political climate is fertile; statehood is being discussed and will change everything, bringing the rule of law and threatening the open range. At the local meeting to elect representatives, Valance tries to disrupt the proceedings but is held in place by Doniphon. Stoddard nominates Doniphon as a man uniquely qualified to represent the region. If he accepts the nomination, he unites physical and legal authority, bringing order to Shinbone and relegates Valance to the periphery. But he refuses. Accepting such a role is incongruent with his notions of individuality. Stoddard and the newspaper editor are instead elected. Valance vows revenge. Instead of supporting Stoddard, Doniphon counsels flight. He arranges a buckboard to take Stoddard out of town before Valance arrives that night to have it out with him. Doniphon's abdication leaves Stoddard with the decision: leave the town in the clutches of Valance, or stand and challenge him. Stoddard calls Valance out. Valance toys with him, shooting the gun out of his hand. Stoddard picks up the gun. Valance takes aim. Stoddard fires. Valance falls dead. Miraculously, Stoddard has liberated the town, also winning the heart of Hallie. Wayne goes on a bender, drinking himself into a stupor, then burns down his home, symbolically burning his own hopes for the future. He has lost everything. But the depth of his loss only becomes apparent later. Stoddard goes to the state convention, heralded as "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." On this wave of popularity, he is elected to represent the state in Washington, launching his career. As he is elected, Doniphon enters the hall. He is drunk and haggard. He calls Stoddard into a back room and confronts him. "You didn't shoot Valance, Pilgrim," he tells Stoddard, "Think back, Pilgrim." We dissolve to the gunfight in the street, this time from Doniphon's POV. He stands in an alley. As Valance makes his final shot, Doniphon shoots him, the shot simultaneous with Stoddard's, killing Valence, but in a manner without honor. In doing so, he loses his self- respect and violates the code by which he has lived. This illuminates his raging drunk. All is lost. Wayne approaches the tragic in this role. He was the best, but because of the limitations of his code, he defers acting against Valance and defers again. When leadership comes his way, he refuses. When events force him to act, he must do so in a manner that is dishonorable. Doniphon's only sin is that of pride?he will not stoop to the needs of the group and holds himself aloof. For this alone, he fails and ultimately transgresses against all he stands for. When Stoddard and his wife return to Shinbone for the funeral, their solemnity springs guilt. Stoddard has traded on the Valance shooting his entire career and he knows that he has lived a lie. Ironically, the reporter tears up the story at the end, saying "When the legend becomes the truth, print the legend." John Ford made the western what it is today. Here he gives us movie that is a complex and, at times sardonic, critique of the genre, while at the same time giving Wayne his deepest, most tragic role. There was not to be another western of equivalent depth until Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. It rewards repeated viewing and is a capstone to the career of Mr. Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Lawyer ....and a teacher....the first west of the Rosey Buttes."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senator James Stewart and his wife Vera Miles get a telegram from their old home in Shinbone about the death of a friend. They arrive in Shinbone and go to a sparsely attended service. When prodded a bit by the editor of the Shinbone Star, a paper he was once employed at, Stewart sits down and tells the story of just how his political career got its start.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is John Ford's final homage to the western film genre that made his reputation. It's maybe the most nostalgic of westerns he ever did. Beginning with the cast all of whom are way too old for their parts. But if you notice there's a kind of soft focus photography used on John Wayne, James Stewart, and Lee Marvin which masks their age. The skill of these players does the rest.Stewart arrives in Shinbone, a newly minted attorney who has taken Horace Greeley's advice and the stagecoach he's riding on gets held up by the local outlaw Liberty Valance and henchmen. When Stewart protests Valance, played by Lee Marvin beats him with the butt end of a silver knob whip and leaves him on the road.He's found by John Wayne who brings him to Shinbone to get medical attention. Stewart stays with restaurant owners John Qualen and Jenanette Nolan and their daughter Vera Miles who's Wayne's girl. Miles who can't even read or write takes quite a shine to the educated easterner.But Stewart and newspaper editor Edmond O'Brien keep getting on Liberty Valance's bad side, especially when they come out publicly for statehood whereas the big cattle ranchers who hire Liberty Valance and henchmen want to keep this part of the USA a territory for as long as they can. This is all leading to an inevitable showdown.Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance is one evil man. No subtle psychology here, no explanations of a mom who didn't love him or a girl that dumped him, he's just an evil guy who likes being evil. If Liberty has any redeeming qualities, despite repeated viewings of this film, I haven't found any. Marvin clearly enjoyed this part, but he never turned it into a burlesque of himself. That he waited for Cat Ballou to do.John Wayne who by this time was playing more roughhewn types than he did when he was Ringo Kid in Stagecoach, gets back to that kind of a portrayal here. He's more Ringo than he is Ethan Edwards. But that's at the beginning. Over the course of the film he changes into something like Ethan Edwards, his character from The Searchers. What happens to make him that way in fact is the story of the film. But actually the film really does belong to Stewart. He's on screen for most of it, he's the protagonist here and until almost the end, what's happening to him is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is all about. Ford once again rounds out his cast with many of his favorite players in support. Andy Devine as the cowardly marshal, John Carradine as a pompous windbag politician, Woody Strode, Denver Pyle, Strother Martin, all who had appeared in Ford films before.There are two to single out however. This was the last film Jack Pennick ever did with John Ford. You might not know his name, but he and that horse-face countenance appeared in just about every sound John Ford film there is. He has a bit role as a bartender. Pennick died after completing this film.Edmond O'Brien made his one and only appearance in this film as Dutton Peabody, founder, editor, and owner of the Shinbone Star and as he said himself, he sweeps the place out occasionally. He's a regular character in Ford films, the wise friend of the hero who has a bit of a drinking problem. Kind of like Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone in Stagecoach. Like Stewart, O'Brien is an eastern immigrant who came west to be his own newspaper editor like his former boss Horace Greeley. Words are his weapons, like the law is Stewart's. It's no wonder that these two annoy Lee Marvin so. Even the fast draw hired gun can't kill public opinion. When they're both chosen as Shinbone's Delegates to the territorial convention it is O'Brien who makes the nominating speech to draft Stewart for the job. It is one of his finest bits in his long and distinguished career. It encapsulates a lot of what Ford was trying to say about progress and progress in the American west. In the end it is the farmer, the merchant, the builder of cities will eventually triumph just about anywhere. Stewart and he are as much pioneers as Wayne and the others in Shinbone are, they're just the next logical step.Progress always comes at a price. We see the price in the beginning and the end of the film, the scenes of Shinbone during the early Twentieth Century. The paved streets, the electric lights are there because of who came before and what they did. There wasn't room in the changing west for many like Wayne and Marvin, their time came and went, just as Stewart's time came and went too.Actually I think the real winner in this film was always Vera Miles. She started out as an illiterate girl working in her parent's restaurant and wound up the wife of a United States Senator. That's progress too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allows us to understand the creation of myths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anticipating Peckinpah and Eastwood, John Ford's Hamlet-like Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance deconstructs the legends of the Old West as a place where good always triumphed over evil and civilization overcame barbarism, a myth that he helped to create. Ford's 1962 film, based on the story by Dorothy M. Johnson, looks at how myths are created and, in its complex vision of the passing of an era, both pines for the lawless open spaces and eagerly anticipates the railroads bringing paved roads, schools, and law enforcement. The film contains the classic phrase "When truth becomes legend, print the legend", cited by a journalist who refuses to print newly discovered facts about an incident surrounded in myth that took place years before.While there are stereotypes and all-too familiar stock characters, Liberty Valance succeeds because of strong performances by John Wayne as the macho embodiment of the old school, and Jimmy Stewart as the man who brings literacy and respect for law to the small town, though unconvincing as a young man just out of law school. Shot in black and white on a studio sound stage, the film opens with gray-haired Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arriving at a small frontier town named Shinbone with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles). Met at the train station by a reporter eager for a story, Senator Stoddard tells him that he came to attend the funeral of an old friend, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne).It is there that he reunites with Tom's dependable ranch hand Pompey (Woody Strode) and, since no one remembers Tom Doniphon, relates his story that takes us back to the time before the coming of the railroads. As Stoddard tells it, he was a young law graduate who arrived from the East in a stagecoach, following the advice "Go West, young man, and grow up with the country" first made in 1851 by John B. L. Soule, editor of the Terre Haute Express and incorrectly attributed to Horace Greeley. His welcome to Shinbone, however, is not what he had hoped. He is met by a sadistic bandit named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who robs the stagecoach and beats Stoddard after he tries to protect a female passenger.Rancher Tom Doniphon finds him unconscious and brings him to Hallie, his girlfriend's house. When Stoddard recovers, he asks the Marshal Link Appleyard (Andy Devine) to make an arrest but Doniphon soon sets him straight about how justice is done in Shinbone - with the barrel of a gun. Without money, Stoddard works in the family restaurant as a dishwasher and also for the editor of the local newspaper, a man named Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) who is overly fond of the bottle.Ransom develops an interest in Hallie and soon sets up classes to teach her and other locals how to read and write and also to convey the finer points of democracy and its institutions. Threatened by Valance and taunted by Doniphon, Stoddard goes against his ideals and learns how to shoot a gun with the help of Doniphon who "educates" him and shows him the error of his liberal ways.After Stoddard and Peabody defeat Valance in an election to be representatives to the Sate Senate and an editorial appears contrasting the goals of statehood with the interests of Valance and the cattlemen, Dutton is severely beaten by Valance who then baits Stoddard into a gunfight. The showdown between Stoddard and Liberty is the centerpiece of the film and the shot heard round the West allows the victor to build an entire career based on the incident.The legend of Shinbone will soon be joined by real-life icons Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill, and Kit Carson and the truth about the West with its corruption, misogyny, domination of the weak by the strong, and Native American genocide will be quietly buried. John Ford helped to romanticize the West and create the myth and, now in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, he allows us to understand its melancholy and its lie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic of the Western genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I have seen this movie numerous times, I am just getting around to commenting on it. I measure other films against it when I see them. The James Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, and Woody Strode performances are magnificent. It is important to note the contributions of past and future notables: Andy Devine, Lee Van Cleef (Hang'em High), and Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke).This movie captures some of the aspects of how hard life was on the western frontier towns and how they sprang up and died later in the era. Also, it it depicts how law and order are just as important today as in that time. Without L&amp;O, you are in just another "third world" broken nation.A superb motion picture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man, the story, the truth, the legend--Stick with the legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had every element of classic western action/story. Directed by John Ford, and starring John Wayne and James Stewart, the film focuses on an eastern lawyer attempting to make a career out west. Early on, he runs up against Liberty Valance, the baddest of the bad, keenly played by Lee Marvin, in one of his most villainous roles.Stewart manages to bring some sense of education and fair play to the town citizens, but ultimately gets embroiled in conflict with Valance. In a shootout outside the local saloon, Valance takes dead aim on the eastern dude, Stoddard, (Stewart). Shots ring out, and surprisingly, Valance falls to the ground. But, who really fired the fatal shot?That question is answered in a convention meeting attended by Stoddard as a delegate, where Tom Doniphan (Wayne) reveals the truth of the fatal shooting.This movie is unique in that it was one of the last of the truly great westerns shot in black and white, and the story is presented in flashback sequences. The viewer can settle back to a truly marvelous story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful and nostalgic western with two great heroes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns aren't normally my favourite so it has to be a good one, and this one starring two legends, James Stewart &amp; John Wayne, is surely one of the best. It ranks with me right behind High Noon.It tells the tale of an aging Washington Senator, Ranse Stoddard, who returns to Shinbone, his (sometime) hometown in the West with his wife, Hallie, for the funeral of their friend, Tom Doniphon. While there he relates his story to a journalist, telling how he came to Shinbone as a young lawyer and met there both Tom &amp; Hallie (who was formerly Tom's sweetheart). He became famous as the man who shot the notorious bandit, Liberty Valence, which kick started his political career. However, Stoddard realizes that this career is based on a lie, and he experiences his own guilt dealing with it. The shot that actually killed Valence came from another gun, not his own. The film emphatically makes the point that perception (or rumour reported as truth) and reality are not necessarily one and the same thing. The public has lauded Stoddard all these years for a heroic deed he didn't really do.The movie has marvelous characters and a stellar cast portraying them. Both Ranse Stoddard and Tom Doniphon, though seemingly opposite, come across as sympathetic, honourable men with great personal integrity. This is a film with TWO heroes, protagonist &amp; antagonist to one another... though jointly opposing the villainous Valence. The legendary James Stewart, such a decent man himself, is perfect in the role of the noble lawyer &amp; Senator Ranse Stoddard, who is initially opposed to gun violence, advocating education and the rule of law. He is not too proud to don an apron and wash dishes to pay for his keep. That great Western hero, John Wayne, is forceful (as always) portraying the rough hewn Tom Doniphon. His philosophy is 'the gun is the law', and he has little respect for either book learning or law courts.Lee Marvin is downright deliciously sullen &amp; evil as the whip wielding Liberty Valence. I love that restaurant steak scene, he's just so despicable the way he holds the terrified citizenry in his grip! Few villains elicit more outrage than his heinous acts against Dutton Peabody, the drunken editor of the Shinbone Star. Liberty Valence...what an absolutely fabulous name for this wretched snake! Can you imagine any other name in the movie title?This film seems to take a nostalgic look at the decline of the Old West and its replacement with modern civilization. Tom Doniphon of course represents the rugged frontier West. He is actually dead throughout this movie, his character revealed only through the flashback retelling of the story. By contrast, Ranse Stoddard brings from the East law and literacy to this Western town. From the time he first comes to Shinbone as a young lawyer, he teaches its inhabitants to read &amp; write. The conflict between the old frontier ways and the new educated society based on law &amp; order is clearly revealed in the love triangle here. Both Tom Doniphon and Ranse Stoddard court the lovely and quietly spirited Hallie (played by Vera Miles). The cactus rose symbolizes her early attraction to Tom and the Old West, the real rose her newfound romance with Ranse and his Eastern sophistication. Her courtship by Tom is eventually replaced by her marriage to Ranse, causing Tom's increased drinking and gradual decline. Other characters include the drunken Doc Willoughby and the cowardly Marshall Link Appleyard, who shrinks away from dealing with Valence. The movie is a compelling metaphor for the decline of the Old West, has a gripping plot, and surely some of the best character depictions ever. All told, it's a wonderful movie for both fans of westerns and for those who are normally not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cartoonish and Buffoonish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I either love or hate John Ford's early movies; there's no middle ground. Anyone who admired F. W. Murnau as much as Ford had to be touched by the great man's fire, but many of Ford's well-regarded films, "The Iron Horse," "Young Mr. Lincoln," and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon," seem dreadfully mannered and stylized compared to "3 Bad Men," "Stagecoach," "My Darling Clementine," and "Fort Apache." After 1948 Ford embraced his worst idiosyncrasies, as did his co-dependent John Wayne, who became an enthusiastic promoter of his own "legend."Not heeding the glaring defects in Ford's worst films, the film school generation of directors in the 1970s over-praised films that were rightfully panned by the critics. One of the travesties they promoted to "classic" status is Ford's adaptation of the interesting Dorothy Johnson short story "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance."In Johnson's story "Rance" Foster is an insufferable eastern snob itching to face Liberty Valance in a gun duel because the outlaw had savagely beat him for no reason, injuring his sense of eastern superiority. Cowboy Bert Burricane saves him from dying of thirst on the prairie, but he repays Burricane with indifference and, on his own, begins pistol practice for his showdown with Valance. He dislikes everyone in town because he's humiliated at having to take a swamper's job in a saloon. And although Burricane's girl Hallie is drawn to Rance because of his education, he conceals his attraction for her because he's embarrassed to show interest in an illiterate girl he's teaching to read. When Valance comes to town Rance jumps at the opportunity to meet the outlaw and gain respect in the eyes of others even if it means his death. Burricane kills Valance from a concealed vantage point just as the two men fire, making it look as if Rance killed Valance. When Burricane tells Rance he killed Valance, he explains that he did it because he loves Hallie enough to let her have the man she wants. After recovering from a wound he received in the gunfight, Rance marries Hallie and is elected Senator in part because of publicity generated by the shooting. Years later when Burricane dies alone and forgotten, Rance returns to show respect for the man who changed him.But instead of making James Stewart's character, Rance Stoddard, an eastern snob, Ford and his writers make him an idealistic young lawyer, uncomfortable with guns, who is beaten by Valance when he stands up for fellow passengers in a stagecoach holdup, and who continues to seek remedy through the law until forced into one desperate, violent act. John Wayne's character, Tom Doniphon, doesn't save Rance from his macho pride for Hallie's sake. He maintains his usual tough guy persona, urging Stoddard to get a gun, a man who is disappointed to find, when he loses Hallie after killing Valance, that the gunman's day is past. In Johnson's story the tough westerner ironically must teach the easterner to be a gentle man. But that's too radical a concept for Ford and the writers, who subvert Johnson's irony to make her story fit the western conventions she was trying to deflate.But aside from the watered-down story, there are still the seemingly obligatory Ford inanities. Wayne and Stewart were certainly too old for their parts, and O. Z. Whitehead, who was one of Ford's Stock Company in '40s, plays a sullen, truant teenager in Stoddard's school, even though he was in his fifties. Then there is Woody Strode's "Yassuh, Boss" portrayal of Tom Doniphon's "boy" Pompey, and Edmund O'Brien's bombastic, drunken newspaper editor, an over-the-top ripoff of Thomas Mitchell's Doc Boone from "Stagecoach." And Ford insists yet again on having John Qualen annoy us with his best stage-Swedish accent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myth Over Reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford directs this western story that opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard(played by Jimmy Stewart) arriving by train in the town of Shinbone, to attend the funeral of old friend Tom Doniphon(John Wayne). He tells a local newspaper reporter about his first arrival in Shinbone by stagecoach, where it is robbed by a bullying ruffian named Liberty Valance(Lee Marvin, well cast) As a young lawyer left only with his law books, he gets a job in a local restaurant as a dishwasher, only to run afoul of Valance again, who is being used by local landowners who oppose proposed statehood. Stoddard is approached to be a representative, and after being challenged by Liberty, is elected, though Valance decides that only a showdown can settle things...Thoughtful and effective film is more a showcase for Stewart than Wayne, much the same way Stoddard comes to overshadow Tom, though both actors are equally memorable, as are the characters they play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Western!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was the last Western that John Ford and John Wayne made together. The film also stars James Stewart, who plays Ransom Stoddard, a young lawyer who later becomes a senator. In the movie, Ford explores the differences that exist between the facts of Ransom Stoddard's life and the legend that has sprung up around him. Ford shows us that people would rather believe a legend than know the truth about a famous person and about the events of his or her life. This is especially true about the heroes of the Wild West era.There may be no era that has been more mythologized and romanticized than that of the Old West. In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Maxwell Scott, editor of The Shinbone Star, proclaims, "This is the West, Sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." Ford's movie seems to suggest that much of what we think we know about the Old West may not be based on fact. The movie begins and ends with a scene of a train in motion. In the opening scene, the train is seen coming towards the camera and towards the small town of Shinbone, where most of the action will take place. Then, at the end of the movie, after the story has been told, the train is seen riding away from the camera and from Shinbone.The film's two main characters are Tom Doniphon, a rugged frontier's man, who is played by Wayne, and Stoddard who is played by Stewart. Other significant characters include: Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin), the snarling, hate-filled outlaw; Hallie (Vera Miles), a young lady who both Tom and Ransom are in love with; Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), Shinbone's faint-hearted Marshal; Dutton Peabody, the lovable drunkard and editor of the local newspaper The Shinbone Star and Doc Willoughby who is Shinbone's physician and who also is a drunk.In the movie these characters come together and mix and clash with one another in Shinbone, a place where the lawless ways of the West seem to hold sway. Link Appleyard, the town's Marshal, represents the power of the Law in Shinbone, and he is a spineless man who cowers every time someone like Liberty Valance comes near. Doniphon tries to teach Stoddard what "Western Law" is like when he tells Ransom: "I know those law books mean a lot to you but not out here. Out here, a man settles his own problems."But Ransom Stoddard refuses to accept that way of life. He has come to town, and he represents law and order and the settled ways of the East. It is true that when he first arrives, he is unconscious after having received a vicious beating at the hands of Liberty Valance, and it is also true that next to the stalwart Tom Doniphon and the venomous Liberty Valance, Ransom doesn't seem very strong, but, nevertheless, he has come to stay as he tells Doniphon: "I'm staying and I'm not buying a gun."The movie also focuses on the inevitable conflict brought on by the encroachment of the Eastern way of life upon the Western way. This conflict is seen represented in Hallie who is torn between her attraction for Doniphon, the frontier man, and Stoddard, the man of the East. Doniphon woos her with a cactus rose, a symbol of his way of life, while Stoddard asks Hallie if she has ever seen a "real" rose. Hallie says she hasn't and she shows her ignorance of the Eastern way of life when Mr. Peabody tries to teach her "the proprieties concerning the cutlery.""How many times have I told you the fork goes to the left of the plate? And the knife goes?" Hallie interrupts him and asks, "What's the matter with you? You superstitious or something?"Hallie knows that if she chooses to be with Ransom, she will have to change. But her first impulse is to resist change. When Ransom offers to teach her to read and write, she says, "What good will that do around here?" Later, however, she relents and accepts Ransom's offer. Unlike Hallie, who decides to accept the Eastern way of life and the changes that come with it, Liberty Valance and Tom Doniphon both refuse to change, and they both die because of their unwillingness, though each dies in a different way. Valance, who passionately hates Stoddard and all he represents, tries unsuccessfully to destroy, first Mr. Peabody and his newspaper press, and then Ransom himself. In the end, Valance, who has lived by the sword, dies a violent death at the hands of Tom Doniphon. And the latter, after realizing that he has killed a man in cold blood and that he has lost Hallie to Stoddard, self destructs; he starts drinking heavily, and sets his house as well as his life on fire.And Stoddard? What happens to him? He becomes famous because everyone, except for Hallie, thinks that he is the man who shot Liberty Valance, and he gets the girl and goes on to have a successful career in Washington. But without the help of noble, and honest men like Doniphon, men like Stoddard wouldn't have been able to survive in the West.John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is an intelligent, insightful, and greatly entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rance was the hero they needed, Tom the one they deserved. Sound familiar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many, I regard 'The Searchers' as arguably the greatest western ever. However, one of the reasons I say 'arguably' is because of 'The Man who shot Liberty Valance'. While on the surface, it deals with how the 'wrong man' gets the credit for the death of the thug who enforced the will of the vested interests who profit from blocking the march of civilisation and law and order towards the town of Shinbone while the true 'hero' dies in obscurity, beneath the surface it argues the need for a 'dark knight', who can do the things that need to be done, legal or otherwise, that will be required so justice and peace can take hold in a lawless, violent land and time. John Wayne's Tom Doniphon can clearly see that James Stewart's Rance Stoddard is the man the people need to inspire them to stand up for themselves and bring progress and order into their lives, although he also understands that Liberty Valance have to be forcibly removed from the equation. By the time the moment arrives that he makes the decision to eliminate Valance himself, he also realises that not only will he have to live with the guilt of the crime he commits, but that he will lose his girl to Stoddard in the process. As if that wasn't enough, he ultimately has to confess the truth to Stoddard in order to finally push him into fulfilling his role in the deception (granted, the viewer needs the confession scene to make sense of the movie) surrounding Valance's demise, using his reputation as 'The Man who shot Libery Valance' to get elected. In addition, the movie also manages to comment on how the 'legend' of the West has been written by ignoring the unpleasant 'truth' of how it was actually won. So, the hero the people needs depends on the help of the hero they actually deserve. Curiously, Christopher Nolan has apparently never heard of this film! Unfortunately for him, there seem to be enough members of AMPAS who have.</fullReview>

John Wayne as Tom Doniphon plays the usual role as tough and valiant action man by means the force ,beyond the law ,he achieves the democratic liberty in Shinbone town .Villanous Lee Marvin as the nastiest gunfighter and his henchmen(Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin)are supported by the cattleman and rich owners confronting for the open range against the homesteaders .The movie is ensemble by a magnificent supporting cast as Andy Devine as the coward and ridiculous sheriff,the drunk journalist Edmond O'Brien,Jeanette Nolan,John Carradine,John Qualen... This picture is considered an American classic and is one of the greatest Western motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just recently seen this movie, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The box cover of this movie states that this movie is the best western, second to stagecoach. While this movie cannot be the best Western (I believe the best Western is The Searchers) it certainly is a spectacular one. I love how the story gently unravels itself. THe movie begins with the story set in the future around 20 years. In that time, much has changed in the town. First, the funeral of Tom Doniphon, whose story is told through Ransom Stoddard. It is unknown how he died (SPOILER he just dies from natural causes). In the beginning too are all the characters that are left, Pompey, Link Appleyard, Hallie. ALl are in their elderly status. Yet it takes around one hour for the movie to reveal how they got into that state. The movie plays out as the story of a man's struggle through Western front. A story of a man as he tries to survive- and shoot Liberty Valance. It is the spectacular story of a man as he struggles with his love for a woman and his hatred towards a man, and a man that comes in between. As a western this movie certainly depicts the the spirit and the struggle of the new frontier. Here is the epitome of the harsh western life, where the struggle is not only how to live, but how to survive with people literally holding their guns up to your face. In the beginning the harsh western is even depicted as a place where bandits rob protagonist Ransom Stoddard. Here is the struggle even to eat, where Hally struggles to feed even her curstomers in the harsh western front. And all the performances are magnificent. James Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, and Woody Strode; these veterans of other westerns, notably John Wayne, allows for viewers to truly enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Great* film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fellow movie-watchers, Put this one on my list years ago, finally saw it a couple days ago.There were a few eye-rollers, to be sure, such as an obvious 50-year-old playing a lollipop-scarfing schoolboy (and Stewart obviously past middle age, but apparently playing a character that was supposed to be probably 25); the fat, whiny sheriff; and adding nothing to the film, a stuttering ranch-hand. But, considering that this is a 40-year-old picture, such doozies are rare.Overall, this is an absolute classic that has aged remarkably well.Teaming the nerdy, decent Jimmy Stewart with the commanding, decent John Wayne for this story was *perfect.* So many great quotes, but probably my favorite is when Pompey, Tom Doniphan's black servant (?), apologizes to his teacher, Stewart's Stoddard, for forgetting during recitation the line in the Delcaration that all men are created equal."That's OK, Pompey; a lot of people forget that part," Stewart wryly quips -- in a movie released just as the civil rights movement was on the rise (1962).And John Wayne, as usual, is just THE MAN. When Doniphan asks Valance to pick up Doniphan's steak (after Valance had tripped Stoddard, who had been serving it), and one of Valance's toadies bends down to pick it up instead, Doniphan just kicks the toady square in the face and knocks him on his a**, barely even exerting himself or breaking stride.Later, the same toady (I think) draws a gun on Doniphan from point-blank range, and Doniphan simply TAKES THE GUN AWAY with one hand and knocks the dork down with the other, in one move.Also, the newspaper editor was a nearly-constant hoot, and the town doctor summed up my feelings whenever a (to borrow a phrase) towering b*stard dies. Rushing to the scene of Valance's shooting, he snaps, "Whiskey, quick!" He takes a big drink, eyes the bleeding, inert Valance, half-shrugs and says, "Dead." Then walks away.See it if you haven't. And pray God that they don't re-make this one.-- Chaz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is the West, Sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen this film many years ago when I was a lot younger, and thought it was a pretty good Western. The passage of time and a keener focus reveals a lot more going on in this movie than a conflict between two good men and the killing of an outlaw gunman. Surface generalities aside, the story is about the passing of an era, with the bullets of a bygone time about to be replaced by the subtler but just as lethal machinations of the political machine.There's another way to look at the events surrounding the death of Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Suppose Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) made up the story about shooting Valance to save Ransom Stoddard's hide. It would have been just another savage way of further emasculating Jimmy Stewart's character upon realizing that Hallie (Vera Miles) was never going to be his girl. After all, he wasn't above humiliating Ranse with the mean spirited paint can demonstration where his rage was more palpable. I'm not advancing that hypothesis by the way, but it's an interesting conjecture that fits, and isn't denied by any of the other facts of the story.There's a rather strange moment in the picture that director Ford opted to keep. When Stoddard addresses the town meeting about to nominate representatives to Washington, he walks from behind a desk and hits his head on the bottom of the stairwell. He looks at the stair, and without skipping a beat, keeps on talking to the audience. I wonder if it hurt?Even stranger though is the sequence when Wayne's character leaves town after drinking heavily and arrives home with his ward Pompey (Woody Strode). In town he has a black shirt, arriving at home it's a light colored one. Breaking the door in, the shirt is black again, and when Pompey saves him from the fire, it's not only light colored again, but with a set of buttons that go down to the belt line. Finally, the shirt is black again in the final scene of that sequence.For his final team up with John Wayne, Ford seems to go for caricature with many of the figures here. Most obvious is Lee Marvin's title character, Liberty Valance. He's pretty much allowed free reign as a nut case, and even though Andy Devine's usual persona as a do nothing lawman is somewhat expected, he's totally ineffective in enforcing anything in the town of Shinbone. Liberty's henchman Floyd (Strother Martin) is irritating as a whiny outlaw, and Lee Van Cleef has disappointingly too little screen time to be of consequence. Perhaps the most over the top performance is delivered by John Carradine, with macho exuberance and a name to match as Major Cassius Starbuckle.There's a lot going on in 'Liberty Valance' with repeat viewings recommended to uncover even more nuances. This is one Western that doesn't fit the typical mold, where preconceptions are shot down like cans on a fence post. It's a look at the wild west coming to an end with a blend of nostalgia, romance and grit that offers an effective glimpse at legend before succumbing to fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liberty Valance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a tragedy about the passing of the Old West, represented metaphorically in the passing of Tom Doniphon. That Ford chose to tell his tale of larger-than-life Tom Doniphon, a heroic figure reduced to a pair of beat-up boots and a crumpled hat, as a reminiscence of Jimmy Stewart's Ransom Stoddard only adds to the nostalgia. Senator Stoddard and his wife have come by train to Shinbone, a once rugged frontier outpost, intending to pay their respects and then slip quietly back to Washington. Waylayed by an aggressive newspaper editor who insists on knowing the story behind the story of the senator's sudden and secretive appearance in town, Stoddard agrees to tell the truth about the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.It was here in Shinbone many years ago that young lawyer Ransom Stoddard, seeking his fortune in the West, recovered from a vicious beating at the hands of Liberty Valance, a malcontent and highwayman, well-known as a hired gun for the interests of the cattlemen who run the territory. Valance holds up the stage coach Ransom is riding, and when Ransom intervenes on behalf of a female passenger, he is beaten and whipped and left for dead beside the trail. Tom Doniphon, equally well-known for his toughness and prowess with a gun, stands on the side of law and order. It was Tom who drove out and found Ransom, bringing him into town in the back of a buckboard wagon and overseeing the details of his recovery. Stoddard swears he will have Valance brought to justice by putting him in jail, an assertion eliciting wry amusement from Tom, who chides Ransom for thinking that he can solve the problem of Liberty Valance with anything other than a gun.In time, Stoddard's greenhorn optimism and complete trust in the power of the law are tempered by the realities of frontier life. The local Marshall is a bumbling incompetent more interested in mooching his next meal than in confronting Valance, who openly defies the law by parading around town and bullying the townspeople. Valance is kept in check only by Tom Doniphon, who brandishes the threat of gun play but never has to draw his pistol because Valance fears him. Quietly, Stoddard purchases a gun and practices shooting it.When the political issue of statehood arises in the territory, Liberty Valance tries to intimidate the townspeople and secure the interests of the cattlemen, who oppose statehood, but is thwarted by Doniphon and Stoddard, who supply the muscle and the mind necessary to rouse the town into sending two pro-statehood delegates to the convention. One of these is Stoddard himself, and the other is Dutton Peabody, editor of the local newspaper, the Shinbone Star. True to form, Valance vents his frustration by trashing the newspaper office at night and thrashing Peabody to within an inch of his life. In the subsequent gunfight between Stoddard and Valance, Valance toys with Stoddard and wounds him in the right arm before Stoddard gets off an unlikely shot that kills Valance. Thus, Stoddard's reputation as "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" precedes him at the convention, where he is ridiculed by the pro-territory orator Major Cassius Starbuckle as a gun-wielding yahoo unworthy of being taken seriously as a spokesman for statehood.Anguished by what he perceives as his own betrayal of the principles of law that he so ardently espoused, Stoddard quits the convention only to find Tom Doniphon waiting for him. Here we learn that is was Doniphon himself, lurking in the shadows that fateful night, who shot Liberty Valance, timing his rifle shot to coincide with Stoddard's pistol shot. Doniphon convinces Stoddard to return to the convention, and thus begins the illustrious political career of a man whose reputation as "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is a lie that he never corrects.Until now, of course. Now we understand why the Senator wanted to slip in and out of Shinbone without fanfare, precisely to avoid the circumstances that have led to his confessional tale. But Stoddard is too moral a man to leave so large a lie uncorrected. Hearing the truth for the first time, the newspaper editor refuses to print it, preferring the legend to the reality.The film ultimately becomes a statement about the sadness of progress, and how the rough and ready life of the colorful frontier West gives way to a more modern world marked not by gun play but by wordplay, one safer but blander.The final shot of the film is the train taking Senator Stoddard and his wife back to Washington. We see it from the back, pulling away and leaving us behind. Chatting animatedly aboard the train, the senator and his wife express an eagerness to return to Shinbone, but we know that they probably never will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobility That Fades Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:I read lots of objections to this old classic; the central theme seems to be what is the point? Well, yes, like all of Ford's movies, it is idealized but it still has plenty to say about the long forgotten Old West. Stoddard rides into Shinbone with a satchel full of law books and a sense of importance about his place in the world. He encounters Law alright, a different kind than he was taught, the law of the strong in a lawless part of the country as Liberty malevolently says to him as he is half whipping him to death. Tom tries, futilely, to disabuse pompous Ransom of how things work when all the law there is consists of an obese, cowardly sheriff with one broken jail cell and no courage of any kind. The movie follows the historical transition from the gun to the law. The title is ironic; the answer is why this is among Wayne's best films and quite a sad, tragic, little story. Stewart is almost killed when Liberty calls him out; Tom, unknown to us, shoots Liberty though Stoddard gets all the fame and credit which Tom can endure but not losing Hallie. If you are avoiding this movie because you loathe the excessive bravado of most of Wayne's movies: you know, he takes out thirty men all by himself. This is not that movie, not at all. Wayne is the silent, unknown hero who gets Ransom a senator's seat, the woman he loved and all the fame for something Stewart never could have done.Stewart begins to see what is coming, that Tom was right, out here it is still the gun not the law book. When he tries to train with a pistol, Tom has some fun with him to ease the growing romance between his girl and Stewart. Ford gently shows us our violent past here in the States. It is idealized, but yet, enough reality remains to demonstrate the truth of Tom's words to Stoddard. If you want justice, you better learn to use this, he says brandishing his 38. Stewart should have died for his quixotic, arrogant pacifism but Tom, we learn much later, saves him from the deadly consequences of his naiveté about how the Old West works in Shinbone. Valance does whatever he likes, beats the newspaper man half to death, burns down his office, everyone scurries away. The film's point is that the rule of the strong is not a pretty picture. That violence, sadly, is often a requisite for survival. It is a trip back into a forgotten world where pacifism could lead to quick death when smelled out by a cruel monster like Liberty Valance. Marvin did him so well, that evil smile of enjoyment as he methodically whales on you with his silver tipped whip. I recommend the movie as the second best of Wayne's films only The Searchers is better. True Grit got more acclaim and brought an Oscar to John but this is a far superior picture. Tom loses everything protecting the frankly ungrateful, cowardly Stoddard. The last shot on the train out of Shinbone says the point when Hallie is in a reverie as they are on the train leaving. She jumps at Stewart's suggestion they resettle there now that he is retired from politics. We sense she wants to be with your real love: Tom. The man who died in obscurity while Stoddard got all of his credit and the woman he loved. This is not your typical 'John Wayne' macho festival. He plays such a sad, tragic figure of nobility here. In the end, Hallie's love for Ransom is why Tom did what he did. I consider it the deepest Western Wayne ever made. It adumbrates the Law of Nature and how horrible it was to live underneath it in terror. Beyond this, you see a man lose everything on earth he loves saving a blockheaded, idealistic fool who leaves rich, famous and married to the woman he loves. Tom lets his dream house he built for Hallie wither and die; it is a bleak metaphor for his life. When we see the ruins, at the very beginning, you feel such contempt for Stoddard for never telling people the truth of "Who Shot Liberty Valance." One Of The Best Westerns Ever Made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS IS HOW YOU SHOOT A WESTERN, PILGRUM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence" as a young kid, and I guess seeing a masterpiece early in life spoils you. There have not been too many western movies like this one, and will probably never be again. John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart together, along with Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, Edmond O'Brien and Andy Devine cast beautifully. Director John Ford's legacy is in place as it is obvious that true pros did more than just read a great script. Marvin is a cruel villian, and the mixture of hero John Wayne, and anti-hero Stewart bring a stark contrast to the black and white images on screen. The cast is truly colorful and each scene memorable. It is one of the great westerns and great movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Marvelous Mythology Played Out In The Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom Stoddard (Stewart) arrives in the unlikely named town of Shinbone having had his arse 'wupped' by local bad-guy, Liberty Valance (Marvin); but does he seek a bloody revenge on his wicked nemesis? NO. He seeks justice by the book. You see, he's an attorney at law, and he desires to see civilised leanings spring up all over 'south of the Picket Wire'. Laughable really. The only law in the wild-west is the law of the gun. That's what's kept tough rancher, Tom Doniphan (Wayne) alive. And it's the only thing that will work for Stoddard... or is it?!?Ford doesn't pretend that he's got anything new here. God no! What he's clearly interested in is the marriage (and divorce!) of the primal and the cerebral. He set's the whole thing in the wild-west (a genric canvas second to none) and relies on character and emotion to lead us way beyond the obvious plot. And what he delivers is a sublime debate on the inter-dependency of force and reason. For there are those not prepared to listen to reason and those disenfranchised by the reliance on force; and Ransom Stoddard eventually acknowledges this, embraces the essence of both codes and thereby supercedes Doniphan as the real 'hero' of the new renaissance of the American West.This is an excellent piece of metaphorical mythology. The monochrome teases us of a 'black and white' world within which the 'reality' of life is oft contained within the shadows. Ford's direction of comedy and drama has never been bettered by himself (not even in the somewhat ponderous 'My Darling Clementine') and the dialogue risks allowing wisdom in Doniphon's horse-poke to be matched by an often acerbic, no-nonsense Stoddard. The characters (and the actors within them) are uniformly excellent. Stewart never puts a foot wrong and this is the high-water mark of Wayne's dramatic capability. The scene in which he realises his love is unrequited and subsequently drinks himself into oblivion reveals a depth few could have thought him capable of. Special mention must also go to Edmond O'Brien's avoidance of (surely tempting) caricaturing the newspaper editor and instead creating a most believable bridge of humanity between the values of the wild west and the civilised east. Lee Marvin's sullen rendition of the bad guy Valance is also outstanding. And it is to Ford's credit that you are always left uncertain as to whether Valance or Doniphan was the tougher cowboy.The idea of a developing world allowing us to metaphorise our own understanding of and relationship with existence is as old as Zeus (and the God's that preceded him); and in the developing new world of the American west, nobody examined that potential better or more profoundly than John Ford. And this film is one of the crowning moments of that examination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This western is yet another stellar Ford/Wayne movie. John Wayne is great, because in this movie, he is the unknown hero. Not only does he lose recognition for killing Liberty Valance to Jimmy Stewart, but he also loses his girl to the same man. Stewart also gives a brilliant performance as a man who gets everything, but doesn't truly deserve any of it.Featuring great performances by the supporting cast, especially Lee Marvin, this is one movie you'll want to see again and again.

		<shortDescription>One of John Ford's masterpieces.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The director's unique brand of character-driven storytelling has seldom been matched. In this film, John Ford succeeds in telling his audience a story that is universal : how to stand up to bullies even if violence is not your cup of tea. He couldn't have chosen his actors better to mark the different approaches to violence. John Wayne gives one of his best performances here and puts paid to his critics in what is a finely tuned role. James Stewart is perfect as the ever-suffering lawyer lost in the realm of gunsmoke. Lee Marvin is the ultimate sadist in a role remarkably similar to the one he played in The Big Heat. Some of John Ford's favourite stalwarts fill out the cast: Andy Devine as the lovable but cowardly sheriff and Edmond O'Brien as the newspaperman stand out. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance remains a classic for the right reason : no matter how predictable or sentimental the story, it's a timeless testimony to the art of film-making by a great artist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" has long been one of my favorite movies, regardless of genre, and as I grow older, I appreciate the film even more. A great script, a great story and, if possible, even better acting combine to make this truly a piece of Americana. I cannot imagine a film more accurately reflecting the rough and tumble times of the Old West, depicting a territory's struggle to move forward as a society and as a people. Lee Marvin's performance as Liberty Valance is nothing short of brilliant and I have long thought John Wayne's role as Tom Doniphon was his true shining moment as an actor. People tend to stereotype The Duke, claiming that he only ever played himself. While there may be some truth to that in some of his films, he proved himself to be a great actor, too, in movies like "Liberty Valance" and "The Searchers", to name but two. With a sterling supporting cast, the fine direction of John Ford and a tremendous story, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is, in my humble opinion, a cinematic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man of words vs. Man of actions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb Top 250: 238I came to a realization about John Ford watching this film. He's a legendary director who can create interesting plots, fill them with meaning and themes, provoke strong performances from his cast, and keep a viewer interested for 2 hours. But between this and The Searchers, I felt something missing. This film is shot in a very conventional manner, so visually it didn't stand out. And there was just a lack of... heart. The minimal soundtrack played a role in that matter. So to conclude, this is a well-made movie with strong features, that played it safe and didn't take many risks.There's very little to spoil in this movie: you know how it ends from the title. There's only really one plot point worth hiding. But knowing that puts me in a different state of movie-watching mind: the point of the film is not what happens, but why and how. The great beginning, set much after the bulk of the film, cemented that idea. We know the fate of all the characters. But how did they get there? This brings me to the strongest point: the dynamic between Ransom and Doniphon, played by the legendary James Stewart and John Wayne, respectively. Ransom is the man of words, a lawyer who wants to solve his problems diplomatically. Doniphon is the man of action, who realizes the importance of guns and confidence in the West. Between them is Hallie, and a sort of triangle develops. It's interesting to see how that love plays out, especially when the other tug-of-war, Ransom's struggle to maintain his principles also unfolds. As I've said, the cast is excellent. The two leads are excellent, in a cool conflict with each other. Vera Miles is, as Wayne says, "kinda cute when she's angry", and has some good scenes. Mr. Peabody and the Marshall are excellent characters fully realized to their comic, and dramatic, potential. But the acting star is Lee Marvin, in the role of the titular Valence. He's a bad, bad man and supremely played.I like to review Ford's films, as the meaning he puts into them make great analysis and reviews. If you like westerns, you probably love him, and if you don't know him you need to see his films. They could just be that much better if he would take a risk. 8.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is excellently-scripted, and well-directed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first John Ford film that I've ever watched, and by golly, it impresses me to the extent that now I know why Ford was so revered in cinema. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is excellently-scripted, and well-directed (though I think this may not represent Ford's best work). The two aspects that sustained my interest for two hours are the screenplay, and the acting.The screenplay is able to effectively bring out the weirdly interesting characters involved. Liberty Valance is fearsome enough to make viewers feel jittery, while we root for the rest of the cast. Speaking of that, the casting is spot-on. James Stewart, John Wayne, and Lee Marvin are the right actors in their roles, giving incredibly delicious performances throughout. The chemistry between the supporting cast and the main actors are brilliant, everyone knows what they're doing, and they did a real fine job.I need to watch more Westerns to be exposed to the way such films are made. So far none has let me down. Although Liberty Valance is splendid, I rate Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West as the best I've ever laid my eyes on. But both represent what is so good about the Westerns, and they show us what we have been missing in our cinemas for decades.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Western like 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)' could only have been produced by a man reaching the twilight of his career. Suddenly, all those gunfights, bar brawls and romantic quarrels, to be found in abundance in John Ford's previous efforts, don't seem quite so exciting anymore, and all we're left with is the lingering melancholy of nostalgia, the memory of wasted years and missed opportunities. Many critics say that Ford reached full maturity with 'The Searchers (1956),' the powerful tale of a cowboy plagued with guilt and racial prejudice. However, even that film required a lighthearted romantic subplot to break up the drama, a typical Ford inclusion that rather thinned the emotional intensity of the primary narrative. 'Liberty Valance' offends similarly ? Edmond O'Brien's drunkenness and Andy Devine's cowardice are clearly played for laughs ? but this does little to detract from the story at the film's heart, a wistful reminiscence of the Old West, before it became civilised, and the untruths that helped build the core of the Western legend.John Wayne and James Stewart were, of course, no strangers to the Western genre. Their casting, aside from adding commercial appeal to the picture, was made with a very deliberate intention in mind ? after years of defining these two actors' Western identities, Ford would then systematically break them down, to reveal the bitter truths about life, love and death in the Old West. But, in a way, Ford seems to prefer the "uncivilised" and "lawless" lands prior to the arrival of the educated man ? we watch with disdain as a fast-talking politician (John Carradine) carelessly spouts lies to add dramatic effect to his speech, and refers to Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) as "the bullet-ridden body of an honest citizen." Just how did the scholarly law-man, who arrives in town without a gun, manage to conquer the West, to defeat the likes of Liberty Valance? The truth is that he could only have done it with the aid of true men like Tom Doniphon (Wayne), who compromised their values and later lived to regret it.'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' comes at the cross-roads of a radical transformation in the Western genre. That same year, young director Sam Peckinpah released 'Ride the High Country (1962),' a key landmark in the development of the Revisionist Western, a subgenre that critiqued the idealistic themes of the traditional Western, and favoured realism of romanticism. Ford's film is wholly traditional in terms of film-making style, with the majority of filming taking place on studio sets rather than on location. This decision, a departure from the director's other famous Westerns (which often made excellent use of Monument Valley, Arizona) was made to stress the film's greater emphasis on characters. At the same time, however, 'Liberty Valance' is a reflection on the fallacy of Ford's Old West, a mournful footnote to decades of the director's work. Here, the villain isn't killed in a fair fight, but he's gunned down from the shadows; the hero doesn't win the girl, but dies lonely. In fact, I'm not even sure there are heroes in this story. Only legends.This is, without a doubt, one of Ford's saddest Westerns; rather than looking towards the future with hope, its characters are instead looking back with wistful regret. The West, which was once a wilderness, has been transformed into a "garden," and a well-meaning politician has built a career upon an act that he can't claim to be his own. Wayne's Tom Doniphon perhaps comes closer to heroism than any other character, but he shot his foe, unseen, from a side-street, and thus his reward is not the respect and admiration of a nation, nor the love of the girl (Vera Miles) whom he adores. Instead, the courageous but foolish educated man, Ransom Stoddard (Stewart) reaped the benefits of his "achievement," and his life is forever tinged with the guilt of his own success. We can almost see Stoddard's conscience tearing itself apart when the railway conductor good-naturedly quips, "nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance." Perhaps Stoddard did shoot Liberty Valance. The legends tell us that this is the case, and so now the truth, whatever it may be, doesn't make an ounce of difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solidly enjoyable Western that is more underlying theme than up front story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senator Ransom Stoddard returns with his wife to the small town where he first settled to practise law ? a small town in the violent, lawless mould of the Old West. He has returned for the funeral of his friend Tom Doniphon and takes the opportunity to talk to a journalist about the story that made him a legend and furthered his career ? the fact that he shot and killed violent outlaw Liberty Valance. As he talks the changing times become clear and some truths behind the legend are revealed.The westerns of John Ford will normally have wider issues as their underlying themes and many other Westerns have used the idea of the Old West giving way for new things as their backdrop. Here the main plot almost appears to take second place to that backdrop as the film is clearly more about the shift from a society solving problems with a gun, to a society controlled by laws and political structure. The film does manage to bring out a good lead plot but it is the subplot or theme that is of more interest to Ford here.This split focus has negative impacts on the main story at times and slows it down a little too much, one example being the English class taken by Stoddard which seems to be more about trumpeting the constitution than developing the plot. On the other hand it also serves to strengthen it by taking a fairly ordinary Western plot and adding layers to it. Happily it does the latter much more than the former. The hand-over between the old way (Doniphon) and the new way (Stoddard) is clearly done and is handled without underestimating the importance of the `old west' as the road to the new world. Without this aspect I think the film would have been significantly lesser and wouldn't be held in the esteem it is today.In terms of the branding of this film as a classic I think it is fair. I wouldn't put this film in my list of favourites but it is definitely a strong entry in the cannon of work from director Ford and star Wayne ? and those works definitely deserve the badge `classic'.The cast is strong and they mainly do well. Marvin is a real presence as Valance as was required for him to pose a tangible threat alongside John Wayne. Wayne is good and allows himself to be surpassed by time towards the end, in that he is seen to become obsolete in many ways and become a little bewildered by the world where his values are being left behind. Stewart has to carry the majority of the message and thus has the harder job to do. Some of his scenes are a little too heavy in the shouting and browbeating department but generally he is very effective.Overall this is a solidly good Western from a great team. Visually I'm not sure if it would have looked better in Technicolor (although it would have given another way to contrast the present and the past) as the black and white is OK, albeit a little basic feeling. The central plot is good and is held up well (and passed) by the theme of the changing culture of the west. It is done with some sadness but does well to judge neither Stoddard or Doniphon or the times they represent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reviewing the other user comments and surprised at how many people simply view this film as a "great western." If that is all this film represents to you, perhaps it missed its mark. In this Post Sept 11th era, Americans have been called to arms or at least to dig deep within themselves to find their true patriotic self. Movies such as these are forever emblematic of the constant "good versus evil" theme with its companion subplot "when must the pen be put down and the sword wielded in the name of justice." As I watched my President put forth this question to the United Nation, I was reminded of Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne wrestling with the same issues in this film. Everyone agrees violence is not good. Everyone agrees evil must be done away with. Everyone agrees alternative solutions should be explored. But what happens when all alternatives to violence fail to eradicate evil?? Is it then that a person born out of law, order, and justice must finally wield the sword and takes a Stand? Have you decided?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast of Veteran Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greatly enjoyed this great Western film directed by John Ford who produced many great Classic films. John Wayne, (Tom Doniphon) plays the role of a man who is admired by all the homesteaders in a local town who stands up against Liberty Valance, (Lee Marvin) who is a hired gun by the cattlemen against the farmers and homesteaders. Ranson Stoddard, (James Stewart) visits this town as a man who is a lawyer and works as a dish washer in a restaurant owned by Swedish owners who sell steaks that are so large they almost fall off the plates they are served on. There is also a newspaper man named Dutton Peabody, (Edmond O'Brien) who takes an interest in Ranson Stoddard and allows him to share his office space with him. Ranson tries to teach the local people in the town to read and write and he begins to fall in love with Vera Miles, (Hallie Stoddard) who becomes his wife after he encounters a confrontation with Liberty Valance. Great film with Andy Devine, (Marshall Link) and John Carradine, (Major Cassius Starbuckle) who gave great supporting roles. Great Classic film, Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford's Meditation On The Passing Of The Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a short story by Dorothy M. Johnson, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE tells the story of Ransom Stoddard, an eastern attorney who has the misfortune to be victimized by notorious outlaw Liberty Valance during a stagecoach robbery. Left for dead, Stoddard is rescued by rancher Tom Doniphon and brought to the small town of Shinbone. Disgusted by the lawlessness of the area, he determines to use not a gun but the law itself to end Valance's reign of terror.Released in 1962, VALANCE was among the last films directed by John Ford, who was more closely associated with the Western than any other Hollywood director--and in one sense it certainly has the classic "good guy vs. bad guy" plot one expects from from a western classic. But Ford was not a superficial artist, and VALANCE is a remarkably multi-layered film that plays much deeper than you might expect.Tom Doniphon is all that is right about the west; Liberty Valance is all that is wrong. But both are part and parcel of the same code, a society in which law and order are merely words on the lips of a cowardly marshal, a world where a man either dominates through fear or is dominated by it. It is a world that is coming to an end--and Rance Stoddard is in the vanguard of the new civilization. Both Doniphon and Liberty must fall before Stoddard if the worst of the west is to be tamed.The cast is superior. James Stewart (Stoddard) and John Wayne (Doniphon) have unexpected chemistry on screen, and Lee Marvin (Valance) is easily one of the most unpleasant black-hats you could ever want to see in a western, vicious to the point of being psychotic. Supporting players Vera Miles, Andy Devine, Edmund O'Brien, and Woody Strode are equally fine. Although the script is occasionally a shade overwrought, it is laced with a very fine irony and sense of loss, and John Ford brings all the various pieces together without beating the viewer to death in the process.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... so says John Wayne's character "Tom Doniphan" in this remarkable film to Lee Marvin's character "Liberty Valance" after Valance tripped Jimmy Stewart's character "Ransom Stoddard" while Ransom was bringing John Wayne his steak dinner. This film is undeniably the best western film ever made. Best story line, best acting, best filmed- and most irony.There were so many memorable lines like the above in this film, i'm surprised that not more of them haven't made it into American slang.John Wayne, always the perfect choice as a rough &amp; rugged individualistic cowboy. Lee Marvin as the bad guy works every time, too. Jimmy Stewart, the frail idealist, works great in this film as well. Vera Miles gets the job done. My choice for best supporting actor in this film was the actor who played "Pompey", for his strong but understated performance. The scene where Tom was getting drunk and tries to force Pompey to drink with him was a great allegory- he was miserable and wanted everybody to be miserable with him.If there's a better western out there, lemme know what it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never really explored the western genre, and plucked this one from the IMDb top 250.It's a cracking film that I really enjoyed, and one which I now understand why people debate so much.What struck me though, was how tall the leads are! I'm used to seeing Stewart towering over everybody, but putting him with an astonishingly good Marvin (6' 3") and of course the towering Duke (6' 4 1/2") must make this the tallest cast ever until the Green Mile came along!I've seen more than one person say that Stewart was twenty years too old for this role. I don't agree, and thought he was fairly convincing in this. There's also nothing to say how old his character was on arriving in Shinbone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone think TMWSLV is a murder mystery?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is my favorite John Wayne movie. I have watched it over and over and as I watch the movie, it occurs to me that it is really a "murder mystery".Someone shot Liberty Valance, and if you follow the script, you would assume that Tom Doniphon did it. It would make sense since John Wayne's character rescues Ransom Stoddard. Then, after he sees that Hallie loves Ransom, he tries to show Ransom he isn't cut out for the rough &amp; tumble west and as a final gesture, Tom sends Pompey with the wagon to help Ransom get out of town.Later, when Ransom is having second thoughts about accepting the nomination for political office, Tom explains what happened that night?or does he? After watching the movie over and over again, I believe that Tom Doniphon LIES to Ransom Stoddard. In reality, it WAS Ransom Stoddard who shot Liberty Valance.First, we know that throughout the movie, Tom Doniphon is there to rescue Ransom Stoddard. Second, Tom is in love with Hallie, so if Valance kills Ransom, Tom gets Hallie back. It would be in Tom's best interest to let Ransom and Liberty shoot it out. Third, bullets don't scare Ransom (as evidenced by the fact that he is willing to face Liberty on the street in a gun fight). Ransom is a man of principle. What DOES scare him is violating his principles and capitalizing on the killing of a man to gain political office.I believe this is where Tom Doniphon steps in once more to rescue Ransom Stoddard?this time, not from bullets, but from his own conscience. Tom realizes that Ransom is the right, true and just man for the political office he seeks. Tom realizes that Ransom's conscience is keeping him from it, so he makes up a story about what happened that night.I believe it is a lie because Tom never actually says, "I shot Liberty Valance." In that scene, what Tom actually says is, "Beside, YOU didn't kill Liberty Valance." He stops short of saying it was he who shot him as a clue for the viewer. He is making up the flashback scene to relieve Ransom of something scarier than bullets. He is relieving Ransom of a guilty conscience.This is affirmed in the last scene when the conductor says to Ransom, "Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance." It is like the movie is now solving the mystery and proclaiming that Ransom was in fact the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.This is just my take on the movie. Does anyone else think this could be true?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" - arguably John Ford's most thought-provoking Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I had taken Horace Greeley's advice literally. 'Go west, young man. Go west, and seek fame and fortune, adventure.' " So starts U.S. Senator Ransom Stoddard's (James Stewart) story of his first arrival to the small western town of Shinbone in John Ford's highly thought-provoking 1962 Western, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance". His arrival to Shinbone isn't welcoming at all as he's brutally whipped and left for dead by town bully Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). He basically tells him that the laws created by the U.S. government will not suffice in the West. Ransom is eventually rescued by local rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) and nursed back to health by a restaurant owner, his wife, and their daughter Hallie (Vera Miles). Even with all of his law books and documents scattered and lost, a now healthy Ransom is determined to bestow justice upon this local daily menace and his henchmen once and for all. There's only one problem with his plan to put Liberty Valance behind bars. Apparently, Tom states that in Shinbone, the law books and documents that Ransom uses won't apply to this politically unstable town. "Out here, a man settles his own problems," Tom states to Ransom. Furthermore, many of the townsfolk, including Hallie, can't read or write. However, Ransom does volunteer to teach some of Shinbone's citizens how to read and write. While his voluntary teaching works well so far, the next big encounter with Liberty comes ever so closer to the point where Tom has to teach Ransom how to shoot a gun against his will. And no matter what the end result of Ransom and Liberty's next encounter will be, it will profoundly change the town of Shinbone permanently. Either way, it makes the whole plot all the more fascinating especially when it comes to dissecting what the main moral behind this film is. Does this story argue for the importance of educating others how to read, write, and reinforce laws? Does it argue for the importance to defend yourself regardless if you're incapable and unwilling to kill a man? What makes this particular tale all the more interesting is that it answers these certain questions by giving us indirect answers and raising more questions both at the same time. In short, we're given an answer that makes us draw our own conclusions as to why it had to end up this way. Without revealing too much about this climax, it's unforgettable to say the least. The way director John Ford brings the town of Shinbone to life is also worth examining. By the end of this film, one can obtain a better appreciation of what this town was like between when Ransom first arrived and when Ransom returns at an older age. When Ransom first arrives to Shinbone, we can clearly see how poorly run this town is. The town marshal (Andy Devine) does absolutely nothing about his town's troubles except get drunk at the saloon. The only person aside from Ransom who's willing to stand up against what's going on in Shinbone is the editor of Shinbone's newspaper (Edmond O'Brien). Everyone else is either too afraid to confront Liberty over his actions or too afraid to even admit or say that Liberty's actions are unjustified. When Ransom returns to this town at an older age however, that's a different story. I appreciate the way John Ford captures the change that the town experiences by simply focusing on the folks that occupy it as opposed to just showing the town physically change. After all, the main way change can be brought about is by being introduced to original thoughts and ideas regarding how we can make life better for all of us. In this case, the citizens of Shinbone agree to put an end to the Western law being determined by gunslingers and let it now be determined by politicians. By analyzing the dilemmas our main characters experience, we can obtain a better understanding of how change is created through this technique as opposed to just being shown shots of a town physically changing. This was not just a well-chosen storytelling decision on John Ford's part, but also on the part of the film's screenwriters James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck. I also respect how Ford and his writers handled the love triangle between Ransom, Hallie, and Tom. Even though Ransom and Tom are basically competing for Hallie's affection, I admire how they still end up respecting each other as opposed to becoming each other's foes. It just makes these characters feel more real as opposed to just becoming plot devices. It's all the more encouraging since these three all have very strong personalities. I respect how Ransom believes in the written law so strongly that he'll stand up to gunslingers without a gun just to stick to his morals. I found Tom's internal struggle between his belief in guns being the law and having Liberty Valance killed for the town's good to be fascinating. The main reason is because he realizes that he isn't going to win either way by having the best of both worlds. Although she can't read or write, I like how tough and defensive Hallie can be and how she stands up for herself. Many people agree that if there's one quote that sums up "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", it would be this: "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." That quote means that regardless of the facts, this is the kind of story that people want to hear. But these words won't do justice unless viewers, Western fans or not, see this outstanding film for themselves especially if they want to have a career in politics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence (1962)During the 1960's, the Western genre proved to be more than just another subtext for violence and rugged masculinity. Thematically speaking, the genre gave a new edge to the film industry as it adopted contextual issues into the "bigger, moral picture." A few of the main premises in Liberty Valence were "civilization versus the wilderness, violence versus idealism, and the male bond (which idolizes and fraternity) versus the male ideal of isolation" (Bordwell, 247). While some instances of isolationism surface throughout the film, we as an audience ultimately sympathize for Wayne's character as he protects Senator Ransom Stoddard (the isolationist lead) from the feared gun-slinging outlaw Liberty Valence. Director John Ford was much of an auteur, whom casted John Wayne into several of his Western outlaw roles. In his film Liberty Valence, Wayne's character Tom Doniphon, is portrayed from the moment we meet him as someone who understands the relationship between the "individual and society." When we first meet him in the Ericson's Restaurant, Stoddard tells Doniphon about his confrontation with Liberty Valence bruised and beaten. Doniphon tells Stoddard that out on the Western Frontier, there is no order or law, and that things are settled and handled in a quick-draw duel. Contextually, while the film's genre turns to antimodern situations, "the iconoclastic hero struggles and fails to conform to modern society" (Bordwell, 248), at least initially. In the case of Liberty Valence, Senator Stoddard tries to press his political ideologies in the community of Shinbone, which at first raises a few eyebrows. Stoddard uses his legal knowledge and culture to fight for Statehood in the community. While it takes all the townsfolk awhile to adjust to this lifestyle, eventually they adapt to Stoddard's "idealistic perspective" by taking his legal advice. However, this articulates his failure to conform to what is shown as a "modern civilization." Since Stoddard attempts to establish conformity in the community throughout most of the film, his character in due course, betrays his primary ideals by choosing "violence" over education and order. This character contradiction is also illustrated in another example where Doniphon admits that he was the one that actually killed Liberty Valence, not Stoddard. While Stoddard is grateful for Doniphon's actions, Doniphon is disgruntled and envious that Stoddard has something that he doesn't. Stoddard teaches Hallie (a girl that admires the both of them) how to read and write, giving Stoddard an upper hand in the love triangle. Doniphon tells him to "accept his nomination as the state's first governor so that it would give Hallie something to read and write about." It's after we're given this piece of information though where we realize that Doniphon's intervention in the duel resides in personal issues. Doniphon realizes that his feelings for Hallie are outmatched by the idealistic attraction of education and democracy. The underlying concept in this instance depicts "civilization versus the wilderness," where a civilized and educated man is showcased over the opinion of an illiterate individual living on the western frontier. A final contradictory example that conveys "civilization versus the wilderness" is in the final scene where Stoddard asks Hallie if she would like to go back and live with him in her hometown of Shinbone. Excitedly, she simply tells him, "My roots are here? Look at it ? it was once a wilderness, now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?" It's in this contextual facet, where we see Stoddard give up his "civilized roots" to live a life in the wilderness, which leaves another contradictory mark on his character. While contextually, we take note that "many of the men returning home from the war at the time found that their country was profoundly changed" (Bordwell, 248), we notice the contrast between these two realities where Stoddard unexpectedly invites this cultural change even though he fights against the ideals of the wilderness setting throughout the entire film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not necessarily a rejection of the myth of the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jimmy Stewart is the greenhorn spokesperson of law and civilization in a violent frontier town. The movie is sympathetic with his aim of creating a better society, but it also seems to endorse the view expressed by John Wayne's character that violence must sometimes be met with violence. Few other Westerns consider these issues in any sustained or nuanced way. Yet it is not necessarily the case, as many commentators have said over the years, that the movie is a critique of the romanticized myth of the West. The scenes eulogizing Tom Doniphon at the beginning and the end of the film seems to be saying that, in the end, the West really was won by cowboys with guns. The Hollywood narrative is thus preserved, but at least it was questioned. In any case, the film is a must-see, and features Lee Marvin in one of the greatest Black Hat roles in Western-dom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>different Ford tribute to the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a takeoff for Wayne.His character is too romantic,a guy who does it all for the woman he loves and she doesn't even love him back.Actually,its strange why she would chose J.Stewarts's character.Nowhere in the movie does he show any affection for her or flirts with her in the least.We are supposed to understand she prefers him because he's educated.Not really convincing for a woman who was born and raised in the West,to fall for an easterner just because he taught her how to read,one would expect her to have much more in common with a local like JW. This triangle is important because its the reason Wayne shoots Valance. It can only be considered noble from a woman's point of view,since he does it for her.I thought it was all too far-fetched and not really a good motivation for a Ford or Wayne movie.Then there is the myth thing.This is the theme of the movie,new America may belong to educated and successful people,but the average American really admires guts and courage above all else,the way of the west. Stewart's character gets the girl but also gets stuck with this reputation he hates but he cant do anything about it. The real hero here is the myth ,none of the characters but the legend people believe in.In this way Ford is consistent again with his tribute to the West.But too corny here. I didn't like Stewart in this,he overacts IMO.Same thing with Ed O'Brien.The best thing is Lee Marvin's Valance,one of the great villains of movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i thought i had seen all the best movies of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart. but i was pleasantly surprised to come across this one, to find two of my favorite actors together!(i know - the other movie is How the West was won - but they were not in the same scenes together) i decided no matter how bad the story was, i surely will watch it. and watch it i did. i have seen a great many westerns. this movie is truly one of the greats. now i happened to watch the Spencer Tracey movie - The sea of grass - which gave the other side of the story - the Rancher's side. The man who shot L V gives the story of the homesteaders, the town folk, the farmers... i have read about this constant battle between the ranchers and the homesteaders in books by Louis L'Amour. to watch it on the big screen truly gives you an idea of how harsh the life was in the old west. The tough guys - the ranchers fought the Indians, struggled against the forces of nature to make a home in the middle of nowhere. and along came the other folk to claim the land that these cattlemen had fought so hard for. i guess when it comes down to progress the homesteaders and the others were right. but coming back to the topic of this movie, it's really great to see two actors, strike that, icons of western movies acting together. you would be surprised to see another actor holding his own in the presence of The Duke. well Jimmy Stewart does this easily and the two actors complement each other. one a book slinging lawyer, the other a gun slinging tough rancher. trust me on this, you surely will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine that many will say that this movie is dated.

While we often see heroes and heroines portrayed as perfect people, the heroes and heroines in this movie seem much more true to life. They are wonderful, but never perfect. As such the movie hits closer to home and is more heart warming than most movies.It did take a few minutes before I saw the greatness of this movie. At the start it almost seems a normal western. But as the characters unfold, coupled with excellent acting, the movie simply becomes much more. While John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart have been in many good movies, it is this movie that I likely will remember them the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>" . . . we print the Legend." Thus says Maxwell Scott, Editor-in-Chief of the Shinbone Star, near the end of THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, and no truer words ever were spoken. For instance, the State of Texas has had the power of total censorship against ALL American K-12 "History" text books for more than 90 years. That's why virtually no one younger than 90 realizes that Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and the rest of the Alamo "defenders" died TO RE-ENSLAVE BLACKS from Mexico's far more enlightened lawful government. All the characters John Wayne portrayed in his movies were part of the racist Western Big Lie in one way or another, never more so than here as the title character. Wayne's "Tom Doniphon" is a total Iago, promoting Mischief for Mischief's sake in Shinbone. He knows that he's a far better gunslinger than the local drunkard terror Liberty Valance, but he gets his jollies by giving Liberty a wide berth while vicariously enjoying the havoc Liberty and the gang wreak. If Tom had a pair, he'd have taken over the gang for himself long before this sordid tale begins, since he has no use for Readin', Writin', and Civilization himself. It's only after it finally dawns upon Tom that he lost "his" girl Hallie the instant she clapped eyes on Rance that Tom tardily takes out Liberty (after allowing the gratuitous torture and murders of many innocent neighbors). The mendacious plot "twist" here is transparent all along, since this tale is set in the West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in Oakland's Paramount Theatre, an art deco theatre designed by Timothy Pfleuger, 1938. So audience participation becomes part of the film aesthetic.But the movie as character study fails in comparison to "The Shootist" a far more complex and variegated film. This by contrast was simplistic and suitable to the mores of 1962--before November 1963--when the tyranny of the 2nd Amendment ruled the day.Lee Marvin--Liberty Valence--is the evil doer--have gun/will bully (the mantra of the NRA) while the na?ve James Stewart--Ransom Stoddard--believes that Liberty Valence can be brought down by force of Law. The world weary John Wayne--Tom Doniphon--knows better. Liberty Valance continues to terrorize the town till the town is sick of him. Liberty challenges Ransom to a duel. With his first shot, Liberty wounds Ransom in his shooting arm. Liberty gets ready to fire a final shot, Ransom raises his arm in what appears to be a shaky aim, fires and Liberty falls dead. Unbeknownst to Ransom, The man who shot Liberty Valence was in fact Tom Doniphon. Tom reveals this to Ransom when Ransom expresses doubt about the worthiness of being State delegate based on one deed of shooting to death an evil doer. So in some sense, Tom is releasing Ransom from a sin he does not need to own. And Ransom goes on to a career of successful Delegate, Senator, Governor. And when he returns to Shinebone for the funeral of Tom Doniphon he recites the true story--but the paper prefers the legend.Since the Newtown tragedy of almost two years ago, gun ownership has taken center stage in the American psyche, the American discourse. There are people who believe that a good guy with gun will stop a bad guy with a gun. Sadly what seems to predominate the evening news is a tendency for possession of the weapon to turn some people into pathological killers. (Not mentally ill people with guns, but people who planed in detail a scheme for homicide with that gun they own.) So to me, the 1962 movie seemed simplistic suitable to a more innocent age when mass shootings were not the norm. (Since the Dec 2012 Newtown shooting, there have been some 74 other mass shootings in schools The FBI reports a sharp increase in mass-shootings.) I remember watching the movie when it came out in 1962, and I had seen it several times since. But since the Newtown tragedy, I am less sanguine about gun ownership--both from the mere fact of owning that gun and the mindset of the gun owners--which strikes me as being down right pathological a la Liberty Valance. Have Gun / Will bully.Ransom Stoddard's patience and desire for a legal resolution falls to the wayside with the persistence and challenge of the bully, Liberty Valence.</fullReview>

In a big flashback Ransom tells his story, the story of Tom Doniphon, the story of Hallie who loved both men and the story of Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and the man who shot him. To tell more would spoil it for you. The movie has a great story but it starts a bit slow.John Ford directs another one of his masterpieces which is beautifully shot in black and white. James Stewart is good as always and after John Ford's 'The Searchers' John Wayne again is pretty good either. He can act. A classic western, truly great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who says the ending is typical Hollywood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[Possible Spoilers]People say that in order truly to appreciate the great, sweeping, Westerns, you need to be American. Maybe that's why, as a non-American, I like this one so much, for the focus of the film is not Wayne's rugged cowboy, but James Stewart's liberal, modern, lawyer. Much of the ground covered in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance had been considered before. The history of the homesetters and the legitimacy of their claims against the men who had originally tamed the area was covered in "Shane", while the arrival of an Eastern softie in the wildman's West was already a well-trodden path (eg "Dallas"), but by trading grand cinematic shot-making for characterisation and personal detail, John Ford went a step beyond those films in terms of even-handedness and depth of understanding. A film like "Shane" provided only clues as to how the West was turned into proper mass-settlement, the message effectively being by a combination of honest toil and honourable violence. On the face of it, "Liberty Valance" had the same combination, but with a new and much more revealing emphasis on the role of legal and political institutions, and, most importantly of all, of railroads. What takes "Liberty Valance" a level beyond, however, is its sense of ambiguity. Which is the more sympathetic - Stewart's noble but naive humanity or Wayne's equally noble (but beautifully unglamourised) hard cynicism? So many aspects of the film represent its uncertainty on this one key point, and almost all resurface in the final scene. If the film has two main aspects in its double-header between Stewart and Wayne, the first concerns their values and the second their relationship with Hallie. In the final scene we see both. We see Stewart's two-fold sense of guilt at having compromised his beliefs and then taken the credit not only for someone else's deed, but for an act to which he is naturally opposed, and we see the sadness and remaining uncertainty in Hallie. The impression remains that she might have made the wrong choice, emphasised by the resignation in Stewart when he asks her about the cactus rose. Throughout the film, although we sympathise with Wayne, it is natural to support Stewart's inadvertent romance - he is more youthful, and can open her eyes in ways which the old cowboy cannot. Yet, at the end, the question remains, was she any happier? Does an honest, real working life, living by the tenets of common sense, offer more than intellectual fulfillment, expanded horizons and being true to abstracts of right and wrong? Did any of the three main characters get it right? All of them end the film less certain, and probably less happy than they were at the outset, but was there anyway for them to have avoided making the choice? "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" gives no definitive answers, but it asks the questions in comprehensive style.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ONE OF ONLY 2 GREAT FILMS BY YAWNMEISTER FORD.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the great movies, not because of the criminally over-rated John Ford, but despite of him.Ford only made two great movies in his long career(this and "THE HURRICANE")and all the others were sickly and sentimental dross.For example, even the worst episodes of "BONANZA" were better than "THE SEARCHERS"."LIBERTY",however, is something else entirely;a wonderfully moving and elegaic tale about the passing of an era and how myth becomes reality.John Wayne was wonderful here as was James Stewart and especially Lee Marvin who makes Liberty one of the great screen villains. If Ford had made just this one movie his name would have deserved its place in the movie history books.That his name is there because he directed a long line of boring and cloyingly antiseptic westerns and cinematic bilge like "THE QUIET MAN" and "DONOVAN'S REEF" is one of the great anomalies of movie history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all-time favorite John Ford movies that has never received the credit that is was due. Again Ford has assembled a flawless cast from the leads right down to the bit players.John Wayne is excellent as he plays against type as the bitter rancher. Edmond O'Brien practically steals the film as Peabody the newspaper editor. They don't come any meaner than Lee Marvin as the main villain. Andy Devine is excellent as the town sheriff and Woody Strode stands out as Pompey, Wayne's man. Also of note, in minor roles are Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin as Marvin's henchmen, Ken Murray as the town doctor and Shug Fisher as one of the cowpokes. Even John Carradine turns up in the end, as a political type at the statehood convention.The only knock that I have against this film is the fact that it was shot on mainly indoor sets, and it shows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I had heard of this classic film I didn't get around to watching it until today; I must say I shouldn't have waited so long... it was great. The film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard returning to the western town of Shinbone to attend the funeral of one Tom Doniphon; a man unknown to the locals but somebody who meant a great deal to the senator. When asked why, the story returns to the time many years before when the younger Stoddard first visited Shinbone. On the way into town the stage coach carrying Stoddard is ambushed by a group of ruffians and he is left for dead; Doliphon rescues him and takes him into town. Here he learns that the man who attacked him was the infamous Liberty Valance. He is determined that he will bring him to trial; even though everybody warns him that the only way Valance will be brought to justice is if he is gunned down! Having lost his money he takes a job at the local restaurant and meets the woman who is to become his wife, when he learns that she can't read he offers to teach her and is soon teaching many of the townspeople, it is this job that gets him into local politics; there is a vote coming up to decide whether the territory should become a state; something opposed by the cattle barons and their hired gun Liberty Valance. Realising that a confrontation is inevitable he learns to shoot but not very well... which leads to it being quite a surprise that it is Valance who goes down when they have their shoot out. Hailed as 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' he is the hero of the town and ends up not only speaking for the town but all the people wanting statehood... and so begins his illustrious career in politics while Doliphon, the man he owes so much to, disappears into obscurity.I was rather surprised that this film was set almost entirely indoors or in the streets of Shinbone rather than amongst the magnificent scenery famously favoured by Ford. This actually works in the films favour as the more intimate settings give a claustrophobic feel; Stoddard is effectively trapped by his surroundings as much as his refusal to run; James Stewart was great in the role; bringing both vulnerability and determination to the character. While John Wayne might have got top billing he is definitely the supporting actor here; he gives his standard performance; plenty of swagger but with a good heart, which is what the character needed. Over notable performances came from Vera Miles who played the woman loved by both leads and Lee Marvin who played the sadistically villainous Valance. Fans of Westerns will no doubt spot Lee 'The Bad' van Cleef as one of Valance's henchmen although the role is unfortunately rather small. If you are a fan of Westerns this should be on your list of must see films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man (Ford) who filmed a fantastic film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The man who shot liberty valence is considered as one of the best westerns ever made. Personally I don't think it's the BEST western but it is very close! The plot goes like this; A politician famous for shooting a criminal, Liberty Valence, heads back to the town where he shot him. Journalists meet him and ask him questions. Instead of answering them The senator tells them the whole story...The man who shot liberty valence was, what you could call, an "end of an age" film. Black and white films were slowly becoming obsolete and colour films were dominating Hollywood. This is probably one of the last GREAT black and white films.John ford cast some of the best actors in history and I think this is why i love the film so much. Lee Marvin, John Wayne, a cameo of lee van clef and my all time favourite actor James Stwert. Because of the confusing advertising, it's hard to know who is the main character- John Wayne or James Stewart. Although John Wayne has some good line, bold acting and plays a fantastic performance, James Stewart really steals the show. He acts like it was the last film he will play in, acting with so much expression and oozing with talent. He acts similarly in one f his earlier films, "Mr Smith Goes To Washigton" which would make since because both characters he plays are politicians. In this film he plays the character I would like to be; A justice seeking, kind, generous fellow who is not afraid to stand up to injustice. By and large;One of Stewart's best performances. John Wayne's character,Tom Doniphon. He really pulls it off. Although he is the supporting character, he's plays more like an acquaintance to James Stewart rather than a friend which keeps the film diverse. Tom Doniphon encourages the senator to fight a gunfighter who is causing some trouble in the town. The senator doesn't like the delinquent himself, but shooting him conflicts with his beliefs and this is why he doesn't appeal to Tom Doniphon as many western characters would. They play like chalk and cheese and it's just brilliant to watch.There is no action involved in the film. Instead we get a suspenseful, on edge, thrilling sequence which keeps you wanting to know if James Stewart's character will take up the gun and end the villain or if the villain will shoot him in cold blood. It's rather intriguing and will keep you glued to the screen.This was John Ford's last black and white film. Boy, did he go out in style.If your a action western junky, the chances of you liking this film are low. There are a lot of political moments and it may feel a bit long for some. However if you just like westerns in general this is a enjoyable western that not only exposes the injustice of the west but makes a daring, admirable character who stands up to it. A fantastic and unique western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford's beautifully articulated western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart and John Wayne had already made their mark on Hollywood long before this was released and it seemed as if their careers would stop. However they proved them dead wrong. Joining forces with director John Ford, they created this western which proved that scenery is not the only aspect of strong western movie-making. The film takes place in a small town with no scenery, a very bold move for director Ford. Yet it pays off, the film is as compelling as any of John Ford's westerns and any of John Wayne's performances. Wayne and Stewart shine as usual, but Lee Marvin steals the show as Liberty Valance himself. Great western, with veteran talent both behind and in front of the camera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Paper Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the western film library depicting the old frontier as seen through the eyes of John Ford, comes this black and white classic. In many ways, this tribute (which includes, stagecoach and Tie a Yellow Ribbon) personifies the early pioneers of old west. Ironically it sets the stage for many others which also purportedly 'represenated' authentic characters of the era. During the age of John Ford, few in the audience ever cared to peer beyond the colloid and never doubted it's authentic veneer. Yet, few could expect anything less when you have John Wayne and James Stewart up on the marquee. Those film greats were followed by Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, Woode Strode and of course Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance. The story is of a idealistic young man (James Steward) who is challenged by a vicious rouge character (Marvin) and his gang, (Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin). Steward is supported by rancher Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) in a quest for law and order. If one looks closely, you'll see that Steward is no gunfighter and Wayne does not necessarily wears a white hat. The title song, "The Man who Liberty Valance" which enthralled radio audiences, was sung by none other than Gene Pitney. As with any Ford Film. the window dressing of the old west can be overlook if one seeks only entertainment, which this film adequately provides. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of John Waynes best roles.. And even though he realizes that when he kills Liberty Valance he is really killing himself.For he knows his vision of the west is dying, just as Valance knows his west is dying when he sees the lawbooks. And hard to notice but has anyone else seen the quick little smirky grin, he gives to James Stewart when he tells him, that HE shot Liberty Valance, and he did'nt do it for him, he did it for Hallie..... His life has fallen apart. He has lost Hallie, has killed for her, yet knowing that even though he did this thing which he knows is not right, but done for the right reason, will cost him dearly, he has lost his most precious thing "self respect". But he wants Rance to know that he must make something of himself " for Hallies sake".Tom has realized that Ranse can give her everything he could'nt. As Tom says " you taught her how to read and write, now give her something to read and write about".... AN Underrated CLASSIC FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

When I started to watch this movie I knew it certainly couldn't be bad but I admit I still didn't expect a motion picture experience that's as wonderful and startling as this was. Personally I can't stand John Wayne and I've said it before. However I love Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin and of course the legendary Lee Van Cleef who unfortunately has only a tiny and almost invisible supporting part. With cast this great it's easier to deal with Mr. Wayne too, no doubt he makes a great performance like all the actors. At this very moment "The man who shot Liberty Valance" is #7 in the IMDb's top westerns list. That should definitely tell something. This movie is without a moment of doubt one of the finest American westerns ever made and perhaps my personal favorite of John Ford's directions. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" (1962) is essentially John Ford's "High Noon". A collection of western film conventions operating on dual levels; at once both reverent and cynical. Although not his last film it is considered the final film in which he invested much of himself; turning it into a commentary on the mythic topics and worlds of his preceding films.Superficially it is yet another "passing of the old frontier" movie and it literally juxtaposes Ford's mythic west (an extended flashback) with a recognizably modern west (which bookends the story and serves as a sort of commentary or voice-over). Ford is showing the viewer what happens when individuality is subordinated to the common good; then asking whether the results (i.e. progress) are worth what has been lost. And he stacks the deck a bit, undercutting his celebration of untrammeled individualism by including an individual more corrosive than mythic.Yet "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is not a simple superficial film; despite often being dismissed by those who fail to pick up on its multi-dimensionality. So here are some random things to look for as you view this great film: Note how like a myth, pretty much everything about the early Shinbone is a larger than life parody of film western conventions. Liberty Valance's evil, the cowardly bluster and bumbling incompetence of the sheriff (Andy Devine), the size of the steaks, the perpetually intoxicated newspaperman (Edmund O'Brien) with a passion for the truth. And contrast all this with the modern town: "This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." Watch throughout for the use of paper to punctuate the moments of extreme melodrama. Valance tears up a law book and later stuffs a newspaper into the editor's mouth. Rance (James Stewart) crumples up the newspaper he is holding when told about Valance's plans. Scott (the modern editor) crumples up his notes and discards the truth for the myth.Observe how the lawless evil of the early Shinbone is associated with the night while the modern town is all about the day. The overplayed Valance is a nocturnal figure; so extreme as to be much like a nightmare or hallucination to those who encounter him. And he is typically accompanied by his cackling and squealing sidekick/minion Floyd (Strother Martin); a character almost surreal in his sleaziness.Doniphon (John Wayne) and Liberty are linked to horses; not to the train, which is the catalyst for change, nor to the stagecoach or wagon. Individual horses are the means of mobility for the individualist, the rest of the characters get around by public transport. Liberty is hauled around in a wagon for his final trip to graveyard. A drunken Doniphon (not capable of riding his own horse) is driven back to his ranch in Pompey's (Woody Strode) wagon. The robber and the horseman are both becoming obsolete.Note Fords use in the score of what some call the "Ann Rutledge Theme," (from his 1939 film "Young Mr. Lincoln"). Hallie (Vera Miles) is Tom Doniphon's Anne Rutledge, the circumstances of their estrangement are different but equally permanent. And the music first plays when Hallie visits Tom's abandoned ranch at the beginning of the film. During the extended flashback you hear it several times as the romance between Hallie and Ranse progresses; implicitly signaling a receding of the Hallie-Tom connection.The Hallie-Tom estrangement gives the film a great deal of depth. It is a mirror image of the events in "East of Eden", as this time the heroine gives up what she had been denying herself and embraces what she thinks she should be. Don't misinterpret Tom's motivation toward Hallie, he is not doing things to win Hallie's love but because he loves Hallie (communicated by the early scene where he watches her working in the kitchen). The former motivation would be simplistic; the latter opens up a host of interesting and ironic interpretations.Miles essentially plays the same character she played for Ford six years earlier in "The Searchers" (1956). Laurie was Ford's most enduring heroine and if you watch that film you can see why he choose a reprise for "Liberty Valance". And while not as fresh looking as in the earlier film Miles is able to sell the part. Wayne could not have passed for her love interest in the earlier film and can barely do so here. That he is able to make the romantic elements credible is a good argument for calling this his finest performance; at the very least the segments immediately following the shooting are his all-time best work. His Ethan Edwards character in the earlier film had also willingly given up a girl he loved in the interest of her happiness. Miles is better in her scenes with Wayne than with Stewart. The classics are the occasions when Tom tells Hallie how pretty she is when angry. Her reaction the second time is meant to be contrasted with her earlier occasion, and to subtly convey to the viewer Hallie's growth since the introduction of Ranse into the Shinbone community.Miles in this film has always reminded me physically of Shirley Jones in "Oklahoma", and it is interesting how watching these two actresses juggle two men soon achieves a dominance over the other dynamics in both features. Neither were typical Hollywood glamour queens but their well-scrubbed persona's were a nice fit for playing this type of heroine. Note also how as in "The Searchers" Ford frames Wayne in a doorway for his final parting shot, symbolically separating him from being a part of the each film's nuclear family.Ford ends his bleakest film by revealing that just as Ranse has pretended to be the man who shot Liberty Valance, Hallie has pretended to love Ranse more than she loves Tom. Each has paid a high price for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once It Was a Wilderness, Now It's a Garden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A train arrives in the plains, the ominous dark smoke polluting the grand nature. It arrives to a nicely civilized small town in the west. Comes out a famous politician. He says he came for the funeral of a friend, Tom Doniphon, that most people have forgotten. The politician sees the body, insists "where are his boots? where is his gun belt." The boots, which was awfully nice, was taken by the undertaker, the funeral paid by the county. "I am not going to make any money out of this," the undertaker says, who was going to sell these boots for gaining some extras. A fat and sad old man, a former marshal, mentions very quietly about the gun belt, "he didn't carry a handgun for years."With a masterful economy of narrative, the beginning already crystallizes the thematic cores of this film, one of the last westerns by the master of the genre John Ford. Once it was a wilderness, the wild west. Now it's a garden, with churches, high schools, shops... civilized. But already the progress doesn't seem to be that positive--the symbol of civilization that opens the film, the train, is invading the innocence of the nature with black smoke. It's menacing. The town is clean but void of any charms. Many conversation about money, rather petty amounts. When the politician meets the black guy who worked for the dead friend, he palms some bills pretending to shake hand--a very acted out gesture of subtly caring--Jimmy Stewart is superb. The politician is obviously bluffing, acting out his charm. But at the funeral parlor, his attitude, even his manner, changes totally. Suddenly he is sincere, asking that his friend should be buried with boots and gun belt, symbol of a heroic westerner--that everybody has forgotten, now perished in poverty and oblivion.With James Stewart the iconic star of 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and the hero of the heroes of the western genre John Wayne, both playing more their own star personas, the ideals they had represented for the American cinema, than just their roles in one film, John Ford weaves out a complex analytical elegy on the myth of the west, crystallizing its inherit contradictions. This melancholic elegy is in no way sentimental nor positive, even surprisingly bitter and cold for the filmmaker that Orson Welles once called "the poet and the comedian."The politician confesses the past between his and the friend who has died, the surprising truth about how he became the champion of "law and order," arriving to the west with the hope of bringing civilization and democracy to the people of the west.But that tale is in no way an idyllic one. The young lawyer that he was being totally powerless against the law of the guns and violence of the west. The local community of small everyday people was menaced by an outlaw hired by the big ranchers. Only the heroic western gun man, that friend now going to be buried, could confront the outlaw. He told the young lawyer he should carry a gun if he wanted to survive. the young lawyer initially refused, as that would contradict his ideals of civilizations.The young lawyer opened a school. When he was talking about the democratic principles of the United States in the class room decorated by portraits of Washington and Lincoln and the Stars and Stripes, the gunman-friend came in to warn that the outlaw was approaching the small town. All the students had to leave, for safety. The lawyer, depressed, erased what he had written on the blackboard; "education is the basis of law and order."The plot develops around how the lawyer Jimmy Stewart and the gunman John Wayne, totally disagreeing with each other, yet somewhat joined hand to beat the outlaw and the big ranchers. But the struggle can only be a twisted one. It reveals the most terrible sacrifice democracy and civilization needed to pay to be realized--by making compromises, ending up betraying the very core of its ideology. The honest and non-violent lawyer becomes a politician by taking violence in his hands and then corrupting his morals; nevertheless that was a necessity for the people. The old-fashioned heroic gunman has to disappear in oblivion, even willingly so, so that democracy and civilization can take over the outlaw wilderness.Disguising a western mixed with a mystery whodunit story, what 'The Man Liberty Valance' really tells is the dark side of the American history. Democracy and the American ideals could be realized only by violence, compromises, and even lies. The civilization started with moral corruption already from the very beginning.Ford doesn't only decomposes the myth he was chiefly responsible to create; the western myth, the myth of the frontier hero. At the same time he mourns what was lost in "the progress," the innocence that there was once in the wilderness, even though it was a rough time for the people to survive. That melancholic minimalist poetry is crystallized in the delicate beauty of a cactus rose, the only genuine presence in this bitter tale of historical self-deception."Once It was a wilderness, now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?" asks the politician's wife. He can only remain silent, then asks "Who put the cactus rose on Tom's Coffin?" She replies, "I did." The train leaves in what was once a wilderness--what it used to be a beautiful innocent landscape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pilgrim's progress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a cleanly constructed, sturdy Western that uses its theme of the underdog taking on the bully and gives it real depth and a perspective on how we are shaped by a decent society, and how in turn that society shapes us. But it's something else, too, a character study of one man who makes a monumental decision that allows his small part of the frontier, the town of Shinbone, to advance on the road of progress and, at the same time, leave that man by the wayside for the rest of his miserable existence. He knows this, and does it anyway.The man is Tom Doniphon, and may well be John Wayne's single best performance. For those who said the man can't act, their education in reality should begin here. He has never looked meaner in a movie, (perhaps because he was being dogged by John Ford on the set about his empty war record) yet he manages to make us aware of his character's deeper good, even if lawyer Rance Stoddard (James Stewart) sees him as just another cutthroat. Doniphon sees farther. He should probably hate Stoddard, who is winning over his girl, but he sees him instead as the territory's one true hope of achieving law and order. Without Doniphon, Stoddard would just be another pile of carpetbagging vulture chow on the stage road. Without Stoddard, Doniphon would be the boss of Shinbone, with the woman of his dreams by his side, living in that new room he built for her back at the ranch. So what does he do? He makes Stoddard a hero, torches his dream house, and drifts away into drunken obscurity, his obituary not even making the Shinbone Star. Go figure.No wonder Doniphon presses Stoddard's buttons so, drenching him in paint and needling his vows of non-violence. He wants to test his mettle, and hopes in some way the man will chicken out. If he doesn't, Doniphon understands its his duty to stand behind (not beside, he must give Stoddard the pretense of solitude) the man and help him see his quest through. There's that word he keeps calling Stoddard, "pilgrim." Well of course he calls him "pilgrim," you say, it's John Wayne. But this is the only movie of Wayne's I remember him saying it in, and it's a telling term. "Pilgrims" after all were the people that first carved out law and order in this new land of ours, and took us on the first steps toward freedom and liberty. Calling Stoddard "pilgrim" is one way Doniphon clues us in to the fact he knows what's really at stake here.I really like this movie. I wish I loved it, but its self-mourning, elegiac tone distracts sometimes. I'm so not caught up with Stewart, who seems a trifle windy and overbearing in this one, and Vera Miles doesn't really add much in her central role. The Ford regulars are all eagerly overripe, but that's why Ford movies are so good, because he's not afraid of some broad gestures and low comedy here and there. Shakespeare understood their usefulness, too. A lot of funny bits of business, most featuring Andy Devine and Edmond O'Brien. Liberty Valance's post-mortum is a one-word classic. The message in the schoolroom is a trifle heavy-handed, but it is delivered entertaining and sets up the central message of the movie well.Lee Marvin's is the other standout performance here. His is a world-weary villainy, one knowing like Doniphon that his time is quickly passing, but unlike Doniphon ready to do anything to fight that change. Marvin lets us see the callow fear, the false bravado, beneath the smirk. Like Wayne, it's a multi-dimensional performance that's easy to overlook because we latch onto the character so completely, rather than the actor behind him.Wish they had used Gene Pitney's title song in the movie. It's a great song, written by Burt Bacharach in his pre-paisley days, and would have been a solid compliment to the opening and closing credits. By the way, what other classic film is told in the form of a reminiscence to a reporter, only to have the story's key thrown into the furnace at film's end? C'mon, movie lovers, you must know this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMHO, one of the best westerns ever shot. Simply because it isn't a western as much as it is a morality tale. John Wayne could have, maybe should have, gotten an Oscar nomination for best actor for this movie. His role as the jilted lover/overlooked hero plays as well as his Rooster Cogburn. Jimmy Stewart is at his idealistic best. That's what makes this movie so profound: The juxtaposition of the images of these two acting giants. Marvin makes a truly scary villain, and there are others in the cast to provide comic relief from what is truly a melancholy story about injustice (by Liberty Valence and the other villains) solved by another injustice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exceptional Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Western stands out from the crowded pack for two reasons. First, it stars BOTH Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne--that's a lot of star power in these leads and both had done quite a few Westerns. While Wayne had done quite a few more Westerns, Stewart's all had the distinction of being exceptional films--that's quite a track record. Second, the story is unusual--and that just doesn't happy often enough in this genre. The idea of a bully intimidating the towns people ISN'T unique, but the way it was told in flashbacks and the resolution of the problem is quite creative.Because this is a John Ford directed film, it is naturally of superb quality--with excellent pacing and supporting characters (a Ford trademark of sorts). While I don't think this film is necessarily his best film with John Wayne (THE QUIET MAN and FORT APACHE, I think, are slightly better), it is still a great film.The only negative portion of the movie is when John Wayne goes on a bender and burns down his own home. While I understood WHY he was so upset, his reaction just seemed like a big temper tantrum and was pretty unrealistic. A minor quibble, but a quibble nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legends at work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) is a book smart lawyer. On the way into town, his stagecoach is robbed by local ruffian Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and Ransom is whipped savagely. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) who rescues Ransom, is a local rancher who is vying for the affections of tavern maid Hallie Stoddard (Vera Miles). All the while, the town is terrorized by Liberty Valance and the big ranchers who oppose statehood.This is John Ford's final masterpiece western. It stars two western legends in James Stewart and John Wayne. They are too old at the start of the movie playing the younger versions of the characters. And the lack of grand vista do hold this back somewhat considering the great visuals of The Searchers. However the veteran actors make it all work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All in one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there wasn't The Searchers I would say this is the best film of John Ford. I believe he is one of the few directors that set the fundamentals of the classical Hollywood cinema but he went beyond this. I mean that he surprised me with the different levels that he was handling with, in just a film (like this one). Beyond of the excellent narration of the story (mystery, drama, action, comedy) we can see self criticism of his former films (the myth around the hero is collapsing), he comments politics, racism, the turning point that the technology and social life has come and there's no place for lonesome cowboys and fast guns. He surprised me also with the part of the incomplete love affair between Wayne and Miles. For me John Ford is inexhaustible and his beliefs a big question mark but after all he is on of the greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of John Ford's last efforts is also one of his better ones. Curiously, the limited budget Ford was given for this picture forced him to use more indoor sets, less elaborate locations (no monument valley) and even a few sound stage exteriors. This gives the film a curious and unique "look" of an early 1960's T.V. western, but with a decidedly "A" movie cast and script. The film explores the themes of authority versus anarchy, encroaching civilization upon the fading "old west." James Stewart represents law and order and progress as (in flashback) a youngish eastern lawyer who comes to the western town of Shinbone to introduce literacy and lawfulness to the people. He runs afoul of the symbol of lawlessness and anarchy in the person of Liberty Valance, a thoroughly amoral, heartless terrorist, here masterfully portrayed by Lee Marvin. John Wayne plays the intermediary character of Tom Doniphon, a rough, tough, straight talking, take no bull@#t type who recognizes the value of law and order, but knows that a gun is the most expedient and reliable persuader and peace keeper, if wielded skillfully. Doniphon befriends Stewart's character, Rance, and eventually helps Rance bring order to Shinbone. I won't give the method away except to say that Rance becomes successful due to the way in which he dispatches Valance, thus making his political ascendancy possible. He is the legendary "man who shot Liberty Valance". He must live with the truth behind the hyped up legend. The performances in this picture are a joy. Everyone is at the top of his game here. Lee Marvin should have won an Oscar. Hell, they all should have. Edmund O'Brien and Ford staple John Carradine were a bit over the top, however. Both seemed under the impression that they were performing gaslight melodrama. Vera Miles Plays the love interest in a rivalry triangle between Rance and tom, and she's appropriately saucy, irascible, and enjoyable here. Her Hallie is a virtual continuation of Laurie from "The Searchers". Great Western, well made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is a sparse, clean morality tale. The great vistas practically invented by John Ford are gone. There are no backdrops , no Monument Valleys, no Indians. In short, it is a western directed by John Ford that is NOT a John Ford Western! Go figure!John Wayne plays the most difficult role here. He is a hero who pretends not to be a hero . A man who gives all the credit for a deed he has done to Ransom Stoddard, played by James Stewart. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne's character) hates Stoddard yet he does what he does because he knows it is best for his girl and the West, even if it tears him up inside and leaves him a forgotten man. James Stewart is excellent as the traditional hero. He is Ransom Stoddard, a lawyer from the East who is determined to bring justice to the West without gunfire. The irony is that he only succeeds after gun play is attributed to him. He becomes a success for being good with a gun at a very important time even though he did not do what he was credited for. His victory is hollow and his success is without satisfaction. Lee Marvin was super in this film as the baddest bad guy in the West. The rest of the supporting cast was top-notch. Go see this film. If you already have, see it again right now!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cast- Underrated Film Often</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film, I wondered why Lee Marvin did not get more chances to work with Duke Wayne. This is one of the very few. Then add a Jimmy Stewart who seems to old for the role he is playing but does bring it off well, &amp; then you realize this is becoming more &amp; more a classic film.The film has a well crafted plot. It brings out some of Stewarts best acting. When it was released, viewers expected more because the film is a John Ford film with a loaded cast. I am not sure how they could have made it any better at the time.The film manages to tell its legend straight forward, yet with a twist. It manages to bring in pathos &amp; emotion, while also showing why a wild &amp; crazy Liberty Valance has outlived his usefulness in a more &amp; more civilized &amp; rising state &amp; country. It creates not only a legend, but 2 legends in one film as by the end you realize there is a real live hero &amp; a martyr.The supporting cast &amp; the pace of this film are worthy of a classic &amp; this film is time well spent, even today. This film rates up with the other westerns John Ford made, &amp; as time has passed, more of us realize that. Even though this film is in black and white, it gives Wayne the type of character he had in The Searchers. He is a hero, but a hero with internal struggles. Still, in this one he is dead at the beginning of the film and only alive in the flashback which tells most of the tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this. It wasn't hokey or dated. The acting was amazing and the story haunting. It made me realize how much I love John Wayne and how mesmerizing he really was. Don't ask him to kiss on screen (because he could never really do that), but damn, the camera loved that man and his charisma! I kept thinking about this story for days after I had watched it-- generally life gets in the way and prevents such meditative thought-- but this movie overcame that.The story is crafted in such a way, that suddenly all the pieces come together at the very end, literally a minute or so before the movie ended. There's so much subtle psychology revealed at the end of this movie. Life, missed opportunities, what people do to get by...I start thinking about these characters and wondered what their lives would have really been like for the past 20-30 years if they had been really people. And I'm embarrassed to admit that I cried and cried at the end of this movie, it was that powerful -- everyone should see this movie and it should be staple in all university cinema courses (and maybe psychology classes as well).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a film that my class had to watch in a High School Literature class, so it has been a little while since I watched it. Although it is classified as a western film, it does not really follow through with what most would consider a western; it takes place in the western states, and the characters are cowboys, but it is a civilised film following the different characters and their fate. I could not find anything to fault with this film whatsoever. It was engaging and entertaining and was shown to us in school as an example of good film-making. I cannot agree more with that comment.

		<fullReview>Without dribbling on about how good each actor was or how poor they were you have to simply admit this is one fine film! Ford does a fabulous job making as much authentic as possible, from fire leaping out around the cast iron pots on the wood stove, to the steaming dishwater. The set designs added to the realism as did some of the quirky characters (Struther Martin and Andy Devine for example. I thought it was cast perfectly allowing the strengths of some to play off the weaknesses (though minor) of some of the others. A very good trade off in my opinion. A bit of trivia for those that may actually read this. I've counted how many times John Wayne calls Jimmy Stewart "Pilgrim". It's 23.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, and "Rio Bravo", are my two favorite Westerns. But I might give this film the edge in terms of really being a Western masterpiece.I am updating my previous review to add information about the recent Blu Ray edition. Is it worth the upgrade. Yes. It's an excellent transfer.But I'll start with the two criticisms I have of this film...and they're minor. First, that in 1962, with 2 of America's greatest actors, John Ford still couldn't find the money to make the film in color. Second, that every once in a while in films, Jimmy Stewart could be guilty of overacting just a bit, and he does here a couple of times.Now, a lot of criticism has been leveled toward this film about the ages of Stewart and Wayne when they made this film, and particularly of Stewart. The problem is that at the beginning and ending of the film, Stewart is supposed to be in his 60's. For the body of the film, Stewart was supposed to be in his early 20s. Stewart was 54 when he made the film. Well, tough luck. I'd rather have Stewart in the role than any other actor I can think of.The story here is simple -- a Western bully terrorizes people, and the question is: who will have the guts to stand up to him? And then, the question is: who really did shoot Liberty Valence? But beyond the basic story, this film is rich in the little details: race relations, the inability of most Westerners to read, lawlessness, not to mention sadism.The other highlight of this film is the acting. This is one of John Wayne's best performances, and here he even doesn't seem awkward in the love scenes. Wayne even looks like he's enjoying the film! Stewart, despite a little overacting in a few scenes is just right for the part of the lawyer.Vera Miles is perfect as the love interest for both Wayne and Stewart. Miles was an underrated actress, but I never failed to enjoy her in any film or television appearance.I never liked Lee Marvin. Not ever in even one film. But, he chews the scenery up here as Liberty Valence. It's a bravura performance, and possibly his best.Edmond O'Brien is another of the underrated character actors who shines here. I always liked O'Brien, even when he had a few starring roles. But I don't think I ever enjoyed him more than here as the drunken newspaper publisher. This should have been an Oscar winning supporting role.I never had much use for Andy Devine, but he's really quite charming here...in his own rough way. He's particularly interesting at the beginning and end of the film.Jeanette Nolan and John Qualen are two wonderful character actors who play husband and wife, and play Scandinavian owners of a restaurant. Woody Strode has an excellent role as Wayne's "Negro" worker. And we can't leave out the creepy Strother Martin.I rarely like Westerns nowadays, but this is an exception, John Ford at his peak. John Wayne at his peak. Jimmy Stewart at his peak.And then there's that line from the end of the film: "This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." It doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

The movie stars James Stewart as Senator Ransom Stoddard arrives in the town of Shinbone with his wife Hallie (played by Vera Miles) for the funeral of Tom Doniphon (played by John Wayne), then Stoddard goes through flashbacks to the moments when they first met to the present especially the time where they set out to kill Liberty Valance (played by Lee Marvin). Director John Ford was the pre-Howard Hawks of his generation because of all of the masterpieces that he has directed throughout his entire career.</fullReview>

Woody Strode was also in five Ford movies.This is about a period in the West when the rule of the gun was giving way to the rule of law. It pontificates on the importance of education, and of the power of the people. It is not so much anti-gun as it is anti-fascism. It stresses, and reminds use that we are a nation where the people use their vote to keep our politicians honest. Sure, there is a love story in there, and that is important to why certain action is and is not taken, but it is an important movie about the growth of our country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly brilliant and classic western drama that brought together two icons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I gained a fascination with Jimmy Stewart. It has sent me through many classic films that I liked would have never seen. I have been a big fan of westerns for a long time so I was excited to watch Stewart in the first western I had seen him in. I was not disappointed. In many ways The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a very different sort of western. It is more drama than action, more story and dialogue than shoot outs. I was impressed and amazed at the ability of the actors and film makers to show the cast as ageing citizens and then as "younger" versions of themselves. It was completely believable and so well done. The film has everything you could possibly imagine from a western behind the scenes and in front of the camera. Shoot outs, western town, an evil villain, romance, the train, the frontier...everything. The story is just so in depth and you become so invested in the characters that each moment in the story will have you cheering for the next. Mixing together the romance and the political story with the frontier justice angle and you have one of the best formed genre films I have seen in a very long time. On top of that it is brilliantly acted and the characters come to life in such a big way and I am saying this from someone who is NOT a John Wayne fan.I am however, a Jimmy Stewart fan. More and more by the minute in fact. Stewart brings a quiet, subtle determination to the character of Ranse. He's very serious in the role but also has that underdog fighter quality we all love about him from his previously iconic roles. He is the hero of the film and is definitely portrayed even above the legendary John Wayne. As much as I like westerns, I can't stand John Wayne most of the time. I think he comes across as pompous and vapid in his performances. However, his portrayal of rough and tumble Tom actually works in this film. The chemistry between him and Stewart is okay...I actually wanted it to be a little better considering the story focuses on their rivalry but also their budding friendship and extreme differences in personality. Wayne is his usual lumbering, slow talking self and it works this time. I still thought I was gonna pull my hair out if he said "pilgrim" one more time. Vera Miles is terrific as the vivacious and outspoken Hallie Stoddard. Her chemistry with both Stewart and Wayne is just okay but the romance and love triangle that drives the film works very well. Her character is terrific and a strong and driven female lead. The legendary Lee Marvin is the evil Liberty Valance and is perfect at it. Surprisingly, considering his name is in the title, he doesn't have a ton of screen time but he personifies the western villain and the scenes with him and Wayne are some of the best. Supporting cast is brilliant, with stand out performances by Edmond O'Brien and Andy Devine in often comic but solid characters.While the film takes place almost entirely in the close quarters of the small western town it feels epic. Legendary director John Ford knows how to tell a story and Liberty Valance proves that. It does rest on a ton of action or large elaborate sets (and didn't even use colour) but instead is built on a solid story, intense characters, a romance that is far from easy and frontier justice. When you look at the film and start to dissect it I think you'd be shocked at how simple the film really is. Compare this movie to other westerns and I think you'd discover the budget for this was probably very small and yet is told so well that you would never know it. For fans of westerns, Wayne, Stewart, Marvin or just classic films...this is one you can't miss because it is truly outstanding. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Got 'Pappy' Ford, The Duke, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin, etc.,etc., So, where does this Gene Pitney "Liberty Valance" song come in?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we went to see this John Ford picture, this John Wayne, James Stewart co-starring feature, we all thought we were going to see another Western, a Horse Opera, an 'Oater', if you will. Well, we were at best, only partly right.To begin with, we have an adequate looking, yet not overly done, not very fancy or not too ornate. The production has a realistic look about it, but perhaps it did not appear as we thought of and have come to expect in the looks of a Western.The most obviously glaring difference is, that this was 1962. By this time, Color Photography was definitely in. Just about all productions would be in Technicolor, Color by Deluxe, Warner Color, Cine Color, Nature Color, etc., or one of those processes. But BLACK &amp; WHITE!!, give me a break!! But the film started thataway, and went on for the approximately 2 hours of intricately woven screenplay. In short, Tender Foot "Pilgrim", Ransom Stoddard(Jimmy Stewart), fresh from Law School, has made his way out to this un-named, semi-arid,Territory in the Old West of the United States. This was probably somewhere in the 1880's most likely, though this was never expressed, it is left to the viewer to create his own locale.Well, young Legal Eagle Stoddard gets a bitter lesson that wasn't taught in college. The World of the West is hard, harsh and highly unlawful. Having been a victim of a Robbery of a Stage Coach and the personally battered victim of one Masked Individual, who is named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin in about as bad a role he's ever played!).Half beaten to death and left by the outlaws by the roadside, Young Mr. Stoddard is rescued by Local Rancher and Good, Tough Guy, Tom Donovan(John Wayne). Donovan sees to it that Ransom Stoddard has food, shelter and medical care. We are introduced to the citizens of this town called Shinbone. Linc Appleyard (Andy Devine) is an ineffectual town Marshall, who we see run out the back way of the restaurant upon hearing that Liberty Valance had arrived.Then, through a series of complicated incidents, Stoddard manages, without trying, to work himself to the position of top citizen. He starts a school program, he works for the Town Newspaper, the Shinbone Star, Dutton Peabody(Edmund O'Brien), Publisher* In an unbelievable occurrence, Ransom Stoddard faces down Liberty Valance in a gunfight and wins, when Valance is incredibly shot dead. Well this event, combined with his 'book learning' and community activity, makes him the perfect candidate for the office of Territorial Delegate to Washington, D.C., his job being to lobby Congress to consider Statehood for the territory.** Well, for Ransom Stoddard, this is only the beginning of a highly successful career in the Political Arena. But the public office is not the only thing that he won, for in the process of becoming Shinbone's first citizen, he has won the Heart of one Hallie Ericson. And she(Vera Miles) had been the Duke's girl.The story opens up years later than these previously mentioned events. We are introduced to a rather elderly Senator Ransom Stoddard and Hallie, who had come back to Shinbone to attend the publicly funded Funeral of Tom Donovan. The Curiosity of the Newspaper's Publisher-Editor, Maxwell Scott(Carleton Young) as to just what was so damn important about this Tom Donovan to get a U.S. Senator back to town.The rest of the story is told almost completely in flashback. We laugh a lot and cry some. But we are all better off as members of the human race. All of this because of this Human Comedy-Drama, character study and work of satire of our society, which Mr. John Ford has cleverly packaged as a Western.Thanks, Pappy!*** * By this time in his career, Edmund O'Brien had become heir to those kind of roles that once been the property of Thomas Mitchell.** Director Ford gives us a little spoof of what a Political Convention in the United States must look like to an outsider.*** 'Pappy' was Ford's nickname to those who became his on screen family. And let us not sign off before we salute a great cast. The very experienced players included:Ken Murray, Jeanette Nolan, John Qualen, John Carridine, Woody Strode, Earle Hodgins, Willis Bouchey, Lee van Cleef, Strother Martin, Robert Simon, ............</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a supremely, satisfyingly entertaining Western tale, spun by John Ford with a perfect ensemble and mood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost tried, at least at first (err, for the most part) to resist the worthwhile performance/casting for the character of Tom Doniphan by John Wayne. While it's Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) who has much of the focal point as the lead of the picture, Doniphan (not that I'll be spoiling much saying this) *is* the man of the title, and it's really in the last section of the picture, following the typical climax of the shoot-out, where Doniphan becomes much more captivating and even poignant in his own personal manly tragedy. So far, in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Doniphan has been archetypal practically to a fault, as the true-blue cowboy who pressures and warns the newcomer lawyer Stoddard- who's only in town because he got the hell beat out of him by Valance (Lee Marvin), and who thinks the only way to settle things is by a gun, not by the law. But when the final showdown happens, Ford handles all of this perfectly, as Doniphan sort of self-destructs for a spell, as he drinks himself stupid and basically burns down his house (one might think back to La Strada for a similar masculine display of self-pittance, or even the Searchers). However, there's also an even greater moment when Doniphan himself tells Stoddard outright- and this is when Wayne actually fully delivered the goods- to go to Washington to get full- on into politics. It takes a lot to make a character who's up till then seemed to be the weak link in the picture, but it's a link that grows stronger and more in tune with the most famous line "when legend becomes fact, print the legend." Yet I'm sure Ford knew that he couldn't just rely on the bull-headed force of nature that's more often than not given such a presence by Wayne. So he casts James Stewart and Lee Marvin in the white and black roles of morality, respectively, in this small Western town where the Marshall (Andy Devine) is a hapless tubby with a big heart but little guts. Stewart breathes the full life-force that he can as the sort of good-hearted, conflicted hero of conscience that he made a staple in his career; however much this isn't as pat as a Capra movie, there is the sense that Stewart is right at home in playing Stoddard, who is generous and intelligent and a born leader, but doesn't ever like to get pushed around. So on the flip-side we get Marvin's Valance, who is arguably one of the great, nasty villains in any Western, who's out to make the picket-lines around the town into chaos if he can, and as a kind of sadistic bully with his cantankerous whip he gets fear out of everyone- that is, except Doniphan and Stoddard. There's actually one really devastating set of scenes involving the newspaperman (Edmond O'Brien, brilliant as Peabody) who drunk after being nominated for a political post gets his place of work torn to pieces, and whipped as well. Ford so far has set up so brilliantly the characters that by then its not some exploitive sequence, but where the lines of black and white become even more pronounced...and eventually, after the shoot- out (which in and of itself is quite intense), the lines become a little grayer.So is the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance a must-see? If you're wanting to see all of the essential Westerns, I'd say without a doubt. The cast assembled plays off their respective parts, and each other, with big doses of humor (Marshall), grit (Lee Van Cleef), compassion (Vera Miles's Hallie), and machismo (Wayne). While I wouldn't say Duke is totally spot-on, at least all the way through, it does provide Stewart and Marvin with unforgettable turns, and it has a very fine message to boot amid certain histrionics. Amid the subtle genre-bending motions of the plot and characters, and Ford's dead-on, superlatively-tuned style of traditional film-making, there's even bits about what it is to live in a community in America, and what the highs and lows of the society bring out in everyone, for better or worse.

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could talk about this film all day long but I'm going to limiit myself to telling you that it's the finest work by John Ford, John Wayne, or James Stewart. Ford's photography, with the deep shadows and careful camera placement, has to be seen to be believed: I swear to god that it makes his other work look like home movies by comparison. Wayne's performance eclipses even his turn in "The Searchers." His scenes in the bar after discovering his woman with Stewart are the finest of his career and his whole angry performance has a maturity and gravitas that he never matched in any other film. I've read that Ford was particularly brutal to him off-camera in this one, no doubt to keep him in the proper frame of mind, and it shows on the screen. It's the most impressive portrayal of sheer strength I've ever seen, and reminds me of Lon Chaney, Sr.. The aspects of the movie that some less discriminating viewers perceive as flaws are actually subtle touches of genius: the claustrophic unreality of the obviously soundstage-shot flashback sequence, the barrenness of the interiors of the "present day" scenes, evoking the comparative sterility of more modern life, and the plot itself, marvelous in the context of the fact that none of the legends we take for granted can really be accepted at anything remotely resembling face value. This film is so dense and rich that I'll simply refer the reader to the extant scholarship rather than proceed any further. One amazing thing, though: this movie went right by Garry Wills in his superb book on Wayne; oddly enough, Wills didn't understand the movie and even had a basic misapprehension of the storyline itself. In any case, whatever you do, don't miss this greatest of Hollywood movies, and when you watch it, give it your absolute full attention. You'll be very richly rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another John Ford masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only seen three of John Ford's films; The Grapes of Wrath, The Searchers, and this one, but they are all near-perfect. This one is slightly more flawed than the other two, but a very powerful and entertaining one nonetheless. Even though the story is told in flashback, and thus the ending is partially revealed, this film kept me guessing the entire way through, up until the excellent (if slightly implausible, this being the film's only minor flaw) surprise ending. Brilliantly performances (with Lee Marvin stealing the show making Liberty Valance one of the greatest screen villains of all time), masterfully direction and impeccable writing all combine to make this one of the great Westerns. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, elegaic western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" isn't the landmark that "The Searchers" was, this has to rank up there with the great westerns, and one of director John Ford's best films. Some criticize the predictability -- it's not difficult to guess who shot bad guy Liberty Valance. But that's not the point, and Ford makes it clear that's not the point by telling most of the film in flashback. Instead, the movie depicts the civilization of the West, as the spirit of James Stewart's character, Ransom Stoddard (Stewart's a little old for the flashback scenes, but what the heck), and his law books eventually win out over the spirit of John Wayne and his guns. Wayne's character knows in some inarticulate way that he's being marginalized and there's little he can do it about it -- except perhaps hasten the process, both of statehood and of the love story. Some viewers also say Stoddard doesn't deserve the success that comes his way (this is no give-away, as he starts the film as a senator); but Stoddard deserves credit for showing the bravery (however naive) that Wayne's character is too savvy to display. Stewart is very good; Wayne is excellent, portraying his swaggering cowboy with an atypical sadness to him; Vera Miles is good as the center of the love triangle. The rest of the supporting cast is also good, including Lee Marvin as Valance. I rate it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful film; 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Libert Valance is a brilliant film for 90% of its run. It is perfect in direction, acting, writing, and photography. The actors deserve special attention. Jimmy Stewart may only have had one better role than this one, in Hitchcock's Vertigo. John Wayne also had at least one better role, but probably not two; that one, in my opinion, was in John Ford's The Searchers. I haven't seen too many Lee Marvin movies, but he creates in Liberty Valance one of the all-time greatest bad guys that I have ever experienced, whether in the movies or elsewhere. His presence onscreen is enough to make me shiver. The staging of the gunfight between Liberty and Ransom (Stewart) is one of the best scenes I've ever seen.SPOILERSUnfortunately, the film seemed to peter off at the end. I don't know, maybe the film's fame ruins it: I already new that Ransom was not Valance's killer, so the rest isn't difficult to figure out. Maybe if I had no idea, then I wouldn't have had any reason to question it and thus figure it all out. Tom's (Wayne) reappearance at the film's end is sort of a let-down. His penultimate scene is startling and truly affecting, but that quick appearance at the end where he explains everything away disappointed me. I would have liked more, not only with the Wayne character (who deserved a lot more), but even with Ransom and Hallie (Vera Miles, whose role begins a lot stronger than it finishes). Whatever they could have added to make the film fuller, as it stands, the end is too abrupt, as I see it. I wish I could give it a 10/10, but that flaw seems too glaring to me (although I certainly might be wrong and might end up changing my vote anyway later on). 9/10 for now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only was "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" a hit song, but the movie offered a fresh perspective on heroism. Viewers learned that the stuff of legend may sometimes be just stuff, but it can be the entry point to something that is truly legendary. Cynics can view the denouement of the film as suggesting that politics hasn't changed. More romantic viewers can suggest that the film leaves you believing that a misplaced legend can still accomplish great things.Facial expressions often tell the tale and John Ford's direction lets them speak. Which of this stellar cast is playing the true hero? The quiet one? The politician to be? Unlike most westerns, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance leaves you with just enough of the ambiguous to be interesting. Only Eastwood's "Man with No Name" is more human within the western genre than the characters depicted in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nontraditional Western Passes Muster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[WARNING: This review may contain "spoilers."]This western digresses from the traditional approach. In actuality, this is the story of two men, told from the perspective of one, Ransom Stoddard. Stoddard is a "right" filled lawyer fresh from the east. Tom Doniphon, played by John Wayne also believes in "right." However, Doniphon is unsophisticated in "book learning" and operates on a rougher moral code.The location dictates that Doniphon's justice is more apropos. Likewise, Stoddard is seen as a weak man on the trail of righteousness.The catalyst for action is bad man Liberty Valance's character. Generally, he is a bully, not shy about using terror as a tool of his trade. Valance has a peculiar fear and respect for Doniphon. Stoddard, astutely reasons that both Valance and Doniphon operate on the same moral code, albeit on opposite spectrums.The result is a "thinking man's" western. The general gist of the film is riveting. However, many sequences which pervade the film are slow and rife with humorless banter.Upon Valance's exit, Doniphon's character turns inward and dark. He immediately realizes he is no good for his sweetheart and engages in a downward spiral. Succinctly, he abandons his code of honor for the sake of progress.On whole, this picture acts as commentary on modern social issues. While this film doesn't equal "High Noon," it comes close to the mark and is well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the final films from the legendary director John Ford, and it is also one of his greatest. It is the very first time renowned actors John Wayne and James Stewart appeared alongside each other in a film, and this is only one of the many things that makes The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance a powerfully spectacular film. The film opens with Stewart, who plays Ransom Stoddard, returning to a town where he once lived because of the death of an old friend. Reporters want to know Stoddard's story, so he tells them in one long flashback. This flashback tells the story of how Stoddard came to the town by accident after being held up by the notorious Liberty Valance. Once in town, Stoddard, a lawyer from the East, sets up shop and starts teaching the townsfolk how to read, and about history and politics. However, he's a survivor of the ruthless Liberty Vance, and that threat looms over his head throughout the whole movie. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valnace is an incredible film, and it is absolutely quintessential to the progression of the Western genre from spaghetti to its more modern style of today. It's ingeniously important.This is the film that symbolizes John Ford's knowledge of where his own beloved genre, the Western, was headed. It's a film that represents the maturing of the genre into something wholly new. The town in which the film is set is like any other spaghetti Western locale. It's a lawless gun slinging territory where jurisdiction is not part of the local vernacular, and jail means as much to a man as the word illegal. There are no rules in this dusty Western town, and the rest of the world seems to have no barring on what goes on here. That is, until Ransom Stoddard shows up. He represents the Eastern ideals of lawfulness and government that the Western genre practically pretended didn't exist before. He represents this maturing of the genre into the real world, not some rough and tough shoot em up fantasy land.Of course, with this kind of change you will have those who will hold it back. In the case of this film you have two characters. The first is Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance. He is the epitome of what we know the spaghetti Western outlaw to be. He is afraid of nothing and he plays by his own rules. Beating, robbing, and murdering whoever he pleases. So, as you can imagine, when he comes head to head with the lawman of the more civilized world things get ugly. It's one set of ideals taking over another. Valance's seem to be more outdated, which is why he's the bad guy and Stoddard isn't.But then you have another character which holds back this democratic progression into the lawless West. John Wayne's character as Tom Donaphin. Wayne is the perfect actor for this role because of all that he represents as an actor. He's the face of spaghetti Western. The ultimate gunslinger. The hero of the great plains. So obviously newcomer Stoddard threatens his ideals and is the representation of his face being lost amongst the crumbling of the spaghetti Western. And to drive the point home even further, that is why Donaphin is the character who lies in the coffin at the beginning of the film.This is, essentially, what the underlying theme of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is. It's a transition piece. One that illustrates the fading away of the spaghetti Western as it is replaced with something more contemporary. What was once a lawless wasteland is given government and democracy that allow it to grow into something more substantial. Throughout the film Stoddard resents the use of guns, as he aims to educate people so that democracy can replace violence and so that education can replace disorder and futile discord in these small Western towns.There's a lot more to this film than I could have ever expected, and all this subtext was a welcome surprise to a film that I thought would be nothing more than another fun spaghetti Western. It's pure genius, an exceptional metaphor through filmmaking, illustrating the morphing of a genre that the director himself was so familiar with. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a truly astounding film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, a couple old movie theme songs I always liked came to mind recently. One was "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", by Gene Pitney. I just had to download and listen - a real joy for me. And this prompted me to write this review.I saw this movie more than 30 years ago and I can still remember scenes and the story. That's how great this movie is. I'm not especially a fan of westerns (True Grit, both versions, huge exception!). But this movie is much more than a western. In my opinion, it's one of the greatest movies of all time. If you are at all a fan of Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne and/or Lee Marvin (three of the greatest actors of all time), this is a must see. If these actors and this movie are before your time, this is one of those classic movies you really should add to your "gotta see this" list.Other reviews have additional details if you're interested. For me, not particularly important. Some movies are just so incredible, that's all you need to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cowby western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just read the comments of someone from August 30, 2004, who had reached the conclusion that John Wayne's character had stepped aside "for the better man," played by Jimmy Stewart. From my view, nothing could be farther from the truth. For all Ransom Stoddard's disdain for frontier violence, in the end, he was left with no choice but to pick-up a gun to finally silence Liberty Valance, something Valance knew better than to do with Wayne's Tom Doniphon. Call Stoddard the idealist and Doniphon the realist, but don't call him the better man. In 1946, John Ford directed My Darling Clementine, perfectly blending Wayne and Henry Fonda with his usual cast of characters to create a masterwork. Sixteen years later, he put Wayne together with Stewart (plus all the ol' gang) and made another peerless film. There was a time I didn't really "get" John Ford and John Wayne. One day, I awoke and now, the greatness of these two giants of the cinema is undeniable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Western in cinema, although it is ostensibly nothing more a category of movie set in a certain time and place, has grown to become something far grander than that; an unofficial reminiscence of a lost era of manliness and the law of the tough. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is perhaps the most knowing and self-aware statement of those themes. It appeared however in the early 1960s, an era in which the classic Western itself had run its course and was beginning to fade from cinema screens.Of course, such an ultimate Western could have no-one less a personage than John Wayne in a lead role. This was just about the last time The Duke? would be able to play the he-man as opposed to the old man. Compare his physique here to that just six years later in True Grit. Though in his mid-50s, Wayne still has all the presence and charisma that made him the archetypal Man of the West, at least in outward appearance. And who better to play the level-headed lawyer who serves as both his ally and nemesis than good old Jimmy Stewart. Stewart works here because although a similar age to Wayne he has that real ability to inhabit the persona of an even older man in the prologue, and then remember that eager youth he was in Mr Smith Goes to Washington for the main bulk of the movie. This is a typically deep and considered performance from Stewart. Look at the way he places his hand on Doniphon's coffin, conveying so much meaningful reverence in such a tiny gesture.And appropriately enough The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance comes right at the tail-end of the career of John Ford, the man who was to Western directing what Wayne was to Western acting. Let's forget for a moment that this is (for very good reasons) Ford's first black and white Western since 1950. An equally big departure here is the sense of smallness and confinement. Most of Ford's oaters were what I call *plains Westerns*, ones set way out in the wilderness. This however is firmly a *town Western* of saloons and homesteads, and is in fact even more sparing in its use of landscape than such seminal town Westerns as High Noon and The Gunfighter. In fact the only really significant use of Western backdrop is in the prologue where we see the remains of Doniphon's shack, with some typically Fordian framing beneath the bow of a tree. It gives us this little whiff of the great outdoors, and it's enough to colour the rest of the movie, indoor and stuffy as it is. When we return to that location later on, the backdrop is not so prominent. It's only in the very last shot that we receive a pay-off. This is absolute genius on Ford's part.The idea of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is supposedly a mourning for the death of the old tough-guy West before the likes of Jimmy Stewart came along and civilized it. But really, it is more about the death of the *Western* itself (of which Jimmy Stewart was presumably innocent). There's more to Ford's choice to shoot in monochrome than for a bleak, shadowy look. Apart from the widescreen and of course the ages of the various actors, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance looks like it could have been made at any time in the preceding twenty years. The acting is of a style that was fast becoming outmoded by 1962, with Edmund O'Brien and Strother Martin both gloriously theatrical. And although there we seldom see rolling plains or galloping horses, this is still a movie of Western cliché, epitomised in a brilliant shot of John Wayne and Lee Marvin staring each other down completely motionless. This conception of the West never quite existed in reality, but the classic Western of Wayne and Ford certainly did exist, and this is what The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance salutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Stewart, Lee Marvin, John Wayne...Epic.It's the story of a city lawyer (Stewart) who moves to the west to practice law in a troubled town. He's a strong advocate for education, and takes it upon himself to invest in teaching basic school to the townsfolk. He also inspires the people to get involved with local politics.The local outlaws and bandit gang (Marvin) are against this idea. They play as the exact opposite. It turns into a classic struggle between order and chaos.There's a really powerful scene in the beginning where Marvin's gang of bandits ransack Stewarts wagon before they roll into town. Marvin discovers law books inside the luggage. Stewart informs him that he's a lawyer, to which his response is ripping pages out of the law book and shouting along the lines of "This means nothing out here, I'll show you the law of the west". He then takes his belt off and whips the crap out of Stewart.Sorry for all the spoiler, I just love that scene. It's a great movie that happens to be set in the west. Westerns to me are usually full of gunfights. This film is almost the complete opposite. The fighting is pretty minimalist. It focuses around the eventual duel between the protagonist and the antagonist, and that's about it.Great cinema. If you're open minded to a dialog-heavy western, check this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Death of Liberty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb late western from John Ford that stars James Stewart and John Wayne both giving award-worthy performances.Stewart is an idealistic attorney trying to bring civility and education to a lawless frontier town terrorized by a gang of thugs, led by Libery Valance (Lee Marvin). Wayne is the upstanding town citizen who admires Stewart's ideals but also sees his naivete in believing that justice can necessarily always be dealt from a book. The film is told in flashback as Stewart, in later years a prominent politician, revisits the town to bury Wayne. It's elegiac in tone, like many of Ford's westerns, both an ode to progress but also a lament for what's lost at the sake of it.Edmond O'Brien has a supporting role as the town newspaperman/drunk while Vera Miles plays a love interest for both Stewart and Wayne. The entire cast gels beautifully, and Ford supplies rock-solid direction. This is one of the best films of the 1960s, and one of the best westerns ever.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sombre, equivocal, nostalgic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that starts and ends on the railroad, the quintessential symbol of the coming-of-age of the pioneers of the West. This is a Western that looks back at its compromised foundations, trying to gauge the moments in which what seemed necessary might now been seen as backward, formative thuggery. It's a super film in which no answer is reached, where the good guys live on, shouldering the burden of the past as best they can.In a film where characters' names are more than averagely apposite, the town has a problem which unmistakably gets in the way of the America that everyone wants. Liberty Valance might otherwise have been called Liberty Veil - and it's no coincidence that the saviour of the town is a man called Ransom. Jimmy Stewart is no Christ-like figure but he is a new philosophy to the people of the place he finds, advocating education, reason, restraint and the rule of consensual law. Opposite his well-meaning but frontier-emasculated prophet of the future is the one man who'll tell it like it is, John Wayne's Tom Doniphon ('giving voice' to the facts - a bit of stretch but there it is.)Ford's achievement is telling a straightforward story and its ramifications without diluting any of its complex, intractable cross-weaving. The men have fought over a woman as much as over the future of a United States - and whether one can lay distinct claim to her, or it, is in constant, wistful dispute even as the credits roll. Superb and not least for the titanic central performances of Stewart and Wayne. 9/10</fullReview>

Unlike Ford's earlier Westerns shot in Monument Valley, the setting for this film is rather bleak, conveying the decay of the West. Stewart and Wayne are obviously too long in the tooth for the roles they play, but each brings an undeniable star power and they work well together. Marvin makes a nasty villain. Interestingly, Wayne and Marvin represent the two sides of a coin that lawyer Stewart wants to put out of circulation. The large supporting cast of familiar faces is terrific, particularly Miles and O'Brien.

		<shortDescription>A simple Twist of Fate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprinsingly, Nostalgia already wasn't what it was in 1962, when John Ford filmed what is generally considered as his last masterpiece : "The Man who shot Liberty Valence". The west is won, but its spirit is gone and the film shows us that it's not necessarily a bad thing.Cinema appeared at the end of the West that is generally described : cinema has the same age that the railways, that in many movies, symbolize the end of an area (from this one to Leone's "Once upon a time in the west"). "Liberty Vallence" is the movie that tells this transition from a brutal period, where strength is everything, to a civilized period, where the law primes on force. Lee Marvin is Liberty Valence, the symbol of this brutal force of the West, and James Stewart, the "Pilgrim", is the other side of the time : the law. But the transition from one to another needs a mediation, that will bring the biggest Western star, John Wayne, how embodies Tom Doniphon, the man who'll make the changes possible, by using force in order to civilized the West.Ford gives a strong an wise look to this period, in a melancholic movie, that paradoxically explains that there is nothing to regret from the changes and the disappearance of a certain idea of the world. But the characters can't help thinking that they probably missed something, that their lives could have been very different. The movie is very modern, the biggest part of it is a long flashback. James Stewart, who's now a important senator, comes back with his wife to a small village apparently full of memories. They're here to assist to the funerals of an old friend : Tom Doniphon. But their presence here surprises the local journalist, that asked James Stewarts for explanations. It's only after this melancholic introduction that the movie really begins with a flashback : Randson Stodard will tell the story of a man from another time : Tom Donniphon. But, as the journalist finally said in a very famous sentence : " This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." The last half hour of the movie is definitely the best, all the contradictory feelings are present, and the final duel is most impressive, beautifully filmed in Black and White photography. The twist at the end is unseen in Ford other's movies, and proves that he was still able in 1962 to direct a personal and original movie, even with the old star John Wayne, even in Black and White, even with the same narrative codes he uses since more than 30 years. This movie is still surprisingly interesting and complex, if you can see through its classicism.</fullReview>

Ford is much more careful with the supporting performances, and he gets just what is needed from Lee Marvin as the gunslinger who challenges Stewart. The action sequences and the comedic asides are far more enjoyable than the political rabble-rousing, but Ford does some amazing, show-off things with his camera that keeps the movie from getting too sticky. *** from ****</fullReview>

John Wayne looks and acts like the consummate professional he was; Jimmy Stewart displays his talent for adapting to the role of an intelligent but sensitive man thrust into events and situations he has no experience in assessing nor reacting to with certainty. The supporting players are finely cast. Lee Marvin's rendition of the immoral, violent and unpredictable Liberty Valence is nearly pitch perfect. Despite the play-like settings the film is superior to almost any non-location Westerns, and to an extent views like "Stagecoach" shot many years earlier. In particular some of the elements of great film are here, including a surprise, great acting and a few real moments.

Lee Marvin explodes as the baddest of bad guys. Never in the history of the Western has there been a badder dude. Rates up there with The Ox-Bow Incedent as one of the greatest Westerns of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is surely one of the greatest movies ever made. I remember this movie from my childhood and recently rediscovered it. Lee Marvin is menacing, John Wayne swaggering and Jimmy Stewart is principled but ineffectual. Outrageous over-acting by Edmond O'Brien and John Carradine in a cameo. Disguised as a movie about the battle between the ranchers and small landowners and an unnamed Western territory's battle for statehood and civilization, it is really a classic movie about self-sacrifice for the one you love and the greater good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FORD'S ONLY MASTERPIECE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am in the minority as I think that the much lauded John Ford was a mediocre director at best,his only good movie being the South Seas adventure from 1937 THE HURRICANE.LIBERTY VALANCE,however is not a good movie,it is a GREAT movie,one of the finest westerns ever made.That it is so great is in spite of Ford and not because of him. John Wayne,James Stewart and Lee Marvin were at the peak of their powers in this masterful movie which tells its poignant and evocative story powerfully with no frills.The scene where Wayne's steak is knocked to the floor and he confronts Marvin to pick it up is a classic.The way Wayne casually kicks one of Marvin's henchmen who tries to pick it up may be the greatest moment in Wayne's impressive career.The love triangle portrayed here is believable,moving and effective and most of all beautifully played.Most of Ford's usual excesses are kept at bay here and if anyone does at any stage sing WE SHALL GATHER AT THE RIVER (yuck!!)then I can't remember it at the time of writing.Ford was working from an excellent script for once and not a hymn sheet.I could happily dispose of all of Ford's other westerns from the lamentable STAGECOACH up until that interminable study in boredom CHEYENNE AUTUMN.Not LIBERTY VALANCE though.For once the most over-rated director in cinema history juggled all the balls successfully to create his one and only masterpiece.I just don't think it was all down to his input but by the collaborative efforts of great writers and actors working at their absolute best.Shame the Gene Pitney song wasn't played over the credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the finest westerns I have ever seen. It is more than the traditional western. Much more than any traditional kind of film. Directed by John Ford and starring John Wayne and James Stewart(one of my favorite actors) The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of the best Westerns ever made.It endured a troubled production. Ford was such a stern director that he ridiculed Wayne and Stewart so they would deliver an efficient performance. Wayne would fight with Stroud because of this. But you cannot see this internal turmoil anywhere in the film.The film starts with a retired senator returning to his old town for a friends funeral and he begins recounting the tale of his adventures to a journalist. From there we are shown his early life and how he set out for a adventure as a idealist law graduate looking for adventure in the west.Liberty Valance is the archetypal bad guy. He kills ruthlessly and there is no remorse in any thing that he does. He isn't arrested because of the coward marshall.Unlike most westerns the film isn't about anti - heroes and lone warriors. It is about a town and its colourful characters. It is about their struggles. Their attempts to find beauty in the world and try to make sense of it as best as they can. There is no room for law &amp; order . The film tries to talk about the need for all these things. You cannot go all guns blazing all the time. Like Batman you have to know where to draw the line between your enemies and yourself. An underlying feel throughout the film is about roots. How you cannot really leave the place where you are born. I love this quote by Abbas Kiarostami that talks about this. He says that he doesn't leave Iran because he would feel like a tree that has been shifted to a new location and suddenly the fruit wouldn't be good anymoreThere are moments of tremendous beauty and poignancy in the film. Like the cactus flowers. And the ending is one of the best I have ever seen. It was visceral. Sergio Leone calls this his favourite John Ford film because he says that Ford had finally learnt a word called pessimism. While I wouldn't call this film pessimistic. I would say this is his most true to life picture. Because it is the most chaotic, yet there is an answer in this chaos. There is beauty in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently panned upon its release, John Ford's film would quickly look even more outdated with the arrival of the man with no name just a year or too later, and yet over the years the Man Who Shot Liberty Valance has earned itself quite a reputation. In all honesty, it's easier to see how it was originally panned than it is to understand the praise that is now routinely heaped upon it. That's not to say the film is particularly bad ? it's just not particularly great and, apart from the hard work of a solid cast, fails to outshine any number of westerns from the fifties and sixties.A too-old James Stewart plays a lawyer fresh out of law school who is robbed by the villainous Valance (Lee Marvin in the kind of role he was born to play) and ends up washing dishes in the homely café of Swedish immigrants Nora and Peter Ericson, and their illiterate but comely daughter Hallie (a too-old Vera Miles). Of course it's not long before Stewart and Miles are exchanging affectionate glances across a pile of soapy dishes, much to the discomfort of big Tom Doniphon (a too-old John Wayne)who also has plans for Hallie.At times this looks more like a stage play than a film, and the pace is a little too leisurely for my liking. There's nothing wrong with a deliberate pace if the time is used to add depth to the characters, but when it's used to give us a potted version of the American legal system and US constitution this viewer's eyes quickly start to glaze over. The roles are clearly defined here: Stewart is the optimistic face of the new west, bringing justice and literacy to the backwards west, while Wayne and Marvin are symbols (good and bad) of the old west that must inevitably move aside for the new.As usual with Ford, there's a terrific cast of supporting players. Amongst them Edmund O'Brien and Andy Devine stand out, O'Brien for managing to inject some recognisable human traits into a character who might otherwise have been a typical stereotype, and scratchy-voiced Devine for the distracting annoyance of his cowardly buffoon of a sheriff. Woody Strode also delivers a typical performance of quiet dignity as Wayne's faithful sidekick. For his part, Wayne, although little more than a supporting character for much of the time, is always a welcome presence when he appears on the screen. Only when he is centre stage does the film really come alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Stewart and John Wayne having a cockfight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps it's just because I'm not really into the genre but I just wouldn't exactly call this movie one that stands out or one that is being John Wayne's, James Stewart, or John Ford's best one, within the western genre.This is more the sort of western that is 'clean' and entertaining, rather than purely realistic and gritty. I personally really prefer a western that is being more straight-forward and gritty but simple fact remains that the sort of westerns like this movie, were still far more popular at the time and still had a big audience for it. The more typical John Wayne Americana type of westerns, in which guns form the solution to every problem and in which the hero always saves the day.The story of this movie really isn't that solid or interesting enough to carry the entire movie and make its 2 hours of running time good and entertaining to watch, throughout. In essence it's a story about reasoning versus violence, in which James Stewart tries to resolve everything with doing things by the book and law, while the Wayne character of course prefers to shoot first and ask questions later, so to speak. They try to convince each other that their way is the best and only one to follow, while in the mean time they are also fighting over a girl. I must say, the story sounds quite good actually the way I'm making it sound out now but in the movie it just never gets edgy enough and there never ever is a real clash between the two very different main characters, since neither Wayne nor Stewart are the bad guys of this movie.It besides is a slowly told movie, that takes its time to get to the point. As a result the movie is being filled with some overlong sequences, that in the long run hardly add anything to the overall end result. It all started out interesting enough with its non-linear story-telling at the beginning but this just seems a gimmick to make the story feel more original, while it in fact actually doesn't add much to the actual story.John Wayne never really have been known as a great actor and I also don't feel that this movie features his best ever performance. He's so wooden and purely and only relying on his charisma, while playing his role. Thank goodness things really get spiced up by Lee Marvin who plays a great villain. And when Lee Van Cleef is one of your henchmen, you know he's a very bad guy, you better not mess around with. Lee Marvin really seemed to be having lots of fun playing the hardened villain, of which the movie truly benefits.Of course it's not being an horrible movie by any means but I just feel that it's one that doesn't really stand out in any way and perhaps isn't really worthy of its reputation. But maybe you just have to be a true fan of the genre to fully appreciate this movie. 7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, Intelligent western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is often overlooked as a great John Ford film, because the movie, coming from the sixties, seems to be out of its time.I typically avoid westerns, finding them rather simple-minded. But "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" always leaves you wondering about its characters and its story.The key character seems to be the Vera Miles role, who by the end of the film, has revealed a true love for both her husband Stewart and the recently departed Tom Doniphon (played by John Wayne).The movie is a complex study of intellectualism vs. brute force. Stewart as Ransom Stoddard begins the movie being appalled by the violence of Liberty Valance (played menacingly by Lee Marvin), but as the story unfolds, he comes to realize that such evil as Valance can not be eradicated by law books, but only by the necessary force of a gun.At first, I sided with Stewart all the way. I frankly have low tolerance for the great John Wayne. Too often his roles seem to be made of cardboard. But Wayne is a fine actor if given the exceptional material presented here.Stewart reveals his true weakness when, mistakenly believing he has committed murder, renounces any career in politics, since his main drawing card is that he was 'the man who shot Liberty Valance". To build a career that champions law and order all because he has become a venerated murderer is repugnant to the Stoddard character.It takes the Wayne character to tell the true tale. Once Stoddard comes to know the truth, that he has not committed murder, he can accept his seat in politics and his role in taming the Wild West.Vera Miles is wonderful in the role of Hallie. The ending is a beauty for its sparse dialog. Even if the newspapers insist on 'printing the legend', we know that the man who shot Liberty Valance died unknown, with a cactus flower on his grave.I find that this movie, like all great films, gets more entertaining and interesting the more I see it. It is much more than it seems, and it brings together two screen giants, Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did Ford tell the truth and not the legend?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne and James Stewart in this film represent the two sides of a changing west. Wayne is the man who 'made it', he is respected, he can stand up to anybody, including Lee Marvin (Liberty Valance). He takes for granted he is going to marry Vera Miles. When James Stewart shows up, with law books instead of a gun, and also with political ideas, he changes everything, and Wayne has a hard time to adapt to the new ways. The best part of the film is how Wayne handles this adaptation. He is the main hero here, but a sad hero. There is a newspaper editor who says the most famous phrase of the film " when the legend is bigger than the truth, print the legend". I am not sure I agree with that. Assuming this is correct, why did Ford make a film telling the truth and not the legend? Anyhow, this is a wonderful film, not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a great western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Ford is a fantastic director, and with this western he delivered a motion picture worth to be viewed and reviewed, analyzed and commented generation after generation. The black and white photography is in several shots of a classical beauty, for example the train rolling in and out, to start and end the film. Naturally the cast is top-class. John Wayne looks totally desperate and heartbroken when he says to Jimmy Stewart: "Allie is YOUR girl now." Lee Marvin's sardonic outburst in laughter when he makes Stewart fall while he is carrying a plate of steak makes him one of the most cynical villains ever seen in cinema. And the speechless expression on Stewart's face at the end, when the journalist tears his notes to pieces and decides not to publish what he has heard is more than an open book on his feelings, his disappointment too. However, to me photography and acting are only supporting the real message I see in this film: the crowd appreciates and values spectacular heroes, and has no or insufficient eye for moral and intellectual qualities. Ransom Stoddard had ideals as a young lawyer, and indeed he brought literacy, law and order to the little town of Shinbone. But his drama is that he realizes that these are not seen as his primary merits. He is pushed into a role of hero by an ignorant crowd, as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. And still, there is a message of hope, because for Tom Doniphon, the man who only knew to defend himself with violence and gunfire, there is nothing left but a lonely grave and a single flower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic? Not quite, more your standard 50s hoss opera. Sorry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago, I heard of a film called The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance. It was, I gathered at the time, a classic and a John Ford film no less. But I never got to see it, so when I spotted a copy - 'starring John Wayne and James Stewart' - in a bargain bin, I bought it. Classic? This 'classic' covers every cliché in a Western and then some. I really have no idea how it got its reputation or whether I somehow misheard something along the lines of 'it should have been a classic, but Ford got it wrong.' John Wayne, as far as this reviewer is concerned is can't act. In a John Wayne film, you get John Wayne, whether in a saddle, commanding a boat or in whatever other situation you find yourself in. I suppose that's fine if you like 'the John Wayne performance' but if like me it does nothing for you, you're scuppered. To call his acting one-dimensional would be charitable. James Stewart suffers from a similar affliction, but as, as a rule, the James Stewart persona isn't - for this man at least - as irritating as the John Wayne persona, it usually gets a pass. However, he does tend to play the same character. We also get the Swedish immigrant couple, the drunken newspaper editor who might be an old soak but by jimminy he's honest, the cowardly sheriff and, in Strother Martin, the cowardly sidekick. About the only thing worth your while here is Lee Marvin's baddie, and Lord is he a baddie. But apart from that, forget it. If you haven't seen this for a while and have fond memories, do yourself a favour: don't watch it, just stick with the memories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Myth of cowardly townsfolk sinks already contrived plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a remake in the works, it's time now to re-evaluate The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. Wikipedia informs us that the iconic film director John Ford considered it his favorite film. And critic Roger Ebert wrote that each of the ten Ford/Wayne westerns is "... complete and self-contained in a way that approaches perfection", and singled out Liberty Valance as "the most pensive and thoughtful" of the group.It begins with a much too long expository scene. Senator Ransom "Ranse" Stoddard (played by James Stewart made up to be well into his seventies) along with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) return to the frontier town of Shinbone, to attend the funeral of Stoddard's old cowboy friend, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Oddly, the town newspaper editor never heard of Doniphon, despite his legendary reputation, made clear by Stoddard, who then relates both his and Doniphon's story, at the editor's behest.The presence of a telephone at the railway station in the opening scene suggests that the story begins a little after the turn of the century, possibly 1905. Stoddard relates how he came to Shinbone years earlier as an idealistic young attorney, where he immediately was drastically assaulted by Liberty Valance during a stagecoach robbery. Can we assume this might have occurred 25 years earlier, perhaps around 1880? Stoddard, as a young attorney, would probably have been about 30 years old (Stewart is miscast here, as he was a little over 50 when he acted in Ford's picture).Now the location of the story is never revealed, but a big part of the plot revolves around "homesteaders" and "big ranchers." The homesteaders (which include small landowners, small farmers, etc.) are in favor of statehood and the moneyed interests (cattle barons, etc.) oppose them. While historians inform us that for the most part the wild west was relatively non-violent (especially in comparison to what's happening today, particularly in the big cities), there was one bloody conflict, the Johnson County War, which occurred in Johnson, Wyoming, between 1889 and 1893, which may have been the model for the conflict alluded to in Liberty Valance.One glaringly major omission we notice right away is that the hated "big ranchers" are never seen during the entire narrative. Instead, the sadistic criminal, Liberty Valance, is made out to be their enforcer. It's hard to buy that idea since historically, the moneyed interests banded together and created an organization, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA), which hired detectives to police the range?going after rustlers who were poaching on their land. But even if you buy the idea that a criminal like Valance might have ended up as some kind of private contractor for the WSGA, the idea that everyone in the town of Shinbone was a milquetoast (epitomized by the bumbling sheriff played by Andy Devine), and was afraid to stand up to someone like Valance is absurd. Here, only Tom Doniphon has the guts to stand up to Valance, along with Stoddard (who advocates a non-violent approach).After some small ranchers were falsely accused by WSGA detectives as "rustlers," and were killed, the homesteaders formed their own organization, the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA). As Wikipedia tells us, the WSGA hired 23 gunmen and 4 cattle detectives and ended up assassinating the head of the NWFSGA. Various dignitaries including a State Senator joined the gunmen and in response (now read this!) the Sheriff in the nearby town of Buffalo GATHERED A POSSE OF 200 MEN and ended up cornering the WSGA men at a ranch where there was a standoff for two days. Only the intervention of Federal troops on orders from President Benjamin Harrison prevented further bloodshed. So much for wimpy homesteaders!The cowardice of the townspeople in the film is contradicted by history, and the idea that Doniphon is the only man in town who can stand up to Valance, is absurd. There were tough characters on both sides of the range war, and a character like Valance would never have been allowed to get away with terrorizing the populace as is depicted here. Why Doniphon doesn't take Valance out before the climactic duel with Stoddard, makes little sense, considering Valance is already wanted for murdering two people during a robbery (not to mention the robbery of the stagecoach and Stoddard's brutal beating, recounted by the elderly Senator as the beginning of the "break into Act 2").Another plot contrivance which I find hard to swallow is the idea that a Senator from the frontier would have taken up the mantle of pacifism during that time. The wimpy Stoddard is such a pacifist that he walks out after being nominated to represent the pro-Statehood forces in Congress. Why does he walk out? Because he feels guilty that he violated his pacifist precepts by shooting Liberty Valance. It's only AFTER Doniphon reveals that it was he who shot Valance, that Stoddard has a change of heart. Now his guilt is assuaged and he can accept the nomination. The only thing good about this film is the twist that it was Doniphon and not Stoddard who shot Liberty Valance. After the duel, the rest is anti-climactic. Wimpy Stoddard goes on to become Senator and Doniphon takes to the bottle, after he fails to "get the girl." It's odd that macho John Wayne accepted the Tom Doniphon part. Perhaps he liked the idea that the macho Doniphon was a flawed character who could so easily self-destruct. I can't but help also suggest that "Liberty" is a parable about McCarthyism considering the film's release in 1962. Doniphon might have been a stand-in for McCarthy who took to the bottle after being censured by the Senate. The fight might have been justified but the methods weren't. Doniphon must pay a price?and it's the pacifist, Stoddard, who is ultimately rewarded.</fullReview>

Before many years and also before become a senator he was famous because he killed a famous outlaw, but when he returns for the funeral of his best friend he tells the true story behind that killing.I liked this movie because of the plot and because its a classic western movie in which we watch the truth about what was happening in cities in those times. Outlaws were dominating cities and marshals could not do anything to change this situation. I also liked this movie because of the interpretation of James Stewart who played as Ransom Stoddard and he was as I expected to be really good, but I believe that the best interpretation of this movie was made by John Wayne who played as Tom Doniphon and he was simply outstanding on it.Lastly I have to say that "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is a very good and enjoyable western movie which shows us many truths about those times and also makes us understand how things change because of some serious situation and due to some crazy circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter what, he will be always remembered as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. This is how legends are born."The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" (1962) is a superbly solid movie, but not a traditional western. It lacks recklessness and action of previous westerns, and it is more a solid drama set in old west. This movie sort of reminded me "Unforgiven" (1992), another superb movie set in west, but not a western in usual sense. Both movies deals with a legend status, and a true grit and reality beyond the legend. Although they are very different in style and mood, both share similar feeling of change of times in the old west, when old gunslingers were replaced by law and modern times. Overall, not going into plot details, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is an very entertaining motion picture from start till the end. It is not a traditional western, but it a very entertaining drama set in the old west. James Stewart is great in here, while John Wayne is more or less like usual John Wayne except for the ending, nevertheless he is a joy to watch. This film also deals with a lot of great ideas which are not presented openly, but are kinda hidden in context. All in all this a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart and Wayne together for the first time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a film that is highly revered today by critics and audiences alike, although when it was released in 1962 it wasn't met with the same enthusiasm. Ironically today it is one of John Ford's most popular films along with The Searchers and Stagecoach. Many even consider this to be Ford's masterpiece and the purest example of the Western genre and the transition it was heading for. The film's greatest appeal was that it starred James Stewart and John Wayne for the first time together. Wayne always did his best work under Ford's direction, but Stewart was the real star and had been at the height of his career for a while. I'm assuming watching the two together must have intrigued audiences at the time because I was definitely interested in catching up with this classic for that very reason. The film was shot in black and white, which I believe had a lot to do with the fact that both Wayne and Stewart were playing characters 30 years younger than their actual age, although it also gave the film a nostalgic quality to it. A nostalgia that works for this film in particular because through this character study we see a shift of power and dynamics from the traditional macho cowboy character living by the way of the gun to the literate and educated character who believes in justice and law. It also has a strong political undercurrent but it is basically a western where the power balance is shifting from one ideal to another. The black and white composition also allowed Ford to focus more on the characters and their relationship, delivering a carefully constructed character study as well. The film opens with Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arriving at the train station of a small local town with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles). This is the town where Hallie grew up in and where she met Ransom some 25 years earlier. When a local reporter asks the Senator what thy are doing in town he mentions they are in town for the funeral of a dear old friend named Tom. No one seems to recall who Tom was, except of course his personal ranch assistant Pompey (Woody Strode) who is mourning his friend's death next to the casket. Wanting to know why this mysterious man's death is so important to them, the reporter asks for an explanation. And so the flashback begins as Ransom narrates the story of how they met. He was a recently graduated lawyer at the time who was arriving from the East in search of better opportunities. Upon his arrival, his stagecoach was robbed by a bandit named Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and he was brutally beat. Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) came across his unconscious body and brought him to a local family restaurant where Hallie worked at. Once he recovers, Ransom wants to press charges against Liberty but he soon discovers that isn't the way things are handled in the West. Not being able to make much use of his profession in this town, he offers his help at the restaurant and also begins educating Hallie and some local ranchers in the area. Meanwhile, Valance is still in town causing havoc everywhere he goes, and Ransom sees no other way to stop him but to face him despite his lack of expertise with guns.I'm a huge fan of the Western genre and had high expectations for this classic, but I was underwhelmed by it. I found the pacing a bit slow and the fact that the film was shot on sound stages at the studio took away what I appreciate the most about the genre: the beautiful and vast location. The film is shot mostly in enclosed spaces focusing more on the characters, and although John Wayne and James Stewart were both great, I never felt their characters were developed naturally. The transitions they go through were merely there to serve the purpose of the story which was to expose the shift of our ideals of the western world. The facts are much more boring than the legends and that is exactly how I felt about this film. The villain in this film wasn't menacing at all and he simply behaved like a grown-up bully so the tension there was missing as well. The twists in the story were rather predictable as well so the final revelation never did anything for me either. The fact that Wayne and Stewart are supposed to be playing such young characters was also a distraction. Overall I understand why this film is regarded as a classic, but I just wasn't able to enjoy it as much as I had anticipated. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Senator Ransom Stoddard returns back to Shinbone for his friend's funeral. However, when the local press find out that an important political figure has made the long journey just to attend a funeral of a 'friend' they assume that there is something more to Stoddard's visit to Shinbone than meets the eye. The local press are determined to hear Stoddard's story and eventually Stoddard gives in and explains his reasons for returning to Shinbone.This, for me, is very much a message film; Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart)is a lawyer who ends up being attacked by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his gang whilst travelling through Shinbone. He initially calls for Valance to be arrested, but when he learns that the Sheriff is a coward who's pretty much afraid of his own shadow, Stoddard quickly realises that he'll have to take care of Valance himself. Stoddard is befriended by Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) who assists in toughening Stoddard up so that he is prepared for the inevitable showdown with Valance. I believe that the simple message is about standing up for oneself. Even though, the plot twist surrounding who shot Liberty Valance was predictable that didn't really matter to me because again I think that everything leading up to this scene had a purpose. I believe that Doniphon always had the intention of killing Valance. I believe that Doniphon gave Stoddard enough training to give him the confidence to step up to Valance, but he ultimately knew that Valance was too quick for Stoddard and that's why he made sure that he was on hand to kill Valance. I suspect that he may also have done it to help increase Stoddard's popularity and to ultimately influence his political career. Whatever way you look at this film, it does give the viewer a lot to think about and is certainly quite intriguing. The fact that we also don't learn how Doniphon died only adds to the mystery.As great as this film was there were some minor things that did bother me somewhat; James Stewart is usually fairly reliable, but I did feel that he over-acted in some of his scenes (particularly at the start of the film). Some of John Wayne's dialogue delivery was probably supposed to come across as dramatic, but I found some of this dialogue to be cheesy and a bit laughable. I also would have preferred it if there was a little bit more focus on Liberty Valance and his gang - they didn't get as much screen time as I would have liked. As a side note, I thought Lee Marvin was fantastic as Liberty Valance.TMWSLV is a film that is engaging and ultimately very rewarding with some very minor problems. It's a film that still had me thinking even after the credits had finished rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Ford's last true classic is one of the best of the "dying West" subgenre of western. The story is about a U.S. Senator named Rance Stoddard (James Stewart) who rose to fame as the man who killed notorious outlaw Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Attending the funeral of old friend Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), Stoddard tells some reporters the true story of how he came to the Old West and just how Liberty Valance really died.Excellent western is the first pairing of Wayne and Stewart. Both are terrific and are wonderfully supported by a great cast that includes Vera Miles, Edmond O'Brien, Jeanette Nolan, John Qualen, Andy Devine, and many other wonderful character actors. The real standout of the film, though, is Lee Marvin in what is possibly his most iconic role. The last truly classic film made by Ford and essential viewing for western fans or fans of the director and stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The hero isn't the winner, and the winner isn't the hero"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the cast of top stars this movie has, I was surprised to learn that "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence" was panned by the critics when it hit theaters in April, 1962. I was serving in the Army in Germany then, and I didn't see it until years later ? perhaps on TV. By then, its popularity and success had raised the views of the critics as well. European audiences took to the film much ahead of Americans. Today, I doubt there is a movie fan anywhere who doesn't think this is a first- rate movie and a great Western. That itself, should tell us of the fickleness of the field of professional critics.Movie buffs who haven't heard or read much about this movie and its making would enjoy a bonus feature that Paramount Pictures made in 2009. "The Size of Legends: The Soul of Myth" bonus DVD came with the DVD of the movie that I bought. My summary heading above is from that DVD ? it's the title of the third chapter of seven. The DVD is a compilation of interview vignettes with film industry people. It looks at the film and its making, at John Ford and his career, at John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, and at the Western genre. In one of the interviews, a film critic comments that it was too bad that Lee Marvin hadn't come along earlier in John Ford's career ? how Ford could have used him in more films. Film maker Peter Bogdanovich says, "The fact that the movie was dismissed in America as just another pot-boiling Western shows how shallow the thinking was in critical circles. When I first saw the film, sometime in early '62 in a screening room on Broadway in New York, there were like (sic) four people in the room. Nobody cared. Nobody came to the screening. Over the years, in the '70s, it picked up a great deal of critical support, especially in Europe and France (sic)."This film is so different from what decades of Westerns had been like up until its time. So, did the critics just presume that Westerns, in general, were a thing of the past? We know they don't enjoy the place they once had, and that's understandable. When I was a kid, growing up in the mid-20th century, we young boys played 'Cowboys and Indians' all the time. I don't recall my boys doing the same, and none of my grandkids do today. My point is that the Western theme loomed large in American culture and folklore in my childhood days. We were still quite close to the time of the wild West ? Dodge City, Tombstone, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and the OK Coral. But today, we are much further away from that time and its lore. So, while occasional Westerns are made still, they have to be of the substance and quality of the best of the Westerns in the past.This movie is about the very change in the face of the West. It's about the men and women who brought about the change. It's about the fights between open range cattle ranches and farmers and growing towns. And, it's about heroes ? unsung heroes that helped bring about the change and who are all but forgotten today. It's about legends and the men behind those legends. It's an excellent movie, and one that should be in any serious film collector's library. I'll share here some of the poignant comments in the bonus DVD, "The Size of Legends." Scott Eyman, John Ford biographer, says that the movie tells us "that our vision of the West. is based on ? agreed upon misconceptions and half truths." But that this film "insists on the importance of memory ? the past. And Americans don't particularly live in the past. We're interested in what comes next, and that's not Ford's point of view. The past is the foundation upon which the future is built. And, for Ford, there is no present without the past."Richard Schickel, film critic and historian, says, "The John Wayne character is simply lost in history and will remain so?because the newspaper guy's not going to print the story. And that was his last hope for survival? I mean, this character who does the heroic and right thing is lost to history. And that's the sadness in the movie."Eyman says, "Well, the myth starts with the title. Ransom Stoddard has built a career and a life because he's supposedly the man who shot Liberty Valence. But he knows he's a fraud. So, his entire life is kind of turning to ashes as he grows old." And Bogdanovich adds, "It's exemplified by the line at the end when Vera Miles says, 'Look at it. It used to be a wilderness and now it's a garden. You must be so proud.' And he doesn't look proud at all."The melancholy of the closing scene of Stewart and Miles, as Ransom and Molly, says it all for me. They both knew that they would not be where they are today, but for Tom Doniphon (Wayne). They owe their marriage and their lives to him. Tom was the hero for the changes that came about. Yet no one would know his part. He would never be honored, and was already forgotten. Only they, and a few others, will never forget him. And when they are gone, so will be the memory of the real hero. That is, except for you and me and the many others who have seen this movie and can be grateful for all the Tom Doniphons for their unheralded heroics in settling the West. What a fantastic move!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cowboys moral dilemma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a good example of 'The Ethics of The Cowboy'. In that it navigates the standard moral dilemma of: "Is it justifiable to use violence to achieve peace?" Though this film does not critique this question, which in effect is the fundamental objective of the cowboy; to save the day he must kill. It does show in a clear way how the question is laid out. Also, the director is a Democrat! The film was shot in black-and-white on Paramount sound stages, a marked contrast with Ford's other films of the period, such as The Searchers, which featured vast western landscapes and colour photography. Paramount executive A. C. Lyles maintained that Ford wanted to make the picture, but Paramount could not budget the necessary cost. Ford then offered to make it for whatever budget was available, although he had James Stewart and John Wayne, two of the industry's biggest attractions, both at the heights of their careers, lined up to work together for the first time. However, Lee Marvin claimed in a filmed interview that Ford realised that the film would not be as effective shot in colour, because the atmosphere and use of shadows would be adversely affected, and insisted on filming in black-and-white</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A somewhat low key JOHN FORD film about evil and myth creation in the American West. There aren't too many action scenes or grand vistas.LEE MARVIN is pretty sensational in this film, he really manages to make you hate him. And one of his sidekicks would go on to become one of the greatest villains of all time a few years later. JOHN WAYNE is effortless as usual. He does his roles with such ease. I guess he does play the same role over and over again in many films. JAMES STEWART was an aberration - the part where he tries to civilize people was pretty cringe worthy.I guess the film's message is similar to that of SHANE - some people need to be killed. There is no getting around this fact. Idealism and speeches amount to little in the face of pure evil.(7/10)</fullReview>

James Stewart plays his standard upright citizen, brave but a bit clueless, and John Wayne is, well, John Wayne.If you want a superb western, watch The Searchers, that is a fully rounded film, this is a bit 2d. Don't get me wrong, this is a good film, but there is a little too much of men with beards with their thumbs in their westcots smoking cigars and wearing hats whilst shouting at each other. There is the germ of a good idea about the passing of the old into the new, but it doesn't quite work partly because John Wayne never seems too bothered about the loss of his girl and his character isn't as rounded as in other films For me the first ten minutes are the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Fords finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What mainly strikes me, watching this again, is that Stewart, is playing, at the age of over fifty a young man fresh out of law school. How does Ford get away with that.? Black and white filming probably helps. Stewarts acting helps. But mainly I think, we don't really mind. The dynamic is that Doniphan, as the old hand, is the dominant character and Stewarts inadequacy, in terms of coping with the old west, makes him a junior, in a way. There is great poignancy in the way that doniphans time is passing. What really gets me is the sentimentality. I choke up on the opening scenes. I've seen this film so many times that I can't tell whether that's because I know the story that's about to unfold. I think it is. The most poignant aspect is that the man who actually shot Liberty Vallance is a forgotten man in the small town by the time he dies. He was somebody to reckon with as was Vallance in a different way, but his star faded. It seems the reasons for this seem to be that society has changed and his time has passed, and also the loss of the love of his life. The Incident which, by misinterpretation, launched Stewarts career, pretty much spelled the end of Wayne's. He could have had the girl but he saved the life of his rival. But anyway the day of the man who could handle a gun was gone. The cactus rose thing and the final scene get me in the throat every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly dated classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deals with some powerful themes: self sacrifice, political expediency, the rule of law versus personal responsibility etc. On the whole, it deals with them admirably. However it does somewhat undermine its message by the use of several stock comedy characters. Although typical of the films of the time (especially those with 'dark themes' that needed the tone to be lightened) they do jar modern sensibilities.The problem is the excess of such characters and their rather broadly drawn characterisations in the midst of much subtler and realistic people. The cowardly sheriff would be acceptable as comic relief on his own, as would the town stammerer. But the newspaper owner being portrayed as a comedy drunk is a gross miscalculation; he is an important character and his courage is undermined by this portrayal. The savage beating he receives from Liberty Valance and his gang is less effective and frightening than it could and should be.However such are the timeless themes that this still remains an impressive piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best western ever made, with the greatest cast, director, and screenplay ever offered to the genre. This was John Fords swan song(although not his last movie). He has made the sweeping panoramic westerns where the scenery stole your breath. He made the tough Cowboys killing Indians movies. He made the morally upright underdog movies, but here in this move I think he took all his skill and distilled that into everything a great movie should be about. Who we are, where we came from, and what we can be. It is beautiful and tragic. It is art.The love and sacrifice of Doniphan for Hallie is as great as Ric for Ilsa, with perhaps a more realistic end and certainly a more tragic end. Thank you John Ford.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the theme song on the DVD?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been catching up on a lot of great westerns lately and for me the teaming of Wayne and Stewart is enough to have made this a great film. The only actor who could ever get away with playing a part he was much too old for was James Stewart. He also did it brilliantly in "Spirit of St. Louis". He put a lot of passion and volatility into the young Stoddard and a lot of bluff and stuffiness into the older version. I always loved the irony of the ending. Edmond O'Brien is wonderful as the drunken newspaper editor but I wonder if his miraculous recovery had something to do with Ford keeping his options open as to cutting the film down in the editing process. It does seem a bit too long.O'Brien played a similar over- the -top character in "The Girl Can't Help It" which any fan of fifties pop culture should see if they haven't already. He's also great in the "Wild Bunch" which should be seen in the longest version available.I bought the DVD of "Valance" and was surprised that the theme song sung by Gene Pitney was not in the film! This seems pretty crazy to me. Does anybody know why? I assume it was sung over the opening and /or closing credits of the film in it's theatrical release but I don't know. I got burned in a similar way recently when I bought a "Petticoat Junction" DVD which didn't have the familiar theme song at the beginning of each episode. What gives? They should at least have a disclaimer on the cover if they tamper with history like that.Lee Marvin was one of the baddest bad guys in screen history! Check out" TheComancheros" where the Duke takes him out way too early in the film and "Cat Ballou" where he plays two roles one ,the gunfighter Strawn, is pretty much a send-up of Liberty.

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie referred to by various commentors as a "great western". It's really a very good anti-western, in the tradition of High Noon. More should not be said about the non-traditional protagonist played by Jimmy Stewart. For my two cents, Stewart is the one fly in the ointment; I just can't buy the 54-year-old actor as a young, eager-beaver attorney trying to make his way in the wild west.Like all great movies, the success of TMWSLV is largely attributable to its cast. I'm not just talking about Stewart (a great actor if not perfect for this role), Wayne, and Marvin, all superb and clearly having fun making this movie. Valance's henchman are portrayed superbly by Strother Martin (best known as the warden in Cool Hand Luke) and Lee Van Cleef (famous for lighting a match on Klaus Kinski's face in For a Few Dollars More). Edmund O'Brien and Woody Strode have lots of screen time as the publisher of the newspaper and Wayne's ranch hand; John Carradine has a short appearance in a great ham job as a lawyer at the convention in Capitol City. It goes on and on ... Denver Pyle, Andy Devine, and Ken Murray as the townfolks.If you can pretend that Jimmy Stewart is twenty years younger, you will really enjoy TMWSLV. My favorite scene is when Lee Marvin trips Stewart while he's carrying out John Wayne's steak.(PS: Tonight, I saw this right after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. It's interesting to see the difference in Stewart in 1939 and 1962.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: The old ways and the new ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford, the director who took booth the western genre and the Hollywood storytelling into new dimensions in four decades, has made this classic Western. As the other John Ford-Westerns I have seen, "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is not an ordinary Western. And as the case with other Ford-Westerns, his way of storytelling is much more than just gunfights. And Ford´s gunfights is not the typical gunfights either.(Some small spoilers)It is hard to talking about Ford´s "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" without expose much of it's story, but it is for me a film that discuss truth and lie, a film about change, the contrast between "the old ways" and the modern civilization - with a little help from the railroad (as in "C'era una volta il west") and a film who wants to say that the west must be purified to leave the old ways and develop the modern world - but with dependence of the old ways and through sacrifice (instead of using the new ways - putting Valance in jail where he would belong in the modern world, the old way is used - he is shot to death instead). John Ford want to show us that the west had it's bad sides but that the new world is not always better. Some things change but some remains. He thinks that people are not always interested in facts, irrespective of what time they living in."The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is a movie that contain "dusters", the long coats which became standard in Westerns after Leone started to use them frequently in his later Westerns."The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" has a superb cast, such as a very cool John Wayne together with a Woody Strode in perfect shape.Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Non-Western Western, but a True Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Western that isn't a Western? Perhaps this is double-talk. Yet `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' can be said to possess all the classic characteristics of the American Western, but with a few twists.While John Wayne and director John Ford teamed up for many memorable Westerns, tossing Jimmy Stewart into the mix in `Liberty Valance' turned the traditional Western formula on its ear. Instead of a tough, but noble Wayne doing battle with a lawless ruffian for honor, life and the girl's hand, we have something a bit different. The tough, but noble Tom Doniphan (Wayne) does indeed do battle with subhuman ruffian Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and IS trying for the hand of the attractive Hallie (Vera Miles). Stewart, however, mixes up the broth. A skinny eastern dude lawyer, Ransom Stoddard, is nearly beaten to death by a masked Valance during a stage robbery at the beginning of the story. Outraged that everyone ? including Tom ? concedes that the gun is mightier than the law in this wild territory, Rance stands his ground.This is the first screen meeting of Wayne and Stewart and the chemistry is wonderful. (It seems quite appropriate that they paired up a final time in Wayne's last film, `The Shootist.') Surprisingly, the bookish and na?ve, but inwardly tough Rance is a match for the tough, confident Tom. (In fact, the movie is worth renting just to see Stewart sock Wayne in the jaw!) In the strange quadrangle, Hallie is the tough, but inwardly vulnerable female love interest; Valance is the vicious threat to everything decent and above board; Rance is the real hero, in an anti-hero non-Western sort of way; and Tom is the upright and moral, but less idealistic big brother. A competitor with Rance for Hallie's affection, Tom bails Rance out more than once with fist and gun, yet cannot help developing a strong respect and liking for him. Each man turns in one of his finest performances.Ford is also at the top of his game ? although it almost looks like a Frank Capra movie at times. The themes of voting, being responsible citizens, law and order, and the integration of immigrants of all genders and races into the melting pot of society are smacked over the viewers' heads like the mallet with which Rance bangs to try to get order during the election for territorial delegates. Still, the film works and Ford's points are made, thanks to strong work by proud German immigrants Peter and Nora Ericson (John Qualen and Jeanette Nolan), Pompey, Tom's dependable black sidekick (Woody Strode) and several Mexicans ? all striving to learn English and become productive citizens. A cynic might call it `Mr. Smith Goes To Washington And Kills Liberty Valance.'I'm no cynic, though. This movie works because it breaks several Western clichés, while keeping Wayne and Stewart true to their natural screen personas. The cast is fine, with bumbling Andy Devine as the useless marshal and Denver Pyle as one of Valance's obnoxious giggling sidekicks. The cinematography and pacing are outstanding, as one would expect in a Ford picture, and the viewer finishes the film with a satisfied feeling. Whether one is a big western fan or not, this is a movie to watch and to share with the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>nothing's too good for ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can't withstand close examination to "The Searchers," which raised the Western genre to an art form and inspired "Taxi Driver" and other screen classics. Yet, John Ford further demythologizes the John Wayne character he helped create (compare, for instance, Wayne's first entrance in "Stagecoach," a tight closeup that should leave no doubt to The Ringo Kid's ability to make everything work out for the best, with his final scene in "Valance," where he leaves the convention hall after persuading Ransom Stoddard to do the right thing. Although not as emotionaly stirring as the classic final shot of "The Searchers," the ending to "Valance" works similar ground. "Valance" shows us people electing the right person for the wrong reason and, in the case of Wayne vs. Valance, someone doing the wrong thing (i.e., killing Valance) for the greater good. One reads that Ford just wanted to get "Valance" over with and, yes, the screenplay is riddled with cliches (Edmond O'Brien's role is played for laughs, for one thing, and anyone who knows anything about the West can guess that Valance is holding aces and eights, the so-called "dead man's hand," before his shootout with Ranse). But the movie is great entertainment, never more so than when Wayne and Lee Marvin are on screen together ("He's been hiding behind your gun long enough, Tom. You've got a choice, dish washer. You can leave town or be out in the street tonight. And don't make us come get you!"). Vera Miles, John Qualen (a staple of many Ford films) Jeannette Nolan, Denver Pyle and Woody Strode are ideally cast.Two Westerns make my career top 10, one each by Howard Hawks and John Ford: "Red River," a triumph despite a trite ending, and "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance," which is much more than the flawed masterpiece many have made it out to be. Critically, both provide entertainment upon repeated viewings, which any great movie should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I've seen every John Ford directed western, but I have seen enough. Stagecoach wasn't all that good, whereas the Searchers was. Well, this movie tops both of them. Maybe because instead of just John Wayne, it features two amazing actors. Aside from him there's Jimmy Stewart who is always great. He's the star of the movie, believe it or not, and he plays a politician who comes to the west expecting it to abide by the law. He quickly learns that out there the law is the gun. John Wayne is his educator and Liberty Valance is the name of the villain who terrorizes the town and has it in for Stewart in particular. I watch a lot of old movies and they're generally routine. Like Dirty Harry. Sure it was fun and exciting, but was it anything new? Ofcoarse not. Every once in a while there's an old movie like Network that is truly original and creative. Well, this is another one. From the introduction to the great secret at the end, this movie is original and great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is this film one of the greatest westerns of all-time, but it is also one of the greatest American movies ever made. This John Ford classic western has been tremendously underrated since it's original release. Why? Frankly I've never been able to figure that out. You've got Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne and Lee Marvin all giving powerhouse performances in a movie filled with great characterizations by everyone involved. It's a movie that is similiar to Ford's 1939 film Stagecoach, but only better in my opinion. A very mature western that tells a simple and basic storyline of events surrounding the bid for Texas Statehood and of life in the old American west of the 19th century. It was a lawless and reckless time and always a hard life for even the most rough and tough individuals of their day. Bottonline, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with it's black and white cinematography gives us what we all want from a movie, to be entertained. This movie does that from the first scene to the last frame! Ford's direction is outstanding in this, his last great effort of motion picture story telling. Over the years few directors have been successful at telling a story and entertaining an audience at the same time. John Ford was successful at both and excelled time and again in this regard. Holding the audiences attention with his highly crafted style and approach to filmmaking. No director has won more oscars then Ford who had four to his credit, but surprisingly none given to him for a western. It doesn't matter, hell....John Ford perfected the western in a career that spanned over forty years! From the Iron Horse in 1924 to 7 Women in 1966. What a life.The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance belongs right up there with the best westerns ever made, the greats and the near greats. The finest of the finest like Red River, My Darling Clementine, Shane, High Noon, The Searchers, The Westener, Rio Bravo, Once Upon a Time in the West, Unforgiven, Stagecoach and Destry Rides Again. Let's not forget the John Ford-John Wayne cavalry trilogy of Fort Apache, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande.In the 1950's there was a series of films directed by Anthony Mann and all starring James Stewart. These were considered some of the darkest adult psychological westerns ever made. Like Winchester '73, The Naked Spur, Bend of the River and The Far Country. Good stuff for sure. No doubt about it. My apologizes to those westerns I may have overlooked.</fullReview>

He played such a horrible man in this one but I found myself rooting for him. He was just a really cool guy and a great actor. Overall I'd give the movie a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Great Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)**** (out of 4) John Ford's classic about a lawyer (James Stewart) who comes out West to discover that his idea of law and order doesn't carry any weight. This is especially proved when he falls victim to a brutal attack by the thug Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) who doesn't fear a law book but only a gun, which is told to the lawyer by gunslinger Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). If THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE isn't the greatest Western ever made it's certainly right up there and I certainly think it's the greatest Western from Ford. There's no question that the director made all sorts of great films but this one here is just pure gold thanks in large part to its story and the wonderful direction but of course there's also the terrific cast that carries everything. Yes, both Wayne and Stewart are too old for their parts but this here really doesn't matter or hamper the film because both of them are just so great in the roles that fans want to see them in. Wayne is playing the typical tough guy, Stewart the lovable weak fellow and then we have Marvin turning in one of the strongest performances of his career as the hated Valance. The three actors are simply so excellent in their roles that you can't help but constantly have a smile on your face and especially during a sequence early in the picture when the three get into an argument inside a restaurant. This sequence here has to go down as one of the greatest and most tense things Ford ever did. The supporting cast also features excellent work from the likes of Vera Miles, John Carradine, Andy Devine, Ken Murray, Edmond O'Brien, Woody Strode and not to mention Marvin's sidekicks played by Strother Martin and Lee Van Cleef. The B&amp;W cinematography really captures the era that the film is set and I really don't think the story would have worked as well in color. The bit about "printing the legend" works so well here because of the B&amp;W. The film has some great tension but there's also a lot of heart, comedy and a couple great beatings. The film is certainly one of the highlights of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Liberty Valance is a bully. A big cowardly brutal bully who has a western Marshall quaking in his boots, is mean enough to just grab someone's steak from their restaurant table (throwing them out of their chair while ding it) and being totally hateful to educated peace loving Easterner James Stewart. Lee Marvin, in pre-Cat Ballou western gear, entered his name into the rogue book of villains with his performance here, the type that silent era audiences hissed and booed.The storyline has James Stewart returning to his old home for a funeral where he lays down the legend of his days leading up to the alleged hooting of the nasty Valance. There, truth be told, the reporter must decide which is the greater legend-fact or fiction. In a major supporting role, John Wayne takes a rare back seat to Stewart's attorney as his pal who tries to teach the peace-loving man the rules of the pre-civilized west: Fight or be beaten; Shot or be Shot; Kill or be Killed. His constant use of the world "pilgrim" here has become one of the signature lines of Wayne mimics. Vera Miles gives a delightfully feisty performance as the woman in both Stewart's and Wayne's lives who witnesses the entire legend and teaches both men something in the process as well. Andy Devine, John Qualen, John Carradine and Anna Lee are among the supporting players in this western of human emotions which like "High Noon" tell of sometimes that peace isn't always the way to go. John Ford adds another classic western to his cannon of masterpieces, then 50 years of cinema, with still a few more to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western at its purest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest westerns in the genre, a movie that actually marks the end of the old west as we know it. It's a dramatic tale about bullying, strength, honor, creating myth and legends about alleged heroes, and what it really takes to adapt to the truth. John Ford did a great job with telling the story in a retrospective, by placing all the missing links together, and therefore, showing the world, who really shot the infamous Liberty Valance. James Stewart is very believable as the fearful, neglected and a bit foolish, newcomer, who steps on the wrong territory and tries to fight with a notorious gunslinger, known for his perfect proficiency in gun- related manners. In all of the tension, coming from the strong dialogues, and in all the romance, coming from the beautiful Vera Miles, he seems to have succeeded in defeating Liberty. But as the memorable story is being revealed, the true nature of events can be as shocking as it may be actually expected. Another remarkable collaboration between John Ford and John Wayne, and one of the darkest western tales in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of an era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considered by many to be John Ford's final great film, this is definitely one that will always be compared side-by-side of Ford's countless other great Westerns. Yet, I cannot compare this one to others since it has such a different feel than films like Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, or The Searchers. It is startlingly more graphic in its depiction of violence, and the setup of scenes has a more modern grasp to them than any of Ford's previous work.And yet, I think that is exactly the point. John Wayne and James Stewart, two of the greatest stars of the Golden Age era, headline this movie, and I believe Ford used them to signal the end of one era and the beginning of another. At the time of its release, the studio system was starting to come unhinged, and it would soon become rule that you don't need rules to make a movie. Ford always worked by his rules in some way or another, but he seems to be going with the flow here. It takes time to establish the characters, but speeds head-on in covering a story with lots of underlying currents. This is an urgent movie.Of course, I don't think the story is what is most important here. What we see when we watch this movie is John Ford, the great American storyteller, going to great lengths to try new ideas and techniques, doing things he hadn't really done before. Everyone steps up their game, and the result is a film that can stand alongside Ford's greatest achievements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rich assortment of town characters directed in fine style by John Ford makes THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE one of his most entertaining western tales.It's the saga of a tenderfoot from the east (JAMES STEWART) who gets some rough treatment from the town's legendary villain, Liberty Valance (LEE MARVIN), and is determined to rid the town of the outlaw by establishing himself in a law office, since he's an attorney from out of town. JEANETTE NOLAN, JOHN QUALEN, WOODY STRODE, EDMOND O'BRIEN, ANDY DEVINE and last but not least, JOHN WAYNE, make up the townspeople who don't think anyone but a gunslinger can take on Valance. Stewart disagrees, becomes the town's teacher when he learns most of them are illiterate, and after some humiliating treatment from Liberty Valance, we know that Stewart is going to have to resolve the problem somehow.Ford makes the most of a wonderful cast and a story that hooks interest from the opening shot. There's lots of rough humor in typical Ford fashion and John Wayne gets to deliver some priceless wisecracks in his own inimitable style. Andy Devine is sometimes over-the-top as a cowardly marshall and Edmond O'Brien chews the scenery as the town's newspaper editor, but Vera Miles, Jeanette Nolan and others are excellent in supporting roles.It's an above average story, told in flashback, and Ford turns it into one of his most character driven films with some perfect casting in all of the major roles.Summing up: A western morality tale well worth watching...but watch out for JOHN CARRADINE. He chews the scenery with even more ferocity than O'Brien.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last big John Ford Western delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon its release, this film was panned by most critics and quickly moved to the bottom half of double features. Now, 48 years later, 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is both critically-acclaimed and loved by viewers. This is a compelling Western, one with a depth of character and story that is often missing from the genre. This film is well written, beautifully filmed and powerfully acted. It deserves its place in the pantheon of Westerns.Jimmy Stewart portrays Ransom Stoddard. Stoddard has just graduated from law school and moved to the American West. He hopes to make a name for himself among the outlaws, ranchers, settlers and dreamers that populate the West. Upon arriving he takes a job as kitchen help in the town's busiest restaurant. John Wayne plays Tom Doniphon. Doniphon is the "baddest" dude in town. He is liked by many and respected/feared by all. Both Doniphon and Stoddard have their eye on the lovely woman who also works in the restaurant. She is played by the terrific Vera Miles.The antagonist to our two heroes is the title character Liberty Valance. He is perfectly portrayed by Lee Marvin. Valance is obnoxious, foul-mouthed and very tough. Everyone, with the exception of Doniphon (Wayne), fears Liberty Valance. Valance singles out Stoddard (Stewart) for his abuse. Stoddard, being from the East, has no skill for dealing with such a person. He can neither fight nor shoot. He believes that laws and sheriffs will protect him from the wilder elements of the frontier. But the Wild, Wild West is not fully tamed. How can a city-slicker like Ransom Stoddard stand up to an outlaw like Liberty Valance? One story about this movie that I love. Both Stewart and Wayne were huge stars before this film was released. Who would get top-billing? Having your name appear first in the credits (top-billing) was a sign of status in Hollywood. Both actors agreed that Stewart would get top-billing in all the advertising. Things like the posters, lobby cards, etc. would all feature Jimmy Stewart above John Wayne. Wayne would get top-billing in the opening credits. This would create some balance between the two stars. At the time, most people thought that Stewart got the better of John Wayne. Many more people see the advertising for a film than see the actual film. But John Wayne got the last laugh. His name still appears above Stewart's in the opening credits on each and every DVD, video and TV screening of the film. We still see Wayne getting top-billing long after the advertising materials have all but disappeared. Never try to best John Wayne! 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' is the last big western from director John Ford. His films featuring Monument Valley in Arizona had amazed viewers who had never seen such magnificent scenery before. But 'Liberty Valance' is different from most Ford Westerns. Instead of amazing scenery and epic vistas, this film was shot primarily on sound stages. It is a personal story that focuses upon the characters. The traditional Ford cinematography is nowhere to be found. This movie tells the story of the changing West and Director John Ford changed his style to help tell that story. He returned to using black and white film. This too helps force our attention to the detail of the characters. These subtle changes in film making for Ford help to put 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' on the list of wonderful films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An essay on one of the greatest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), Ford spun the archetypal western into an exploration of America's history by suggesting that the new frontier of an educated, politically active America could not have existed if not for the innate strength of the old west. Similarly, through the exploration of a feudal system fractured by the hope provoked by an eastern intellectual, Ford observed that the old west could not have existed without the possibility of eventual change. Thus, old and new are as symbiotic as the forces of human nature upon which the film's thematic corps lies. The twin poles (good old and reliable tactics) of the classical western are people and the land. Taken together, they represent the forces of civilization and of nature, each existing uneasily with the other. The structure of most westerns is a series of elaborations on this theme of opposition: sheriff versus outlaw, saloon girl versus schoolteacher, settlers versus wilderness, individual versus community. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was not only one of his last but also his farewell - to the western hero, to the myth of the West - which Ford more than any other filmmaker helped create. We observe from the opening frame that things are slightly off-kilter for the year in which the film was produced: the picture is shot in black and white (a novelty at a time when almost every filmmaker tried to shoot in color). The opening credits appear on a series of wooden signs, except they are not actual signs but obvious, almost crude, drawings. And while we see the landscape - consistent with Ford's aesthetic - in the opening shot, this time it is not Monument Valley but a much less heroic vista, and through it travels not a lone cowboy or a stagecoach, but a train. We soon observe by way of the film's use of flashback (eventually flashback within flashback) that The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is about the passage of time ? history - and how we deal with it, factually and mythically. Hence, the film is about how new aspects come to replace old. The film is also about the death of the "legend" (the closing of a chapter), and as it is suggested not just in Tom's death but also in the artificiality of the sets and the references to stagecoaches (the "old" vanishing). However, the death of that legend is a grudging one. We know through the motif of the cactus rose that Hallie loved Tom (a symbol of burgeoning life and resilience; the cactus rose is a biological anomaly). And, more importantly, we know that the events of the film occur because of Tom: it is Tom who kills Valance, tells Ranse the truth about it, gives up Hallie, and thereby creates Ranse's career. It is Tom who refuses nomination and destroys his (and what was to be Hallie's) home. Thus, Tom anticipates his own obsolescence and gives up power, home, love, and finally his way of life so that Ranse may create community through words and law and politics; Tom's every act is one of denial, sacrifice, almost of suicide. As a matter of plot, the new is predicated upon the old.</fullReview>

It's neat to see so many of the supporting actors, who are so young, in this show who went onto bigger and better roles.

		<shortDescription>A Classic, Yet Politically Incorrect Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance rates as one of the top three westerns of all time; behind High Noon and Shane. A classic tale of good and innocence against bad. John Wayne gives his classic line, Pilgrim", and Jimmy Stewart in his typical emotionally charged performance. But, it's Lee Marvin who steals the film as the sadistic Liberty Valance. For those too young to recall, there was even a hit song entitled, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. However, this classic would be extremely politically incorrect today. The film pokes fun and humor at excessive drinking and drunks. It makes fun of stutters, and stereotypes gay men. There are a number of other "disturbing" points including John Wayne's character calling his African-American male servant, "Boy". If one can overlook today's thoughts, then this is truly a great acted western classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching and Idealistic, Bitter and Tender</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Libety Valance was John Ford's cinematographic legacy even though it wasn't his last film, not even his last western. But it was one of the last blossoms of a dying genre. It represents classical western, perhaps classical cinema -- old life? It's a summary of the genre's deepest emotions. A depiction of a community at the dawn of the new world in which garden and wilderness, untamed west and civilization are against each other. The film is also talks about democracy, the spine of civilization and its significance. It was an untypical film for John Ford, and it was the first film in which James Stewart and John Wayne played together, both of whom had earlier worked with Ford.John Ford's puzzling mystery of history and humanity is built on the relationship between two men but the character of Hallie, played by Vera Miles, turns their relationship into a love triangle as well. A senator, Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) arrives to a town because a friend of his, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) has died; so discretely that the press hadn't even heard of it. Soon the senator has to tell the press the story; why has he returned to the town and who was this friend of his -- "it all begun..." Soon we find out that before Stoddard the town was dominated by a notorious villain, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Stoddard desperately tried to end his reign of terror by sowing the seeds of democracy and civilization.The film is both bitter and touchingly idealistic. In addition to its social themes of justice, free speech and education, the film drills down to pure emotion, to the thematics of humanity, love and morality. The characters of James Stewart and John Wayne represent two opposite worlds: Wayne's the old world where the law of the jungle reigns. In turn, Stewart's the new world with its laws and teachings. Stewart's character tries to change the town without order or law into a model of democracy but finds it incredibly hard when Liberty Valance reminds him of the cruel reality of the wild west.The overlap of time levels and perspective technique are masterful and precisely considered; both the gags and the most serious scenes work perfectly. The scene where Liberty Valance arrives to the restaurant is one gorgeous example: Ransom (Stewart) comes to deliver Tom (Wayne) his steak but Liberty trips him up and the steak drops down to the floor. Here picking the steak up appears to us as a drama of power relationships.In the end Ransom has to meet Liberty Valance in order to make the town a better place. He insecurely approaches Valance with his small gun but for the surprise of everyone, including Ransom, Valance loses and dies. This is obviously an act: Ransom, who barely knows how to handle a gun, couldn't have won Valance. Tom, supposedly, comes to the restaurant too late and sees Hallie taking care of the wounded Ransom. Here Tom makes the biggest choice of his life: he abandons the heroism as the killer of Liberty Valance because of a promising lawyer, and at the same gives up the love of his life, Hallie. He enters to the shadows of the street as the cowards of the new world are celebrating -- brilliant psychological depiction by John Ford. History is stripped down from all of its idealistic form to a personal loss. Next comes an extremely powerful and tragic scene where Tom goes and burns the house he was supposed to build for him and Hallie to live in; he gives up of his dream. Ransom is anguished: he has resisted violence for all his life but now has a killing on his conscience. The two perspectives; the immortalized history and the truth are now revealed as Tom tells Ransom the truth that he actually killed Liberty, with a shotgun, from the shadows. Ransom is relieved and ready to continue his career as a senator-to-be. The truth is out, history can be re-written but it won't be. The real man who shot Liberty Valance can step into the shadows of history. In the end, when we return to present day from the flashback, Ransom who is now a senator explains quite clearly to the press that the true hero of the stabilization of civilization was Tom Doniphon. To which the reporter replies: "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." The alcoholic journalist and the lazy sheriff represent the new world which isn't as glorious as it could be. Ford's brilliant cinematic sense is shown in here, and the picture of corrupted political power is grotesque as the election turns into a Chaplinian farce. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is also about the sudden beauty and injustice of life. The cactus blossom is the motive of the film and it grows out to be a strong metaphor of the new world. It collects both symbolic and emotional significance to itself as the story goes by. The cactus blossom equals civilization and education. In the beginning Hallie hopes that one day their town will be full of them, and in the end when Hallie and Ransom are leaving the funeral by train they see a land, which was once cold and vacant, full of cactus blossoms, hopes and dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, to start off, I would say this is by far the best western I have ever seen. Not to say that I have seen very many (True Grit, The Good The Bad And The Ugly, and The Outlaw Josie Wales are the only ones I have seen prior to this). My reason for watching this movie is that I absolutely LOVE the song, and I didn't even know there was one until I was on wikipedia looking up who sang the song. Then I wished that I could watch it, but I figured it would be nearly impossible to find since it was so old. But not too long after, I was just browsing in the video rental store, and I saw that they had it. I was like "oh my gosh, I HAVE to rent it!" And I actually found out that the song was SUPPOSED to be on the movie's soundtrack, but the director decided to rip 1930s Henry Fonda movie songs instead=lame.Although I did like it, I was utterly disappointed that Stoddard wasn't the one that shot Liberty Valance. Because heaven forbid John Wayne sits by and lets someone else be the one that shot the bad guy. I was expecting the "man with the law book in his hand" to be the one that shot Liberty Valance. ugh *disappointment* Overall, I did like it though. Now I have to read the book that it says it is based off of at the beginning of the movie to see whether the song or the movie is telling the truth heehee!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A generally well-made western with John Wayne in excellent form, he provides an outstanding performance here, although he does have an advantage over the rest by playing the only character that is really likable in the film. James Stewart's acting is very similar to his roles in light-hearted films such as 'It's a Wonderful Life', and he was good there, but his personality feels out of place in this film, and he even looks silly against the title villain. As for the rest of the characters, they are pretty much run-of-the-mill types. The film also is bogged down by an awfully slow pace and the courtroom scenes at the end are very weak. There are some good ideas at hand here though - justice in the Old West, what makes legends and what makes good news - and the middle section of the film is quite strong. Not up to the level of John Ford's best non-westerns, this is still quite good viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director John Ford (My Darling Clementine, The Quiet Man), this to me is one of the most iconic western titles, and the film could almost be too. Basically Ransom 'Pilgrim' Stoddard (James Stewart) has returned to the town of Shinbone in the Wild West, to attend the funeral of friend Tom Doniphon (John Wayne), and to a journalist, he tells the story of "the man who shot Liberty Valance". Flashback, and he was a lawyer in Shinbone trying to bring law and order to the town, and he was lucky to survive a savage attack by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). Nursed by his wife Hallie (Vera Miles), Ransom is determined to make Liberty pay, but without violence, which Tom, when he meets him, is obviously not very confident about. While he waits for the right time, Ransom teaches the people of Shinbone to read and write, and it is only when Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien) is beaten to death by Liberty that Ransom decides violence is the only way. Eevn wounded, Ransom managed to fire a shot that he himself presumed was what killed Liberty, but later, Tom comes out to recall the fateful night, and reveal himself as the real killer. Also starring Andy Devine as Marshal Link Appleyard, Ken Murray as Doc Willoughby, John Carradine as Maj. Cassius Starbuckle, Jeanette Nolan as Nora Ericson, John Qualen as Peter Ericson, Denver Pyle as Amos Carruthers, For a Few Dollars More's Lee Van Cleef as Reese and Strother Martin as Floyd. Stewart and Wayne are both great leads, and Marvin is fantastically nasty as Liberty Valance, and there is a great quote: "When the legend becomes the fact, print the legend!", if it wasn't for the political chit chat and stuff I would have enjoyed this a lot more, but it is still a great western. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Costume Design. John Wayne was number 56, and James Stewart number 12 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Wayne was number 13, and Stewart number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and Stewart was number 13 on The World's Greatest Actor.

		<fullReview>"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" is generally considered a classic, but it's not really the type of film that inspires you to rave about it. Watching it now for the first time, you may even start wondering what all the fuss was about; the story only attains whatever importance it has in the last 10 minutes (a quite ironic comment on myth-making)). It's too long, and there are sequences (like the territorial session) that ramble on for no obvious reason. And James Stewart is about 20 years too old for his role. But John Wayne gives a standout performance and Lee Marvin provides some lively (and much-needed) villainy. I wish he was in the film more! (**1/2)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Turning Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dd John Ford and John Wayne know that they had reached their twilight hourwhen they made The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance? Is there meaning behindthe fact that John Wayne's character is introduced to us in a coffin? Perhaps I'm reading into this further then I should. Intentionally or not this film is where this team passed their baton. The subject of the film at every turn seems to hinge on turning points of society, urban development and world views. From theromanticized violence of the past, to the calculated temperament of the future. Through the desert villages of yesterday to the bustling centers of tomorrow. Wayne is a brute dinosaur and Stewart is the studied man of reason. The film exists in a meeting ground between the simplistic west we knew from classicsand the world of the modern western. While The Magnificent Seven, made twoyears earlier set the stage for the spaghetti western, this set the stage for classics such as The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Inthese worlds the gunmen are fallible and the choices they make are sometimesirrational, with sad consequences. We sympathize with Wayne in this film in a way unlike any of his previous work. This is a must see for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the West, sir.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there a more emblematic way of signalling the death of the old west than the death of John Wayne himself? Of course, we don't see his actual body, but we are made aware of what sort of person he was through the reminiscing and the dialogue - Jimmy Stewart's indignation that such a great man could ever be buried without his boots or his gun belt. There are no wide, sweeping shots of the town or of the iconic Monument Valley. Anyone who is at least a little familiar with the Western will recognise that it has become a relic here. Sometimes the steam engine brought the hero's last hurrah - here it brings not a gunslinger, but a politician and his wife. The sheriff is a plump, gone to seed kind of fellow...ah, but he was always like that. Sometimes the law must stand aside for a while for these conflicts to boil. So we have two opposing perspectives; Ranse, the young hotshot lawyer who has grand visions of his practice and schooling being able to restore this lowly frontier town, and the pragmatist, Tom, who prefers brute force and seems to be the only one who can stand up to Liberty Valance. And in between, as always, the woman. Westerns have always been imbued with a sense of their own logic, their own rules. There are clear power balances that are established; three guns, for examples, outnumbers two. We can almost certainly tell who has the upper hand just by looking the eyes. They tell us so much...and of course the fingers, inching towards the holster. Leone was very good at this, but of course he learned from the master. Ford subverts these structures in this film because it was the last of his westerns with Wayne and even he knew that the west was dying. Tom and Valance exchange death-stares in the restaurant, with Pompey ever present with his shotgun, and conventionally, we expect a slow, agonisingly tense retreat, but we would also be relishing the battle later on. Here, Ranse rudely interrupts them with some common sense. Who would die over a measly steak?, he exclaims incredulously. But as he goes into the kitchen the bravado cracks and we can see his is visibly shaken, and on the verge of tears. Stewart was not often asked to be one of the weaker of the cast, but here he does very well. Is it enough for Vera Miles' Hallie, who is the aforementioned woman the two leads are fighting over? She flirts harmlessly with Tom every time he comes around for his dinner, but the younger and newer lawyer seems to have caught her eye. Ranse offers something that no one else in this town can offer, not even the hardy Tom, and that is the hope that comes with his knowledge of the law and his passion to educate the townsfolk. She is clearly taken by this little glimmer of inspiration; how long has it been since someone didn't treat Liberty Valance's brutish invasions as normal affair? Notice that Ford doesn't ever lean on those sappy, inevitable moments to signify the romance. He suggests through their actions and reactions. The most telling scene of the film is when Hallie confronts Ranse after his 'showdown' with Vance. This is what she wanted for him, is it not? For him to stick close to his principles and to stand up for what he has been proclaiming to the townsfolk all this time. No more being bullied by the bigger men. And yet, one look at the 'hero' and Hallie immediately knows that she cannot admire what has clearly scarred him. Without a single word we know that her priorities have shifted - that she now values his wellbeing and safety more than any high-minded lawyer talk. But it is Tom that we are admiring at beginning at end. He is a character that has a distinct awareness of his own use-by date, but nevertheless chugs on, perhaps because without him Shinbone would be left free for Liberty Vance to terrorise as he pleased. We sense that he has been waiting for someone younger and more idealistic like Ranse to arrive and relieve him of his duty. John Wayne has been required in many of his roles to have that masculine aura of invincibility, the rugged wanderer, to always have the answers (often a physical one). It is why instead of weeping or talking he instead beats Vance's thugs, and then in an act of silent rage, destroys his house and possessions. But here in this film he is also required to know that this persona is not enough, and that his time has come. He realised this in The Searchers too, and gave us one of the great all time film endings. Much more admirable is the hero who knows when to back down and admit they are out of their element. He adds a parting gift - a coward shot, from the darkness, for a man who must be protected in order for Shinbone to flourish (Steward spends much of his time wearing an apron and in the kitchen - the symbolism is clear enough). With this, he has fired his last bullet, his own personal code of honour marred, but he has ensured the building blocks for the future. Tom Doniphon is the hero of this story. He was the man who shot Liberty Valance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance If you think you are getting a thoughtless western when you turn on The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, then you are dead wrong, pilgrim. This John Ford classic starring James Stewart and John Wayne brings about a very thought provoking piece to the western genre. The audience will really be challenged to evaluate what they think of right and wrong, and just how absolute the two should be. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance begs the question, will justice always prevail? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance opens by introducing us to an aged United States Senator as he visits his hometown to attend the funeral of a dear friend. Accompanied by his wife, the audience soon learns that there is quite a history between the deceased person and the Senator. Upon the newspaper reporters' ceaseless questioning of his arrival, the senator goes on to fill them, and the audience, in on the story involving him and the deceased man. Early on in the film a powerful scene takes place in which we meet the main character, Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) as he is riding in a carriage. Unfortunately for Ransom, he is ambushed by a vicious gang lead by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). After protecting the woman accompanying him, the gang turns their violent focus on Ransom savagely beating him and leaving him for dead. Fortunately for Ransom, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) peels him up from the path and takes him into town to have a local family tend to his wounds. When he finally comes to, Ransom is stunned, both to see the family tending to him so attentively, and to the realization that there is no accepted idea of justice in this Wild West. Ransom is committed to his belief that justice exists everywhere and as a lawyer, refuses to take arms to protect himself against Liberty Valance and his gang of outlaws. As our story progresses, Ransom stays firm in his notion of justice ruling the land. Ransom remains with the family that took him in, he even teaches the adult daughter of the family how to read and write, eventually marrying Hallie (Vera Miles) Ransom takes his teachings a step further and seeks to educate the entire town on basic principles of law and citizenship. Liberty Valance, however, remains just as committed to keeping the law out of his land and cuts Ransom off at every pass of collective improvement. Tensions rise as the boiling point is finally reached between these two culminating in a surprising shoot-out that has the audience on the edge of their seats. First of all, it needs noted that I am a sucker for a good movie told backwards. No flashbacks took place throughout the film, we are just made aware of the ending, after which the film is told in proper succession. To me, this takes a great deal of precision by a filmmaker, which John Ford is more than capable of. When this type of storytelling is properly achieved, even though the audience knows a great deal of how the story turns out, they are no less interested in how it turns. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a wonderful display of backwards story telling. Another aspect that adds to the story telling of this film is the score. Each change in pitch is punctuated perfectly against the action being told on screen, bringing about a masterpiece of sensory symmetry. The sound effects were also a standout part of this film's experience. For instance, each time Liberty Valance used his weapon of choice, a whip, against his adversary, the sound was realistic enough to give the viewer a sharp sting on their back. Another mark of a great film, for me, is when action is fragmented well between what is seen and unseen. Much of this film reminded me of Burt Lancaster's first film The Killers (1946) in which the most pivotal scene climaxed out of frame proving that when a director can acknowledge the intelligence of the audience, they don't need to put every detail in front of their eyes. This scene, and many others like it, notably from Alfred Hitchcock, has stuck with me years after their initial viewing because there is great power in performing a scene off-camera. This story-telling device requires immense detail and thorough framing; once both of those criterion are met, the audience's mind is free to wonder imaging exactly what the action that took place on screen looked like. This imagination may provide even more depth to a scene than the director would have been able to film. To depict a scene this way also requires a great deal of trust in the actor. In this set-up, a director must be confident that the actor will display enough nonverbal emotion to cue the audience into what is taking place. One illustration of this device occurs when Ransom looks into the casket of his deceased friend and becomes angered that his boots have been removed. If Jimmy Stewart was less of an actor, or if John Ford was less a director, the audience would not have enjoyed such a scene, made all the more powerful by the pinnacle occurring off-camera. Another excellent device used by John Ford was the way he introduced us to John Wayne's character, Tom Doniphon. Tom acted as a savior to Ransom, and a savior is exactly how he was depicted the first time we see him, high upon his horse. One could also notice that Wayne's character first appearing on a horse correlates him to that of a knight, riding up to save the day, which he ultimately did for Ransom. Such direction by John Ford illustrates his legacy and allows the viewer to recognize, first-hand, why he remains a legend more than 40 years after his death.</fullReview>

The town tries to elect him as their representative to help towards statehood but he refuses. Naturally we think he will be the one to get to Liberty Valence but we are wrong.Lee Marvin is really bad guy Liberty Valance. He even intimidates the Marshal, played by western veteran Andy Devine. In one scene near the end Valence and his men tear up the local newspaper printing office and beat the owner to near death.The hero turns out to be James Stewart as Ransom Stoddard. He is a gentle man, but the antics and lawlessness of Valence finally gets to him. In a confrontation in the street Stoddard is carrying a hand gun in his right hand. Valence toys with him, and shoots Stoddard in the right arm, forcing him to drop the gun. But Stoddard picks it up with his left hand, and as Valence aims for the head Stoddard shoots him dead. Liberty Valence was a badd azz outlaw but he didn't know that Stoddard was a left-handed shooter!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of many, but perhaps the greatest of a genre of westerns which illustrated and attempted to explain and justify the post World War II foreign policy of the United States.Like Magnificent Seven and Shane, this movie supports the idea that a little outside help for the good guys in their mano a mano struggle with the "bad guys" (always "they are evil" types who have no reason to be bad, other than they are just bad...and you don't need to know why) who directly confront them is the only thing that will allow right and justice and law and order to prevail.What makes this movie different from others in the genre and distinguishes it as unique is that in this movie, the aid is given covertly, much like so-called "advisors" in Viet Nam, Panama, Chile, etc...It was movies like these that helped many young men make the decision to answer (or accept)the call to arms (or usually their "greetings" from the local draft board)and take on the job of fighting the spread of communism in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western About Bullying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Pontius Pilate, director John Ford asks "What is truth?" in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance--but unlike Pilate, Ford waits for an answer. This Western stars James Stewart and John Wayne. The screenplay by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck was adapted from a short story written by Dorothy M. Johnson. The supporting cast includes Vera Miles, Lee Marvin, Edmond O'Brien, Andy Devine, John Carradine, Woody Strode, Strother Martin, and Lee Van Cleef.The film opens in 1910, with distinguished and influential U.S. senator Ransom Stoddard and his wife Hallie returning to the dusty little frontier town where they met and married twenty-five years earlier. They have come back to attend the funeral of impoverished "nobody" Tom Doniphon. When a reporter asks why, Stoddard relates a film-long flashback. He recalls how, as a greenhorn lawyer, he had run afoul of notorious gunman Liberty Valance, who worked for a powerful cartel which had the territory in its clutches. Time and again, "pilgrim" Stoddard had his hide saved by the much-feared but essentially decent Doniphon. It wasn't that Doniphon was particularly fond of Stoddard; it was simply that Hallie was in love with Stoddard, and Doniphon was in love with Hallie and would do anything to assure her happiness, even if it meant giving her up to a greenhorn. When Liberty Valance challenged Stoddard to a showdown, everyone in town was certain that the greenhorn didn't stand a chance. Still, when the smoke cleared, Stoddard was still standing, and Liberty Valance lay dead. On the strength of his reputation as the man who shot Valance, Stoddard was railroaded into a political career, in the hope that he'd rid the territory of corruption. Stoddard balked at the notion of winning an election simply because he killed a man-until Doniphon, in strictest confidence, told Stoddard the truth: It was Doniphon, not Stoddard, who shot down Valance. Stoddard was about to reveal this to the world, but Doniphon told him not to. It was far more important in Doniphon's eyes that a decent, honest man like Stoddard become a major political figure; Stoddard represented the "new" civilized west, while Doniphon knew that he and the West he represented were already anachronisms. Thus Stoddard went on to a spectacular political career, bringing extensive reforms to the state, while Doniphon faded into the woodwork. His story finished, the aged Stoddard asks the reporter if he plans to print the truth. The reporter responds by tearing up his notes. "This is the West, sir, " the reporter explains quietly. "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."The movie does not offer a clean-cut look at morality and heroes, who emerge from a reluctant position, but it does draw a definitive line between good and evil.As relevant today as it was when it was released in 1962, John Ford's classic Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is the best film about bullying ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unlike reading a book, where you can lay back and - read out - a message, watching films you have to - read into - an immediate visual evidence of what is simply there. You can't stop the images, nor set up a distance between yourself and the events; an image comes out straight at you, at the speed of light, effecting you emotionally, intellectually and viscerally on the spot. To decently analyze what's going on the screen, you may only watch the film over and over, and even then, you are immersed again back into it. John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a stunning tragic feature. It's visuals and graphics stimulated and influenced me throughout my childhood. ? Who's dead Sir? The locals (the newspaper editors) don't even know! Senator Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) says to them he's in town for ? a funeral... a man by the name of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). Here's - right at the beginning - all the magic of a good film! Watching it once again it reveals new experiences, you'll have new thoughts and feelings on the same visual content: when senator Ransom gets in town you'll find him almost arrogant and haughty; only because he's asked to speak, he'll tell about his friend Tom. Then we take a ride out to the desert with Hallie and Link (Vera Miles and Andy Devine) to rediscover Tom's burned house ? he never did finish that room he started to build on, did he? says Hallie. How is that that these same words and images make you now feel so uncomfortable, so hurt and sad? At the second view the wooden coffin inside the room is not empty anymore... the sight of it makes you almost see the body lying inside... and so with the missing boots; how dare they have taken them from such a man! and the dedicated friend Pompey, the cactus roses, and so on... Then the final shot, the train pulling away from Shinbone, taking Stoddard and his wife (and the audience) back to Washington, and the question of whether Stoddard and his wife were happy with their lives stays with us... John Ford knows of what images are made of! I can watch The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)As with most John Ford movies (including many Westerns with John Wayne), this is really well constructed. It's smart and compact and filled with clear logical progression. And it's filmed in widescreen black and white with some classic favorite Ford actors.That's not enough to make a truly great movie, but it gives the slightly simple moral and social problems in the film a brace to avoid being either simplistic (too simple) or sentimental.At first it seems to be about the introduction of reason and educated decency to the wild west. Jimmy Stewart plays the newcomer in town, a young lawyer with a bag of books and no gun. But he learns quickly that this is laughable to the old-timers and the salty locals, one of them played with predictable confidence by John Wayne. Between them, almost literally, is a young woman who has her eye on a good man--or men--for her future.People who have seen a few Westerns and are wary of their simple intentions will not find any surprises here. But this is so well made, and acted with true cinematic integrity, it's a pleasure to watch. There are "better" Westerns like Ford's "The Searchers" or even his breakthrough "Stagecoach" (which features a surprising number of the same actors). And there are other kinds of Westerns like "High Noon" which takes a simple tale of ruling by guns and makes it have a different kind of resonance. And I'm not even talking about Spaghetti Westerns which had their breakthrough just as this film was being made. (The Leone movies began in 1964, but precedents go a few years earlier.)But John Ford is a story teller, and so he uses expert crews and writers and photographers to make the story clear and human. He adopts stereotypes willingly--the bad men scowl (Lee Marvin is perfect) and the good women are nurturing (Vera Miles is just fine as well). Many people will find these kinds of clichés boring or irritating or both, but if you can go with the flow and see these as part of the toolbox for creating a larger allegory about strength, morality, and an oversimplified American history, you'll enjoy the ride.The one real hitch to the film, for me, is the thing that has made it famous. And that's the kind of trick that happens in the end (the trick was re-worked in the 1973 comedic Spaghetti/American hybrid starring Henry Fonda, "My Name is Nobody"). I can't give it away, but you might find the wool has been pulled over your eyes. I'm not sure what the allegory means about America--that we've all been duped and the participants are never going to tell the truth? Watch it. If you like old movies, or just want a fun, well made drama that happens to be set in the unpolished territories of the West, give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Duke made a few westerns that were filmed to a great extent on manufactured sets inside a studio, just like the TV westerns. The writing of these studio-westerns had to be difficult---there was no real reliance on the natural beauty and space that filled "The Searchers" and "How The West Was Won". A studio western was a stage play in spurs and gun belts. "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence" was one of the very best of this genre.And why not?---director John Ford was the Spielberg-Cameron-Scott of his day, and knew a thing or 2 about directing actors. And WHAT actors...Duke, Jimmy Stewart, Vera Miles and Lee Marvin.....that is still a working A-Team, tho they have passed into history. Woody Strode and Thomas Mitchell were the icing on the cake for me--Woody being one of the finest and most spectacular character actors in film history.This studio western had the unique and undeniable effect of an epic---the passage of time and tide so well written and played. John Wayne looked like a man destroyed by love at the end of that movie, and he will, like other great male actors such as Brad Pitt, Kevin Kostner and Kurt Ressell, always be under-appreciated and underrecognized mainly because acting is so seemingly effortless to them, and the mostly gay entertainment press ignore them because they ignore the mostly gay entertainment press.Vera Miles was perfect as a beauty who could make one man's life, and with complete innocence, ruin another's. John Ford had a great eye for the truly beautiful women in Hollywood, Miles and Maureen O'Hara setting the bar very high for that all-important camera-eats-them-up factor.I'm still kind of struck by the casting of decorated WWII B-24 bomber pilot Jimmy Stewart being cast as the egghead who didn't know which end of a gun to hold, and the Duke, who was never in the military, as the crusty old gun-fighter...the only man capable of terminating Libery Valence--the only man Liberty was afraid of.....but...that's the movies. Reality is willfully and lovingly suspended when the lights go out and the projector cranks up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lawyer comes to town for a funeral... but this is an unusual time. The town of Shinbone is voting to see if they will be part of statehood or remain in the Wild West. A local gang leader, Liberty Valance (played by tough guy Lee Marvin) wants freedom... others might disagree.The film suffers slightly from stereotypical voices and characters (particularly Andy Devine and John Wayne). But that's not really a surprise when you have such a stock of reusable actors for Westerns. For some reason the films used the same cast again and again. The big surprise here is James Stewart.An undercurrent of the film is law versus gunfighting. Liberty Valance and John Wayne are comfortable living in a world where man settles his own problems. But James Stewart, the lawyer, would like to see Valance in jail and dreams of schools where children can learn to read. This is easier to accomplish in a law-abiding society.I don't mind Westerns, and it helps if there's a good story. I can watch John Wayne shoot things all day, and throw in James Stewart an you have a win. He really can't make a bad film, it seems. If you're not sold on Westerns, this is a good film to give a try. I'd say it was better than "Stagecoach", another Wayne-Devine-Ford production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We don't really know who killed Liberty Valance. (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who killed Liberty Valance? Why, Keyser Soze killed Liberty Valance!But seriously, the film is worth seeing. Yes, it's black-and-white, claustrophobic and old-fashioned, the production values are low, and the sets are cheesy. Everyone here is a stereotype, or an archetype. The Good Guys wear white hats and the Bad Guys wear black hats. Mexicans in sombreros twitter in the corner and dance in the streets when Valance is shot, but never say a single line. Swedes speak like muppets. But that's probably not because of the age of the film - it came out in the same year as Lawrence of Arabia! - but more likely to be deliberate - this is a homage to, a farewell to, almost an affectionate parody of, of an obsolete kind of film. The political scenes are certainly parody. This is *not* a realistic film. Three side-bar points:The good: the supporting cast, as others have said, are excellent. Everybody overacts shamelessly except for the supposed leads. Stewart and Wayne play default Stewart and Wayne characters. Miles sinks blandly into the background. This allows the others to stand out against their neutrality and ham it up to their hearts content. The best are Carradine and O'Brien who don't so much steal their scenes as pick them up, elbow the opposition aside, and run over the line with them. Marvin &amp; Strode are wonderful as well as being total stereotypes. The Bad: Maybe Wayne can act, but he isn't doing it here. Perhaps he wasn't asked to. In only one scene does the seem to come alive emotionally, and that's when he sits on the stairs at the back of the convention hall hand watches what's going on while saying nothing. For the rest he's more a cipher than a character. Maybe there is an alternate universe in which Clint Eastwood played Tom. That would have been a different film, and probably a better one.The Ugly: one of many American movies in which someone is placed in an absurd, unlikely, or extreme situation in which it becomes morally correct to use a gun to shoot someone. This is propaganda, Pilgrim.But who was the Man who Killed Liberty Valance? The "Keyser Soze" crack is not entirely off the point. All we know is that Rance said that Tom said that he killed him. It is all a double-flashback. Either man could have reasons to be economical with the truth.Rance might have made a lucky shot - we do see him firing first, before either Liberty or Tom. If Rance had killed Valance Tom might have lied about it to persuade him to stand for Congress. Rance might even have wanted to believe that Tom had done it to ease his own conscience. Or smooth his career. It might suit him to be known in the Territory as "The Man Who" - but to have a defence against any accusations made in Washington.Or Pompey may have killed him. At the first account of the fight we don't know that Tom is even present. We do know that Pompey was in town and knew about the fight, and Pompey had a rifle and is a good shot. If Pompey had killed Valance, both Tom and Rance would have wanted it kept secret - at that time and place there'd have been a lynching. We don't know what happened, only what was said. It is Tom's story within Rance's story within John Ford's story. Print the Legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect John Ford Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance probably 20 times since I was a little kid. In the last few years, I think I've seen it maybe 3 times and every time I see it I fall in love with this movie a little more.John Ford had such a perfect way of filling his stories with well-defined characters, rich sentiment, tense drama, varieties of humor and realistic action. TMWSLV is a great swan song for the team of John Ford and John Wayne as this was the last western they filmed together.Filmed in Black and White, the scenes are full of texture and ambiance that Ford had mastered earlier in his career in movies like My Darling Clementine and Stagecoach. In this classic we have Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) as a noble lawyer looking to bring law to the west in the form of books and ideals. John Wayne is perfectly cast as a good-hearted, tough rancher who has seen law dealt out by the gun and lives his life appropriately. Lee Marvin is menacing as Liberty Valance the polar opposite of Ransom Stoddard.This movie has it all - a great story of good vs. evil. The struggle of man against man and man against himself as Stoddard struggles not to live life by the law of the gun. There's a complicated love triangle with Vera Miles as the center piece and Wayne and Stewart as her courters.Edmund O'Brian is Dutton Peabody the Editor of the newspaper and a comical drunk. And Andy Devine as the town Marshall who is scared of his own shadow. If you are at all familiar with Ford's movies like the Quiet Man, The Searchers, Stagecoach, The Three Godfathers, you have to see this movie. A movie that Ford obviously crafted with love and great attention to detail late in his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Best Work of the Two John's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another John Ford/John Wayne western (Their last best work combined). Add to that James Stewart and Vera Miles (Post Psycho) and a very determined Lee Marvin. The result is a very impressive adventure western with a touch of politics and American Legislation. As the title suggests, there is a guy by the name Liberty Valance who has been shot and since none of lead heroes respond to that name, Valance must be the villain and he truly is. Apart from that James Stewart plays a honest lawyer who thinks that all criminals should be treated as per the American Laws and violence is not the way to deal with them. John Wayne plays what he plays best - A tough guy from the west who is a genius with the gun and has a golden heart too. Lee Marvin is Liberty Valance - The Bad Guy, who is the most feared and dreadful mobster and who loots and kills innocent civilians, mocks the law and has a gang of just two people. Both Stewart and Wayne have their different takes on Liberty and how he should be punished for his deeds. But the movie just does not end at punishing Liberty, it moves a bit forward and ventures into politics going as far as the American Congress at Washington.What separates an ordinary western from a special one is the handling of the genre itself. John Ford is the master of the genre and he has excelled with this particular movie as well. As far as the acting is concerned, it is a cakewalk for John Wayne to play the tough guy from the west, he does a fine job. James Stewart also plays the frail, non-violent yet determined law abider who becomes a Senator convincingly. Vera Miles plays the love interest of both the leads and has done a good job at that. Lee Marvin is exceptional in the few scenes he has got in the movie. He was truly one of the plus points of the movie. The hallmark of a great director is how he deals with the supporting cast along with the leads of the movie. John Ford is known to extract the best from his supporting cast and this movie shows that. Overall, 'Watch it Pilgrim'.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Its Budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seldom numbering amongst any list of favourites, 'Liberty Valance' is actually a very poignant story about the subjugation of the 'wild' west and its passage from truth into legend.The movie begins with one of those interesting back-to-front denouements in which an ageing senator, played by James Stewart, turns-up in a western town called Wishbone. Townspeople ask for an explanation to his visit. The senator begins. An old rancher-friend of his (John Wayne) has died, and he means to attend the funeral. And this is what happened...Stewart reverts now to an idealistic and naive young lawyer, completely out of his depth, turning-up bruised and battered in the - then - remote village of Wishbone. He is planning to establish a law practice. His injuries derive from psychotic hoodlum Liberty Valance, who attacked the stagecoach earlier. The movie charts the lawyer's gradual rise from timid stiff-neck to resolute crusader, as Valance becomes increasingly brazen in his lawlessness towards a town stricken with fear.He confronts the drunken Valance with a gun. Shots are exchanged. Valance lies dead. The lawyer is credited with his slaying and made a great hero, but all is not what it seems...On the strength, of his reputation for both honesty and courage he, the lawyer, is elected senator and his future is assured.Stewart is perfectly believable as the moral fish-out-of-water, whilst Lee Marvin has a menacing and unpredictably violent Liberty Valance to perfection. The joker in the pack is big John Wayne, playing the flawed hero as well as he always does. He and Stewart are in competition for a certain young lady, played by reliable Vera Miles.A number of other regulars do excellent work, not least of which is the quietly competent Woody Strode, as Wayne's sidekick.The movie is shot in black &amp; white, which is unusual for a 1960's western and conveys an appearance of low-budget. Also the set-pieces are economical and rather stagy, adding to the feel of low production values. Yet stars like these don't come cheap.The script is good, dialogue is well presented and the acting everything you might expect. Apart from the 'staginess' other technical matters such as directing, editing and lighting are properly addressed, and I might best describe the movie as a well-grown figure in poorly-fitting clothes.Issues of history and legend, the passage of time and the transience of human life are simply and sweetly addressed without any sweeping moral judgements. And it is the very understated presentation of this movie that tends to conceal its great strengths. I particularly like the ending, in which an old 'iron-horse' steam train rumbles off into the distance as if it is driving into history and taking all of the legends and myths with it. Music is extremely apt to the moment.Unfortunately; the story does rather shoot itself in the foot, because it is highly unlikely that such a momentous duel that put one of the town's own heroes into the US senate would ever be forgotten. Quite the contrary; the townspeople would have traded upon the connection for all that it was worth. It is also highly unlikely that the senator would have neglected his home town so completely for so many years. Senators are not elected for life. Favours need to be curried, and babies kissed pretty regularly.However; this is one of those movies that I always seem to forget how much I enjoy, until some channel or other discovers and shows it again. Highly recommended.Incidentally; last week I found it in an Asda supermarket. Three Wayne movies in one: 'Liberty Valance', 'True Grit', and 'The Sons Of Katie Elder' - ?5.00. An absolute steal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the Legend becomes Fact, Print the Legend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) John Ford was one of the few directors who could deftly balance entertainment with more ambitious elements in the undercurrent. Because of that, his appeal to mainstream audiences was as wide as deep his reverence among aficionados. His films are among the favorites of many great directors, from Scorsese to Kurosawa.Ford made great films throughout his long and illustrious career. One of those was The Man who Shot Liberty Valance. That film, like many of his others, is skewered with problems and elements of period melodrama acted sometimes by not so great actors. But nevertheless, those films, and this one, survive and thrive in spite of them.James Stewart plays Rance Stoddard, a big wig senator, once a small time lawyer. His fame came as a result of his killing of a notorious outlaw, Liberty Valance. Rance tells his story to a group of reporters when he returns with his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) to the small town where he found fame for the funeral of a man - Tom Doniphon. Lee Marvin plays Valance, who's gang holds up Rance's coach, then mercilessly beats him. He's found by Tom, a rugged wild man played with ferocity by John Wayne. He has a side kick, Pompey, a towering African American. The two men get along, but there is conflict under the surface. At this stage in the game, Hallie appears to be in line for Tom, not Rance. Rance preaches the word of the law, while Tom insists the only way to survive in this essentially lawless land is through the word of the gun. He frequently stands up for Rance when Liberty rides into town, and though never outwardly stated, seems to emasculate Rance with his protection of him. In the mean time, Rance is persuaded to start teaching the townsfolk to read and write, and starts working for the local paper. He is a jack of all trades but the gun.When the town decides to elect two delegates to head to the territorial capital city to press for statehood, Liberty tries to bully the people into elected him. Embarrassingly, they elect Rance and the local newspaper editor, Dutton Peabody, as their representatives. Soon after, Liberty orders Rance to meet him in the streets, guns drawn, or leave town. They meet, Liberty toys with Rance, then on the final draw is inexplicably shot dead. Rance is celebrated for killing the outlaw, but all is not as it seems in the end.The first two thirds of Liberty Valance play fairly standard. What keeps it really going is Stewart's fearless wimpishness, Wayne's commanding and quite enthralling screen presence, and Lee Marvin's eccentric and dandyish portrayal of Liberty Valance. His performance, I think, is one of the big highlights of the film. He has such a wildness about him that when he's intimidated by Tom, the scene jumps off the screen.Ford's direction is characteristically meticulous and understated. The film's best scene comes after Valance has been shot, with Rance and the other townsfolk at the territorial meeting. It's one of the best examples of the 19th century political meeting and their elaborate goings on. Horses ride in as signs are raised and slogans shouted. Wayne makes his reappearance here, after a curious absence during the street gunfight. It's the scene that i remember most vividly from the film, and its crude elegance is enthralling to watch.As noted, Ford's film's tend to suffer with age due to some period hamminess. His shifting of genre's sometimes can confuse modern audiences, and the melodrama is occasionally thick enough to choke a bull. John Qualen is there again doing his almost insultingly embarrassing Nordic impressions. His foolishness is often charming though. Some have also pointed out that both Stewart and Wayne were far too old to play their characters, but to their credit, they succeed anyway in their portrayals.Nevertheless, The Man who Shot Liberty Valance, because of what it is, is a great film, in spite of what it is. It is a classic example of the Hollywood Golden Era, coming in its dying days. The final revelations of the film and the understated feeling of resentment Hallie seems to have for Rance in the present tense heighten the film. When asked who placed the cactus rose for Tom, Hallie responds, almost defiantly, I did. He was his friend, almost her lover. Their relationship exists only because Tom saved Rance - more than anyone else really ever knows. As the man says, when the legend becomes fact, print the legend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything about this film is first class, especially the cast. Stewart and Wayne of course but also supporting actor par excellance Edmond O'Brien (The Killers, The Barefoot Contessa, Seven Days in May etc.), Lee Marvin (as one of the most vicious screen villains ever), and Vera Miles amongst others. The story of an aging Senator returning to the site where his legend was made and the sacrifice for the greater good by his friend of both love and glory make this film much akin to Casablanca in my mind. Having an avid interest in the history of this period I was very intrigued by the conflict between the interests of the cattle ranchers and those of the 'common people.' All in all an entertaining and even informative not to mention moving classic Western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens to bullies like Liberty Valance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Stewart plays a senator named Stoddard who returns to the town of Shinbone with his wife (Vera Miles) to attend the funeral of an old friend named Tom Donovan (John Wayne). The local newspaper picks up on the senator's visit and wants an interview and the scoop on who Tom Donovan was.Stoddard is reluctant to do so, but the editors insist so he proceeds to tell them a tale about himself that they don't want to hear.About how 30 years before, Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) robbed the stagecoach that Stoddard was riding on in his trip out west, beat and robbed him and left him for dead. Until Tom Donovan came along and saved his life by bringing him back to town in order to receive medical attention. Donovan's also taken to calling Stoddard; "Pilgrim". (laughs) Valance is the all around bully in Shinbone that people go out of their way to avoid, and that includes Stoddard who agrees to work for Vera Miles' families restaurant while he decides to later open a law practice there. And it also turns out that Donovan is the only one in town that Valance is afraid of. Only after Valance and his henchmen (played by Lee Van Cleef and Strother Martin) viciously beat the drunken newspaper editor (overacted by Edmond O'Brien) that Stoddard agrees to meet Valance on the street for a duel.Valance shoots first, wounding Stoddard, but then Stoddard fired back, killing Valance. Or does he...? We all know Stoddard the tenderfoot can't hit the side door of a barn, right? One of the lesser known John Ford oaters that's out there, this has the disadvantage of being filmed on Paramount's back lot in b/w, instead of the wide-vista on location filming that we've come to expect from him. It also goes on a little bit too long at the end after Valance is shot. He could have wrapped it up a lot sooner, imo.But even so, a lesser John Ford western rises above most of the other oaters out there.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a painful experience considering all involved. It is so Studio bound that it looks like a TV Show. Everyone overacts and almost every line is shouted and not spoken. There is very little here that is not embarrassing.From the over age Stars to the sentimental claptrap (admittedly in all John Ford Movies). But here that's all there is. Ideas and Culture clashes are clichéd to the extreme. The only thing interesting is the sadistic, whip wielding Villain. From the opening, laughably occurring on a set of painted backdrops and plastic bushes it all goes downhill from there.This is vastly overrated and fondly remembered by most but if one is at all critical it falls apart quickly. This self-indulgent Director should have retired long before he was given full reign to force this on a rather forgiving Audience.The scenes are so brightly lit that it evokes a shiny template on a dusty town. It is the only thing that shines in this completely horrid exercise in bloated Nationalism and corny New Country confrontations in the Old West. Politicians, Newspapermen, and all the Characters here are something out of a Political Cartoon or some self-important imagination of an egotistical, and at one time, very good Director.</fullReview>

I had heard of it for years and expected to get a High Noon type of old west gunfighter flick but all I got was bad sets, horrendous acting and a director who seems to love everything he saw on the first take. Everyone is over acting and the cast is so old I thought someone was going to break a hip. Stewart looks no different from present to past other than some bad makeup and he has withdrawn into the stutter Stuart acting style he did so badly for his last 20 years. Wayne is a caricature of himself and the rest of the cast, including the horrible Swedish accents are laughable.

		<shortDescription>No, (The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance by Gene Pitney is not in the movie but should have been!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may or may not surprise some musicologists and rock trivia nuts, but the very fine Gene Pitney song "(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance" is not even in this Western! The song was written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. (Bacharach wrote for Famous Music which Paramount owned.) Gene Pitney stated: "The only problem was that Paramount was in Los Angeles. By the time we finished recording the song which was tailor-made for the film, the movie was released already in Los Angeles with music taken from a 1939 film called Young Mr. Lincoln with Henry Fonda. Why in the world they used that I have no idea. It's a shame too, because I don't care if I was the one singing it or not, but the song 'Liberty Valance' would have really helped the film." The Bacharach-David composition was superbly performed by Gene Pitney under the production of Musicor Records founder Aaron Schroeder and recorded March 1962 in New York. The song went on to number 4 on the US charts and may be more famous than the film. Thomas J McKeon Indianapolis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Shot Liberty Valance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This entertaining black and white western has a number of things going for it: John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin, a host of top character players, with John Ford directing. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and immediately realized that just about everyone was a bit too old for their parts, but this was OK, as the flashback device seemed to excuse that. After all, almost the entire movie is a man's recollection.Through a string of incidents we are led to the inevitable showdown between the main characters, in fact all three of them! It is overlooked on these pages that the Wayne character indulges in exactly what he uncompromisingly disdained in other movies: a 'bushwhacking'. Valance has little chance (although he doesn't know it). Stewart is mistakenly iconicized. Rightly, Wayne's character is implied to sink into oblivion.This central duplicity in the story, which plays inversely to the title, actually ruined the movie for me. I could accept the long-in-the-tooth characters, cheap jack sets, B &amp; W photography. But the fact that there are no true heroes, only varying degrees of villains, precludes me from granting more than seven stars. It's a good but flawed movie. But, I do not understand it being designated a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie just the other nite for the very first time. It's a great film with great performances. Firstly, I learned where John Wayne's use of the sobriquet "Pilgrim" came from. Second, I got to see the classic Andy Devine in all his splendor. Edmund O'Brien and to a lesser degree John Carradine show us a very wide range of acting with comedy, camp and tragedy all rolled in. Lee Marvin gets prepared to spoof himself in Cat Ballou. Strother Martin looks like Howard Morris of Sid Caesar's company. Woody Strode as the only black man to ever pick the Duke up out of a burning house and earn a drink (he refuses) at the local tavern. Bet Clint Eastwood &amp; Morgan Freeman owe a tip of their Unforgiven hat to Ford/Wayne.Ultimately the film is a play on Tale of Two Cities with the Duke as a heavier Sidney Carton. He's prepared to give up the best cook in town (wasn't she Jeff Chandler's gal in The Searchers?)and the woman he loves, so that Rance can aspire to his higher callin of achieving statehood and running water for the territory. A variation of Casablanca as well. I liked the film- warts and all. I even liked Stewart's hairpiece- guess he joined the Whig party.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read various comments, I think that it's pretty obvious that TMWSLV is viewed by some users as a cheaply made, poorly cast, made-in-black-and-white (in a Technicolor era) film, with bad scripting and worse sets --OR--- TMWSLV is seen and accepted as one of the greatest westerns ever made.I would have to come down on the side of the latter, in that, as time goes by, this film WILL by lauded and accepted as a classic in all senses of the word.However, I also take a slightly sideways view of the film. While TMWSLV is a Goody versus Baddy western, with all the usual suspects thrown in for good measure, the rancher, the sheriff, the doc, the newspaper man,the girl, etc, I consider TMWSLV to be a comedy western. Perhaps not a comedy in the same category as Blazing Saddles, or Support Your Local Sheriff, but a comedy none the less.Next time you watch the film, remark how many comical situations there are and how many more comical remarks there are.I consider it a comedy, in, for instances, look at some of the comical situations, which, in a "serious" western, like High Noon, simply would not or could not exist.Halle kicking John Wayne's hat, as he is about to reach for it. The whole eating episode with Andy Devine (Link Appleyard)and his sudden loss of appetite with the arrival of Lee Marvin.Duttin Peabody (What a name!)(Edmond O'Brien) is over the top in his hamming of the newspaper editor.John Wayne knocking hell out of Duttin Peabody's hat on the table at the election.At the dropped steak scene, when Strother Martin (As Floyd) declares that he will pick it up, John Wayne doesn't even look round, doesn't take his eyes of Liberty Valance and doesn't take his hands out of his pocket's, but manages to kick Strother Martin the nicest kick on the jaw ever seen and then says to Liberty Valance, "You pick it up"At the convention, the way-over-the-top speech by John Carradine and his casting aside of his 'speech', (which never existed on the paper)As regards funny remarks, who could forget Kaintuck with his s-ss-sss stutter and "d-d-dee-dee-deep dish app-app-apple pie." Andy Devine (Sheriff Appleyard) almost choking as he ask's in disbelief "arrest Liberty Valance ?"John Wayne's famous remark that "Liberty Vallance is the toughest man south of the Picketwire", whereupon he pauses and adds, nearly as an afterthought, "next to me" and finally, to me, one of the best one liners ever seen or heard on screen.Liberty Valance is lying on the street after being shot, a crowd gathers round, his sidekick, Floyd (Strother Martin) calls, "get the doc, get the doc", whereupon Doc Willoughby (Ken Murray) in his top hat and drunk as usual, appears out of nowhere, gazes intently at Liberty Valance, calls out "Whisky, quick" takes hold of a proffered bottle, unscrews it, takes a generous slug, wipes his lips, reaches out with his boot, turns Valance (Lee Marvin )over on his back, glances a little to the crowd, nods his head and states "Dead!"Yes, a comedy western indeed, but with the added ingredients of the greatness of John Ford to produce a film which can be viewed as a comedy, but also as a love story and a good versus evil film all wrapped up in his favourite set, the Western set.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Along with The Searchers, Liberty Valance is another in the list of over-rated Wayne/Ford pairings. Wayne and Ford may have had a great, long personal history together but Henry Hathaway was, in many ways, the better director of the Duke. Try watching Red River and this movie back to back to see for yourself. Wayne admitted himself, in later years, how uncomfortable he was in his part as Tom Doniphan. You only have to witness his over-acting in his drunk scenes to know how uncomfortable he really was. For that matter, most of the actors can be accused of chewing up film. Liberty Valance has a cramped look from being shot indoors, in claustrophobic black and white. Finally, it has one of the most indefensible lines ever written in film history: "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."</fullReview>

Yes there could well be one or two stereotyped supporting characters, but I cannot deny how intelligent and thought-provoking this film is.The themes in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance are very complex, but guess what, the writing here is written with such skill it all appears so simple. The cinematography is equally as skillful, with grand scenery and a more primitive even innocent west is painted here. The story is often told in flashback, but with a twist that is very unpredictable, and John Ford's direction is solid as rocks.The acting is very fine, John Wayne gives a superb performance portraying a western icon, and James Stewart gives memorable support. Lee Marvin is also brilliant as the Liberty Valance of the title. Overall, if you like westerns, James Stewart or John Wayne then by all means see The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He should have shot the writers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very difficult to discuss this terrible movie without giving away more of the story than a reviewer properly should. Maltin says it was panned when it first came out. That's readily understandable. He adds that it's since become a classic. That isn't. `Valance' is seriously flawed in almost every aspect, although the huge cast is filled with fine, familiar faces, John Ford regulars. Jimmy Stewart and Vera Miles are peerless. Lee Marvin is a marvelous sneering heavy. His villainy is never explained; he's just pure evil. He plays Liberty, by the way, and the originality of the name is one of the movie's few interesting points. The entire film is cast as a flashback, a clumsy device that accomplishes absolutely nothing. We're given a climactic ? but amateurishly devised ? flashback within the flashback. The story is a mishmash of several stillborn plot lines. An eastern tenderfoot (Stewart) in the Old West is befriended by a swaggering John Wayne, who of course has a heart of gold. There's an inevitable love triangle, assumed by the audience but never actually dramatized. There's an underdeveloped conflict between homesteaders and open-range cattlemen in a quest for statehood. The territory isn't named. Presumably it's Arizona, since a few fake saguaros are stuck here and there in the infrequent location shots. At one point, some lines are quoted from the Declaration of Independence, and Jefferson is named as the (principal) writer. But the quote is said to be from the Constitution. Superb research there. Even the splendid John Ford slips seriously in leading us to believe an important character has died when he hasn't. It's a flat-out error in direction, or perhaps ? to be kind ? an uncorrectable result of a last-minute rewrite. The inept cut that ends the `deathbed' scene only makes the mistake more obvious. Long before the welcome end of the film, so many artistic failures had accumulated that I found it hard to pay attention to the screen, despite the eminently talented people involved. The writers are not included in this group. It's generous not even to name them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is said in one of John Ford's biographies that he cut corners when making this film. I guess that's why the exterior scenes are so few. Even the last shot of the movie, a long shot of the running train, is filmed with a hand-held camera. What a pity!As for the story, there's also a big, big problem: A famous senator and his wife come to a small town to attend a funeral of an unknown person. This causes the curiosity of the newspaper reporter and give the senator an interview, thus starts the flashback of the movie. After he finishes the story, his wife put a cactus flower on the coffin, then they leave the town. Now, what about the purpose of their trip? Aren't they forgetting John Wayne's funeral?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I admit to being a John Ford detractor. It is not a role I seek willingly; I'd just as soon love his films as I readily embrace many, many others, but I just cannot.There is a compact between viewer and filmmaker. They set certain rules of the world they create. We enter that world in a relaxed, open manner and what we expect is some reward. If the reward is great, we may relax our expectations on how well prepared the artificial world is.Now, viewers can differ on what constitutes that reward. For me, it is not enough to simply exercise a few jingoistic platitudes. Not enough to have no dimensionality of characters; one single, simple unelaborated plot line; one simple moral. But you, dear reader may differ, but this is not the matter of my complaint. The creation of the world behind that important compact is another thing altogether. A central characteristic of film is the vocabulary that is available to quickly transport you to the world of action, the visual shorthand. And for many years, the Western was a serviceable collection of shorthand cues. We knew we were entering an abstract world, one in which good and evil were crisply defined and in which all intents and actions could be discerned to their deepest depths in an instant. The mythical world of the Westerns were embedded in the popular imagination even before film.We don't use Westerns this way any more. That's because we have universally rejected the abject laziness of the filmmaker, the profoundly insulting pandering that goes with reliance on this device. `Fistful of Dollars' of the very next year was made to demolish this ability. No one. No one has attempted this type of western since. This was the last one which took itself seriously and demanded that the audience does so as well.That's a heavy promise. Not one I am willing to make even for someone who knows his way around. Part of this is my love of film, and the adventure of film, which leads to a sensitivity to cheaters. John Wayne was a cheating actor, one who relied on the purity of the vehicle, on its abstraction, to just as he said `act natural.' Sure, I'm fond of the persona he exploited, who isn't. But since he isn't committed or skilled enough to go halfway to me in creating a world, I'm not willing to make up the difference. The penalties on my imagination are too great.Here is an exercise. Except for a very few details (statehood, cattle barons) this story could take place anywhere, anytime. Imagine it outside the western context to see what I mean. Even the admirably busy Jim Stewart can't save it.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the last couple of years I've watched several John Ford Westerns and found all of them vastly overrated. I find The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence an improvement though still light years short of George Stevens' Shane for example (perhaps significantly Stevens, unlike Ford, was not known for making westerns). The opening reel especially is suffused with melancholy and might be a flavor-of-the-month director transposing Uncle Vanya to the Old West. Then Ford falls victim to the old 'failed flashback' syndrome in which one person - in this case James Steward - begins by recalling a scene in which he himself was present but gradually that same flashback shifts perspective so that the original person has become a reporter rather than a participant. Duke Wayne gives one of his less mannered performances here and often just his presence in a scene is sufficient to lend gravitas. I've always admired Edmond O'Brien and I resent the way Ford makes him a buffoon, Lee Marvin phones it in as the eponymous villain of the piece but overall it had a pleasant feel to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>East meets West in John Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' (1962). James Stewart's character is a lawyer from more 'civilized' parts of the U.S. while John Wayne's character is a not-so-legal vigilante from the grittier portion. To say that there are clashes in this film is to say that Western cinema is like an ass (of the quadruped variety) that expired long ago but the rider still feels compelled to flog it. The love triangle: Wayne's Tom, Stewart's Ransom and Marvin's Liberty is a shotgun wedding and perpetual squabble until the last man is standing. Of course Tom and Liberty are enemies by default according to Western cinema standards but when you throw Ransom into the mix then you've got gin with your oil and water (a most unholy cocktail). An allegory for the evolution of political careers? Check! Whaddya expect for 1962? If you don't believe me then just watch the film, re-read its title and check back with your brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lack Of Subtlety, Pilgrim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off poignant and sad. But the tone quickly shifts to buffoonery when the flashback begins, fourteen minutes into the film. I think it's the general tone of this movie that I find so annoying. Everything is so over-the-top.The script totally lacks subtlety. The entire production is so in-your-face obvious, so blunt, it's as if Director John Ford targeted the film to kids, or maybe to adults who like dumb-downed movies. Part of the problem is dialogue that lacks subtext.Another problem is the characters; they are all so shallow and two-dimensional. As much as I like Andy Devine, his scared-of-his-own-shadow town marshal quickly becomes tiresome. The cigar smoking newspaperman, Dutton Peabody, is always drunk and bug-eyed; he's a cartoon figure. And what about Liberty Valance? Does he even have a back-story? He just seems to appear, and then disappear ... on cue.The story's climax is quite clever, and arguably the best part of the film. And that climax should have been the end of the film.Alas, no. The story then plows forward for an unbelievable twenty-five more minutes. Viewers must endure an unnecessary, raucous political convention complete with speeches, after which an anonymous cowboy gallops in on a horse that prances around on the speaker's platform, as the cowboy twirls a rope and we listen to "Home On The Range". More buffoonery.In addition to the script, the film has other problems, including casting. Both John Wayne and James Stewart are way too old for the roles they play. Further, most of the actors wildly overact, especially Edmond O'Brien, as the town clown. The film's makeup is not convincing; Stewart's toupee at the film's beginning looks like something created by a high school art department. The sets are cheap looking. And the musical score is nondescript.Aside from a clever climax, about the only other feature of this film that I liked was the cinematography. The B&amp;W lighting is sharp and crisp, high-contrast, and generally interesting.Maybe the film's message is deeper than I have perceived. Maybe John Ford is trying to impart some vision of a change in historical eras. But the script, especially its characters and that dreadful structure, along with the film's overall frothy tone and lack of subtlety, overwhelm everything else, including some hypothetical message. At least that's how I see it ... pilgrim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inasmuch as it pinpoints and explicates Fordian themes?the mythologizing of the Old West, the unfortunate but essential legacy of legend superseding fact, and the proliferation of lies that construct history?The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a must-see. However, I much prefer Fort Apache, as it focused on a sustained dialectic between a man obsessed by his own self-immortalizing and a majority of self-actualized, honorable men: Ford's ultimate conclusion, that the majority of great men are forgotten to make room for flatulent fools, is greatly aided in the former by Wayne, who tempers the polemic in a chilling soliloquy delivered to a reflection of cavalrymen superimposed over his weathered mien.In "Liberty," Ford delivers a balanced critique of westward expansion and the ubiquitous railroad, and skillfully evokes the rapidly shrinking open range in cramped settings. The action takes place almost entirely within the town of Shinbone, the camera rarely roving to romanticize the natural land. But the narrative, aside from some spirited interrogations of legislation, how it complicates and corrupts the existing order of self-governance, is positively jejune.The usual troop of slapstick side-characters march out (Edmond O'Brien, good; Andy Devine, not so much) and do their thing, as we wait for the inevitable showdown between Stewart's idealistic lawyer and Lee Marvin's eponymous villain. The problem is Stewart's character isn't very compelling. He's diffident, naive, pedantic, and brazen to an irritating degree. Wayne steals the movie quite easily from him; his and Marvin's terse standoffs have an electricity the rest of the movie lacks. I think part of this is by strategy: Wayne represents the world Ford himself immortalized in movies, so it's fitting that we sympathize with him. Kudos to Ford for staying the philosophical course in what could have been some very mucky footing?the uncharacteristically sober and clear-headed tone is the film's most resolute virtue and, unfortunately, that which restrains it from taking flight.</fullReview>

One movie house, no TV or rock-n-roll radio station, just the Armed Forces Radio Network. We heard "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" by Gene Pitney and it lured my friends and me to see the show.We had no idea that we were entering classic cinema. We didn't know Jack, let alone John Ford. First off, no Gene Pitney theme song. What a rip-off! When the story got going, what were those old cowboy stars, Johh Wayne and Jimmy Stewart, doing playing young characters on the screen? And what were they doing with that young chick, Vera Miles? The final insult to our young eyes and ears was the villain, played by Lee Marvin. This yeoman Hollywood character actor was so mean he was booed by the theater audience, yet he wound up stealing the show. Marvin's performance in Valance foreshadowed his Oscar-winning double-lead in Cat Ballou.Thanks for the memories, IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a John Wayne fan, disregard this comment; same for Jimmy Stewart fans. I happen to think they are the two most overrated, and overacting, actors in film. Neither changed my mind in what I think is, also, a highly overrated film - even for the Western genre which, admittedly, storytelling often takes a pedestrian turn to make way for landscape and action.There is little of the transfixing panoramic shots that made John Ford famous, which is just as well because the bellicose yammering of the film's two stars would have chewed up the scenery. Stewart represents the ideal utopia that democracy is suppose to bring, while Wayne represents the primal instincts of living on an untamed land. The two are at odds, as the cattle ranchers and the settlers are in the back story. Their mutual love interest, Hallie (America manifested, duh) is yanked between the two of them, eventually settling on the man on the side of the law.The film is so caught up in metaphor and idealism, it forgets its characters. There is no back story on anybody to illustrate a reason for their behavior, or why any of them stay in that godforsaken desert town. The settlers are suppose to love their land so much they risk their lives at the hands of a violent henchmen, Liberty Valence (Lee Marvin looking and acting remarkably like Tom Waits)but why? Too much is expected to be taken for granted.All that said, the camera work - typically Ford - is beautiful. The high contrast sculpts shadow and danger into the actors' faces, and the restored sheen is almost chrome-like. There is some wonderful play with the lighting when the newspaper editor is attacked by the Liberty gang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from Ford--very disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of John Ford, but somehow I had missed this one.I was extremely disappointed. If I hadn't known that Ford had directed it, I never would have guessed it. Extremely set-bound, VALENCE has little of the sense of the Western outdoors that mark films like THE SEARCHERS, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON and FORT APACHE. It's overlong. It's poorly cast, with both John Wayne and James Stewart--both in their 50s at the time--too old for their roles. (Stewart is particularly off-putting in this film, fitted with an obvious toupee and most of the time mired in a righteous indignation. He virtually quivers every time he speaks.) The female lead is that perpetual cipher, Vera Miles. (I've seen her in a number of films and still don't understand why she was so often cast in major productions.) John Wayne attacks his role with his usual zeal, but he's flabby and 55--too old to be convincing as Vera Miles' suitor. (This is the film in which he calls Stewart "Pilgrim".) Lee Marvin is the villainous title character and he's the most effective member of the cast. Strother Martin plays his chortling side-kick, who gets vicarious thrills out of Marvin's sadistic beating of townfolk. Edmund O'Brien chews the scenery with impossible speeches about freedom of the press. He is, in a word, ridiculous. Lee Van Cleef doesn't have one line of dialogue. Andy Devine is Andy Devine. VALENCE seems to be very low-budget. It reminded me in a large way of the Westerns that were so popular on television at the time--this could have been another episode of Wagon Train. Again, one of the major problems is the over-the-hill casting. I kept thinking how different the film would have been had it been cast with younger stars.The "surprise" twist ending is unconvincing and doesn't really add anything. I know many people love this film. I'm at a loss.</fullReview>

Most careers don't even get through one phase. His talent was modest and he pre-dates Method acting but some of his performances are just fine.His reward for his lifetime of effort was that in the nineties George Bush's son Neil and other vermin of his ilk, utilizing the new deregulations, caused the savings and loan crisis, losing billions of investors money. All was lucky for Neil as dad had just become president and he quickly put the nation into a war (at great profit to himself) to distract people from the debacle that rich brats like Neil had helped bring about. Neil should have gone to jail, but jail is for poor people. The Bush family is just the gift that keeps on giving.Jimmy Stewart lost his fortune and ended his life in comparatively dire straits.</fullReview>

How original! 3. The story telling. The movie is told in flashback, so we know immediately that: Jimmy Stewart's character survives and gets elected to office, John Wayne's character survives, Jimmy gets the girl, and the bad guy gets shot. The result is that the movie lacks anything resembling drama. 4. Cheezy sets. Sure, it's old, and this should be taken into consideration, but when you see the set they used for the wooded path where Stoddard gets mugged, your first reaction will be laughter. Couldn't they just find a real wooded path? 5. Poor technical management. Example, the Duke blows out a match and chucks it to the floor. But, he can't even blow it out, so he chucks it down still flaming. Stewart has been shot in the arm...shot so badly, he has troubles walking, so he supports himself with...the arm that was shot. The list goes on.This movie should have ended half an hour before it did...watch it and you'll see what I mean.Watching this while understanding it's 40 years old may make this seem better than I've made it out to be, but even then, it's still bad.</fullReview>
