		<shortDescription>Hardy is excellent, the rest is not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the Kray twins is a fascinating one, full of violence and deceit. In Legend, that story isn't really taken to its full potential, thanks to an unfortunately clunky structure despite brilliant performances, good humour and violence.Let's start with the best part of this film, that is Tom Hardy's performances as Ronnie and Reggie Kray. The amazing special effects make the dual show possible, but within minutes of the start here, you completely forget that these two characters are played by the same man.Hardy completely disappears into both men, with an unnerving but humorous turn as the psychotic Ronnie, and a more understated but powerful performance as Reggie, and that really deserves some praise.What's more is that this film does make use of the very violent nature of the history very well. As bloody as it is foul-mouthed, this isn't a pleasant film to watch, but the level of violence does leave an impression with regards to the Krays' crimes, making it seem all the more real, and all the more frightening.The big issue I have with this film, however, is that it's not an exhilarating watch. Historically interesting it may be, but at over two hours long, it's not something that will consistently entice you throughout.There are side plots that aren't picked up on enough, some characters don't get the development they really deserve based on the size of their role, and the plot takes a really long time to get going.The disappointing thing is that Legend isn't a bad film in any way, nor is it boring, but it gives you a sense of growing importance and tension towards a hopefully climactic end, but it never comes as you want it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two of Hardy's best performances in a movie with not much else going for it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend is a gripping movie, there's no doubt about it. Seeing Tom Hardy on screen, whether he's playing Reggie, Ronald, or both, is absolutely captivating. He owns the roles, and despite their identical looks you feel that they're completely different people because of how well Hardy portrays them. Reggie is sophisticated, methodical, affable; Ronnie is impulsive, unpredictable, paranoid. As a vehicle for Tom Hardy's acting chops, Legend is a home run. Unfortunately, that is where the positives of the movie end.The movie is tonally confused from scene to scene. It can be romantic one minute, ultra-violent the next, then reserved and introspective the minute after that. It's clunky writing; every time the movie begins to gain momentum it trips on itself one way or another. Also, you really don't care about any character other than the twins. I mean, thankfully they're in just about every scene, but they're always surrounded by faceless goons, or with a generic love interest, or no-name cops - not fully fleshed out characters. This is in no way a fault of the actors though. Christopher Eccleston is wasted yet again as a villain after Thor: The Dark World. Here he's in an antihero role as the cop assigned to the Kray's case, but his lines lack any form of personality. He does what he can but he really has nothing to work with. Chazz Palminteri makes an appearance for about 5 minutes total as his usual gangster self, but in the end you're left scratching your head. So many characters, so much potential, but the only thing holding the movie together is Tom Hardy.So as you can infer, Legend is worth a watch if you're a Tom Hardy fan. He's scarily good in these roles, and two Tom Hardys are better than one. For that reason alone I can't give this movie a lower score. However, if you're looking for substance in a gangster biopic, you'll have to look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy shines in bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only good thing about this very average film is Tom Hardy's acting. A lesser talented actor would have made it almost unwatchable. Short on facts, the writers here have just invented or borrowed bits to try and make the film sensational. It hasn't worked very well but at least shows the 'Krays' were a couple of psychopathic violent lunatics whose scrambled brains believed they were something special. Fact is, in this film, the one bit of fact we do know was said by Chas Palmintiri as Angelo Bruno the Philly mob boss, 'mobsters should keep a low profile'. Ironically poor old Angelo Bruno got whacked by Nicky Scarfo, a psychopath mafiosi who just like the 'Krays' loved being high profile and just like the Krays was sentenced to die in prison.The 'Krays' and most of the morons who worked for them were as thick as planks. They were also seriously dangerous psychopathic paranoid, disorganised nut cases who would use violence against anybody who got in the way. Although the story seems to have forgotten a lot of well recorded facts and many real people. Where was older brother Charlie Kray and other faces who stood trial with them. Why so many of the main 60s true characters strangely left out of the film. The so called shootout scene was way off the recorded known facts in the Kray's pub the 'Carpenters Arms' and the only gunfight was in Catford at 'Mr Smiths' drinking club in 1965 and neither of the Krays were there. In this film, the 'Blind Beggar' pub had mysteriously moved from it's prominent place on the busy east end Whitechapel Rd to what was some unknown dark cobbled back street which was obviously a film set. Frances Shea had left Reg Kray 8 months after the wedding in 1965, she left diaries clarifying he was fairly useless as a man. The Triumph Spitfire he buys her was a 1967 registered car some two years later. Far from being respected by their 'firm' they were often looked upon a a couple of morons. Albert Donahue's nicknames for the twins was 'Gert and Daisy'. The film could have told interesting story if it had been researched properly. The true story is far more interesting than this fiction. None of it is anywhere near the truth. This film takes some of it's stories from an old book written by a toff named John Pearson. The book was written forty plus years ago and I can imagine they must have had a great time filling Pearson full of tall stories. But this film surpasses the book in being so full of fiction it becomes a spot the next mistake game. I am glad to say that the film does not glorify the 'Krays', it shows them more as the pathetic, paranoid, violent, brainless sick morons they were. Very lucky to have gotten away with their crimes for so long. But the 50s and 60s were not long after the war and London and times were a whole lot different. If anyone out there aspires to admire these couple of lowlifes, they seriously need a reality check up.The Krays and the Richardson stories have been hijacked by so many 'silly b***icks' wannabe gangsters and money grabbing Kray wives it has become a monumental joke. Much of it fuelled by old showbiz people like Barbara Windsor for one who come up with' they were good boys who loved their old Mum'. Many of the most evil despots in history loved their Mothers. The 'Krays' were hated with a passion by many of the proper old faces around London. The Krays were disorganised and out of control. Only last week, Freddie Foreman, who is a wily old fox and was smart enough to shun the limelight when he was active said had the Krays not been arrested they were due to be 'ironed out'. Freddie Foreman would know more about the Krays, the Richardsons and London's underworld than is contained the many books about the 'Krays'. There are many who were there who believe that it would have been better for all of us if they had been ironed out and disappeared off of the face of the earth in 1967. The 'Krays' do not deserve being called a legend. The bull***t has created an industry out there for second rate books, films and documentaries that will invent anything to get your money. This is just another one. As a gangster movie, it isn't in the same league as American films 'Godfather' 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' from a Brit angle it doesn't come close to 'The long Good Friday' or 'Sexy Beast'. 'Legend' is just another ordinary film made watchable by Tom Hardy's performance.Before you see this movie, watch Monty Python's 'Pirhana Bros' sketch and take on the Krays, apart from being hilarious, the Pythons got it far more right than the writers of 'Legend'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what you might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you walk into a film with not one but two leading performances by Tom Hardy, who's back catalogue brings nothing but pleasure (apart from This Means War, but we'll let that slide), you cant help but feel disappointed when you leave the screen completely unaffected by what you've just watched, and that was certainly how I felt hen it came to Legend.Labelled of course as a Kray twin biopic, it sadly offers no real insight into their story and only grazes the top of their criminal wrong doings. Instead it goes down the route of Reggie and Frances love story, who is a character so under developed that the fragility her brother so often reiterates, isn't actually explained what so ever and prevents us from feeling anything towards her.As for Hardy he plays both characters exceptionally well, particularly Ronnie who's insanity and subsequent spontaneity provides some comic relief to it all, however his psychological state is something that could of been explored more thoroughly instead of labelling him as just nuts. The supporting cast, including Taron Egerton and Christopher Eccleston, also do a fine job though Ecclestone's police officer almost gets ignored completely.The violence is also few and far between but when it appears they definitely don't hold back, providing entertaining scenes more reminiscent of other crime dramas and what you would expect going in. It shows us the real consequences of the lifestyle they live which does its best to offset the fairly superficial painting of 60's London but isn't enough and so the 'glossy' comments its been receiving are sadly warranted.In the end this adds up to a rather dull final product that wastes so much potential in this genuinely interesting real life crime partnership.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardy terrific, film so so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this one; the trailers were great and, whilst I'm not one of those who glamourise the Krays (they loved their mums, would do anything for you blah blah blah), I do find it bizarrely fascinating how the Krays/Richardsons have passed into London folklore. Alas, it's a bit of a let down. Hardy throws himself into both roles, by turns amusing and scary as Ronnie and compelling as a Reggie trying to build an empire while struggling to keep his brother in check. But he is let down by a clunky structure, it takes a while to get going and subplots and characters are introduced and then discarded on a whim, an awful Frances Kray voice-over, and an uneven script which can't quite decide if it wants to be an American style gangster flick or tread the same path as The Long Good Friday, Get Carter et al. And who let Duffy and her nails down a blackboard voice back in? I really hoped we'd seen the last of her after that crap Diet Coke ad. The club scenes aren't quite working guys. I know, let's get Duffy, stuck a wig on her and she can caterwaul her way through some 60s classics. High five!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legends</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hardy gives an all time great performance, double acting as both the notorious Kray twins. The story is also quite comedic, clever and full of some great thrilling scenes. One of the great things about this film is you know what you're going to get, and it delivers, then some. It's bloody on top of witty, charming and fun. Legend serves up one of the great films of the year, whilst also being quite modest in its approach. With Tom Hardy's already established terrific acting skills, Legend becomes something more then a typical gangster crime film. It feels invested into making the viewer content with its two hour runtime, whilst always respecting. The award for best actor goes to? Tom Hardy, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Surprisingly Excellent Films This year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, hats off to the acting in this film - the cast did an amazing job. I was worried when i saw the trailer but i gave it a chance and I'm so glad i did. Truly a very well put together film, with a plot that carried it through and several audience members including myself cried at times. It showed the brothers in a different light. Allowing the audience to love them, hate them, sympathise and empathise with them. Tom hardy played both brothers excellently and hats off to the supporting actress who played Frances Kray - she did a fantastic job. A film you could re-watch again and again, the atmosphere and the wardrobe were key aspects of this film and the director delivered on pulling out all the stops. The script was beautifully written. That said, I'd ask you to remember that this film is from one take on the Krays, they were a complex pair and short of holding a séance, we will never know what went on in their minds - this film is an adaptation of an account. Judge it on what you see, don't waste time with trailers that spoil parts for you. Buy a ticket and some popcorn and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding crime picture (and Hardy is a LEGEND).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infamous Kray brothers ? identical twins Reggie and Ronnie ? are so well known in British gangster history they've already had multiple films made about them. What writer-director Brian Helgeland brings to the table with his take on the notorious siblings is exuberant storytelling, classy visual styling and a tour de force performance by Tom Hardy as both twins. Hardy's dual turn is undeniably the centrepiece of the movie. His Reggie is all charm and swagger, with intelligence and ambition to boot, whilst the schizophrenic Ronnie is a short-tempered ball of emotional bluster. Helgeland sensibly opts to make Reggie the focus; of the two he is the more grounded one, a gangster with lofty aspirations and the ability to interact on a human level with those around him to make his goals a reality. There is also genuine chemistry between Hardy (as Reggie) and Emily Browning, her fragile yet strong-willed Frances able to draw out the romantic side of Reggie, making his bursts of savagery all the more terrifying. Sporadically placed throughout the (overlong) two hour plus runtime, the bouts of violence bubble with intensity and exhilaration, often uneasily enjoyable thanks to moments of levity sprinkled alongside them. The 60s setting is capitalised on too, Dick Pope's elegant photography giving proceedings a classical feel while Carter Burwell's powerfully soulful score affects deeply at all the right times. There's a sense of glorification here that mightn't sit well with some audience members, however the Krays were adored in the East End and to deny the glitzier parts of their life would be to deny what made them popular to begin with. An exceptional crime picture with two outstanding performances from one man, proving again that Hardy really is an acting? legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Succession of Entertaining Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If asked what this film is "about", you can respond that it's about the Krays - and you can't be much more specific than that.The possibilities were immense - it could have been about the politics of the Kray empire, or a character study into what made the Krays tick, or (probably what the film should have gone for) a focused story of the Krays' downfall. Instead, the film lacks any real coherence or a strong narrative arc; it essentially consists of a series of scenes which could have been played in almost any order.Now, a film which deals with real events always has to strike a balance between authenticity and arranging events into a satisfyingly cohesive narrative. This can be a problem for films striving for strict accuracy, but Legend's larger-than-life, often tongue-in-cheek approach left plenty of room for fashioning a narrative. Yet the closest Legend comes to telling a story concerns the relationship between Reggie and his wife Frances. This was an odd choice of perspective (Frances functions as the movie's narrator), not least because the film doesn't really explore the relationship in any real depth - for instance, five minutes into their first date, Reggie and Frances kiss and that's all that's done to establish that they're "in love". Although Emily Browning performed well enough as Frances, the writing for her character was so bad it was jarring - she speaks in horrible movie clichés, in a way that no-one ever speaks in real life.The writing is otherwise excellent, and brought to life by fantastic performances from the whole cast - but especially, of course, Tom Hardy. His portrait of Ronnie, though it constantly borders on being absolutely preposterous, is impossible to tear your eyes away from. In every scene, I was waiting for the camera to cut back to Ronnie so I could savour the performance.Does Hardy's double-performance redeem the film's shortcomings? Well, yes - enough for me to say that this film is worth a watch. You will be entertained, even if the film drags towards the end.But ultimately, Hardy's incredible performance is wasted on a film which failed to tell a story. Legend provides no sort of insight into Reggie and Frances' relationship, or the downfall of the Krays, or the workings of their empire, or, most crucially of all, into the motivations and characters of the Krays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardy excels in a dual role of some right historical bad 'uns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hardy is a strange fish as an actor. Famous for being almost incomprehensible in "The Dark Night Rises" and almost equally incomprehensible in his co-starring role in "The Revenant", it's sometimes really difficult to get a sense of his true abilities. Here in "Legend" he gets to show what he's made of?. Twice! Hardy plays both roles in the story of Reggie and Ronnie Kray, the infamous gangsters who ruled across large parts of London in the 1960's.The film tells the story of the rise of the duo, focusing in particular on the wooing by Reggie of Frances (Emily Browning), the local girl who fell in love with and then married the hoodlum. Reggie and Ronnie ? whilst both undisputed 'bad uns' ? were as different as chalk and cheese. Reggie was all for semi-legitimizing the business, running deals through his socialite-heavy clubs, and gaining higher-level cover by inveigling his way into control of political contacts such as Lord Boothby (a delightfully oily John Sessions).In contrast, Ronnie was an out-and-out psychopath with a malfunctioning 'off' button and no button at all marked 'self-control'. An open homosexual ? something far more shocking in the '60s than it is today ? Ronnie was a medicated loose cannon that even Reggie had trouble controlling. Gathering a posse of 'boys' around him (including Kingsman's Taron Egerton) Ronnie blazes a trail of bloody violence against rival gangs with little regard to the consequences. On the side of the law was Nipper Read ("Dr Who" re-booter Christopher Ecclestone) as the dogged detective trying to find something ? anything ? to pin on the brothers.Hardy manages to convey each brothers' idiosyncrasies so well that you quickly forget that this is the same actor playing both roles. It is only in some of the more interactive scenes (such as a fight between the two of them) that the illusion fails apart somewhat and where acting twins would have made for more convincing footage (unfortunately Jedward were unavailable!).What makes Hardy's performance as Reggie particularly memorable is that for much of the film - and against your better judgment - you end up rooting for Reggie and wishing him to 'succeed'. (This is more by way of comparison against Ronnie's truly abhorrent behavior than against any absolute measure of 'good').Browning is also compelling as the love-lost Frances, getting deeper and deeper into a world she has no control over and having to act to extremes of both love and fear. Also worthy of mention is the portrayal by David Thewlis (Lupin from the Potter films) of the Kray's financial adviser Leslie Payne: a man who knows he has the financial respect of the twins (at least Reggie) but is always sailing a dangerous course between kowtowing to them and criticizing their actions. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland ("Payback"), this is an intelligent British thriller, reflecting a visceral view of the criminal underworld of London in the '60's. Overall, its an enjoyable watch that perhaps - Hardy aside - doesn't quite live up to its potential. A note however for the sensitive viewer: this is a very (very) violent film in places, and a couple of the scenes in particular are hard to watch.

		<shortDescription>Not Really About The Krays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bet that you, like me, walked into the theatre expecting to see a gangster movie about the Kray twins only the film is not about them at all. Instead the central character is Frances and the entire story is told from her point of view. You don't get a picture of the criminal world just long love scenes between Reggie and Frances.To illustrate it there is a scene where Frances asks Reggie to leave the gangster world and he answers that it's not that simple. And I was sitting there asking - why? If the film had actually shown the Kray's criminal life I could have understood his reasons for saying that. But as it is Reggie and Ron remain a mystery, their stories are never really told.Also, and this seems to be a pet peeve of mine lately, the movie is over-narrated. It doesn't just stop at things that need to be explained for people to understand the story it is actively telling and not showing and expecting that to make up for the lacking plot.Around 2/3 of the way in I was getting bored with Legend as it didn't deliver in any way. Perhaps it doesn't deserve a score as low as 2/5, perhaps some people will enjoy it a bit more than I did, but what got me the most was that at the end the film actually had the gall to preach their "morality" at the viewer. That's what really got me the most.Overall the Legend is a mediocre film that's not really as good as the trailers make it out to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film with a stunning central performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some poor films recently, e.g. 'No Escape' and (on DVD) 'The Holiday'. But 'Legend' makes up for them. It's a riveting film with a stunning performance by Tom Hardy as both Ronnie and Reggie Kray. His split-screen role never seems odd and his acting is simply spellbinding. The film has its faults. It's too visually arresting at times. A little less gloss and a little more spit and sawdust would have been appropriate. Some of the external scenes seem more like studio ones such is their overly pristine nature. And the character of Frances, Reggie's girlfriend, is not adequately developed. The reasons for her mental fragility are not properly explored. The soundtrack is superb. There are scenes of graphic violence but they are wholly germane to the film's theme. The talented supporting cast is uniformly excellent. But, above all, 'Legend' is Hardy's film. I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend is worth the time, just don't expect a classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend is the true story of twin brother gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, notorious criminals who built an organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.Directed by Brian Helgeland, this biopic sees Tom Hardy play both brothers in a dual role, and brilliant too, from the psychotic Ronnie to the soulful Reggie. It's these performances that kept me entertained. Ronnie's disappointment just before the bar fight, his brutal honesty about his sexuality, and the two brothers fighting each other in the nightclub, these moments had me laughing out loud, but in later scenes we're reminded these guys weren't exactly heroes. The film starts with the brothers as established London gangsters, no mention of their childhood, the boxing years and very little of their much loved mother Violet. Other characters are caught up in their mad world. Emily Browning plays Reggie's naive and tragic wife Frances, who provides an emotional core to the story yet somehow delivers a two dimensional performance. Christopher Eccleston plays the copper Nipper Reed, dour faced but determined to bring in the brothers, although his screen time is short, much like Paul Bethany as Charlie Richardson. Taron Egerton plays Teddy Smith, Ronnie's boy friend and henchman with a hint of menace. My main complaint is the structure of the narrative, uneven mostly and the tone shifts from comedic to violent and dark quite often, contributing to the film feeling as long as it's run time of over 2 hours. The director decided to checklist events like politicians covering up gay orgies and the more personal scene of spouse abuse, without much time spent on the reasons or consequences. The voice-over by Frances is at times unwanted and not interesting either. Even after her death, it continues for some odd reason. With the exception of the original theme music featured, the soundtrack is predictable and out of place with popular 60s American hits played to the brutality of British gangster life. But visually everything looks amazing: the lavish clubs, the homely pubs, the suits and dresses, all captured within the great cinematography by Dick Pope. The world of the Krays already has an identity but it seems this version of the story is packaged and marketed to an international audience who may be unaware of the gruesome twosome. Although more Guy Ritchie in execution than a Martin Scorsese as i hoped, Legend is worth the time, just don't expect a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted and filmed but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this film being a definitive story of the Kray's, what we get instead is a well acted, scripted and filmed movie, nothing more nothing less.This film tries to portray a pair of vicious and bullying thugs as some sort of misunderstood deep characters. Nipper Read is shown as the archetypal copper , a sort of joke figure, which he certainly wasn't, he brought down the Kray's with his dogged determination to get them put away and pay for their crimes. We hear nothing of their gang of accomplices , nothing of their attempts to get others to take the fall for their crimes when they were caught. Jack "the hat" McVitie is shown as a figure who was scared of the Krays , which he was not and is why he incurred their wrath. When Reggie killed Jack all the guests had been sent away and the only people present were gang members , why do film makers feel the need to go against the true nature of what actually happened ? The film as a vehicle for Tom Hardy to shine is brilliant , he takes both parts and runs with them so that you believe they are totally different people. However that is all the film is a Tom Hardy acting class.The whole film is dull and annoying, we are talking about two of the most "iconic" of London's underworld and we see nothing of real interest only some broken love story.There is no background to this story it just rumbles along and expects everyone to join in on the ride. If film makers are going to produce true stories then please stick to the reality of the events ,not what you wanted to have happened or how you wanted it to happen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Romantic-Comedy, Awful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was advertised as a fast passed action thriller, set in the east end, looking into the lives of violent and crazy gangster brothers Ronnie and Reggie.However this film should have been advertised as Reggie and Frances; A love story. This film centered around Reggie and Frances' short two year marriage, which ended tragically, taking the film into a dark turn of events. Frances was hardly even mentioned in the trailer and yet she was nearly the star of the entire film. The whole two hours of the film was completely about Frances and Reggies 'love story'In the trailer Reggie and Ronnie are seen saying they are 'going to rule London' but apart from owning a few failed clubs I didn't really see this London empire. There were no gang fight senses, there were no shoot outs, there gang basically had five member's including the Krays, perhaps one or two fight scenes happened and that's all it really amounted to. Although the Kray's did kill a grand total of two people in their lives, it got them sent to prison for thirty years where they died, not quite the blazing glory death and life I would expect of two gangsters. If it weren't for the character Ron making humorous comments every so often, this film would have been terrible. Finding out what Reggie was eventually like to Frances just made me angry and hateful, which is not what you want to feel with the main character. The only thing that saved this film was Tom Hardys acting. Had this film been advertised as more of a romance film I would not have been giving it such a bad review, but Going into this film I wanted action and all I got was a typical love story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend is really Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read The Profession Of Violence by John Pearson some years ago which this film is based on - and wanted to see a movie about the Krays - I watched The Krays with the Kemp brothers and despite many an accolade bestowed thought it was just an average film - so armed with that I approached Legend with some anticipation. Growing up in rural Britain my film hero's were like many of us Deniro,Pacino,Walken etc - Never had a real British film star I was amazed at until Tom Hardy came on the scene - so after watching Lawless ,The Drop and The Revenant was extremely proud of having a British actor that in my mind measured up to said heavyweights! Legend is a true representation not only of the book but of the Krays story - yes there were some comedic moments in the film with Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie - but they captured the real essence of Ronnie's mistrust and paranoia. The supporting actors are brilliantly cast and noteworthy performances by Emily Browning ,Christopher Eccleston and the very brilliant David Thewlis - not to mention a great cameo by Chazz Palminteri make this a must see film. I would have given this a 10 but waiting for Hardy's next film to do that</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Queen would survive, but God save the rest of us." London in the 1960's was run by two twin gangsters, Reggie and Ron Kray (Hardy). Nothing happened without them knowing or allowing it. Reggie was calculating and deadly while Ron was a little psychotic and unstable. Eventually they only thing that could challenge their reign was each other. As many of you know by now I am a HUGE fan of gangster and mafia movies. I was looking forward to this one for that reason. I like Tom Hardy but never really got all the hype around him, until now. He was so good in this that it almost actually hurt the movie. He plays both brothers perfectly and to the point of you forgetting its the same actor. The dialog and intonation of his voice is even different. I've never seen anything like it and half the time I was staring at them, going back and forth trying to see similarities and failing. It also made me wonder if the movie would have been as good if it had not been for him. What it came down to was it doesn't matter, he is in it and I was just mesmerized by his acting in this. I say distracting because as good as this movie was all I could talk about was his performance, that isn't a bad thing though. Overall, this is a movie that I really enjoyed and highly recommend but the reason to watch is for the dual role played by Hardy. I give this movie a high B+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'LEGEND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tom Hardy plays dual roles, in this British crime thriller, as the Kray twins. Hardy plays Reggie and Ronald Kray; British gangster twins, that terrorized London in the 1960s. The film was written and directed by Brian Helgeland (who also performed both duties on movies like 'PAYBACK', '42' and 'A KNIGHT'S TALE'); it's based on the 1972 novel 'The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins', by John Pearson. The movie also costars Emily Browning, David Thewlis, Christopher Eccleston and Chazz Palminteri. Being a huge fan of Hardy's, I enjoyed the film immensely!The story begins in late 1950s London. It's told from the point of view of Frances Shea (Browning); who was the girlfriend, and later wife, of mobster Reggie Kray (Hardy). The film details Reggie and Ronald's brutally violent rise to criminal fame; as Reggie constantly tried to keep his mentally ill brother in line. It also focuses on the romantic relationship between Reggie and Frances. Tom Hardy is my favorite (current) actor, and he definitely doesn't disappoint here. If you're a fan of his, seeing him play such distinctly different (and very memorable) characters, is wildly entertaining. The movie, as a whole, is a pretty well made gangster flick as well; I've liked Helgeland's other films (especially 'PAYBACK'), and I think he does a more than adequate job helming this one. The movie is definitely worth seeing!watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/A1MyBFioKXM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy is just.......AMAZING!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess that I could never finish or even forced myself to watch any British gangster films until this "Legend". At first, I thought I just might give it a try and predicted that as usual, I'd quit within 5 or 10 minutes, because 99.9% out of 100, the British gangster movies sucked. The reason why I decided to give it a try was because of Tom Hardy, since any film he played turned out to be very good. And this film, Lordy, Lordy, he was just amazing, playing two completely different persons and characters as twin brothers. This kind of performance is simply at genius level, so good that I simply couldn't find word to describe or praise him. I think Tom Hardy is not only one of the best actors in 21st Century, he IS the BEST! What a great gift to movie history and civilization. There's nothing I could express more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I am bias but I love the story of the Krays. I had been waiting for a long time to see this movie ever since I saw the preview for it. While it was not the 10/10 that I was hoping it would be, it was an excellent movie. It was well shot, the script was good, and the story of the Krays is a very good story. My biggest complaint of the movie was it seemed to short. You get a snippet into the history and the story of the Krays starting in the middle years where Ron is already in the mental institution. I personally was left wanting to see more. I wanted to the the movie start from the early years, show the building of the crime empire and then the end of their run. I think the early years really solidify the bond between the two brothers and that bond is simply missing and taken for granted in the movie. Having said that there was a lot of time they were covering in this movie. For that reason you miss a lot of the building of the empire, how they started and what pieces fit together were. I think that is why this movie has such a low rating of 7/10 with most viewers. I think it is also why I feel it was a bit of a let down from what I was really hoping to get. The acting in the movie was bril. Tom Hardy does a really good job in both roles. He sells the characters very well, he accent is even pretty good as well. The script writing was very good given the time limitations. If you don't know the story of the Krays, it is a great watch. If you are familiar with the story, just don't expect to see the whole story unfold. Would gladly watch this movie again and recommend it to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that you can't have too much of Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is true that glasses and change of hairdo can actually produce a different personality. This movie is mostly dedicated to Tom Hardy delivering his excellent, albeit slightly and funnily schizophrenic, acting prowess. As far as biopic goes, other films such as Black Mass delivers a more in depth-look of the mafia life style, but Legend opts for a direct personal view of the brothers and takes full advantage of the lead actor.Tom Hardy plays as both Ron and Reggie Kray, performed with a tweak of facial expression and mild change on make-up. Reggie is the more levelheaded one while Ron can be described as batcrap insane. They are both capable of violence and living a shared gangster life. The events are told by narration from Frances (Emily Browning), Reggie's love interest and a silent witness to the horrible dealings.The movie's strongest point is undoubtedly the lead, it is not often that this "one actor two roles" is used in cinema recently. Tom Hardy delivers everything expected from him, from the subtle or strong expression, change of speech and mannerism to intricate body language of different characters. Viewers know the twin scene is done by effect, yet they often look like two different persons interacting with each other.It dabbles in less criminal activities and more in private life, evident by using Frances a key point for developments even though she is mostly there as spectator, especially when mafia dealings are concerned. Emily Browning is a good addition, she handles her own well, but it's not the level of outlandish on-screen presence like the Krays.While there is a definite involvement of crime thriller aspect, it doesn't portray the shady indulgent in its entirety. It's not the intricate inside view like that of American Hustle. There are few violent scenes, although the movie is not a noir gritty musing and some of the events could be done more thoroughly.Tom Hardy has done some interesting roles, but none arguably had this level of complexity. Legend further cemented his acting signature on the silver screen, it may not be an in-depth take of criminal enterprise, but he alone, or two of him, is enough to carry the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance by Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. It does make out the Krays to be quite comical, especially Ronnie Kray. When in reality they were complete thugs and bullies. But as entertainment this was a great film, which is worth the admission price to see Tom Hardy play both roles.Taron Egerton is excellent as 'Mad Teddy' and adds some extra charisma to the film. The film is over 2 hours but didn't drag at all. It's not up there with Goodfellas, but then not many films are. I've read a lot of books about the Krays and they left a lot out of this movie. I wouldn't say it is the definitive film of the Krays and it could have been better. As someone mentioned previously, it could have been a trilogy. But I can't really see many people playing the roles better than Tom Hardy.I would say if you like Tom Hardy, and English gangland history, then you won't be disappointed with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To keep it simple:if you like movies like Casino, Godfather and Once upon a Time in America, you will like this one too.Tom Hardy portrays English Mobster twins during the 50s and 60s. Whilst one would love to see more intense moments between the two, each character is drawn out with a love for details, whether it is in writing or acting. The side stories are good, no real surprises there but again the setting and realization of the 50- 60s London is simply great.Although I was expecting more interference from other Mobsters, it was definitely one of the best movies in 2015 and if you want a clever crime-drama - this is it....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent and well made enough, but with noticeable flaws present</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A biopic of the most infamous gangsters ever to hail from the East End of London, Ronnie and Reggie Kray (both played by Tom Hardy), who have transcended East London folklore more than any other. Opening in the early '60s, the film charts Reggie's courting of the innocuous Frances (Emily Browning), Ronnie dealing with his homosexuality in less permissive times, as well as being declared insane, and the brothers takeover of the Richardson clans grip on the local crime scene. But with dogged Detective Read (Christopher Eccleston) on their backs, and their own destructive, excessive personalities driving them to their own demise, it all leads to a shocking, brutal end for both of them respectively.It's surprising, given the popularity of the British crime thriller and, as I already stated, the unrivalled iconic status the Kray twins have in British folklore, that since they were at the height of their infamy in the '60s, only two films have been made about their exploits, in spite of the no doubt countless crime biographies and television documentaries that must have been shown about them. The '90s film, a much smaller scale affair, had the similar conundrum of casting two actors who looked alike enough to be twins, and ended up with the Kemp brothers, who at the time were still able to ride on their popularity as being part of the recently split up Spandau Ballet. Here, being one actor playing two roles, Hardy, as acclaimed a performer as he is, risks looking silly, adopting an on screen filming style made most famous by Jean Claude Van Damme in Double Impact. But if you can get over this, the film still has much to recommend it.Telling a true life story, and not to mention a particularly brutal and savage one, inevitably the film will contain more than its fair share of violence, which director Brian Helgeland will quite rightly say is essential to tell the story. But the trick is to show it on screen without 'glamorizing' it, which, sadly, at times, Helgeland fails to do. A particularly unflinching moment is during a hammer wielding pub attack, where the brothers (or one of them, anyway) take out some of their competitors, only set to a rock n' roll backdrop which cheers along what any decent person would find unsettling. The film in general seems consistently unsure of the tone it wants to adopt, flitting between drama, romantic, and even comedy, which it matches with the plot, which lacks any real narrative structure and just plods along, showing various antics from the Krays life without really going anywhere.Since his double performance is the talking point, all eyes fall on Hardy, who undoubtedly fits the roles better than anyone. He creates more of an impression with Ronnie, whose drawling, rambling and softly threatening persona make him distinctive in the same way as Hardy's Bane was from The Dark Knight Rises. As Reggie, he portrays a swaggering, posturing villain to whom appearance is everything, but in all honesty no different to your standard villain from such a film. I can't think of it as any better or worse than the 1991 film when the chips are down, to be honest, and it would be nice if something more structured and smooth could come along to depict the antics of these most timeless and unduly worshipped of real life villains. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me bored and unenlightened</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Medak's 1990 film The Krays, starring Gary and Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet as the titular London geezers, was decent, anchoring the twins' narrative on their overbearing mother, played ferociously by Billie Whitelaw. But seeing the film now, over two decades later, its synth-heavy score makes it feel dated and presses the need for a modern re-telling. Director Brian Helgeland bagged one of the most charismatic actors on the planet to play not one, but both of the twins for his update, and when the trailer first emerged on the internet for Legend, it felt like we were finally getting the definitive story of two of the most notorious gangsters in British history. So how on Earth did Legend turn out so mind- numbingly terrible?In the early scenes we are carried along on a wave of genre clichés, from the spontaneous date proposal from the charming bad boy to the curious girl who should really know better, to a Steadicam shot of a swinging nightclub interior as the girl drinks this glamorous new world in without questioning how such luxury was achieved. It works like a students version of Goodfellas (1990), only without the originality, style or sparkling dialogue. The girl is Frances, or Frankie, and her new fella just happens to be Reggie Kray (Tom Hardy), former boxer-turned-criminal kingpin who, along with his twin Ronnie (also Hardy), are well on their path to ruling London with an iron fist. However, Legend seems more invested in the relationship between Reggie and Frankie than any of the twins' brutal schemes, and Emily Browning fails to inject any life into a thanklessly written role.One of many of the film's baffling decisions is to have Frankie provide the voice-over, forcing her to deliver such lines as "a cup of tea can solve anything," with semi-conviction. Helgeland's script for L.A. Confidential won an Oscar in 1997, but Legend's dialogue makes the dullest of ITV dramas sound like Shakespeare spoken by Alan Rickman (R.I.P.). Yet this could be forgiven had the on-screen action possess an ounce of narrative coherency. Instead, Helgeland portrays the ups-and-downs of Reggie and Frankie's rocky marriage, dipping in and out of the Krays criminal activities whenever it seems to want to show us someone getting punched or shouted at in a style not to dissimilar to the work of Guy Ritchie.Hardy tries his best, but his two characters have been written so cartoon-like that it's difficult take them seriously. Reggie is the brain who hides his violent urges, and Ronnie is the unhinged muscle who has no desire to disguise his brutal tendencies, seemingly revelling in telling other gangsters of his preference to boys. Ronnie is certainly the most interesting of the twins, but he gets a surprising lack of screen-time. His scenes with his more successful and handsome brother provide the stand-out moments, namely a bar fight that sees Hardy fight Hardy, but the complexity of their rocky relationship is only glimpsed and barely explored. Small roles for the likes of David Thewlis, Christopher Eccleston, Sam Spruell, John Sessions, Paul Bettany and Taron Egerton are highlights - Egerton, as 'Mad' Teddy Smith, in particular - but this is small praise for a film that simply left me bored and unenlightened. \</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardy and Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the title...of all the films I've seen with irrelevant and inappropriate titles, this one takes the biscuit and I'm sorry, I didn't find the film legendary either. British cinema's continuing fascination with the notorious (now there's a better one-word title!) Kray Twins continues and I doubt this will be the last one either. The twist here of course is having Tom Hardy play both parts, thanks to some clever editing and video trickery, although with Reggie and Ronnie not at any time looking like the identical twins in the movie, you sort of wonder what was the point.I liked half of Hardy's performances. His Reggie was fine, a criminal who falls in love with an innocent, pretty young girl and wants to be the perfect husband to her but can't resist the lure of power that running his London empire or his misguided loyalty to his more thuggish, slow-witted brother, Ronnie. I personally found his second portrayal of the lumbering other brother to be exaggerated and bordering into caricature. The film tries to tell its story through the eyes of Reggie Kray's young wife Frances who commits suicide only weeks into their marriage, seemingly unable to cope with her new husband's unwillingness to give up the trappings of his ill-gotten success, although I am aware that her family today strongly disagrees with the passivity and helplessness she exhibits here, claiming in her defence her feistiness and even bravery in leaving Kray so soon after their wedding and then quickly deliberately overdosing rather than be dragged back into Kray's orbit. This seemed to me to be an unsuccessful attempt to humanise the Krays particularly as it seems to be at least part of the justification of Reggie Kray's seemingly out-of-character frenzied killing of Jack "The Hat" McVitie.I also found the film to be selective of other events in their well-known story and a certain lack of continuity in the narrative, with the use of 60's music to define the era being haphazard at best (for example Herman's Hermits' 1964 UK number 1 hit "I'm Into Something Good" plays while Reggie is nicked while watching the World Cup Final which took place in the summer of 1966 - the Kinks' "Sunny Afternoon" would have fit better, surely).Quibbling apart, the film just rambled on, with little dramatic tension or driving narrative. It would have benefited greatly from tighter editing and a more focused storyline in my opinion and in the end seemed to rely far too much on Hardy to carry the film on his two pair of shoulders. However what really let the film down as indicated for me were the writing, the pacing and a distinct lack of edginess I think that any film dealing with the Krays needs to address. Clever casting gimmickry can't compensate for those.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hardy has always had my respects but now has moved up the list of bankable leading actors! As a gangster film aficionado I would instantly add this movie to a much watch list for anyone looking into the genre. For obvious reasons the film had a 'Sugar Hill', with Wesley Snipes, storyline feel to it but different enough that minor comparisons can be made. With all the Oscar caliber movies coming out at the moment, Legend does not disappoint. I did feel that the ending could have had more of a twist. The juxtaposition of the twins lends itself to a much more impactful ending. It left me with a "Awww, they could have done so much more with that.." feeling. Never the less, great movie and performances from the entire cast!As a side note, with the help of the wardrobe, I can see Hardy being a candidate for the next Bond and giving Idris a run for the position.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and balanced, but not necessarily accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so let's start off with the obvious. Tom Hardy's talent is the main driving force of this movie, his performance as both Ronnie and Reggie Kray is utterly captivating and you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who could do better. Hardy captures both character's mannerisms near enough flawlessly from open-mouthed, blunt Ronnie to cool and confident Reggie whilst also representing the interpersonal relationships with each gang member clearly. The film really does portray the gangster violence and the effects it had on Frances Shea (Emily Browning) whilst also providing a few laughs. One thing that can be said is that Helgeland utilises his cast who nearly all come from comic-drama backgrounds very well which matches his script as I felt there was a good balance between comedy, drama and down-right brutality which is always good to see in a gangster film. If you don't care too much for the history behind the Krays and want a well constructed piece of entertainment then this is a film you will really enjoy, as I did. Having said this, the film made me go out and research some of the crimes and trouble the Krays got into and, yes, there is a lot missed out. But this film was not advertised as a documentary and I think Helgeland's main target was an international, just-turned 18, audience who will maybe have never heard of the Krays before. Overall, I am giving it a 9 as it was not perfect and glamoured gangster life a little but you won't want to take your eyes off the screen.</fullReview>

The film disappoints on all 3 levels ? it is not a satisfactory gangster film, nor a very compelling love story, nor will it give you much insight into mental illness.In some respects even more disappointing is the inability of the film to give us a feeling for London in the 60s.On a positive note I think the acting was pretty good.

Who knows. It is a way for sure and it works well enough for me. More 'human' than the Kemp brothers rendition in my opinion.But Tom Hardy playing Ronnie Kray is simply phenomenal, for me his portrayal IS the film. For me it is an Oscar worthy performance.The refusal of Ronnie to take his medication is of course true to life for so many. In fact of late it has come to be realised that the refusal to medicate is directly attributable to the 'illness'... 'it' does not want to be lessened or controlled. The human mind is way more complex than a few tablets.If you want to know what a paranoid schizophrenic, psychopathic and sexually sadistic nihilist is like to deal with, then watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of the rise and fall of the Kray brothers, who ruled the criminal underworld of East London. I have to say I'm blown away by "Legend". It's not a gangster film where there is senseless violence everywhere. Though there is some violence, it does not take over as the main theme. The story fact concentrates on the interpersonal relationships of the brothers. It tells how Reggie falls in love with Frances, how she feels after the marriage and the path to its destruction. It tells how Ron can be eccentric sometimes, and yet the strong bond of brothers keep them unless. I find the plot engrossing and engaging. It feels as if the film gives an intimate glimpse of their lives, not just their achievements but their emotional connections well. I really feel for the Kray brothers, and evoking such emotions is something unusual for a gangster film!The actors playing the brothers look quite alike, but not identical because they still have different mannerisms. Imagine the shock I have when the credits reveal that the two brothers are both played by Tom Hardy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know the Kray history, I don't know it's lore or legend in London. But I like Tom Hardy, and I like gangster movies.Summary: When two twin-brother gangsters Reggie (The "good" one)and Ronnie (the "bad" one) take opportunity of rival gangs being imprisoned by making a deal with the American Mafia, things seem to be looking promising for the two. But Reggie's affection for Frances, a fellow East Ender, drives a subtle stake between the two brothers. Even as Ron's outlandish decisions when his brother is put back in prison for violating probation accidentally do all but secure the Krays' untouchable status by befriending fellow gay politicians, he ultimately starts to ruin the relationship between the two lovers. Reggie remains loyal to his brother as Ron gives more leads for the police to reopen an investigation when he murders a rival in cold blood with witnesses. This starts the ending of the marriage, but Reg himself ends it when he rapes his wife out of anger with her- for making him choose between her and his brother, perhaps. This in turn ends Frances as it all drives her to kill herself. Ron then acts on his paranoia and psychotic tendencies, attempting to kill an accountant he thinks knows to much and plans to talk, which actually makes the accountant talk to the police. Reggie, in a fit of rage, kills the stooge who tried to kill the accountant on Ron's behalf, because he "can't kill 'Ron,' no matter how much he wants to." Both brothers are later arrested and imprisoned for murder.Review: As a gangster movie, this one was surprisingly soft. The violence, while visually compelling and believable, is certainly not as bloody and gory as some old Gangster movies like Good Fellas or Scarface. The sexual scenes are even very mild, particularly when compared to the crime dramas like Wolf of Wall Street- even the gay orgy was mild; the rape was implied rather than shown. Though some may discredit the movie for these reasons, I applaud the film for not lumping in with the lot by making a bloody, debauchery filled film, under the guise of "being true to the truth." Ron's psychosis and Reggie's charm are all well understood through Hardy's excellent portrayal of both brothers, without overly graphic scenes to emphasize the point. The gangsters in this film are not made out to be a "Band of Thieves to steal from the rich and give to the poor." Though "high society," aristocrats and politicians, are shown to exert dirty influence into the world of London, they are not made out to be the bad guys who gangsters wield like a tool. Rather, the politicians are just put next to the criminals and shown that there really is no difference between the two. Although the pace of the plot felt a little off, the main point did seem to come across: People are just people, and they are bound to each other, particularly by choices, and without those people that connect you, you become a living ghost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You get a double dose of the excellent Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hardy is always a pleasure to watch. And now that he has even two roles in the movie you get double pleasure. His acting makes the movie worth watching. Legend is a good entertaining movie about the legendary Kray brothers even though it's more about Frances, the wife of Reggie Kray, narrating her point of view regarding the whole situation. Personally I preferred The Krays from 1990 with the Kemp brothers (from Spandau Ballet) playing the twin brothers. But that's been a while that I didn't watch that one again so maybe it didn't age well. But from what I remember I preferred that movie over Legend. If it was not for Tom Hardy I think Legend would not get the same high rating. He's a quality actor and this role is perfect for him. All in all Legend is worth a watch if you like crime/gangster stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was really good. 9/10 would recommend. Tom Hardy is great as the Kray twins. Overall I think it was great. Must see. Would watch again. If you like British movies you'll like this. If you like gangster movies you'll like this. If you like any movie you'll like this. The movie is tonally confused from scene to scene. It can be romantic one minute, ultra-violent the next, then reserved and introspective the minute after that. It's clunky writing; every time the movie begins to gain momentum it trips on itself one way or another. Also, you really don't care about any character other than the twins. I mean, thankfully they're in just about every scene, but they're always surrounded by faceless goons, or with a generic love interest, or no-name cops - not fully fleshed out characters. This is in no way a fault of the actors though. Christopher Eccleston is wasted yet again as a villain after Thor: The Dark World. Here he's in an antihero role as the cop assigned to the Kray's case, but his lines lack any form of personality. He does what he can but he really has nothing to work with. Chazz Palminteri makes an appearance for about 5 minutes total as his usual gangster self, but in the end you're left scratching your head. So many characters, so much potential, but the only thing holding the movie together is Tom Hardy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>legendary Hardy is a legend in Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read reviews about this film slating it as CRAP, I will be blatantly obvious and say "DON'T BELIEVE THOSE REVIEWS". Tom Hardy doesn't disappoint in a revealing biopic of the Kray twins Ronald and Reginald. The film IS about the Krays, their relationship with each other and how they related to each other through the eyes of Frances (Reggie's wife). This isn't all about how they ruled London, how they come into power but it is about FAMILY. The scenes are brutal, bloody and violent, EXACTLY how the twins were. Emily Browning portrays Frances as a loving wife who tried with all her might to get Reggie on the straight and narrow, failing but always trying, I don't know much about Emily as an actress but I will definitely be looking out for her in other roles. David Thewlis, he is an acting talisman for me, he never disappoints in his roles and he is convincing in his roles. Don't be fooled into thinking this biopic of the twins is in any way only about their criminal behavior as it is both their crimes and their relationships. If you can remember the Kemp brothers in an earlier biopic of the Kray's then get ready to watch a performance from Tom Hardy that makes them look like little Pinocchio's in a punch and Judy show. I will say that I am a huge fan of Tom Hardy and have never been disappointed by any of his performances, STILL HAVEN'T. He played both Ronnie and Reggie with fantastic conviction (pardon the pun), a real testament to his acting ability and this film will further cement his status as an established actor. If you believe those reviews that claim this to be utter rubbish then YOUR LOSS, watch and enjoy, relax with a few friends and watch Tom Hardy blow you away with his 5* performance.</fullReview>

The Kray twins Reggie and Ron (both played by Tom Hardy) are absolutely insane gangsters.The beginning of the story was a bit slow paced. But as it carried on, the story became much more interesting and more interesting. The Kray twins did not see themselves as gangsters, but rather as business men. It made their actions seem acceptable in a different manner.Tom Hardy did an exceptional job playing both Reggie and Ron.

		<fullReview>Legend is a gangster drama adaptation about the Krays, both brothers brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hardy. The film is directed by Brian Helgeland, and the film is fantastic! The film probably isn't as good as the original 'the krays' with Martin Kemp and Gary Kemp, but it has been made better because of Tom Hardys mesmerising performances as both brothers. It is a very rude film in terms of language, but there are gangsters from London. It has very memorable scenes, with one of them being in the bar 'shootout' scene, which i have on repeat it is that good! If you are not a fan of the Krays then maybe this movie isn't for you. But it still worth a watch just to see Tom Hardys performance, as he leaves so much tension on screen. He is truly a marvellous actor and deserves a lot more credit to what he does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most people, I found Tom Hardy's performance to be Legend's greatest attribute. Especially impressive was his portrayal of Ronnie Kray. I feel he should have at least been nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. All the cast perform very well. One who definitely deserves a mention is Emily Browning, who plays Frances Shea, the movie's narrator.Overall, despite the sad fate of some of the characters, the movie was enjoyable. I found the direction and screen writing to be very good.And it's informative - by watching this and doing some reading afterwards, I'm now aware of the 1960s British crime lord twins. I'd never heard of them before this film was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but not a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Legend' is easily better than the 1990 piece of crap, 'The Krays'. But unfortunately that's a very low bar.Whilst this movie sticks to the facts rather than 'the legend', it just tells the wrong story.It tells the story of the Kray brothers, in their mid-career period in the 60s, from the point of view of Reggie Kray's girlfriend (then later wife) Frances Shea.And, well ... there's no nice way to put this:She's a very boring, uninteresting person.I don't know if its Sophie Ellis-Bextor ... sorry Emily Browning's performance, or the script she was given, or if Frances was pretty much just so ordinary that there was no reason for the story to dwell on her at all. Because there's no reason for the story to dwell on her at all.Consequently the entire film feels like it's blundering around with this giant millstone around its neck. That's for starters: it then proceeds to tell pretty much the least interesting anecdotes of the Kray brothers' part in London history.And this gets especially frustrating when you start to realise the sheer quantity of genius-level acting ability available here, including Tom Hardy, David Thewlis, Christopher Eccleston and a huge, talented supporting cast of names and faces.Pretty much, all of it goes to waste ...... but not quite.The things that keep it floating along are Tom Hardy's Ronnie and Reggie, the side performances (doing the best they can with, frankly, not the greatest material), and the way 60s London is presented: everything is fresh, everything is new, the wallpaper, the cars, the skirts, it's all state-of-the-art rather than nostalgia.All of that is enough to make the film watchable, but not enough to propel it into fascination. Missed scenes due to checking messages and fetching snacks generally aren't worth the effort to go back and retrieve.If you're looking for machine-guns and broken kneecaps, sorry it's not here - what's here is, instead, almost a soap-opera.Furthermore, the twins effects don't always work. There are times it really does not feel like the two Tom Hardy's are in the same room, and with cheap efforts like 'Orphan Black' pulling it off perfectly there isn't much excuse for a 2015 high-production film.Tom Hardy, as far as I'm concerned, is a new superman of acting. He's not a Robert DeNiro, he actually has a range. He's not a Johnny Depp, he doesn't have a glass ceiling. He's not a Gary Oldman, he hasn't started imitating himself yet.I think I want to see some genius write a clever, clever SF film - or just a really *strange* and interesting film - and then a good director cast Tom Hardy and Jake Gyllenhaal as leads. In the meantime, we take what we can. Like 'Legend'.Oh - if you DO want to see a slow, thoughtful film (which you probably DIDN'T when you sat down to watch 'Legend') with Tom Hardy, that really showcases his brilliance: 'Locke' (2013).- -- ---</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the title of the film indicates so, the Kray brothers were certainly British legends, admired and hated on the same degree, like it always happens with the most famous criminal figures. But director and screenwriter Brian Helgeland doesn't seem particularly interested in judging or offering explanations; he just pretended to make us plunge into the personal lives of the brothers, showing their volatile relationship with each other and the strong contrasts between their personalities which made them so efficient as "businessmen" and so dangerous as enemies... at least until the differences became serious conflicts which threatened to destroy their empire. Needless to say, the story of the Krays brothers has been told in many occasions, both in cinema and TV (the most famous one might be The Krays); and even though Legend has elements which distinguish it from the other ones, I found it quite ordinary on the narrative level, but with an attractive visual style, solid production values and a magnificent performance (well, two performances) from Tom Hardy, who plays both roles with an amazing intensity and detail, making us immediately forget that we are watching the same actor. The screenplay of Legend (based on the novel The Profession of Violence, written by John Pearson) seems to intentionally omit the details in the crimes of the Kray brothers, something which is justifiable when we recognize the intention to explore the psychology from both men. But at the same time, that makes Legend feel incomplete and occasionally a bit tiring, specially during its second half, which is a bit repetitive and predictable. Besides, it's never left exactly clear with the London is so determined to catch the brothers. On the beginning, we are introduced to Nipper Read, the noted Scotland Yard Inspector in charge of the Krays case... but he disappears almost immediately, and we only see him in a few occasions with the same angry face for not being able to find enough proof to start a judicial process; I think there should have been something more substantial than vague conversations about extortion and casinos in order to fully understand the importance and cover of the crimes from Ron and Reggie Kray. As I previously said, Hardy brings a brilliant performance, and Emily Browning, Chazz Palminteri and David Thewlis also make a good work in their roles. In conclusion, I wasn't left completely satisfied by Legend, but it offers enough positive elements in order to receive a moderate recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Sure the Krays' Story Is Legendary, Solid Is a Better Way To Describe This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looked like it was tailor made for me. A gangster epic with a 1960s backdrop, written and directed by Brian Helgeland (admittedly I haven't seen L.A. Confidential but 42 was a well made biopic that was really enjoyable)and Tom Hardy playing a dual lead (Tom Hardy is one of the top actors working today). I couldn't wait to see it, even after the reviews came out and it didn't receive the praise I thought it would and as much as it shouldn't matter what anyone else says, in this instance the critics were right.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Our narrator is Frances Shea (Emily Browning) Reggie's eventual love interest. The movie starts with Ronnie Kray (Tom Hardy) and Reggie Kray (Tom Hardy) riding around in their playground, 1960s London. Frances gives us a brief description of the two men and promises us a hell of a story about how the Krays became the "legends" they would go on to be. The start of the movie revolves around Reggie, the more level headed and ambitious of the two brothers trying to get Ronnie out of psychiatric care. Ronnie had been convicted for a violent crime but moved to a mental hospital because he's crazy. He's a paranoid schizophrenic with a particularly nasty mean streak. But Reggie is able to intimidate his psychiatrist to recommending his release. It is also at this time that Reggie meets Frances, who is the sister of his driver. He begins a relationship with her despite being constantly watched by Det. Leonard Reed (Christopher Eccleston).A warning ahead of time, the actor's accents can be hard to determine for anyone who isn't from the U.K. That's not a criticism, I'm sure it's very accurate to the real people this story is based on. Being Canadian though, it was hard to understand the actors at times (I found especially at the beginning). This is too bad because a lot of the dialogue is pretty good and there's lots of funny jokes and an interesting story here.One of the things that this movie does differently is that there's a lot of focus on the love story between Reggie and Frances, to the point that it makes Ronnie a supporting character. This is different and it's not a bad decision but I wanted to know more about the Krays' dealings as opposed to Reggie's relationship with his girl. The best scenes in the movie are when Ronnie and Reggie are starting mayhem or cutting deals to keep power and while I liked both Tom Hardy and Emily Browning in that subplot, it just isn't as interesting.If there's anything that almost lives up to this film's title, it's Tom Hardy's performance as Ronald and Reggie Kray. Hardy's a great actor and this project is a good showcase for his talent. Both Ronnie and Reggie have distinct characteristics and to Hardy's credit there are scenes where they play off each other remarkably well. I wasn't a big fan of Emily Browning previously, I had only seen her in Sucker Punch but she was pretty decent here. She does a good job and she and Hardy have good chemistry. Getting to the rest of cast, a lot of the supporting characters have good actors playing them but they are reduced to one note. Chris Eccleston and Chaz Palminteri are barely in the movie, the trailers are misleading that way. Chris especially feels wasted here, he's more comedic relief than anything. David Thewlis gets more to do and he does a solid job. Taron Edgerton isn't given a whole lot to do conversely, Kingsman: The Secret Service was a lot better of a showcase for him. On a side note, Paul Bettany is barely in the movie but he steals his scenes completely. He plays a rival gang leader and he's pretty crazy and funny.I think the biggest drawback to Legend is that while certain things are different, you get the typical rise and fall gangster story when it comes to the plot. Sure it's dressed up well, the cinematography is beautiful and they hired the right people to make something interesting. It just didn't end up being the equal to the sum of its parts. I thought I was going to love it and while it was still a good movie, it definitely falls short of being great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: I really enjoyed this film, mainly because of Tom's superb performance but I still preferred the first Krays biopic from the Kemp brothers, for some unknown reason. Since that movie, there has been many documentaries and books on the Kray brothers, so the whole shock value about there criminal activities has become common knowledge to people around the world. The director chose to stay away from a lot of there violent episodes, which you see in the Kemp brothers version but you can still feel the intensity and fear from the people around them. The fight scene in the pub, when they took on the South London gang by themselves, really did show that they didn't fear anyone and when the American casino gangsters came to the UK to see them, they made it clear that they were not going to bend there morals for anyone. The director also added some wit to the script, which I found quite funny and the tragic love story was also very well written and performed well by Emily Browning. The cinematography was spot on and the whole look and feel of that era, was believable but you don't get to see how much of a big part there mother played in there life's. I personally think that you need a mini series or a 4 hour epic movie to cover the Krays legendary story because they done so much while they were ruling the East End. With that aside, this is still a great film which is interesting and entertaining throughout and I have to give Hardy total respect for making both characters seem completely different. Great!Round-Up: This movie was written and &nbsp;directed by Brian Helgland who brought you Payback, with Mel Gibson, A Knights Tale and the Sin Eater, with Heath Ledger and the biopic 42 with Harrison Ford. He hasn't had that much experience behind the camera but he done a brilliant job with Tom Hardy, who really seemed like he was on screen at the same time as his brother, especially during the fight scene in there club. I know that the movie is based on true events but I would have liked to have seen new material about the East End gangsters. I think that is why the Kemp brothers version had such a big impact, because of the graphic violence and the different periods that it covered. Anyway, this is definitely worth a watch and I'm surprised that Hardy didn't win any awards for his total commitment to the role.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $39millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/crime/drama movies starring Tom Hardy, Colin Morgan, Christopher Eccleston, Joshua Hill, Emily Browning, Paul Anderson and Tara Fitzgerald. 7/10</fullReview>

As I have some knowledge of The Krays and their lives and life styles I was quite pleased by how this movie was created. I have listened to the opinions of friends who were critical of this movie as they believe that it did not depict the action and violence that they expected but upon further examination this was due to my friends not being too knowledgeable about The Krays, often hearing over exaggerated stories and tales of violence and brutality. I believe they managed to make this movie as correct and precise as they possibly could of. I believe Tom Hardy was exceptional in this role playing both Ronnie and Reggie Kray. In my experience and knowledge of The Krays through reading books and autobiographies I believe that after years of seeing movies, documentaries and reconstructions of The Krays Tom Hardy nails the performance. The movie was logical, not too over dramatic and told a real life story. I also believe the casting was great with Frances Shea being depicted very well.

But in Legend he shows a new side since he plays 2 twin brothers with different personalities especially that scene when they beat the crap out of this guys. I didn't liked that they turned the film into a comedy tho sometimes especially that fight scene between the 2 brothers was kinda lame he was grabbing his brother from the balls and lift him up or throwed him bottles from a distance i mean that was so lame. But his performance and the performance of Emily Browning is what kept the movie alive for the most part and it did it good definitely a big return for him in good roles let's see if he can stay that way.

		<fullReview>This is a good solid entertaining film about real life London gangsters the Kray twins.I don't know how historically accurate it is and I don't care.Tom Hardy is exceptional as both twins, the nutty homosexual murderous one and the sensible business man gangster one. I genuinely would not have realised they were the same actor. I like the how the story is told, from the view point of Reggie's dead wife (who took her own life). It gives a very believable insight into 1960's gangland London and the rise and fall of the Krays. It has violent scenes but not overdone (which is a common error these days). The film also has some genuine humour thrown in. It's not faultless e.g. I thought a good actor like Christopher Ecclestone was rather wasted on a minor role, which didn't have any major bearing anyway. But the whole thing works, well worth a watch in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid effort and outcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the shadows of Johnny Depp's "Black Mass", there is another crime thrilled based on real characters and events from 2015: This is "Legend". It was written and directed by Academy Award winner Brian Helgeland ("L.A. Confidential") and runs for an impressive 132 minutes. Actor Tom Hardy plays twin brothers Ronald and Reggie Kray, who are very different in terms of character for the most part of the film, but actually really similar in terms of certain crucial situations. Hardy definitely did a fine job with this double role he has here and his acting, together with the film's script, result in a couple pretty great moments. This fraternal relationship is one of the core elements of the film. Others include one character's relationship with Emily Browning's character. She played her character well too and was a very positive surprise. I must say I have never been a big Tom Hardy fan, but with performances like these, he certainly elevates my interest in him. Finally, there are of course many crime-related (sometimes also police-related) developments happening in here, also interesting to watch for the most part.I liked the watch. I believe this film could have been kept down at 110 minutes maybe with cutting out the occasional moment that drags, but it's still never really bad in terms of getting bored because it is a very long film. The main characters are all fun and exciting to watch and will maybe even have your eyes glued to the screen on some occasions. The supporting actors are not all that tremendously exciting to watch, but most of them are fine too. And of course, there is still the crucial factor that this is based on real people. Ronnie's homosexuality and the way he actually dealt with it publicly in a very progressive manner made for the occasionally awkward laugh in here, together with Hardy's excellent delivery. I am not sure if this film has a performance as good as Edgerton in "Black Mass", but it's good acting all around in here and if you have seen and enjoyed that one, it's very likely that you will enjoy this film here too. 2015 is certainly a good year for films based on real-life gangsters. I recommend "Legend". Nowhere near year-best material, but delightful to watch. Thumbs up. Also for the inclusion of ""Going to the Chapel" and "Something Stupid". Some great music in here.</fullReview>

They were twins, Ronnie &amp; Reggie, and they are both portrayed by Tom and he does a fantastic job. He changes his voice and personality so that it gives the feeling of watching two different actors. Their story takes place in the 1960's in London. Tom/Reggie is the smart one and Tom/Ronnie is the paranoid schizophrenic. Tom/Reggie meets a nice girl, Emily, and gets married. Tom/Ronnie likes men and spends some time in a mental hospital. Taron plays Tom/Ronnie's main boy friend and right hand man. Chazz plays an American mobster that wants to expand the American mafia's business into Europe, using the Kray brothers' help. The story is typical gangster narrative but the performance from Tom is really good. It's rated "R" for violence, language, drug material and sexual content- no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 11 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read some of the other reviews it seems that people have been watching a different film than the one I did and some of their expectations would rather fit more into a T.V dramatization played out over several seasons perhaps.The movie for me focused on the relationship between the two brothers and that is the crux of the Krays their relationship with each other as much as people want to fantasize about them being crime lords and modern day robin hoods and everything else they did anyone who knew them really talks about the dynamic between the brothers and that is essentially what the film is about.Hardy puts in yet another convincing and solid performance as both brothers and the story flirts with what may have been and the responsibility Reggie felt for Ron. The film decides to stick with the official coroners verdict as to what happened to Reggies then wife rather than the speculation of Rons admission of murdering herMost of what happens in the film is accurate to a point and of course can only be told from the opinions of those around at the time but having read books on the Krays and various debates as to what did and didn't happen it did not spoil the drama of the film for me.The official story line says it is focusing on the relationship between Reggie Kray and Frances Shea, told from France's' point but I found the relationship between the brothers far more compelling and the narrative from France's character helped to move the story along but the relationship between her and Reggie was secondary for me but in no way lessens the film.Very much worth a watch but be warned there is 'proper' violence in this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun just for Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of this reminds me of Filth just because of its audacity and its ambition and its blend of true comedy and drama, even in moments that can also be disturbing. Just like Filth, it also doesn't come together all that well to the point that I would call it a great film, but it's definitely entertaining (more so than other films that could be considered better by many). The biggest reason that the film works is Tom Hardy, who really does an amazing job with either character and who might give some of the best acting of the year in either character, let alone having two to really dive deeply into such range. Definitely the biggest reason to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend by Name, Legend by Nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend, which was written and directed by Brian Helgeland, is the story of the Krays rise to power and ultimate fall during the 1960s. It stars Tom Hardy as both Ronnie and Reggie Kray in a remarkable double performance, although the film is told from the perspective of Reggie's young wife, Frances, who is played by Emily Browining. What's quickly and capably established from the start of Legend is the world in which the Krays dominate, but Helgeland is careful to develop the characters and personalities of two brothers who are twins, but aren't very much alike. We see the suave and pleasant Reggie, who knows the police have him under surveillance, so he brings them cups of tea. Ronnie, who isn't shy about his sexual orientation, is more unhinged. He's a paranoid schizophrenic, but Reggie wants his brother out of a mental institute and by his side as he rises from being the owner of a pool hall to running clubs and soon the entirety of London's East End. Hardy, who is a magnificent actor, does something very special with the kind of role that was once a novelty in requirement of wigs, stand-ins and characters with their backs to the camera. But here, thanks to some technical brilliance, but also superb direction and what Hardy brings to these characters, is a truly symbiotic relationship that exists fully in the frame. As Reggie, he's immaculate, charming and reserved, but certainly dangerous. But Ronnie, despite moments of clarity and amusing anecdotes, is snarling and loud, spitting as he's riled and hunched like a great bear in a suit. Through Frances, we can understand these characters and find a way into their world, which has shades of Goodfellas with the mingling in clubs and back-room dealings. It's slick, but violent and uncompromising, and doesn't court sympathy for the brothers, who do wrong and are punished. Frances, on the other hand, lacks better character development, although it's easy to join the dots, but when her own problems arise, they do so as a matter of requirement to the plot as opposed her being afforded the same arc as her husband and brother-in-law. Which is a small gripe when so much of this movie is a triumph. Thanks in no small part to Tom Hardy, who is undoubtedly one of the most interesting and fearless actors working today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watch Tom Hardy in Legend, you wont regret it....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Words cannot describe how great Tom Hardy's acting in this film is... Considering i didn't know about the Kray twins, as i was never told, i caught up literally 2 days after i saw this film and it's great! i don't know how Tom Hardy was able to play BOTH brothers but he excelled. I watched The Rise of the Kray's and don't get me wrong the guy who plays Ron, was funny because of how he freaked out plus how he wanted things his way and did a really good job with his acting but the guy who played Reggie...i didn't get the feeling he was such a tough guy. He didn't exactly intimidate people and when he was with the other guy who played Ron, he may have been able to seem in control of situations. But to be honest, i feel he didn't really portray Reggie as he should have.Tom Hardy portrayed both the brothers great, Reggie did seem strong, intimidating and a nice guy on his own. he would be able to walk anywhere and people knew who he was but playing Ron...goodness me he really did a good job. he may not have acted as crazy as the guy from Rise of The Krays, which portrayed Ron as an insane guy but he was very hilarious. WHen i watched the film in the cinema, the audience were laughing at the things he said. the guy from Rise of the Krays who played Ron, did not have any humor...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational Hardy in a Stylishly Entertaining Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.3/5 starsIdentical twin thugs Reggie and Ronnie Kray ruled London's criminal underworld in the 1960s, and depending upon who you ask, the brothers were either barking mad or quite charming. Or both. Despite their violent natures, the twins hung out with some of the most popular figures of their time, and became celebrities themselves; they owned clubs frequented by aristocrats and movie stars, and were even photographed at the height of their infamy by portraitist (and fellow east ender) David Bailey.That combination of grit and glitter in their story makes its way into "Legend", a film about the Krays that stars Tom Hardy as both Reg and Ron. Since every Londoner has a Kray tale to tell, there have been a few quibbles about the story told in "Legend", but nobody can dispute the sheer genius of Hardy's dual performance. Director Brian Helgeland finds his way into the story (which is loosely based on one of John Pearson's books) through Frances Shea (Emily Browning), Reggie Kray's wife. Frances narrates various parts of the proceedings, casting light on the brothers' criminal activities as well as on their relationship to one another."Legend" depicts Reggie as a stable criminal mastermind while Ronnie ? eventually diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with borderline psychosis, and institutionalized at Broadmoor ? is depicted as far more volatile and violent. Ron is openly gay in this version of the Kray's life story, although in real life, both brothers were thought to be bisexual and possibly incestuous. Complicated but simplified here, as are other details of their lives. And though the appropriate murders are shown and the guys are pursued by detective Nipper Reid (Christopher Eccleston) as in real life, but "Legend" seems more interested in the Krays' domestic and emotional life, such as it was, than in their criminal undertakings. The movie delivers the brothers as established adult gangsters, illustrating their move up the crime ladder via business overtures from the American mob.For such a gritty story, "Legend" turns out to be beautiful to look at, full of perfect and lustrous period detail and appealing music and costumes; all but the most violent crime moments have an odd, darkly comic element to them.It seems fair to say that "Legend" doesn't set itself up to be the definitive Kray story, but it's hellishly entertaining. And it's not short of thrills either, the biggest of which is Hardy's performance as the twin gangsters. According to the Director, the technical tricks involved in presenting one actor as a set of twins haven't changed much since Hayley Mills starred in "The Parent Trap" more than five decades ago. What's required to make it all fly are superb performances: Tom Hardy certainly scores on that front, and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Comedy Par Excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved director Brian Helgeland first movie "Payback," starring Mel Gibson and I expected I would enjoy "Legend" too. And I certainly did. Like "Payback," "Legend" is a dark comedy at heart. There are scenes here where I laughed out loud, like the one where Ronnie Kray informs his American mafia counterpart that he's gay, taking pains to describe his sexuality in some length. This was the 1960s, where gays were referred to as "faggots," and the look on the mafioso's face as he's being told all this is priceless. Then there's the scene where Ronnie Kray behaves badly with the guests at the Kray brother's night club. When Reggie gets back from his stint in prison, the only ones in the club on a Friday night are his gang members. When you're making a movie on two murderous gangsters I guess it's best you keep the treatment light and not take them too seriously. Another recent movie called Dark Mass starring Johny Depp took itself too seriously and suffered as a result. In the end end, they were stupid gangsters and there's no point getting into your knickers into a twist over whether they look glamorous on film or not. Like "Payback", "Legend" has a certain look and feel and the artwork and cinematography are excellent. Tom Hardy in a dual role is great too as are the supporting cast. Yes, it's hard to catch the dialogue sometimes, but that's not a major issue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two doses of Tom Hardy. Can't get any better than that, right? He's got the looks, brings the power, exudes fear. He is the right man for this role, and proves it just so. The Kray brothers are notorious gangsters, running the underground scene of London in the 1960's. Ronnie Kray (Hardy) is unhinged, sporadic and very open with his sexuality. Reggie Kray (Hardy) is the balanced one, collective, calm, but quick to anger. Legend covers their tremendous rise to their speedy decline. Hardy manages to portray two separate personalities without effecting the other. Ronnie is funny, Reggie is serious. Both personalities are as astounding as the other, neither outdoing the other. Legend is a gangster film at heart, putting family above all else, full of honour, intimidation and violence. Gangster fans, rejoice, Legend is amongst the best of its genre.</fullReview>

The man is a genius and is well on his way to becoming a 'Legend' in his own right. The movie is good, the performances are good, take Tom Hardy out of the equation I'd give this movie a 6.5 out of 10, but as the movie stands with Tom Hardy's phenomenal performance I give it a 10, I'd recommend you watch it if only to watch Tom Hardy's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kray twins have a fascinating story which has been told many times, but I always like to see true life stories about people like this because it is almost guaranteed to keep me interested. When I saw that Tom Hardy would be betraying both Ronnie and Reggie i was completely sold on the film and couldn't wait to see it.From the trailer what we are shown is a story that focuses on these two as individuals tearing up the streets of London, but we do get something quite different from that. Less focus was put into the empire of the notorious gangsters and what we get is more of a story that revolves around the marriage and relationship of Reggie Kray and his wife Frances. This was actually a very pleasant surprise and I loved seeing how she was coping with the empire, plus the almost love triangle between herself, Ronnie and Reggie. Having an 18 rating I expected the film to be incredibly violent and have a no- holds barred feel to it. It seems a bit weird that a film that it almost tame with its violence gets the same rating as something like A Clockwork Orange. This isn't a complaint, but it was what i expected is the point i am making. The gorgeous Emily Browning does a great job at portraying the tragic Frances and really puts us in the character's shoes to get a feel of what life would be like if your husband were a (in)famous gangster. So, in my opinion a very good move on the film-makers.The thing that arguably mattered most though was Hardy's portrayal of both twins. With a film like the Social Network where Armie Hammer portrays twins, we can see he has done a good job but it is hard to tell between the two. What Tom Hardy does best here is he gives each character a very different personality and we almost forget that we are only watching one actor. I was worried Ronnie's portrayal in particular would annoy me because Hardy puts on a thick accent and looked as if he would play it too over the top. He doesn't and actually managed to make the character very threatening as well as hilarious. I couldn't imagine another actor being able to pull off what he did here and if I had my way Hardy would be nominated for an Oscar just for going from the smooth almost likable Reggie to nutcase Ronnie in seconds. Also, there is an incredible fight scene in a pub where the twins are battering each other.. it is literally Tom Hardy fighting himself. Think Fight Club, but actually real.All in all, Legend was a very good film and a great look into the lives of these characters. Tom Hardy gives us one of 2015's best performances and whilst we don't see much really of the empire these men built, what we did get to see was something refreshing and new. Was glad to see Taron Egerton get a role in this film too, the guy needs to be in more after his performance in Kingsman. Legend had a very Clockwork Orange type suspension vibe to it and i dug that. I recommend this film purely to see Tom Hardy absolutely kill it in the dual role and there is a lot more to like about the film where that came from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film but not what I and others were expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hardy is his usual brilliant self in his portrayal of the Krays, especially that of Ronnie and his paranoid take on life. However, the trailer and the plot line for the film are very misleading. This is not a story about the notorious Kray twins and how they rose to the high ranks of criminals and 'ruled London' so to speak but more about Reggie and Frances Shea and the short time they spent together. My mistake was probably that I didn't read the book beforehand so if you have, you will get exactly what you are expecting. But, if like me, you are someone who loves the psychology behind criminal minds and are expecting a bigger, deeper insight into the minds and worlds of the Krays, you will be disappointed.That being said, the acting was superb. Hardy, as usual, got it spot on. He managed to separate the two roles and shone, more so as Ronnie Kray. Bravo for that. A mention for Taron Egerton too who really did himself proud as Mad Teddy, he was hilarious throughout his role and Emily Browning was especially beautiful as Frances Shea.Overall, a very watchable film but maybe next time Brian should not mislead his audience. To quote Ronnie in the film, 'I wanted a shoot out, like a Western'...but it just didn't quite deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does a reasonable job exploring the relationship between the Krays, but there are misses along the way and when the film is entertaining it's often for all the wrong reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend for me was quite a strange film as it initially seemed to take a fairly serious approach to its subject matter (as indeed it should given the fact it's about two of the most infamous and notorious gangsters in England). However, the writers seem to switch tones wildly throughout the film and it sometimes made me wonder what kind of film that I was watching - I'm not even entirely convinced that the writers knew what film they were making here. The general narrative focuses on the troublesome and sometimes volatile relationship between the two brothers, but far too often it seemed to resort to slapstick and farce; examples of this are the fight sequences - the first one in the pub looked like something out of a bad western and the fight between the Kray Twins in their club was more silly than brutal. Whilst these sequences were quite entertaining (I'd be lying if I said that I didn't laugh), this film is about two violent gangsters and giving some of these sequences a farcical slapstick approach ultimately cheapened the film slightly and at times made the film feel like it was a parody/joke rather than the brutal picture that it should have been.There are other problems here such as Ronnie Kray and his homosexuality; again the fact that this aspect seemed to be played more as a joke and was hardly treated in a subtle manner once again cheapened the film and made it painful to watch at times (the scene with Ronnie Kray in his apartment perhaps demonstrates this point). I liked the idea that Ronnie's psychological problems are explored here, but didn't like the way that they were explored (again it all seemed to be played for laughs which doesn't sit well with the tone of the film). Whilst I'm prepared to commend the picture for offering an in-depth examination of the two brothers, this is sadly done at the expense of other more interesting aspects of their lives - such as the rivalry between the Richardsons. Whilst the exploration between the twins is quite interesting, the writers should have focused a bit more on other areas just to try and break the film up a bit - that way it probably wouldn't have felt quite as monotonous. Sadly because it mostly focuses on one thing it did make the film feel a little dull at times and as a result it drags quite often. The writers also do themselves no favours by offering a very disjointed narrative that was all over the place meaning that it had no real flow to it and as a result of the poor narrative it is a film that is very easy to lose interest in.Aside from an initially interesting exploration between the Krays, the only other selling point for this film is Tom Hardy who it has to be said was magnificent. It's a good showcase for his talents and I can see him having a long career in the film industry, but sadly the script badly lets him down and doesn't do justice to his superb performance. Whilst it's not a total washout, it's a film that misses far more than it hits and as a whole it's a relatively unsatisfying experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie rant! Legend This is the first time I have ever written a review for a film but unfortunately it's only because I have nothing but hate for this film and the fact I wasted up to ?30 on tickets and bottles of water....which I needed to help me swallow down the pile of excrement that was being fed to me. Legend! Unlike the last film I watched by the same name. This film had nothing like the previous. No charismatic characters, no dialogue worth listening to, no musical score to Inspire me, no worthy acting to talk about. This film just dragged its feet from start to finish for what seemed like the length of all the Lord of the rings played back to back. A gangster movie? Really? It had gangster's in this film and talked about gangster's A LOT But it was more of a love triangle. But the kind of triangle you just don't give a toss about. Two people fighting for the love and attention of the none-retarded Tom Hardy/Reggie in a nice suit. One being his wife to be (kill yourself already) and his twin brother (never knew Ronnie Kray was an absolute retard). At times this film made me laugh it was just so ridiculous. Toms portrait of Ronnie was hilarious. And if peaked when I watched him eating cake. It was like a spitting image imitation of Ronnie Kray. So to sum it up I just wasted two hours of my life and I want them back. Legend I hate you, I hate you HARD! 2/10 says **The_beauman**</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film sells itself as some kind of gangster flick, which maybe true too all intents and purposes but the delivery in the final product is somewhat lacking. While many reviews state Tom Hardy is fantastic which I don't disagree with he is let down by a lack of story, coherence and a narrator that ends up dying through the film before it even ends. Undoubtedly confusing for the audience there was no chemistry between him and his love interest and the actress playing his wife/girlfriend her emotions rarely changed from scene to scene which made you care even less about what went on. I can't imagine why she was even cast her performance was similar to her narration ghostly.Because this is a British film as always the press (UK) will be raving about it putting all their bias etc telling you how great it is. However in the words of a cockney villain "your havin a laugh", this film is slow boring and apart from its psychopathic scenes of violence which you will not enjoy, I would rather watch paint dry. Like Carry on Films, Wine and Premier League football players this film will not travel well and hardly set the globe alight. Don't believe in the hype and more importantly don't waste your money there is a wall that needs drying and is a far more interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the plot of this crime-drama moves in a somewhat haphazard fashion, sort of meandering through a lengthy timeline, the one thing that can be taken away from this film is the brilliant performance of Tom Hardy. Legend tells the story of two twin brothers. One, Reggie, the brains and sensibility behind their gangster operation and the other, Ronnie, a loose cannon with a penchant for violence. As the film goes on through the lives and encounters of the gangster family we slowly see Reggie become more and more like his firecracker of a brother and slowly descend into a madness brought forth by his own personal demons. While the plot appears to be somewhat dragged on, it does have its peaks and valleys in terms of the viewer's interest. All around a soundly mediocre film that is only held together by the entertaining and dynamic performance of Tom Hardy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bloodthirsty, cruel, illogical, paranoid and funny is this biopic of Ronnie and Reggie Kray (Tom Hardy), identical twins that had a brief flamboyant run at ruling London's underworld in the 1960's. Writer-Director Brian Helgeland takes it fast and loose in this highly interesting story of the gangster twins, who fell just a little short of becoming respectable businessmen. The brothers had totally different personalities and handled business in almost polar opposite different manners. They were night-club and casino co-owners in London's East End and practically ruled the city as they rubbed elbows with politicians, singers and beautiful starlets. They actually turned themselves into characters bigger than life. They frustrated authorities while terrifying the public before their inevitable downfall. The Kay's empire slowly collapsed while their exploits became Legendary! Very strong and graphic violence is accompanied with a fantastic soundtrack featuring: Booker T. &amp; the M.G.s, The Meters, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Herman's Hermits, Major Johnson Finley, Ramsey Lewis Trio and Duffy.Mr. Hardy is masterful in the dual role. Other players include: Paul Anderson, Emily Browning, Christopher Eccleston, Adam Fogerty, Joshua Hill, Nicholas Ferrell, Stephen Bender, Mel Raido and Colin Morgan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double the Tom Hardy doesn't quite make it double the fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie should be able to stand on its own, independent of whatever source material or basis in historical fact it has. Keeping that in mind, I'm not terribly concerned with LEGEND's historical accuracy. More importantly, does it efficiently tell an interesting story? I'm a bit mixed on that element, but there is no denying that, however gimmicky the decision was, Tom Hardy killed it in his double role as Reggie and Ronnie Kray, gangsters from London's East End. No matter what flaws the film has, and there are more than a few, LEGEND is worth at least one viewing for Tom Hardy alone, who seems to choose projects where he can shine as an actor, regardless of whether the material deserves it, or his supporting cast is given much to do. I thought he did a great job differentiating the two performances, although the actor's bag of tricks was more obvious with his choices for Ronnie (fake teeth, glasses, accent, etc.). The next most engaging character was Emily Browning as Frances Shea, Reggie's wife, who also serves as the film's omniscient narrator. What initially seems like an oddball choice actually makes sense later on, although divulging why would be a spoiler (for those unfamiliar with the history, which I was). The film also has gorgeous cinematography, immaculate production design, and a well-chosen soundtrack full of 1960's pop tunes. It's these last few things, outside of the gangster genre, tie it to something to which it never quite lives up, i.e., Martin Scorsese's own forays into gangster pictures. One would have to be completely ignorant of cinema to miss parallels between LEGEND, and Scorsese's GOODFELLAS and CASINO. Director Brian Helgeland clearly shows affection for those films, but nothing he does here rises above the level of simple homage or, in a few cases, outright theft. Just to provide a few examples, Reggie and Ronnie's relationship has shades of key relationships in GOODFELLAS and CASINO, and Ronnie at times seems like a riff on Joe Pesci's character from those films (with homosexuality thrown in for good measure). There's also a wedding scene set to the Dixie Cups' "Chapel of Love" and a scene late in the film which is kind of like the "Get your shinebox!" scene in GOODFELLAS. Again, there's nothing inherently wrong with lifting elements or paying homage to previous films, which is something that happens all of the time. For it to work, there needs to be some fresh perspective or take on it, and I don't think that Helgeland ever does that. Outside of the Krays' contentious relationship with each other, there was no unifying theme to drive forward what was a rather unfocused narrative, often feeling like a collection of scenes instead of a coherent story. In short, it was like a jewel-encrusted plastic crown. There's also the issue of the title, which I don't think it earned. Nothing in the film would suggest that the Krays were "legends," and merely asserting it as fact was insufficient. All of this being said, there definitely is an audience for this film and I have a feeling like they (including myself) will want to see it at least once. It doesn't compare favorably to its cinematic forebears, but there is enough good in it to make a loose recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy Shines in a Double Role, despite Flaws,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend is a good movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a great cast. The highlight of the movie is without a doubt Tom Hardy, shining as two characters, Reggie and Ronnie, two real life gangsters, better know as the Kray twins, it is clear that he put a lot of work in to these characters and delivers two very different performances. The story is slow moving, the trailer made it look like a fast paced, fun crime film, but the pace is quite tedious, however, it is not very serious either, not sure whether it wanted to be a comedy or drama, and in the end feels a bit bland because of that. Frances was one of the biggest flaws, though Emily Browning does her best, the character is poorly written, her narration makes her appear troubled, although her real life self is abundantly normal, it's as if they are two different characters, we are never introduced to the Frances we see in person until the very end. The film does boost some enjoyable fight scene and excellent dialogue, particularly from Hardy and Chazz Palminteri. It certainly has its flaws, but Legend is a fun ride and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film, just do not bother going out of your way to see it. A pair of gangster twins, Ronnie and Reggie Kray, work together in order to rule London. Best Performance: Tom Hardy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hardy is it's saving grace, perfectly dual acting in the roles of the very different twin brothers. He's conflicted as Ronnie and charming as Reggie. Helgeland might be known for building suspense but the two-hour wait for something climactic turns this movie into a ramble of thick East End accents and too many "unfinished" plot lines. We get Reggie's wife, Frances (Emily Browning), pushing him to drop the gangster act, the drama of Ronnie Kray being gay, as well as the twins fighting to rule the London underworld while struggling to run multiple booze- filled nightclubs?it all offers some vibrant action, like when Reggie stabs a gangster repeatedly with a butter knife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legend is a very entertaining movie with a lot of funny quotes and strong scenes. Even that it's a biography movie he contain a very sweet romance that to me is the most beautiful and touching part of the story. The powerful fights between the brothers are an other piece of art in this movie, knowing that Hardy plays both brothers with an amassing talent, makes the movie more interesting and desirable to watch. I have seen all three Hardys movies of 2015 and even that he is nominated for Oscar in his performance in The Revenant, I think that this performance is better.The cinematography is very good, the soundtrack is good to. What I dislike in the movie it's the way it ended, now I know that this is a biography but I wanted a happy ending for this movie. I really enjoyed watching the movie I think that this is one of the best movies of 2015 and one of Hardys best of all times. So go and watch it if you haven't already I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine Biopic Notable Mostly for Hardy's Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The notorious gangsters of Sixties London, Ronnie and Reggie Kray, have proved a popular subject in the movies, most notably in Peter Medak's film of 1990 when the parts were played by the Kemp twins.This updated version contains a remarkable tour de force by Tom Hardy who plays both twins and manages to establish a clear personality difference between the two. Ronnie Kray is a homosexual with clear personality disorders; always overshadowed by his brother, he becomes pathological when Reggie is put away in prison. He is also the more vulnerable of the two, with a close attachment to his mother (Jane Wood). Reggie is a smooth operator with a violent streak, which he tries to cover up. Falling in love with Frances Shea (Emily Browning), he vows to give up the criminal existence for good, but we know that will never happen.Told from Frances's perspective, Brian Helgeland's film portrays the evil attractiveness of the gangster's life; the ability to exercise power and dominate others through intimidation. We understand why the Krays were so mythologized in the Sixties, as they hob-nobbed with the great and the good while keeping tight control of their 'manor' in London's East End.Yet whether the film has more to say about the twins than we already know is debatable. The Sixties atmosphere has been competently re- created, even though Soho tends to look like a reject from Julien Temple's ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS (1986). The script has more than its share of plot-clichés, especially the twins' love of their mother, and the dogged cop Nipper Read (Christopher Eccleston) who pursues the Krays in a far too shiny-looking Ford Prefect without actually getting anywhere near them.Some of the supporting performances are overtly camp, to say the least. John Sessions's Lord Boothby has distinct echoes of an aging Quentin Crisp, while Kevin McNally's Harold Wilson has little of the down-to-earth pragmatism of the former Prime Minister.The film has a certain macabre attraction, but not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legend is every gangster movie ever. If you like gangster movies you'll probably like it and I did like it.The best thing in it is Tom Hardy playing 2 roles. I like him more after every movie he's in because he shows that he can act very well and he does every role thrown at him. Weather it's a villain in Star Trek Nemesis, a villain in Batman, the protagonist in Mad Max, or whatever other roles he does, he can do it.In this movie he plays Reggie Kray who is the lead gangster of their organization and is an overall likable guy that also is the womanizer. He really did a great performance in this movie as just Reggie alone. However he also plays the twin brother called Ron Kray who is a paranoid schizophrenic who is gay and just completely crazy. His portrayal of this character is also great and funny as hell. Almost everything he does made me laugh so that was really nice.Also the humor is very good, the movie had a lot of funny moments and I laughed a lot while seeing it. Just watch the movie to see why.This movie does have flaws, I was actually annoyed by some parts or some things in general that hurt the movie in my opinion. Like I said, the movie is nothing new to gangster movies so if you want something new to it, don't watch it.What I also found very weird in a bad way is the pacing and tone of the movie. The pacing sometimes speeds up or slows down and it can be hard to follow what is happening. Also the tone of the movie switches drastically some times what felt off putting. The movie makes me think it's funny and somewhat lighthearted, even when there is action. But then sometimes they go really dark and serious that I don't feel was done well.So that's basically all I can say about Legend, I enjoyed the movie mainly because of Tom Hardy performing amazing and there was a lot of humor. 7/10 is what I honestly think because of the good and bad things in it and I hope you find my review useful.</fullReview>

Thank you for this movie. Brian Helgeland - is king, and Tom Hardy is a God. The two persons played by one actor, different mentally and appears physically, the two brothers, were so prominent from one another ... After the Bane incarnation, Hardy become one of my favorite actors of this decade, but playing this kind of role, becoming two completely different persons, was a shocker to me.

		<fullReview>The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.There are two good reasons to make what might otherwise seems an inessential new biopic of Ronnie and Reggie Kray - and both of them, as it happens, take the formidable form of Tom Hardy. In fact, as a performance showcase Legend is sensational; Hardy is astonishing. To this dual role, Tom Hardy brings physical, intellectual and emotional commitment. His inspired twin turn elevates and complicates the otherwise straightforward terrain of the film. In my opinion, these roles are prestigious awards vehicle. His Reggie is suave: a charismatically volatile antihero calculated to inspire perverse admiration among younger male and his playfully eccentric inhabitation of the gay, mentally unstable Ronnie would, on its own, balanced the extravagance of the era. Moreover, it's an unexpected way into the film's story, narrated by Frances (Reggie's love interest and future wife) starring Emily Browning, her point of view takes on an unconvincing omniscience, in assuming equal narrative authority on their domestic and professional lives. The formerly institutionalised Ronnie is the film's most fascinating, conflicted figure and the one whose interior life most eludes Frances narration. His romantic relationship with young lackey Teddy Smith - a poignant, under used Taron Egerton - is played in tender fashion. However, the film is less satisfying on deep psychological profile: for all Hardy's expressive detail and physical creativity; incident-packed script offers little insight into what made either of these contrasting psychopaths tick, or finally explode. Director Brian Helgeland has fashioned the Kray's rearing of London's underworld from Whitechapel to Soho perfectly. But by doing so, turning the period into a playground it softens the horror of what really happened and the tyranny of the Krays becomes diminished. Overall, this film takes on a fascinating period of time and leaves us sorely uninformed, as if we've skim-read a pamphlet. There's not enough within Legend to elevate it from other British crime films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hardy excels as the leading roles, in this biopic of the notorious twins. In previous carnations there's been a cheeky warmth, a rose tinted view of their lives, their friends, family &amp; antics. This isn't the case with Legend, in fact it's probably gone a little too far the other way. The all too brief scenes with Violet Kray (Jane Wood) we certainly don't feel much love for or get much insight into her life, other than she makes cakes! We don't really hear much from the twins father, &amp; the older brother doesn't exist! This is a colder look at the Krays life.They were murdering gangsters after all, &amp; that's how it's portrayed. If you came for jellied eels &amp; the days when front doors cold apparently just be left open, you've come to the wrong film. Although if doors are your thing, there's rather a lot of modern double glazed doors &amp; windows to be seen in the blocks of flats. This is a superb performance by Tom Hardy &amp; a good supporting cast,it doesn't feel slow, and its the most accurate portrayal of the twin to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally different from the previous Krays biopic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this movie is excellent and Tom Hardy outstanding. Would could deny this? But this film is more a drama than a gangster movie. And the main difference with the Peter Medak's feature, made in 1990, is that in this film from 2015, you don't see the Kray's childhood and the relation with their mother is not so strongly shown. Maybe the most important part of the film. In the 1990 movie, the relationship between the twins and the mom was so poignant, more than with another classical love story. The two movies are quite different for the same story. In the old film, you watch many more things about the twin brother genesis than in the Brian Helgeland's piece of work. But, again, that doesn't remove any of its quality. The original, as far as there was no film about the twin mobsters made before 1990, is more a gangster film than this one from 2015. In the elder film, you see the real rise and fall of the Krays, and not only their state of grace before their fall. Actually, the Helgeland's film is more in the Hollywood style, in the biopic wave as were some Marty Scorcese's movies, with the vintage music score all long the film and the off voice of the Krays' mistress. In the 1990 film, Ron Kray's homosexuality is clearly shown, far more than in the new one. In the Peter Medak's movie, the story emphasizes on sub characters, such as the old lady friends or relatives of the Kray's mother, for instance their aunt Rose and her war souvenirs. The two films have something in common, although. They perfectly show the brutality and sadism of those gangsters from East Side of London. The best would be to see both films. And I found out that there was a British mini series about the twins, made last year. I have not seen it yet, but it sounds corny. Anyway, I will try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Won't exactly go down as a legendary film . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie centering on the Kray brothers, Brian Helgeland's Legend is a menial and virtually bloodless snore. If the know that story of the brothers then you know that this is a colossal miscalculation. A story about The Kray brothers without excessive violence is like a Superman movie in which he doesn't fly. If you know something about the brothers then you'll come away merely disappointed; if you don't then you'll come away bored and indifference.The Kray brothers, Ronald and Reginald were gangsters who ruled the London crime scene from the late 50s until their imprisonment in 1968. They were legends in their own time; brothers whose penchant for bloody violence was so much in the public consciousness that they would become a parody sketch on "Monty Python's Flying Circus" called The Piranha Brothers. Later they were the subject of a much better movie by director Peter Medak called The Krays which embraces the boy's ultra violence in a way that this movie never does.Ronald and Reggie would change the face of gangland crime. Before the Krays, a gangster might shoot you dead or at the very least beat you up, but the Krays elevated gang violence to a level that could only be described as 'savage'. Yet, they didn't live the lives of thugs. They might destroy their rivals in a bar with swords and brass knuckles but later they would turn up at a posh nightclub looking immaculately dressed, like members of The Rat Pack. They became a problem for the police and an industry for the tabloids.None of the exploits that made the boys famous are anywhere near the new movie Legend. The movie never really gives us a reason why the boys became so famous. Their world is said to have been plagued by violence and bloodshed but it's absent from the movie.The story is told in narration, for no real reason, by Frances Shea (Emily Browning) who would become Reggie's wife. The twin brothers (both played by Tom Hardy) are interesting and couldn't be more different in terms of their personalities. Reggie is a cool-headed, dapper fellow who takes care of his business with words or, failing that, with a knife. Ronnie is the more Neanderthal of the two, slumped over and grumble voiced he lives in a filthy trailer in the middle of nowhere and is surprisingly open about his homosexuality.The best part of the movie are the two performances by Tom Hardy. In any movie where an actor plays twins you always ask yourself if you believe that they are two separate individuals, and in this Hardy succeeds. The two performances are so different and blend so well that we forget we're watching the same actor. Yet, much like Jeremy Irons in David Cronenberg's Dead Ringers, we admire the twin performances despite the fact that we can't stand the movie.The storytelling here is messy, to say the least. There are ideas started but never finished, plots that get going but then stop. A subplot involving the boy's offer to go into business with some American gangsters goes nowhere. We're told things about the boys that should play more interesting than they do, like the Kray's rivalry with The Robinson Brothers. That story exists around the edges of the movie but it never takes focus. Like a lot of this story it is brought up but then abandoned.Even the violence seems muted. There is a moment when the boys enter a pub and find it populated by a group of rival gangsters. We see that Reggie is sporting brass knuckles and Ronnie is packing a pair of hammers. Yeah, there's violence, but the scene never builds to anything. There's a fight, but there's no real punch to the scene.It is clear that Helgeland's intention was to build Legend with the kind of posh 60s energy of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, but that film was energetic and, despite the bloodshed, kind of fun. This movie never gets going and we feel that we're watching a lot of people sitting in chairs smoking and talking. When you know about how violent The Krays were, it makes you sad to watch a movie that never seems to understand why they became so infamous. Ultra violence was the Krays port of call, but this movie just seems to drift around.</fullReview>

A lot of questions were left unanswered and the movie as a whole feels like it is missing something.A lot of the humour wasn't necessary or appropriate, in fact I thought it somewhat tainted the movie and the story it was supposed to be telling. The violence is minimal - surprising for a gangster movie but not necessarily a bad thing, though I personally would have liked a bit more action.All in all, 'Legend' is a decent enough film and Tom Hardy is convincing as the Krays, but I was largely underwhelmed. There is nothing special about this movie and I will probably soon forget about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's funny how some people make their way into some careers without having the minimum requirements for it. Tom Hardy for example, he's been around for some time already but I'm still appalled by the fact that he isn't working on his speech. It's really hard to understand what he says. How can you have someone lacking such basic skill for actors star as a leading role in a movie?So, the movie is nothing you haven't seen before, but this one is slow and uninspired. The story is not engaging, the acting is very stereotypical and Hardy playing two roles didn't go well, specially since one of his roles sounds like Bane from Batman. Add to that the attempts of making the double acting more believable which ended up putting into more evidence the montage, and it's easy to realize there is nothing to see here. Summing up; It's a movie where people are smoking all the time with some violence between cigarettes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to ask... is it to hard to make a great Gangster movie? After Black Mass, this is the second movie in 2015 which has the same problems. Good lead character but a bad Story telling. I mean, they don't have to invent a new genre. There are enough examples how it's done right.I have to say, that without Tom Hardy this movie would be bad. Tom Hardy played so well that at some point I forgot that the Klay brothers were played by one actor. Big respect for that performance. I very disliked the way the story was told. It is more a love romance than a real Gangster story. Watching it, you never get deep in the business, or the fight to the top of London. I think it would be better to let the neglecting of his wife play in the background of the story, so that the suicide hits ever harder in the end and pulls the character and the viewer out of the plot. Have some creativity. To tell the story from the view of the wife is not the best idea... that's what I think. Without Tom Hardy the movie has not much to give. The story is lame, the camera work is good but has nothing special and the overall look is just OK. In the end the movie is not what the trailer shows us. I wanted to see more straight gangster business. But the trailer had most of the good scenes in it. So what is the movie about!?!? It is a Love Story after all. BUT... Tom Hardy is so fu**ing awesome that maybe I will watch it again. Tom Hardy is one of the best!! Hope he chooses better movies infuture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Legend" is the latest take of the story of the infamous Kray Twins, Reggie and Ron. These two rose to fame in London during the 60s through robbing, looting, and gambling. Tom Hardy does a remarkable job in playing both title roles. However, that is just about all this latest movie has going for it. This is another movie where the British accents are so heavy, I feel you need subtitles. It took me a good 20 minutes to finally get into the movie where I could understand what was being said. The director does an odd thing here in having Reggie's girlfriend, Frances Shea, narrate the story. She loves Reggie; she hates Ron. The reasons for her hating the other brother are easily seen. Ron was not only mentally ill, but he was a savage. There was no such thing as "too much violence" to please him. Reggie finally marries Frances, but the marriage dissolves into rubble because Reggie's family does not approve, and Reggie turns out to be just as big an ass as his brother.The 1990 movie entitled "The Krays" is a much better film. That movie focused on the gangster aspect, where "Legend" bores its audience to death with a hackneyed love story. The director (and all others involved) should have made their minds up early on as to what they wanted to do because their "mixture" did not do anything but bore me to tears. Rated "R" for violence, drug use, sexual situations, and language, "Legend" is just not that entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legend sums up what the audience only cares about this movie: it has Tom Hardy playing two different roles. People would come here only for the sake of intrigue how this already acclaimed actor pull off more than one character and offers nothing beyond that expectation, which is a shame, because there are many interesting directions this movie could go through. Instead, we get some familiar elements from this genre, which isn't quite interesting by its approach. I feel like the filmmakers solely care about showcasing what Tom Hardy could do, but we already learned that in his past films. Legend just suffer for its lack on flourishing its own personality.The movie follows through a totally needless voice-over narration from lead character's love interest and we explore this rather quirky world. Despite of its seemingly colorful atmosphere, the movie doesn't quite let these details shine as it keeps shifting to the next totally different subplot. We see some sort of playfulness at some of its action scenes, it mostly takes a gag out of its villains and torture scenes. As a biopic, the movie mostly treats its story with a somehow comedic flavor, right until the third act where stakes get serious. There's at least three or more conflicts for these characters to deal with. But the main problem is the lack of exact focus, the film just tries to squeeze these events into a rather incoherent plot. And of course, the voice- over narration doesn't really help anything.If there's anything to like here then that's obviously the performance of Tom Hardy as the twins. As Reggie, he brings on the charm, while also trying to give a convincingly dark complexity behind this supposedly likable man. As Ronnie, he's delightful. Although he is mostly treated as a joke, he brings a hint of earnestness behind this mad laughing stock. There's also worthy and even comedic moments with David Thewlis. The filmmaking does bring some appealing flavor; a fancy soundtrack, some snazzy production, it all looks good and fits fabulously for its setting. Maybe not that rich in detail, but it all looks nice.Legend doesn't quite bring much novelty as a gangster film. It's like some Guy Ritchie inspired film, minus the energy. The enthusiasm only lies within its star and while Hardy carries it magnificently, the movie just gets dragging. It tries to be quirky, but it's underdeveloped to what it's trying to be. When it tries to be dark, it's too overshadowed by quirkiness. Maybe the plot would work better if it's mostly centered on how Ronnie is in control since that's the most entertaining side of the film, while it does that, it still detours to subplots, longer and longer like it's also taking over the story. Biopics are tough, but this didn't make enough inspired ways to subdue its heavy-handedness, therefore it's nothing special, besides of Tom Hardy's talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two very good reasons to see and appreciate 'Legend' and they are both Tom Hardy. His dual performances as the Kray twins is nothing short of sensational and he is magnetic in both roles. Aided by some seamless camera trickery he often appears as both brothers in the same frame. Unlike Director Peter Medak's 'The Krays', which came out in the early 90's, this film concentrates first and foremost on the brothers themselves rather than building the story around their mother Violet. Here this is well and truly Hardy's show and Violet is relegated to a very minor role in the story. Even the fine supporting cast are generally over shadowed by Hardy's tour de force performance although Emily Browning, as Ronnie Kray's mentally unstable wife Frances, impresses by effectively communicating her character's fragility via understatement. She also serves as the movie's narrator. The film looks great with outstanding production design depicting the East End of London during the 60's. Many hits of the period pep up the soundtrack sharing musical duties with a surprisingly melodic original score. Only the sound seems a tad off in the early stages, but this probably has more to do with the cockney accents of its cast rather than bad mixing by the sound department. As if to confirm this, after about half an hour one's ears begin to attune to the dialect being spouted. There in after one is able to totally surrender to the film's vice like grip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****May contain strong spoilers****Sophistication. Crime. Insanity. Money. Brutality. True story.As the story goes on, I am hooked. The story and the movie has a great start out and many laughs upon the twins of Kray, Ronald and Reginald. The longer the picture rolls out, some things begins to fade and the interest does the same, sadly. I have to agree with other reviews that come with their perspective of a brilliant Tom Hardy and a "so-so movie". The first 35-45 minutes is just a heavenly entertaining chunk of movie, with it's pure and dry British humour and a brotherly love.The production is solid; all in for that one.What happens in the late of the movie is the great sad story behind the brothers. Maybe it's there where the movie loses some of its touch. Starts out as a interesting crime story with lots of interesting happenings... just to spiral down the staircase many steps to the lies, anger and sadness.With that said...maybe the film is great, after all...all in all. Maybe it's the true story that is hard(y) to comprehend.Thumbs up for good actors and good directing...and Tom Hardy makes one of his best performances, against and with himself.7,1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardy is the best thing about Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Krays have become almost legendary in British folklore despite the fact that they were basically just a couple of thugs that ruled by fear. Legend just adds to the glamorisation of the brothers and glamorous is what this film is. Tom Hardy is absolutely brilliant as he plays both the Krays . Ronnie always wearing the glasses . The film follows just a small but significant period of their reign of terror and if you are familiar with their story you won't learn anything new . This looks fantastic. The director has got the 1960's period down to a tee and there is no doubting that this a very entertaining film but i could have done without the narration and it probably would benefit from having 20 minutes shaved off of the running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Legend": There is a difference when I say I didn't like a movie and when I'm disappointed in a movie. Sometimes they can go hand in hand, in terms of this film though I can't say that I didn't like it but I am disappointed. I expected more coming from this after seeing the trailers, knowing the talents behind the director and the lead actor as well. I've liked past scripts by Brian Helgeland such as "L.A. Confidential", "Payback", and "Mystic River". And Tom Hardy, I love Hardy. He's become one of my favorite actors from the last several years now. Even in films that I don't much care for, he still turns a great performance. As he certainly does here, carrying this film almost entirely by himself in two very diverse roles. Everyone does a good job and there are even a couple of other standouts in the crowd here, but my problem with this movie is that it has no concrete focus. Yes it does consistently follow the Kray twins, both played by Hardy, but it has no focus or structure for me to hang on to for the whole two hour runtime. I like these characters; for the most part anyhow, they are colorful and fun to watch. But for two hours there's no main story going on, only a number of side plots among the twins doing gangster stuff. Not much more to it, not to say that makes it a bad film, but after a while I didn't know what the real point of the movie was. If someone were to ask me what this movie was about, I'd say "It's about the Kray twins who were gangsters in London during the 1960s". Okay, what happens in it? "Do you have two hours to spare?" Things are constantly happening, never staying on a single subject for long. It starts with Reggie (the sane twin) getting his brother, Ronnie (the insane twin), out of a mental institute. Then it moves on to them taking out one competing mob. At the same time, Reggie is goes on to date a girl named Frances (Emily Browning). The twins take over a new club and start an alliance with an American mob that doesn't ever come into play. Then Reggie gets put into jail and then comes out to marry Frances, after proposing to her he comes back to his club to discover that Ronnie has driven it into the ground whilst away. They briefly have a disagreement that results in a fist fight and Frances walking away, not for long since in a quick cut they're back together. Then it goes on from there, an hour in, with several mini-plots about the twins doing gangster things, fighting between each other, a court case that's quickly dismissed, Ronnie being a lunatic and running the empire into the ground, Frances and Reggie growing apart, there's a few deaths, a funeral, a wedding, the whole shebang. There was one point towards the end of the film though where the easiest character to route for, Reggie, becomes a lot harder to sympathize with. If you see it then I think you'll understand what I mean, but I'm not going to spoil it here. Will I say that this was a really good movie? No, it is very flawed but as something to entertain with a couple of great performances by one actor alone this definitely gets the job done. Tom Hardy was terrific in the film and without him this wouldn't have been nearly as watchable as it was. Watchability isn't my problem though; I believe that the writing does a disservice to his performances though. I know that this was based on a true story, but if this film had focused on one singular story then I think this could have been one of the better films of this year. As it is, it's fine. It annoys me when something has a lot of potential just to turn out to be a lesser product is all. If you want a truly great gangster movie with a solid performance from this year, see "Black Mass". Johnny Depp will stare daggers into your soul as he strangles out a hooker and it is fantastic. But if you love Tom Hardy then this won't be bad either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend drifts away to a mediocre love territory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Love is a witness." Tom Hardy's "the double project" Legend rams into the average door. So what takes it down the gnawing jaws of mediocrity? The plot! Yes the plot! Wish they had thought it through before helming it.The drama isn't engaging at all. There is a constant upbeat score that keeps going in the background that makes sure of it. You almost know you are in for some humour and constant light-hearted melodrama. So things work until you see some serious business going on.The biopic had a lot of potential if the story building was given a proper look-see. But unfortunately the direction takes a weird sluggish pit stop as it proceeds with the Frances-Reggie sub-plot to bring the tale to fruition. A lot of real facts in the Kray dictionary go down the toilet as John Pearson's story tries to concentrate more on Frances and Reggie than the twin story itself.Screenplay is good at times, however not enough to drop the anvil. You also wish the direction to be a little more engaging. You feel this sudden need for more humour, more drama and more colours into the "not so kray-onic" world of gangsters. When the movie gets over, you instantly feel the void all the aforementioned absent elements leave you with.The only reason you should watch this movie for is Tom Hardy. Watch him turn into something else yet again. This time he gets to play two of 'em in a single flick. Both his personalities are very different from each other. He wears two different voices (one's a monotone where he chews on his words mostly) quite gorgeously. You will marvel at his walk, the way he talks and reacts to a situation. It is both ballsy and reckless at the same time.PROBABLE SPOILERS: In the movie Legend, the chemistry between Frances and Reggie was terribly missing. Wished Tom Hardy's Reggie to be a more feeling kind. His acting at other junctures is simply outstanding though. Like when we get a glimpse of his rad provoked anger at a bad-ass moment when he stabs the hell out of Jack McVitie. It was probably the most memorable thing in the entire movie. That and the fight between the twins which was quite hilarious and emotional at the same time.Go watch Legend if you wish to have a little glimpse into the history of the Krays and the London mafia scene back then. That and if you are a Hardy boy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, there is a Legend here - his name is Tom Hardy pt 1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brian Helgeland titled this film "Legend" based on the sheer wealth of myths and fables surrounding the infamous East End gangster twins. That treasure trove enables even more artistic license than film makers are typically allowed, but the result here is a shallow mining that bypasses the documented, the verifiable, the "true". Unfortunately, many of the director's Kray scenarios, although beautifully photographed by Dick Pope, are pale vignettes compared to the fantastical reality of the brothers. An example is the early scene depicting Ron Kray's release from Long Grove psychiatric hospital as a strong-arming of a shrink caper, when Ron's "escape" was really so much more exciting: he blithely switched clothes and places with his brother Reggie and walked away. (Reggie could not be held as he showed his drivers license as identity). Seeing that played out, an audience would have a much better sense of the twins' near telepathic abilities, and the deviousness of their ingenuity. Again and again in Legend, Helgeland romances myths when truths explain so much better who the brothers were, and how they rolled. "Knowing what happened" should always be open to interpretation, but not at the expense of less interesting story telling. This scripting failure is a particular pity when a writer of Brain Helgeland's quality is involved : with one mocking line by a surveilling cop in the opening scene, one can understand just why the inhabitants of Bethnal Green would prefer to "kiss a gangster than talk to a cop".Yet Legend has its delights: gorgeous cinematography highlighting 60's London settings from East End streets bustling with stalls and costumed to perfection shoppers, to mahogany barred, velvet appointed night clubs to dank, forbidding prison halls ? all of which looks to the contemporary Yank as likely authentic ? Pope can evoke a sense of nostalgia for what was never even experienced. Although some of the 60's pop musical selections are laughably literal (Chapel of Love for the wedding is corny enough; Make the World Go Away playing while Frances suicides with pills is beyond even Ronnie Kray sadism/silliness), Carter Burwell's lovely score tempers critical scenes. The cast could have been better used in cases, particularly Taron Egerton as Ronnie's amiable yes/rent boy triggerman, but Chaz Palminteri as the US Mafia don, David Thewlis as frustrated "fixer" Leslie Payne, Christopher Eccleston as legendary 'flash bastard' cop Nipper Read, and especially Peaky Blinders' Paul Anderson as Reggie's right-hand man Albert Donoghue all convey a strong degree of authenticity to any student of the Krays and their milieu. Emily Browning as Reggie Kray's love interest is conversely both at center stage and so objectified by Reggie that the fullness of her personality can't help but be obscured by her exposition and "otherness". But she is amazingly effective as the doomed girl next door, seduced by danger ? when she meets Reggie, her youthful flirtation is a marvel of innocence and sexual awakening. She slips down a front door stoop to meet Reggie's gaze from a diminutive height, from which she (barefooted and shy-brazen) twinkles up at him to best advantage. Her devolution is all the more painful to behold considering her initial saucy confidence.Of course it's Tom Hardy in his dual role who is the saving grace of Legend. From first sight of Reggie (he of the perpetual furrowed brow and pouty lips) swaggering down an East End street, mocking Old Bill and announcing his guvnership of the 'hood, we see a larger than life character as confident with his fists as with his reputation, a bespoke suited jungle animal, eyes cunning and wary. There are scenes (the opening street strut filmed from behind, a later one flanked by two prison guards, a frontal approach to his brother in an impending fight, a final walk by river lights after killing McVitie) where everything we need to know about Reggie is in that fascinating walk. Leading with massive shoulders, a boxer's arrogant swagger, this is the King of Creation for as far as he can nail it, born to command. To Ronnie, "the mad twin" Tom brings a surprising innocence. Ron knows he is both "fragile" and damaged, but his only real fear is losing primacy in his brother's life. The signs of deep psychosis are always there in the direct glare behind thick horn-rimmed glasses, the ramrod posture, the words spit out as though forcibly expelled from some simmering mass of chaos.It is true, as has been maintained in review after review, that you quickly forget this is one actor playing two characters ? that delightful amnesia is aided by Helgeland limiting the scenes in which both twins are in the same frame, but it is really down to Tom Hardy how carefully, but naturally, the personality foundation of the differences between the two is constructed. The use of minor prosthetics and suit style/padding help this illusion, but you feel Tom could have easily pulled off the distinction had the twins been exact doubles ? and again, much of that distinction comes from Hardy's famous command of his gait, posture, stance. This is an actor who can face off against a man half a head taller and present the picture of intimidation, toe to toe, with the angle from which he cocks his head and the direction he aims his gaze. Does any other actor working today have such a control of the "real estate"? When he lackadaisically leans the right side of his body and arm against a bar in total repose, but strikes out a lightening left hook that decks his adversary with shocking force, you are stunned with the physicality. But you buy it. (Yes, if you enjoy Tom Hardy in fighting scenes, with himself as well as others, this is a must see film).to be continued</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy - woah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a movie about Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas, but give him an identical twin and give everybody a cup of tea. That's pretty much Legend in a nutshell. First of all, shut up anyone who says this movie is bad because it glorifies gangsters. Anyone who comes out of this movie wanting to be like the Kray brothers is an idiot. Sure, Brian Helgeland never really shows them to be evil like Scott Cooper did with Whitey Bulger, but I watch a movie to be entertained, and Legend did that job and then some.Lets talk about Tom Hardy. The man is something truly spectacular. Its very easy to forget that Ron and Reggie are played by the same actor, thanks to a solid hair and makeup department and great subtle nuances by Hardy. When you can wrap your head around them both being Hardy, your mind will be blown. Reggie Kray is an affable, very British, charming, charismatic realist. Ron is dumb as a plank, slow-witted, rude, crazy, has awful social skills and is so much more physically menacing than his brother. I don't know how they did it, but despite being played by the same man Ron always looked bigger than Reggie. Its a hats off to Emily Browning, who has come a long way since last year's Pompeii to give a very likable performance as Reggie's wife Frances and yet share no chemistry with Hardy in the next scene. David Thewlis also gets a fairly decent role and adds his veteran gravity to it.Brian Helgeland is probably my star writer/director of the year. I think many will have problems with how funny Legend ends up being when it might not have been intended that way, but I was loving it. There are some very witty insults thrown around, and a couple of beautiful recurring jokes and motifs that still get a reaction out of you (laughter or fright) the third time they pop up. Hardy's Ron Kray is a big part of the humour. Carter Burwell's score is playful at times and menacing at others, a great storytelling technique as well.What sets Legend apart for me is that the major fight scenes, including one spectacular showdown between Reggie and Ron, are infused with meaning. The biggest theme throughout the film is the bond between the brothers and how one is always dragged along with the other. Reggie goes away, that leaves Ron in charge, whether we like it or not. Reggie may be just as evil as Ron - they share the same gene pool after all. A climactic showdown at the end of the film between the twins is a perfect way to end the film, and even though I knew Reggie's hissed insult was coming, to hear it out loud really hammered it in.Legend felt a bit long (not slow, just long) but I loved every single scene in the movie. I'd struggle to trim 5 minutes without losing a scene I loved. This is one of my favourite gangster movies of all time. Ignore the critics everyone, and see this movie! Do yourself a favour!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, good film Hardy solid performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watched the film Yesterday. Tom Hardy's performance is good, he really showcased his acting ability playing both Kray's brother. The film tells the story of London's two twins who had held the streets in their hand, and terrorized the locals and the police in any way they wanted. But as film, I can not say that it was great, it really felt that there wasn't much of a point to it. All it was is random scenes that were pasted together of "Someone's" life, there was no build up of tension nor did the film have really any direction that it was trying to head in. Can't say that the film will be remembered down the track or is considered to be on the same level as other gangster films like godfather or good fellas. Acting: Apart from Tom Hardy's good performance, Emma Browning is great as the fragile wife or Reggie Kray. She is absolutely brilliant. Although Hardy had more screen time and had the chance to showcase his acting range playing two roles, it was Emma's performance that stole the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two psychos for the price of one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key question: Is this version of the Kray brothers' story better than the 1990 version starring the Kemp brothers as the twins who ran one of London's mini-Mafias in the 1960s? The answer: Not really. It's very much a one-man tour-de-force from Tom Hardy playing both Reggie and Ronnie. Emily Browning gives a good account of herself as Frances, the East End girl who makes the mistake of falling in love with Reg. Tara Fitzgerald has a couple of good scenes as Frances's disapproving mother, but the role of the Kray boys' mum (Billie Whitelaw in overdrive in 1990 as a kind of British Ma Barker!) has almost vanished.The script focuses on Reg and Frances, with Reg constantly promising to give up his gangster life and always reneging on these promises. Ronnie, the gay psycho, hovers in the background with the slightly pantomime air of Anthony Hopkins's take on Hannibal Lecter. There's a clear divide between Hardy's two performances, although towards the end, when Reg commits the crime which sends him to jail for 33 years, he also seems psychotic - not the way the courts saw it.The 1990 film gave a better sense of their 'empire' developing. This screenplay seems to keep going over the same ground: the scenes between Reg and Frances, the tension between the brothers, brawls in pubs and nightclubs. My favourite scenes were those with John Sessions on fine form as Lord Boothby, the Tory peer with a weakness for rent boys supplied by Ronnie (I think Boothby was fictionalised in the 1990 version). LEGEND scores high points for evoking the atmosphere of the Sixties. In the annals of infamy the Kray brothers were minor villains, but this film, like the earlier one, reminds us that London's history has always included men like Reg and Ronnie who pander to the seedy vices of the not-so-great, the not-so-good.</fullReview>

This after all is a Biopic. They could have made this into the British version of Goodfellas or even Casino but I think they wimped out at the end. about 3 good fighting scenes and a bit of dirty dealing doesn't a gangster film make. If there is ever something made like this again please leave the courting, gift giving and marriage at the door. Wheres guy richie when you need him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Legendary (Non-specific spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting in Legend was excellent. The setting and costumes were also excellent.The problem with the movie was the narration and story-telling. I could not care less about the played out cliché of a woman trying to make her "bad man" turn good. First off a woman who is attracted to a gangster is likely attracted to him because he is a gangster: she likes the power, respect and money. Once you have those things you get the ladies just ask Tony Montana. The other cliché in mob movies is the cop vs. crook angle which this movie also has. What this movie lacks is a big score like Heat or Goodfellas or a good sense of proportion like Scarface. By that I mean that you understood exactly where Tony stood in the criminal underworld- he was a big deal in the USA as a major drug importer but was a small fish compared to international mobsters based in Colombia.In this movie the Krays are implicated as major underworld crime figures but there economic power seems limited to club ownership.All in all the movie is worth watching based on the genre, solid acting, great costume design etc. The choice of narrator was very disappointing as was the direction which seemed determined to make the Krays seem more powerful than they were. In my opinion what makes gangsters interesting is not their money or influence but their raw physical power, often unpredictability, and ruthlessness. I feel like the director missed the mark by his feeling that if you aren't at the top of the criminal food chain you aren't interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Legend" is strong (especially in its performances), but isn't quite legend-ary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the bond between twins is special, the bond between identical twins is almost spiritual. Identical twins share their DNA, their looks and often (but not always) their personalities. No twins are ever completely identical, but what joins them is almost always stronger than what separates them ? for better or worse. In the case of Reggie and Ronnie Cray, the real-life 1950s and 60s-era London gangsters portrayed in the biopic "Legend" (R, 2:11), their unbreakable bond and their similarities were definitely for the worse.In real life and in this film (the second one about the brothers, following 1990's "The Krays"), Reggie and Ronnie were tough kids who became tough and ruthless adults. As kids, they once had a fight during which Reggie almost killed Ronnie. As teens, they made very effective use of their aggression and their physical abilities in the boxing ring. As adults, their "might makes right" mentality made them the most powerful and feared gangsters in London. They were two halves of the same fertilized egg who became two halves of the same coin, but there were still differences. Reggie was more of a lover governed by his mind and Ronnie was more of a fighter ruled by his impulses. Reggie was more refined, and Ronnie was simply psychotic. Romantically and sexually, Reggie liked women, while Ronnie liked men. One could note other differences between these men, but those differences are almost inconsequential when viewed in light of their unbreakable bond as twins and unshakable commitment to being crime legends.British actor Tom Hardy plays both Kray twins, with all of their differences and similarities, and through the separate, yet intertwined events in their lives as gangsters. Both men did time in prison for their business methods, but were never incarcerated at the same time (at least during the period of their lives covered in this film). When Ronnie was in prison, Reggie proudly ran a classy dinner and entertainment club. When Reggie was in prison, Ronnie practically ran that club into the ground with his odd behavior and counter-productive business practices. With both the twins on the streets at the same time, they added clubs and gained power in London's criminal underworld through a combination of extortion and violence. They also partner up with gangsters in the U.S. (represented by a character played by Chazz Palminteri) and pursue very different love lives, with Reggie becoming engaged to his beloved Frances (Emily Browning), while Ronnie spends time with young men like "Mad Teddy" Smith (Taron Egerton).The underworld empire of the Krays, like all other criminal organizations, inevitably peaks, then declines. For a while, they seem untouchable, due to a combination of their brutal business tactics and just plain luck. (For example, when a member of the British House of Lords becomes involved in the homosexual activities of Ronnie and his friends, and a scandal looms, the authorities increasingly ignore the brothers' criminal activities in order to keep the public's attention diverted from the lord's indiscretions.) The Kray brothers' business manager (David Thewlis) struggles to keep their criminal empire solvent in spite of Ronnie's erratic and violent behavior. Meanwhile, Reggie struggles with Frances' persistent demands that he pursue his business activities without resorting to illegal methods. Through these and other challenges, the continued success of the Kray twins' endeavors are threatened by problems from their pasts, increasingly erratic behavior during their present and that ever-present unconditional loyalty which starts to seem unlikely to sustain them much farther into their future.The mixture of strengths and weaknesses in the movie "Legend" mirrors that same condition that we see in Reggie and Ronnie Kray. Telling the story primarily through Reggie's eyes keeps the story focused, but the directing is uneven and the use of narration by Frances is unnecessary and gimmicky. The story unfolds like a British version of "Goodfellas" (especially if you imagine Ray Liotta's and Joe Pesci's characters as brothers) and seems to be paying homage to Martin Scorsese's gangster classic, but the amount of similarities between the films becomes distracting. Writer-director Brian Helgeland, whose efforts gave us "L.A. Confidential", "Mystic River" and "42", delivers a strong movie here, but fails to tap into the magic that produced some of his earlier work. This film is engaging and entertaining, but it owes most of that to its experienced and talented cast, especially, Browning who is both adorable and strong as the film's emotional center, and Hardy who caps off a great year of on-screen work (including "Child 44" and "Mad Max: Fury Road") with an Oscar-worthy performance (actually? two performances) which is/are earthy, funny, heartbreaking and frightening. Would that the rest of the film were as impressive. While it doesn't suffer from flaws as fatal as those in the Kray twins, "Legend" isn't quite legendary. "B"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initial thoughts prior to seeing this film, were hopes of not having the same Spandau Ballet experience I had previously. Within the first 5 minutes i was happy to say i was wrong. The differential character acting portrayed by Tom Hardy, as both Ronnie and Reggie Kray is sublime. If i was not such a fan of Tom Hardy, i would have thought Ronnie and Reggie were played by separate actors. The film oozes Eastend character, with a hint of mafioso influence. The use of the big bands and swing music, made me think what it was like to be in one of the Kray clubs, 'back in the day'.Remember that scene in the movie, Goodfella's, when the camera spans around the club, well it has that same feeling, especially with the clever POV cinematography.The Director and Writer, Brian Helgeland, not from the East-end himself, still managed to show the movie watcher what it was like living in the Eastend. God knows how the location manager found Tower blocks and Terrace houses in such good condition, which i am guessing is showed that way because at that time would have been new builds.The film had everything from great dialogue and comedy to action packed drama. The story evolves around the poisonous triangular relationship, between Reggie and his wife, Frances and brother Ronnie. Actress, Emily Browning, who played Frances was fantastic, especially in her interactions with Ronnie Kray.Even if you're not a fan of The Krays (Past Films or the real Krays themselves), you should go watch this movie. It gives a real account of the occurrence's that happened in a dramatic setting, which will make you want to watch this movie again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy Shines In An Otherwise Dull Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LEGEND tells the true story of identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, as they build their organized crime empire and terrorize London during the 1950s and 60s. Tom Hardy is the reason you see this movie. His double performance was captivating, and the special effects that made this binary show possible were just as impressive. Within mere minutes of this film you completely forget that one man plays these two characters. Hardy is able to convincingly disappear into each, playing the sane Reggie Kray with charming subtlety and the insane Ronnie with unnerving humor. And while Hardy is excellent, the rest of the film is sadly not. As an overall film, it's not that compelling to watch. Historically speaking, it's intriguing for sure; it's just not something that'll keep you on the edge of your seat for over 2 hours. This has a lot to do with the tonally incoherent nature of LEGEND; it doesn't know what it wants to be, juggling drama and comedy quite unevenly. The voice-over narration by Emily Browning, who played Frances, was good and all, but it's implausibility kept taking me out of the movie. What I mean by that is, as a framing device for the story, it was incongruous; more than half the events that she narrated didn't even involve her whatsoever. Also, her character felt more like a means to an end than she did an end in itself, serving the characters around her better than she ultimately served herself. The best way to describe the kind of vibe that director Brian Helgeland was attempting here is "British Martin Scorsese" film. Not in terms of quality per se, but definitely with regards to feel. The injection of pop music throughout, along with a glossy sheen, gives LEGEND plenty of charismatic, larger-than-life, personality. Unfortunately, the film's messy structure hinders it from ever taking shape. But you know what they say: a messy house is a sign of character, and that may be the highest praise I can give to a movie I desperately wanted to love, but, at the end of the day, have trouble calling good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cor blimey! Stone the crows! A diabolical liberty is taken of the Kray Twins as their gangster life is turned into a love story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been major criminals in London over the years. However, only two groups of criminals have ever become iconic, legendary and mythic. One lot were 'The Great Train Robbers' whose one big crime and long, long, aftermath, gave them immortality. The other lot were 'The Krays', a gangster family who were the closest British thing to the Mafia, and who comported themselves throughout their lives in such a way, that they created their own legend. Hence the title of this film. The Krays and the Trainrobbers have influenced crime in London ever since, be it culturally, or in the actuality, in other gangs such as the blaggers of the 1980's.'The Krays' (1990), was a decent gangster film that starred real- life pop-star brothers Gary Kemp and Martin Kemp. Fairly accurate, it suffered from being shown from the POV of Violet Kray, the mother, and thus had women making speeches about swans and other nonsense.Therefore this reviewer looked forward to this new version of the story, especially as it was said to be based on John Pearson's book 'The Profession of Violence, The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins'. An added attraction was the actor Tom Hardy being in the film. The earlier film had used twins to play the twins, an obvious move, now in retrospect an even more obvious idea was used. In this film Tom Hardy plays Reginald Kray, and Ronald Kray is played by Tom Hardy.Director Brian Helgeland who also wrote the script based on the book, had attempted to recruit Mr Hardy to play Reggie. However he was much more interested in playing Ronnie. The obvious solution was found!What was of concern, was the information put out, that the film was to be narrated in the voice of Frances Shea, the wife of Reggie. And so, sadly, it turned out to be. From the opening scene, we have an awful narration. It is so inappropriate! It turns the film into a hagiography. We even have some cod-Marxist class analysis as well as lots of pathetic loved-up philosophical meanderings. Thus the film is transformed from what could have been a good gangster film into a love story. If Frances Shea had declared that there were three people in her marriage, it would have fitted in well with the overall tone.Film is set accurately in the London of the Swinging Sixties in which the Krays were an integral part. This is shown well. Sadly lacking from this film, is a Scorsese- like soundtrack, that captures the music of the era. Location shooting was generally good as were the period details. However, the real-life Blind Beggar pub exterior, is much grander, and more prominently located on a main street. The stand-in is stuffed down a street so little, it looks like an alley.Tom Hardy is superb in his two roles. Ronnie is truly terrifying. Reggie too, carries menace. Mr Hardy's appearance as both brothers is very good. Those familiar with the iconic photos will be amazed at the likeness. Scenes with both brothers was part of the attraction of the film. These scenes are all shot superbly. Mr Hardy convinces in each role and is the embodiment of each twin. Recollection of a short interview long ago of the twins, suggests that Mr Hardy has captured their voices well too. If the narration of Frances Shea is bad, her portrayal by Emily Browning is superb. A brilliant and moving performance. Most of the film deals with the relationship of Frances and Reggie. Frances, so fragile, is stifled by the gangster life. Reggie is torn between his love for Frances and for his brother Ron too. Frances wants Reggie to go straight. Ronnie models himself on Al Capone. Reggie is torn between the two. As this film concentrates on the love angle, it is not really much of a gangster film. Rated as 18 in the UK, it actually has less bloody violence than the recent 'American Ultra' which has a UK 15 rating. 'Legend' does have three violent and bloody fight scenes. About half of the events in the Kray story are in this film, though often needlessly fictionalized, and chronology is not good. As film progresses you wonder what is going to be left out. As you finally assume something is left out, it's popped in. The fictionalization is often so unnecessary. For example, the early scene leaving the hospital is just so less interesting than what happened in real- life. This should have been an ultra violent gangster film that showed the violent world of the Krays. The violence in the film is downplayed thus making it nicer and more entertaining. A major flaw!It was an interesting idea to make this a film about Frances Shea. However this follows the earlier film about Violet Kray. Sure, both women played an important part in the lives of the twins. However this is not the most interesting aspect of the lives of the twins. In this film the differences between the twins is emphasized. However, their similarities is another aspect that deserves attention. Most of all, we are still in need of a definitive Kray gangster film.There is not enough use made of the John Pearson source material. In fact, much has been fictionalized and rewritten. A shame! The Pearson book is considered the definitive work. He was hired to write an authorized biography which morphed later into it's more revealing shape. Charlie Kray's second edition of his own book is more revealing than the untruthful first edition. Leonard Reed has also collaborated with James Morton on a book.However, for a final comment about the violent and feared Kray Twins, the book by Frank Cater, tells the story of a terrified girl trying to escape a car and screaming "You're not from Scotland Yard! You're from THEM!A diabolical liberty! 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving and well acted - a bit hard to understand Tom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite not being able to understand about a third of what Tom Hardy was saying (and I doubt too many East London Cockneys would be able to either) this is a surprisingly involving movie. You can figure out what's happening even if you can't get all of the dialog. A true story is better than fiction and it's quite fascinating to see the craziness. There is a dark comedy vibe going on which helps keep things entertaining. The violence isn't as bad as a fictional gangster Mafia movie - no machine guns blazing but it's scary enough because it's more believable.Tom Hardy gives 2 good performances as both the Kray twins and he speaks and acts and looks differently. He also looks like the real life twins too. Quite amazing. He didn't have to mumble so much but his acting is quite mesmerizing. Emily Browning is well cast and sympathetic as Reggie's wife. Finally a role she is perfectly suited for. The supporting cast including David Thewlis and Taron Egerton, is good except the Scotland Yard detective looked too much like a gangster - should have been more of a good guy looks wise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>50 Shades of Kray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so I went into this film expecting a gangster flick and I was rather excited about it too. However I was left surprised as it wasn't quite what I was expecting, but still a very entertaining watch. I don't think that this was ever really promoted as a biopic of sorts so some inaccuracies shouldn't be something to condemn the film for. I got the vibe that the producers of this film were searching for the perfect balance between romance and action in order to make a great movie with a broader target audience.I was surprised at the fact this film follows the relationship between Reggie and his wife so much, leaving Ronnie to be more of a supporting role. All the performances in this film are brilliant, props to Tom Hardy for portraying two identical looking characters with very different traits. The "gimmick" of Hardy playing both roles is easily forgettable due to his brilliant performance(s). Throughout the film, I think the director does a very good job at making the audience feel and understand how much Ronnie and his condition held Reggie back in terms of both "business" and his relationships. It fuels some quite emotional scenes where you feel the Reggie was also a carer to Ron, as well as a brother.This films violence is very good, I say it's very good because EVERY scene of violence in this film made me wince. It's graphic and brutal, along with the language, but it gives you a sense of how ugly these crimes were that the Kray brothers committed during their time on the top. Truly gripping.Despite the violence being terrific, my only compliant is that there wasn't enough of it. Like I previously mentioned, the director intertwined the plot with romance and that can be a good thing, but when I go to see a film about the Krays... the criminal side of things is what I want to see most of. I would say that this film is worth the money to see, it's very well made and the performances are brilliant. The soundtracks good too. It's a very good film, just not quite a great gangster movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant performances all round, with Tom Hardy on top form. Kept my attention from start to finish, with no bouts of boredom. A mix of dark humour and grit gives the film a fresh feel, with a touch of old school charm. I would have liked to see more of the gangster rivalries, as it felt a little condensed, but the impression of ruthlessness was there nonetheless. My favourite aspect of the film has to be the relationship between the Kray twins. Rarely do you see a love/hate relationship so strong. It is almost painful to watch in the moments where Ronnie cannot understand why Reggie is so angry with him, and when Reggie doesn't know how Ronnie's brain works. Just go and watch Legend, you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hardy's best performance yet, throughout the whole film he managed to keep an obvious difference between Ronnie and Reggie; down to the mannerisms, how they walk and how they talk. I kept forgetting that Tom was playing both characters! It would have been so easy for Tom to make Ronnie come across as mindless, cold human being who put no thought into anything but he gave Ronnie so many dimensions within his character, coming across as a guy who is charming, funny, and almost innocent but not fully in control in his actions... how Hardy pulled this off while acting as Reggie as well i'll never know.If Hardy doesn't win awards for this there is something wrong. I watched The Rise of The Krays recently and felt the opposite towards Ronnie in that film as he just came across as a senseless human that just got a thrill out of beating people up with little to no thought but not with Tom Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie. As the film progressed i felt myself really warming to Ronnie. I felt like I understood him, he came across as a guy where his heart is in the right place but he just didn't know how to react to certain situations, lashing out irrationally more often than not but you kind of forgive it as Hardy has set up a solid foundation of the fact he is a caring person deep down, how he managed to do this while playing Reggie and nailing that as well i will never know. Well done Tom... Well done. Visually excellent. All the locations were beautifully shot and felt authentic to its time. The costume design was awesome. I know it may seem simple but the suits they were wearing, screamed class about them. Every single shot was thought about, I won't give any spoilers but if you see a close up it means something (not like other films where close ups are overused) so don't just surpass a close up.Also i loved at the start that when Ronnie says "that's interesting". Apparently he doesn't know what he's on about or doesn't understand when he says this so throughout the film when he says "that's interesting" it's a nice cue to let us understand how Ronnie is digesting a situation... it may not sound like much but i personally thought it was used incredibly effectively. Editing was on point. There isn't a lot to be said about the editing as it's amazing, you'd think it would be hard to edit this film together considering Tom is playing the main characters so splitting them up etc. and yes it would be hard but at no point was there a hiccup that took me out of the film. Richard Ayoade's The Double has the same idea of playing one actor for the two main characters and it was okay but seemed to play it safe whereas this film just pushed the boundaries so much and managed to pull it off above and beyond of what I expected. Casting was spot on and the film is so stylish, The rule of thirds game was strong in this film and they used that to their advantage in the sense that it would be very easy to be distracted by Tom playing Ronnie and Reggie... I know Tom Hardy's performance was so good we didn't notice it but Brian Helgeland obviously wanted to play it extra safe by really thinking about where he placed the shots and where they were standing. Best example i can give is when they are sat in the room with Leslie Payne and they are sat on opposite sides of the room, now, that could look awkward and be maybe distracting as they do hold the shot but they really think about how to set up the shot so the visual and aesthetic appreciation takes away any distraction that Tom Hardy plays the same character and this mentality is carried throughout the entire film.All in all amazing film, thoroughly enjoyed it. This will go up in my top 5 favorite films. Tom Hardy should get an Oscar for this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Legend won't have a legacy like its main characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that a new film was going to be made about the Kray twins, I was genuinely excited for two reasons. Firstly, the Kray story is a fascinating one, one which was never properly realised in the 1990 Adaption with the Kemp Brothers.Secondly, Hearing that Tom Hardy was going to play both of the Twins filled me with excitement. His screen presence and charisma is exactly what the role requiredI have read a great deal about the Krays because to me they are simply fascinating. The Profession of Violence by the author John Pearson is like a Bible when it comes to the Twins, and if you haven't read it, then please seek it out and do so. The author spent some time with the twins before their empire crumbled around them, so I was glad to see his name in the writing credits.So, what do I make of the film after my viewing? Well, I was disappointed to be honest and here is why. Firstly, I didn't like how the film was narrated by Reggie Krays girlfriend/wife through out. Frances is an important character in relation to Reggie and his development in general, but having her narrate the film, makes it seem like she is the central character of the film.Secondly, there is so much that hasn't made it into the film. Why didn't we get to see the rise of the Krays and their demise? - They Spent half of their life in prison, and there are plenty of stories to explore here. Reggie in a standard prison and Ronnie in Broadmoor, a psychiatric prison.- They had a very interesting childhood and were both shipped off to the countryside during the second world war. - If my memory serves me right, they accidentally killed a young boy whilst messing around on a milk float in the East End whilst they were still boys. (I read this in a Kray book). - Ronnie was apparently abused during his teens whilst on a camping trip. - Both were aspiring boxers including their elder brother Charlie Kray and they once all fought on the same bill at a boxing event.- They were petty crooks/brawlers in their younger days and made a name for themselves when they took over their local snooker hall.- They deserted the Army and both were punished by being locked up for a small period in the Tower of London.- Reggie once pretended to be Ronnie and switched with him during a prison visit, to get him out, later walking out himself telling the staff he was Reggie and that he didn't know where his brother was.- The prison break of the Prisoner Frank Mitchell aka "The Mad Axeman" from Dartmoor Prison. They later had him murdered.I could go on, but these elements need to be in a film about the Krays. Some of these stories could be myth, but it is exactly these things which has made them both Legends.Thirdly, for a great deal of the film, the story seems to jump about a great deal and if you are not familiar with the Krays and their story, I think this can be rather confusing. My Friend said that he found it very bitty, like lots of scenes had been shot and strung together very loosely with no context.Fourthly, the Performance of Tom Hardy is excellent. I have read that some feel that Hardy plays Reggie very well, but almost parodies Ronnie Kray. I disagree, I think he got the performances bang on. It's just a shame that Hardy and the rest of the cast, who are also excellent, have ended up in a film which hasn't quite lived up to its billing, which is a shame. Oh and why is the film called Legend? it tells you nothing about the film!! I guarantee people not in the know, won't know what the film is about. It would be like calling the Godfather something like Family Business.To conclude, Legend is okay if you know nothing about the Kray Twins. Tom Hardy and his supporting cast are very good, but the film seemed to focus too much on production values and not on the story.In my humble opinion, the story of the Krays could be on par with the Godfather, and whats more, it really happened. I think a trilogy of films is in order chronicling their childhood, their rise to gangland's heady heights and their time in prison. Their story deserves the full cinema treatment, not because they were gangsters, but because their story is simply fascinating which in turn made them Legends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER ALERT***This film is amazing- it captures the Kray's reign with accuracy, humour and style. Gorgeously filmed, brilliantly acted (if Tom Hardy doesn't win awards there's something very wrong) and deftly written. There's also some great humour in this movie. Hardy as Ronnie is like some kind of comedy genius. At the screening I went to a portion of the audience were hanging on every one of Ronnie's words and laughing along with him.But above all the film is like a love letter to London. The locations are beautifully filmed and the whole film feels authentic to its time.Oh, and this film is violent as hell. One fight scene involves Ronnie using a hammer in each hand instead of his fists. You've been warned.Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing cast, not so amazing execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll kick this off by saying that when I walked into the cinema it was to see two things: - The gimmick of Tom Hardy playing two separate characters - A new gangster/mob movie to add to the many great epics (Godfather, Good fellas etcetera) And honestly this movie is in no way shape or form terrible, but with that criteria in mind it let me down a little. Having said that I'll start with the positives: - HARDY HARDY HARDY! His portrayal of Reg Kray is a good performance but the humour and darkness that comes with playing Ronnie is what elevates this movie from every tragic plot ever to a solid romp.- Supporting cast - David Thewlis is great, Taron Edgerton is unrecognisable from Kings man and Paul Bettany may only be in 2 scenes but those scenes were probably, aside from Hardy's, the best in the film.Now for the downsides: - This film is a third gangster film, and two thirds romance. You know how in Good fellas they kept the distinction between Henry and Karen a separate but pivotal plot point to everything else that went on? In this one the relationship is the main focal point. And it isn't even that the chemistry is bad, it's just that it's very repetitive - they're fighting, they've made up, they're fighting again - when in reality I just wanted more Ronnie Kray scenes.- There is no centrepiece to the film. There are a few decent scenes but nothing which screams iconic.- Christopher Eccleston, in my opinion, has been underutilised again! It happened in Thor the dark world, and it happened in this - the dude is a great actor and he was cast as "Evil antagonist with small back story" in Thor," and "Generic policeman wanting to get his man" in this.In the end ladies and gents if you just want to be entertained for 2 hours with some solid acting give this film your attention purely for Hardy's performance. If you want to spend your money on the new big gangster movie, save your cash for when it comes out on DVD or TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devilishly funny with not one, but two brilliant performances from Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Kray twins are two of Britain's most notorious criminals, who made their name through the organised crime empire that they ran from the East End of London in the 1960s. Depending on who you talk to or what you read, the Kray twins were either seen as thuggish gangsters or celebrities of the East End.Their violent tendencies aside, the two brothers were polar opposites. Reggie was the calmer one who had an idea of how the world of business worked whereas Ronnie was brash with his decisions, more often than not choosing to shoot first and ask questions later. The pair have been depicted in film and television before but none have been quite like the film Legend, which sees Tom Hardy play both Ronnie and Reggie Kray. While the film does tell the story of both men and their criminal empire, more focus is given to the life of Reggie and in particular, the relationship he had with his wife, Frances (Emily Browning).Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, the Academy Award winning screenwriter of L.A. Confidential, Legend is a violent and darkly funny insight into the criminal underworld of London's East End in the 1960s, ruled by the Kray twins.My biggest concern going into Legend was that Tom Hardy playing the role of both brothers would become a gimmick and slight distraction from the story the film is trying to tell. It took me a few scenes to get over it but after that, in a weird way, it's easy to forget you are watching one man play two characters on screen at the same time. This is all down to Hardy's brilliant double performance.He captures the essence of each character so well; the suaveness of Reggie and the aggressive side of Ronnie, once again showing how different they could be as well as how similar they also were at times. In an ideal world, it would be great to see Hardy pick up both a nomination for Best Actor (Reggie) and Best Supporting Actor (Ronnie). It would be very unlikely but very deserved.Emily Browning, starring and narrating as Frances, also gives a memorable performance, showing how vulnerable even those loved by the Krays could end up being. As much as she loved Reggie, she spent a lot of time putting on a brave face and the lifestyle he chose to live ended up eating away at her mind.Brian Helgeland's film has been accused of glamourising the Kray twins and their crimes however, in a Q&amp;A after the film, Helgeland refused to agree that his film did this. He argued that the characters were already considered glamorous, due to the lifestyle they led, but in no way was he championing what they did.Helgeland directs in the stylish way that you would associate with many gangster films and his screenplay is both brutal and, in places, devilishly funny. His film is brought to life with the help of some wonderful production design by Tom Conroy and slick cinematography from Dick Pope.There are some great choices in music included on the film's soundtrack too, Booker T's Green Onions and I'm Into Something Good by Herman's Hermits perfectly accompanying the stylish visuals of the film.Whether or not the Krays were stylish is a matter of opinion but there is no denying that Brian Helgeland's Legend is a very well made gangster film that certainly aims high yet fails to reach the heights of Goodfellas or The Godfather films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organized crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s.Brian Helgeland Writer of LA Confidential takes on his sixth feature film and it's premise excited the hell out of me. The trailer showcased a unique dark comical tone and intriguing plot based off the true story of the Kray twins.I have to be honest and say this was one of the biggest let downs of year for me. It feels shapeless in structure which isn't always a bad thing but here it gives the film no real sense of purpose or urgency. I thought Tom Hardy's dual performance was brilliant, he commits to both role with the supreme talent he has its just a pity that the story around him doesn't work as well. One of the biggest let downs for me was the dialogue, it felt off and didn't make any sense, this made the already unlikeable characters plain uninteresting. Emily Browning's character "Frances" was extremely underwritten and her voice over narration isn't logically as she is absent from much of the scenes she's narrating.Legend doesn't capitalize on any of the early plot points it makes, its scenes with the Mafia and rival gangs are never truly explored or given any resolve whatsoever, instead it focuses on "Frances's" point of view and on her lackluster relationship with "Reggie Kray". As her relationship progresses with "Reggie" certain things happen that come out of nowhere and left me scratching my head and wondering what was Brain Helgeland thinking.Legend does have redeeming qualities such as Tom Hardy's performance and two stand out fight sequences which are very entertaining to watch, but the problem is their just isn't enough of them. Overall Legend's shallow story, irritating dialogue and lack of direction really took it down for me. I am going to give Legend a 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of the Kray brothers, Ron and Reggie, the twins you ran a gangster empire in London in the 1960s. We see their rise to power, the adversity they faced along the way and while at the top. Moreover, we see how the differences between the two - Reggie the calm businessman, Ron the impulsive thug - often undermines their partnership. Interesting, but not that engaging or compelling. Pretty much a blow-by-blow (often literal) account of their criminal careers, and just that. Some good action scenes and some good humour too, but these aren't enough on their own to lift the film beyond the mediocre.What does lift the movie beyond mediocre is the performance(s) of Tom Hardy. He stars as both brothers and is in top form. Despite the brothers being twins, and being played by the same actor, he manages to give each of them different mannerisms, accents and appearances, to the point you can always tell the brothers apart.You do get the feeling, however, that Hardy's dual performance is the only selling point of the movie. Once Hardy was locked in the writer and director felt they could just live off that novelty.</fullReview>

Spittle Spews from the Mouth in a Number of Scenes that is Method Acting Drowning in an all New Level.Hardy is Enamored by Critics and the Public to such an Extent and has Everyone Under His Spell and when the Performance(s) are a Challenge like Playing Twin Brothers, You would Think it's a Stratospheric Accomplishment. It's Passable but can do nothing to Elevate this Awkward Aggrandizement of Scum. It's all just Surface Stuff.The Atmosphere and Period looks like a Low-Budget Movie and the Time and Place hardly Reincarnates. The Same Songs are Recycled at different Times and that's just Lazy and Uninspired and that could be Said about the Entire Production.A Disappointment Considering the Writer/Director and the Genre, but Nothing Tom Hardy does ever Disappoints Anyone and when He Rises to Mediocrity, the Praises Never Stop. This Film as a Whole is Not Praiseworthy, it is a Dull Misconception that gets just about Everything Wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid, but flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second of the big screen retellings of the Kray storyline, following on from 1990's THE KRAYS which starred real-life brothers Martin and Gary Kemp as the terrible twosome. While I enjoyed LEGEND on a superficial level, I found it an oddly hollow viewing experience and not as good as the previous version. The problem lies with the direction, which is oddly inexperienced for a long-time director like Brian Helgeland.The issues with LEGEND are entirely down to tone, and the tone just isn't right. The setting-up scenes are fine, the transition scenes are fine, and the film is well-shot throughout with an excellent eye for realism and a decent budget. What a shame, then, that all of the pivotal scenes are so oddly staged in a semi-humorous tone. It feels like Helgeland wanted to make the story a comedy, which is the last thing it could be.This jokey approach to the material manifests itself in the violent moments, which are rather incredibly played for laughs whereas really the raw power of the incidents should have come out. It's present in Tom Hardy's dual role; the special effects are excellent (and have come a long way since Van Damme played twins in DOUBLE IMPACT) but Ronnie Kray is nothing more than a caricature here, a weirdo played for maximum relish by the off-beat actor.LEGEND also messes up some of the source material, which is a little odd. I've read Reggie's autobiography so have some experience with the facts. For some reason this film plays down the pivotal relationship between the Krays and their mother; the latter only appears in a couple of scenes. In contrast, it bigs up the role Frances Shea played in the story, giving her way too much screen time at the expense of others. Thus at times LEGEND feels like a romance rather than the gangster epic it should be. It's certainly not a bad film, but is it something I'd watch again? Not really - I'd prefer going back to THE KRAYS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brian Helgeland both wrote the screenplay (based on John Pearson's book) and directed this mobster movie. The sole attraction (aside form a fine performance by Emily Browning) is the tick of using actor Tom Hardy to play both roles of the twins ? and for that reason it is worth watching.The film tells the story of the identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray (Tom Hardy in a duplicitous role), two of the most notorious criminals in British history, and their organized crime empire in the East End of London during the 1960s. Focusing on the relationship between Reggie Kray and Frances Shea (Emily Browning), the film is told from France's' point of view as someone who knew him best, as well as the mental health issues the same sex life that Ronnie Kray faced and their rise to power as the notorious gangsters of London.There are some fine roles for Christopher Eccleston, Tara Fitzgerald, Nicholas Farrell, and Joshua Hill, but the entire production is overlong, consistent fighting, and not a lot of character development. But the overriding problem of this film is that is nearly unintelligible due to the thick East Ender accents the actors use. Tom Hardy does a fine job as both twins (very different in nature) but he too is almost impossible to understand. Fortunately on DVD there are English subtitles so we can understand the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An utter waste of two great Tom Hardy performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally can't recall from recent memory a film that so completely wastes its lead actor in such a lacklustre and uninvolving central story and in the case of Legend it not only wastes one Tom Hardy performance but two, therefore setting the recent record for biggest waste of an actor double bill in quite some time.How up and down filmmaker and screenwriter Brian Helgeland (writing L.A Confidential one minute directing The Sin Eater the next) could make such a boring attempt at telling the anything but true story of the London criminal identities the Kray twins is anyone's guess but in a film that comes across as a poor man's Scorsese, its quite clear he struggled to juggle both the imposing and differentiating identities of Ronnie and Reggie Kray respectively and also struggled to get the audience invested in a plot that should've been an easy win if told in a proper and exciting manner.Led by Emily Browning's so-so narration we never really get to experience a true rise or a true fall of the Kray's who at one period in the not too distant past ruled the London criminal syndicate with their mix of smarts and charms (Reggie) and psychopathic lunacy (Ronnie).In these two men we get an in many ways incredible double dose of Hardy who does the thankless task of playing two completely different leads with aplomb. He suits the suave and charismatic Reggie in both mind and body and then does the same with Ronnie even though he forgoes much suability with a more?hands on approach.It's a masterclass of commitment by Hardy but surrounded by underused supports, who are mainly uninteresting and unlikeable side characters, Legend can't keep up the pace with its on form leading man (men?) even though it at times looks the part and shows glimmers of a more rip roaring yarn.When Tom Hardy's unleashed; a highlight is a Hardy v Hardy club set fight, Legend becomes a darkly hilarious and entertaining examination of two brothers and two gangsters but despite the best efforts of its lead the film struggles to ever maintain its momentum and with a 2 hour plus running time of random events, mismanaged plot strands and a general sense of being lost at sea, Legend is one of 2015's biggest disappointments and leaves us still awaiting a quintessential big screen treatment for the Krays.2 lemon sherbets out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy is the only reason to watch Legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hardy is a class act. It is hard to argue with the fact that he is among the best actors out there. He has the uncanny ability to bring depth to a character by simply grunting, and this was evident in his portrayal of Forrest Bondurant in the movie "Lawless." The character he played barely had any words to say and yet he is memorable. Even though the movie is narrated by Jack Bondurant's (Shia Labeouf), it is Forrest's character that you remember fondly when the movie ends. And that has a lot to do with Hardy's acting. However, if we are talking about Hardy's skills, it is prudent that I introduce you to the film "Locke" starring Tom Hardy and a BMW X5. The whole movie revolves around Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) who is in a car driving to London while talking on the phone with various people in his life. The movie is 85 minutes, and it is an amazing film. And that just explains how great of an actor Tom Hardy is.**Spoiler Alert**Having explained just how phenomenon Hardy is, let's talk about "Legend." When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was extremely excited. The movie or the trailer reminded me of "Rock-n-Rolla"; it had a vibe to it that I liked. I felt that the trailer was saying, "hey, look at me, I'm giving you East London Gangster meets the Mafia genre." and I wanted to watch that. "Legend" is about the Kray twins who ran a criminal empire in London in the '60's. Ronnie and Reggie Kray played by Tom Hardy were identical twins, Reggie was the suave, charming one and Ronnie was the unstable brother (I don't mean that figuratively, he was actually mentally unstable). The story is narrated by Frances Shea (Emily Browning) from beyond the grave. I did not know about the Kray twins when I began watching the movie, so it comes as a shock to me when Frances commits suicide. It is a despondent scene to watch. Although the movie has memorable moments like the fight scene between Reggie and Ronnie (Tom Hardy fighting himself is hilarious and mildly disturbing), every Ronnie scene (this guy is dramatic as he should be) and when Reggie and Frances meet, the film as a whole feels anti-climactic.In fact, the only remarkable thing about this movie is the fact that Tom Hardy plays both Reggie and Ronnie. I will go as far as to say that it should be the determining factor for anyone who decides to watch this film. It is no surprise given my introduction that Tom Hardy gives a spectacular performance. Don't get me wrong, it is not a horrible film, but it is not a great one either. I expected more everything and I didn't get it. Maybe it was the trailer that got me thinking there would be more underhand dealings, more taking over, more murder, more everything or maybe it was the fact that I did not know about the Kray twins so I had no point of reference, but I still feel as if there should have been more.So,Will this film be recorded in the annals of History? NoIs it worth the watch? Definitely! Especially for Tom Hardy's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only legendary about "Legend" is the performance of Tom Hardy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Come to Philadelphia! You see a nice girl, we'll get her for you! I prefer boys. Italians, sometimes Greek, but I am not prejudiced. ""Legend" certainly won't be remembered as a brilliant gangster movie. You certainly can't compare it with a gangster epos like "The Godfather" or "The untouchables". This film about the notorious Kray twins surely exhibits a successful retro look and shows how the brothers founded their business empire full of glamor and violence, and how it gradually crumbled. Partly because they were constantly watched by the authorities and also because of the psychotic behavior of one of the brothers. The best part of this film is Tom Hardy's acting performance. It looks like a rematch after "Mad Max: Fury Road" where he served as a defenseless blood donor and where he was outplayed by Charlize Theron. "I'm going to show everybody my capabilities" he probably thought. And so he volunteered to play both twin brothers.It took me a while before I suddenly realized that I was looking at the same person. It's creepy to see how different those two main characters are. Not just physically but also their personalities differ. Ron has chubby cheeks, old-fashioned glasses and a drooping lower lip so during an outburst of anger you'll see spit flying in all directions. Reggie is the brushed off, athletic and more intelligent type. He's the mastermind behind the whole operation and has both a charming as a ruthless side. But mainly the over-protectiveness towards his brother is a disadvantage. Ron is the unpredictable part of the twins. He's rather short-tempered and needs to take medications to keep that in control. Most attention is paid to the difficult relationship between the two brothers. An astonishing piece of acting.Don't expect a lot of violent scenes. There's only the incident in a local pub with a rival gang where the brothers briefly demonstrate their tough approach. Rest assured there will be some of them walking around with sore kneecaps. The rest of the movie is filled with the familiar "policeman tries to catch the criminal without much success", short stays in prison, a slowly burgeoning relationship which is doomed to become a failure and the collapse of the Kray Empire due to a crazy brother. Furthermore a big applause for the scenery and authenticity you can admire. The old London of the '60s revived again in this film. The soundtrack matched perfectly. And then there's also some humor hidden in this film.You can't call this film legendary. It's a mixture of different story lines. The ins and outs of a gangster duo who kept the underworld of London firmly in their grip. Connections with the American mafia is maintained in order to build up a money laundering circuit. The charismatic brother starts a relationship with the lovely Frances (Emily Browning) who hopes that Reggie abandons his gangster life. And the wedge driven by Frances between the two brothers is something Ron can't live with. So he starts reacting totally schizophrenic. The biggest obstacle for me were the dialogs in a fairly heavy English dialect. Especially mumbling Ron was difficult to understand. The only legendary thing about "Legend", was the world performance Tom Hardy had in store.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy rises to expectations..but no the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend depicts a specific period of time of the lives of Britain's most notorious twin brothers, Reggie and Ronnie Kray. Tom Hardy, once again, rises to the challenge in portraying the very different characters of both twins, and does a brilliant job submerging himself in character, specially Ronnie, that you find yourself looking for Tom Hardy trying to establish that it is in fact him playing that character. Hardy, as usual, succeeds in bringing the Krays characters to life, playing the role of Ronnie, the mentally and psychologically unstable brother, as well as the Reggie, the more laid back, smart and romantic brother. Hardy without a doubt deserves the praise for finding it within himself to change his state of mind and alter his perspectives to comply with the transformation into each brother at a time to bring out their individuality but also their complicated relationship.Hardy's brilliance aside, the movie failed to fulfill my eagerness to know more details about the Krays. For example, it had no background history of the Krays and the story is told around the time the Krays had already established their gangster reputation, which I found a bit confusing since I had no information about the brothers before watching the movie. Also, after researching the Krays and reading about them, I found that the movie skipped so many important details of the Krays lives that would have better demonstrated their legendary criminal acts, especially Reggie, when instead it focused on the romantic side of him.Overall, the movie was good and a must watch if you are a fan of Tom Hardy who executed the characters brilliantly. However it could have been a real " Legend" if it had focused a little less on the romantic details and more on the criminal gangster life the Krays truly lived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narrative is all messed up, which is too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By centering this film about an interesting pair of criminals around the Emily Browning character and her narrative, the film is boring, disjointed and uninteresting. Browning herself (and the character as written) basically ruin the film, as the writers attempted to "modernize" a 50-year-old story with "modern" gender perspectives. Why mess with history and ruin the tale? Hardy himself does well enough in the two roles, although the writing really doesn't make the audience care about Ronnie Kray that much. Perhaps that was an impossible task to begin with, of course. Reggie is the only character the audience cares about, and the story is focused enough on him, luckily. However, it should have been presented more from his POV, rather than his wife's. When her narration is edited poorly and ended abruptly with her suicide, the film just doesn't hold itself together well at all. Such as shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legend, not so much perhaps mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so first things first Hardy did a stellar job in portraying both brothers and shortly into the film you forgot that it's the same actor and fully invest in Ronald and Reggie's characters. Unfortunately Hardy's performance aside the film has little else going for it. The themes of the movie seem to change from scene to scene and none are done particularly well. The overriding theme in the movie was 'romance' focused on lovers Frances and Reggie.Now I don't have a problem with a film about the Krays being told from the point of view of Frances but her character is simply under developed. All we are told is that she is fragile with no explanation to what that actually means. She tells the story of how they fell in love, then breezed over some gangster related incidents. suddenly she's popping pills because she's "fragile" no explanation to why (again). although it's clear its related to Reggie some what abandoning her, nevertheless what was wrong with her in the first place and what actually turned her to pills? Well anyway shortly after this she kills herself with said pills. It then becomes a frantic rush back to the gangster plot to squish in everything, that made the Krays story worth telling. Having said that of the few violent scenes we do actually get to see, the quality of them is good. Overall the film has its moments but it just leaves you wanting more and feeling a bit let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opportunity Wasted and comical Ron portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I did enjoy this film, its well shot and the cinematography is great, it felt like London in the 60's, of course Tom Hardy's acting was excellent in regards to Reggie, the difference between the twins easy to see.However, I'm not sure I can recommend it, certainly over the excellent 1990's Kemp brother biopic. The main problem for me was story, surely they missed a trick in really exploring the Kray story and really getting to the facts. I don't feel that I learnt anything new, there was no character development around any of the "firm" who were obviously faces also in the 60's, there was no real clue to their true crime empire apart from a few scenes with a mob boss in an apartment and where was the relationship with their Mother who apparently adored and protected her boys. More importantly where was the grit, I expected more uncomfortable scenes, not because I want to see blood and guts but because the Krays were apparently the most feared gangsters in London. Apart from the George Cornell and Jack McVitie slayings and a dust up in a pub where did that reputation come from. Surely a focus on how that reputation was made could have been a bolder approach.Again I had no real problem that the film was more of a focus on Reggie's relationship with Francis, but again they showed how they got together but the breakdown of the marriage felt forced, it all happened in one scene. Perhaps a lot of this film still lays on the cutting room floor, which is a shame really.Lastly Ron. Obviously a nasty piece of work and Hardy did a good job, but I also found the portrayal a little comically. Anyone in UK who knows the series "Little Britain" may agree. He felt like a caricature by David Walliams.So for me a massive opportunity to really create a Legend of a film but the Directors and writers decided to go safe and not really offer anything new. Apart from Hardy's acting I'm pretty certain this would have gone straight to DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Krays; Legend. This Film not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now the story of the Krays is extremely well known in the UK up and down the country and so when we witness this on screen we know exactly what to expect, Lots of violence, insanity and deceit wrapped up in a twin bow. Now don't get me wrong we see all of this in Legend but by the ending of the film I was left feeling like it was missing something. This is by no means a bad film, In fact its above average but I feel like Tom Hardy's excellent performance pushed it there and the rest was like a hollow shell with not much to offer.My biggest annoyance with the film is there is very rarely scenes where the threat of violence looms which in doing so brings in a tense dramatic atmosphere. A great example of this is the film 'The Equalizer' where a certain restaurant scene made you quiver in fear and awe far more than any actual violence would do. After all its the perfect setting for scenes like that in Legend as The Krays real power came from not violence itself but the threat of it. Now the slight comedy aspect of Legend threw me off a little bit to be honest but after a few attempts it fell into rhythm and worked reasonably well with the film, But by far what made this film was Tom Hardy's performance. It is incredibly difficult to portray not one but two different characters in a single film but he managed it amazingly and there is absolutely no better actor to take on this role. He held this film together and kept you watching through the duller scenes and the long build up. The narration was well done and we got to see another figure in this well known tale have her story told but it never felt truly whole and it sidetracked us from more prominent people in the gang organisation who's faces were rarely seen and their story left unheard. In ending I will say this a great one time watch film and if you're a fan of Tom Hardy as I am then I recommend watching Legend just for his outstanding performance alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Took great subject matter... then took a giant dump on it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An utterly disappointing and very confused film. I could not truly become involved in this film and grew restless watching it. It is surprisingly poorly written. The dialogue is wanting in many places and can appear disjointed at times.The constant use of music from the period, perhaps intended to give "authenticity" ruins any gravitas or drama that this film might have possessed. Am I watching a "good old boy" buddy film? Am I watching a romance? Am I watching a Guy Richie film... the chosen music often makes the film seem almost comical. I half expect to see Vinnie Jones jump out at any second with bungled robberies and a comedy of errors.It goes without saying that the only decent thing about this movie is Tom Hardy's performance - he is truly one of the kings of portraying this East End type of character.Yet even with his excellent performances of both Ron and Reggie, there is only so much he could do with the poor and often disjointed dialogue. The special effects required to make Hardy appear on screen at the same time as both characters also is frequently noticeable and adds a fake air to the film.The lead actress is insufferable. She is irritating as a narrator and even that there is a narrator of this film is irritating and lessens the impact that this film might have had. With the bouffant hair- styles of the 60s, she is the worst walking lollipop I've seen in awhile. Her giant head and twig body makes her look like she is about to topple over at any second.Fans of historical films and of the history of English crime will be sorely disappointed. A much lower-budget film without the big stars, "The Rise of the Krays" makes for much more compelling viewing... by a long way. I would recommend that over this any day.A waste of great subject matter, and a terrible waste of Hardy's talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gangster movie, but not really.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Legend' is a 2015 gangster film set in 1960s' London, written and directed by Academy Award winner Brian Helgeland, writer of L.A. Confidential and Mystic River, and starring Tom Hardy and Emily Browning. As previously stated, the film is set in London, during the 1960s, and it follows the story of two identical twin brothers, Ronald and Reginald Kray, two of the most notorious criminals in British history, struggling to get on top and enter gangster legend. First of all, 'Legend' manages to almost perfectly capture the feel and aesthetics of the period it is set in, along with all the cars, the buildings and even the soundtrack. However, the high point of the movie would have to be Tom Hardy. The British actor pulls off a memorable performance, portraying both of the Krays, and it almost seems as if he is not alone. He plays Reginald as the mature and calculated one ? the one with the brains ? and Roland as the act- now-think-later type. Unfortunately, I had a bit of a problem with Ronald's character; not his character in particular, but mostly with the way he was presented to the audience. The film takes too much time desperately trying to make him as crazy, random and unconventional as possible, it eventually becomes predictable. But he's still better than all the other characters which, except for Reggie, are all one-dimensional. At some points, I found myself unable to distinguish which character is supposed to be who and do what, even though their faces aren't similar. And that is pretty surprising, considering the fact that Brian Helgeland won an Oscar for one of his screenplays. And even if we ignore that problem, the movie still feels so static and boring. Nothing interesting or gangster related thing happens until the final quarter of the runtime. They only kill two people and one of the kills isn't even for ''gangster''-related reasons. All they do is own some clubs and casinos and occasionally do some extortions, and by 'occasionally' I mean once. And the fact that it's shamelessly riddled with obnoxious foreshadowing doesn't help. The biggest problem, however, is that it's not even a gangster movie, which may explain why they don't really do much throughout the movie and I wouldn't have a problem with that if the movie weren't marketed as a gangster movie. Even the narration keeps beating you over the head with the whole 'gangster legend' thing. The film takes way too much time focusing on the relationship between Reginald Kray and his wife, Frances Shea, who, for some reason, narrates the whole movie. Instead of having a gangster movie with occasional glimpses of Reggie's and Frances' relationship, we have a rom-com with occasional glimpses of gangster businesses which are merely gangster related. But that may be just me. However, even if we ignore the fact that it's more of a rom-com than a gangster flick, we are still left with a story that drags out too much and bland, boring characters which serve no purpose. To sum up, I think that 'Legend' is a perfect example of a failed family-friendly gangster film. I don't know what Brian intended to do, but he failed and we were left with an unfinished hybrid of a movie with characters no one cares about and a tiresome, way-too- long and clumsily presented story which focuses on something that should have been kept as background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all love Tom Hardy. He's a great actor for the big screen. This time around we get him playing two characters in one film. Hardy plays Ronnie and Reggie Kray, who ruled the streets of the south side of London during the sixties. Tom handle this duality like a champion, creating two very distinct characters. My favorite performance however, was Hardy as Ronnie Kray, the unstable twin brother. Overall, I did find the narration of the movie a little bit flat. It feels like Goodfellas with a narration, by Reggie Kray's wife, telling their story from her point of view, but It feels too by the numbers and did not have the heart that Goodfellas had.But it did have some good violent scenes that were gruesome and funny, which I lovedGood for Hardy fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little underwhelming... but not a complete waste of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been excited to see "Legend" for quite some time now, and after I saw it, I was a little disappointed. This was for a few reasons; from watching the trailers, I had expected a Guy Ritchie style British crime comedy (such as "Snatch") which I had hoped would work well but I had my doubts because it was, after all, a biopic. To be honest, when it was funny, I thought it was pretty good but then there would be long dramatic "filler" scenes which almost made it feel like watching another film. I didn't always feel the drama that the film was trying to send to audience, and at times I felt that it was a bit forced. Another problem that I found with the film was its story, the problem is it doesn't have a solid story, I couldn't find any narrative and I felt that it was trying to copy the structure of "Goodfellas" - this doesn't work too well because that film is an in-depth character study of life in the mob, while "Legend" gives us little-to-no insight into life as a British gangster, leading me to my next complaint, the characters. Apart from Tom Hardy's dual role, I felt that the rest of the characters were either too weak or underwritten, which isn't too good seeing how Emily Browning's character is our narrator. The rest of the cast, except Hardy is forgettable. However, there are two key reasons to why I enjoyed the film at times, Tom Hardy and the soundtrack. I thought that Hardy was absolutely phenomenal in the leading role as the Kray Twins. He manages to create two separate characters who both possess their own personalities, that is amazing. It's his performance which saves this deeply flawed film for me - I loved it. Finally, I must mention the soundtrack... What a great soundtrack!!! From the very opening scene, we are introduced to Carter Burwell's amazing theme for the film. It is quite effective for the dramatic segments of the film and I found it to be a decent tune by itself. As for the rest of the soundtrack, it was pretty good and did what it had to do as well. That's probably what's so good about the soundtrack, the fact that there was coherence behind it. Overall, it's not a bad film, nothing special either but just above average. I would recommend it for Tom Hardy and the soundtrack. I hope that maybe you could find something which you like about the film too. Thank you for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Legend of Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The jury is still out on 'Legend'. I know it was trying to be a great 'gangsta' film but it never climbed to great heights like I hoped it would nor did it seem to have any particular purpose other than to let the audience know that in 1960's London, the infamous Kray twins ruled the streets. Brian Helgeland, who gave the world the pointless 'A Knight's Tale', has tried to give his Directing career some much needed street cred by tackling the 'Old Darts' notorious Reginald and Ronald Kray and their violent rise and fall on the mean streets of London's East End.Helgeland's version is based on John Pearson's book 'The Profession of Violence' and the movie is told through the eyes of Reggie's unfortunate wife, Frances Shea (Emily Browning). Frances's blind love for her man inevitably leads her down a path that would ultimately challenge her fragile state of mind. Her honest belief that she could change her husband's ways falls on deaf ears as Reggie refuses to see past his own life as a successful 'Club Owner'. Her brother-in-law, Ronnie, knows exactly who HE is and has no problem admitting to his life of blood thirsty crime but Reggie at times seems conflicted. He loves his wife dearly but has tremendous loyalty for his psychotic twin. All said and done, its obvious that Reggie enjoys his life on the wrong side of the law.Tom Hardy is given the enormous challenge of playing both the Kray twins and it is his performance alone that makes 'Legend' more than just a mediocre charmless piece of cinema. Hardy's portrayal of Ronnie Kray is down right scary and amusing as the mentally unstable twin reeks havoc across London without any regard of consequence or respect to his own brother. Hardy moves back and forth seamlessly as both twins, convincing the audience that there just might be two completely different identities on the screen. Hegleland has done a terrific job in bringing Tom Hardy and Tom Hardy together in certain shots and the epic fight scene between the two brothers is quite magnificent. Not for a second did it look unauthentic as Hardy lays into himself with all the ferocity of a heavyweight boxer.Emily Browning seems to take a back seat to Hardy's imposing performance with her delicate presence sometimes going unnoticed. A selection of England's finest actors join in on Helgeland's little playground with both Christopher Eccleston and David Thewlis playing solid roles as Nipper Read and Leslie Payne respectively. Paul Bettany has a cameo as rival gangsta, Charlie Richardson but he is on and off camera quicker than you can tie your own shoe lace.Where 'Legend' is let down is not in the acting but in its narrative. The film doesn't really know what it wants to be. At times it is extremely violent as to say, confronting, and at other moments you can't help but cackle at the amusing dialogue. A lack of an inspiring score creates an emotionless atmosphere that doesn't allow the audience to connect with the film on a deeper level and at 131 minutes long, is a little overdone for what it is. Hegleland could still have told his story in a film that should have been under two hours. Towards the end it became a little tiresome and I couldn't help but look at the time on my phone.It is violent, it is crazy and at times it is amusing but you cannot deny Tom Hardy's performance. Any actor taking on duel roles should be commended and his reputation will not be lost here. He single handedly adds another star to a film that is good but not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not a classic but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First some facts about the film (not these are not spoilers) Facts 1 : Tom Hardy's performances as Ronnie and Reggie Kray are amazing. His acting, coupled with clever effects meant that within minutes you completely forget that these two characters are played by the same man. My partner thought that both Tom Hardys were very handsome ? so I am presuming this will give the film a couple extra stars for the ladies.Fact 2: The film should have been advertised as The Reggie and Frances story. This film centres on Reggie and Frances' marriage and is told by Frances. However, it fails to grip you into this turn of events. Frances is not overly likable as a character and the film fails to show the thrills that must have made someone fall in love someone such a Reggie Kray and while it shows the lows it doesn't overly play them. Yet the majority of the two hours was spent developing/reviewing this love story, it had the potential to go further but didn't live up to it.So what about the film ? is it any good? It was shot well, it had a feel of an Instagram account to it, which gave a sense of ease and comfort to watching.My main complaint is the structure and tempo of the film. The Kray's have so much background material. If I were the director I would have built a trilogy for this story, there's a good cast coupled with a rather British fascination of the Krays which could have been developed well over time. Brian Helgeland's focus on the Frances and Reggie story seems to have missed an opportunity. The bad bits weren't bad enough, the glory bits weren't glorifying enough and the black parts were beyond obvious. The Krays have become a Legend over time, I am not saying that they are people who should be admired but they have none the less gone down in our history, this could and should have been utilised better.The focus on Frances means that the violent and dark parts of the East End in the 60s don't come across. The voice-over by Frances could have been brilliant at implementing this but it barely scratched the surface.The disappointing thing is that this isn't a bad film, it is actually quite good. It isn't boring, but it gives you a sense that it is growing into something that basically never appears - a climax than never happens.It's not a classic, it's too long yet too short at the same time but it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much use of the C word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I liked the way it began, but soon it was quite apparent that the writer of this script was lacking in any real writing skill and imagination. I say this because the entire movie was filled with way too much use of the swear word starting with the letter C. That is one word I really do not like hearing in the first place and this movie just went crazy with using it. I do not know why so many writers think that a movie about tough and rough characters has to be filled with a lot of swearing. There is a way of getting the message across without the over use of swearing. Look at the old gangster movies from the 30s and 40s. You knew that they were terrible people and that they were gangsters and you did not have to sit and listen to a nearly endless stream of swearing. Perhaps today's writers need to go back to school and take some writing classes. They should also buy a dictionary.The acting was good and Tom Hardy did a good job of portraying twins that are so opposite of one another that it is easy to forget that they are actually twins. Some of the story line was also good, and would have been greatly enhanced with a bit more development of some of the other characters (plus less swearing).I was reading the different trivia information that IMDb members posted and noticed that there is another movie about the Krays called The Krays. I have put that on my watch list and I am hoping to be able to see it. I am also hoping that it has more information about the Kray brothers and their "empire" using a better script that contains a great deal less swearing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it wasn't was the performance of Hardy (and credit to Colin Morgan again, good as ever), this would be one of the worst films I've seen in a good while.Whilst this adaption of the Krays 'story' takes a closer look at the Reggie/Frances relationship and the complex nature of the brothers, focusing nothing like as much on their violence, it fails to bring any real sense of connection with what they did.There are time line errors, gaps in the story that surely needed to be there and an almost comical feel to proceedings at times.Some of the fight scenes are nothing short of woeful with punches very obviously pulled and blows that even the shortest sighted of viewers will see don't land! Hardy's acting is well above anything I have seen from him previously. The portrayal of Ronnie is mesmerising. That should also tell you that the film has got to be bad for me to give it 4/10 after such a superb showing from Tom.Why they didn't put as much effort into a storyline that worked as they did into casting is completely lost on me.A huge opportunity missed to tell what is a captivating story from the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie serves a nice story in overall. The biopic seems nice and the events depicted feel significant enough for the movie. But it's strange that the movie left a whole lot of the story behind, leaving them to the narration by Francis. This makes the movie feel severely lacking since there's no adequate transition between scenes. Also this obscures the time perception since the movie didn't really mention the time setting for each event. This makes the distance between each event seems unclear. The movie can really use some montage also as it will improve the storytelling. The acting overall feels great. Tom Hardy did well as the two characters, providing adequate distinction to deepen the story. Yet Emily Browning didn't give enough depth to her character, making Francis look so sad even as she's happy with Reggie. Taron Egerton and Paul Anderson did well to complete the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing central performance in an average film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Legend' is a Crime Thriller Biopic focusing on the lives of twin gangsters Ronald and Reginald Kray at a time where they were large influences in London's East End during the 1950's and 60's. As a crime thriller/gangster film this had many issues but mainly after the 45 minute mark where the tone almost completely flipped and it tried to be a very serious and dramatic retelling. But the biggest highlight for this film and the main reason to maybe check it out is the dual performance by Tom Hardy as both of the Kray twins. This film is a testament to his incredibly diverse acting ability, as he manages to play these two very distinct characters side by side and make the audience look past the actor and see two very different people. Could a Best Actor Nomination be on the way? I don't think so as the year is already pretty stacked with better performances but i wouldn't be against it. The biggest things this film couldn't get right were A) The tone they were going for, and B) What the overall focus of the film was. Firstly, the overall tone of this film was all over the place, it was quite focused in the first 45 minutes apart from 1 or 2 scenes but after that it flips and i kinda lost interest for a lot of the film. The film starts, and it has a pretty quirky tone, there is a blend of some gangster elements and it is introducing the characters, but there is also this very comedic undertone that had me laughing unexpectedly quite a bit. I was really enjoying the film and also confused as i didn't expect a crime thriller to be this funny, and so my hopes for the rest of the film went way up. But then at the 45 minute mark, it seemed as though the person in charge of writing the humour left the film, as that element was completely lost all the way until the credits rolled. I'm not saying it should have been that humorous the whole way through but to go from what it was to just a straight up crime film was quite jarring and i didn't enjoy the film as much as i should. Even after this section where it ditched the comedic tones, it still struggled with whether it was more of a drama or more of a thriller, it never really blended the two together and just jumped back and forth. Maybe this was a flaw, or maybe it was intentional as the film does deal with a paranoid schizophrenic and it did help to keep the film very unpredictable. The other thing was the overall focus of the film. The parts of the film i absolutely loved seeing was definitely the brotherly relationship between Ronald and Reginald. I thought how they interacted together and the way they treated each other at various points throughout the film was very interesting and whenever the film was focusing on them i was completely engaged. But there were times in the film where it felt like the primary focus was with Reginald and the girl he has taken a liking to, i didn't mind that side plot but it would have fit more in moderation. There were times where it started to take over the film and i just wanted to get back to the Krays and so i was getting a little uninterested. The third act also felt quite rushed, there were quite a few moments where the film jumps in time so quickly and it took me a few minutes to realise what the hell was going on.But even though the film seems to be very flawed, there were very interesting dynamics explored with Ronald and Reginald's relationship, and the way the romance in the film occasionally tied in to this main plot i thought was interesting. There were some very interesting moments and events that happen involving the Krays, but i felt like the film didn't give me enough to really understand their influence on London at the time and why they were so notorious. There were hints of it throughout, but despite the characters being interesting, the story itself wasn't as compelling as i wanted it to be.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even Two Tom Hardy's cannot Save Legend's Lacklustre Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a compelling film lurking beneath the surface of 'Legend'. Brief glimpses highlight something greater that sadly never came to fruition.'Legend' is a biopic centered on the infamous Kray twins in London during the sixties; it chronicles their rise to power and eventual downfall.I can see why people would shout their praise for 'Legend', but only if they were completely blind to its numerous flaws. Although I find the film far from gripping it does succeed on a couple of fronts. Tom Hardy offers up an excellent performance as Reggie Kray. You can almost feel the rage building up inside him as the more thoughtful and less brash of the twins. The set design is an important part of the film as it helps you feel like you are watching the narrative unfold during the sixties.One troublesome aspect of 'Legend' is Tom Hardy's other performance as the demented Ronnie Kray, whom at the start of the film is in a mental home. At times Hardy nails the feel of the character acting subdued and lost in his surroundings. Then the other part of his performance kicks in and you become thrown off balance because of how drastically it has changed and for the worst. Ronnie Kray becomes little more than a cartoon character, out of place in the world that Director Brian Helgeland has constructed. Numerous times we are told that Ronnie is a homosexual. Yet, the script is unsure whether this is a laughing matter or not. After all admitting to being a homosexual was considered a severe crime in the sixties. That's where the tone of the film falters; are we supposed to take everything as a joke or at face value? As the character of Frances (Reggie's Girlfriend) would point us towards the latter option.A voice-over should only be used sparingly and if it actually offers us insight into the character's mind. If used all the time it becomes an irritation and takes the audience out of the moment. France's voice- over makes little sense within the context of the film. She offers explanations to events that she was not present at, so how could she know? Frances interrupts the narrative flow of the film on numerous occasions. So much so that the film does not let you figure out anything on your own and the whole affair plays out more like a book than a film. Did the Director forget that film is a visual medium? But, why can't he even trust his audience? It feels insulting and I do not want every single detail spelled out for myself.'Legend' had potential. So what happened? If a polished script was in use then I could see 'Legend' being remembered in years to come. But when your competition is 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas' you have to up your game. Two Tom Hardy's really is not enough if your script is weak and underdeveloped. If a talented Director was given this material then they could at least have made it memorable; instead of becoming the sorely squandered potential that 'Legend' truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legend is a slightly strange title, in whichever sense the word is used. The Krays are the only celebrity criminals in British history; but that is because you can steal more money in legitimate business. Tom's twin turn is superb, but the script doesn't allow for too many fireworks - occasionally Ron comes into his own. The film chooses the popular string of scenes style, which tries to reduce the narrative to a comic strip. But there isn't enough drama to sustain this. The choice of scenes was clearly dictated by how costly it would be to make them look OK. Authenticity isn't attempted, which seems reasonable as the audience probably would consider it costume drama otherwise.Unsurprisingly the film falls to either focus on actual events very closely or being a serious gangster genre film. So we don't get Scarface - and I would recommend re- watching that instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At least where I am, this film has gotten an unfair thrashing from critics. Don't go in expecting it to a typical gangster movie, like say, the Godfather, because it is not. It seems to bounce between wanting to be a quasi-Godfather like movie and also a psychological exploration as to what drove the Kray Brothers during their campaign of terror in 1960s London. The script can be a bit ridiculous at times (read: clichéd and cheesy), but the acting is superb - Tom Hardy plays both Kray Brothers effortlessly to where you forget that the brothers are played by the same actor. Supporting actors like Reggie Kray's wife are great too, but the star is Tom Hardy and he has been unfairly overlooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing a number of TV docs which picked up on the strange mythical status of the "they always looked after their mum" English gangsters the Krays,I was originally not that keen on seeing a film about them,but due to having been impressed by Tom Hardy's performance in the excellent Western The Revenant,I decided that it was time to meet the brothers.The plot:Building a criminal empire in the east end of London,Ronnie &amp; Reggie Kray decide to take advantage of a rival gang being sent to jail for 20 years,by setting their sights on ruling London's underworld.Taking over some of the biggest clubs,the Krays catch the attention of a US gang,who offers to make them partners in crime.Accepting the deal,the Kray's start to become a force to be reckoned with in London,as their personal lives slip away. View on the film:Starting off in the swinging '60s east end,writer/director Brian Helgeland &amp; cinematographer Dick Pope soak the streets in deep blue,which stylishly reveals the Krays to be the "force" on the street. Diving into the era with gliding tracking shots, Helgeland appears determined to wipe any Neo-Noir grit off the slate,as the streets of violence are given a perfect, pristine appearance which is completely at odds with the Krays activities.Loosely based on John Pearson's book The Profession of Violence, (with Helgeland deciding to leave a lot of major real life details out,which includes the third,oldest Kray brother Charlie) Helgeland spends the 2 hour running time no knowing which direction to take the title,as any sign of hard-nose Neo-Noir shots from the brothers are worn down.Wrapping a dire narration about "the kings of London" over the film,Helgeland fails to offer any sense of progression or view under the kneecaps of the Krays,thanks to Helgland pulling the Krays back from every step they take into going deeper into the underworld,to being two boys who love their mum who can't stop delivering hilariously cliché dialogue about their legendary Cockney legacy.Whilst Emily Browning gets torn between showing Frances Shea as a London princess and a tragic case, Tom Hardy gives a performance brimming with confidence as the brothers,as Ronnie's comedic punch is nicely joined by Reggie's sinister gaze in a film that is far from legendary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely Enjoyable Absurdist Black Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this a miss when it came out and you can understand why . Yet another Brit flick featuring gangsters and this time it once again revolves around those poor misunderstood Kray boys . I do remember the pretentious biopic on them from 1990 starring the Kemp twins and that was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons with Steven Berkoff giving the worst performance of any actor in any film ever . And no doubt we'd be getting the usual myth of "They stuck to their own . It was business , we were safe in those days etc" so I found myself watching LEGEND as a mere change from the Oscar bait material I've seen over the last couple of days What the producers and director Brian Helgeland have done is to make a brutal and absurdest black comedy featuring a couple of wannabe gangsters who eventually bite off more than they can chew . Reggie is the brains of the outfit which isn't saying much while Ronnie is the brawn of the outfit which is saying a lot and the film concentrates on Reggie trying to consolidate the gains they make while Ronnie is on self destruct mode while suffering from psychosis and promiscuous . It's probably not a very accurate bio-pic and you constantly get the feeling that the film has take the mere bare bones of the story and rewritten the details to make a very enjoyable film . If you want the true story go and read a book the twins but this approach by the production team works superbly with the first two thirds concentrating on laughs with the tone gradually and subtly changing as the film reaches its end Some things don't work entirely successfully . Ronnie is a little bit too erudite with an idiosyncratic philosophy and it's difficult to believe he had any knowledge of existentialism or pheromones . Likewise Francis Shand voice-over is often a bit too prosaic to be convincing and is slightly intrusive . There also noticeable anachronisms to the dialogue with words like "Horny" which I positive didn't exist in the 1960s These are minor flaws however and I can't think of a British film I've enjoyed more recently and with the award season in full swing I'm slightly disappointed that this one seems relatively ignored because Hardy is Oscar worthy in his dual role . That said one wonders if the subject matter has turned off voters ? Saying that the film doesn't glamorize violence and deconstructs the legend of east end gangsters and makes them the object of fun</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When your mother wears all black to your wedding, you may be marrying the wrong person. Identical twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray rise up in the London underworld of the 1960s. The film is based on a true story. Ronnie is a loose cannon, passive/aggressive, volatile, capricious, impulsive and gay gangster. His greatest strength is also his most obvious weakness in that he speaks the truth and lets his feelings be known, just a bit too bluntly. Reggie is the more restrained and practical one, yet he also has a temper. It isn't a good idea to get either brother angry at you. When their tempers combine or collide, you'd better run.The film is narrated by Frances, Reggie's girlfriend. Tom Hardy performs as both Reggie and Ronnie. I love taking a look at the underworlds of any culture. The characters and settings are fascinating and all the more wonderful because they are real. English to English subtitles are needed however. Tom Hardy was amazing, yet he was overacting. There was too much emphasis placed on him when the other themes, stories and characters needed more attention. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.</fullReview>

The story also sticks to a good chronological order, jumping straight into the years when the twins were in their prime and cutting out their upbringing etc. Would definitely recommend, as one of the best Brit crime flicks I've seen in a long time!</fullReview>

I'm very familiar with the story and this is a good representation so well done, I just don't understand the length with these types of movies, I could of seen a further hour with more in depth facts around the crimes hence 9/10 instead of 10/10.

		<fullReview>Unlike Medak's 1990 depiction of the Brothers, this starts when the Twins were halfway through their rise to power, and is told through the eyes of Frances Shea, Reggie's soon to be wife, and she gives a pretty mundane Bladerunner style narrative throughout the whole film.Although in my opinion, Medak's movie is far superior cast wise (Kemp brothers aside), it seemed to depict the Twins as good old boys, the type where a neighbour would say 'oh they'll do anything for you, but if you ever did them a misfortune, they'll come down on you like a ton of bricks'. And it also seemed in that movie, it was from the point of view of Violet Kray, and Ronnie appeared to be the brains of the outfit.Here, however true the depiction is, it's Reggie for the most part that is the brains, the foundation of the outfit, and Ronnie just seems to be a thorn in the side of the 'firm', the hindrance, and as the film goes along, it's Ronnie who tends to be the films hindrance.It's not the fault of Hardy, he is brilliant, and proves that he is a force to reckoned with, and here he cements the fact that he is one of the most exciting actors around.I feel that Helgeland wanted Ronnie to be truly terrifying, with just a hint of dark humour injected into his character, but toward the end of the film, he only had to appear on screen, and he caused many people in the cinema to laugh out loud. And this took you away from the film momentarily.But as Ronnie's mental health problems start to worsen, Reggie's problems begin to increase, and his tolerance with his brother begins to thin, and his flashes of violence and anger begin to become more frequent, and in turn infect his relationship with Frances. As a film, the narrative doesn't glamorise the brothers too much, and although they appear to be a lot of fun to be around, Helgeland knows that the Twins are psychopaths, and never makes them out to be pseudo-saints (although in one scene, the camera moves away from an incident involving Reggie and Frances, as Helgeland does want you to sympathise with Reggie just a little).There are times in the film where I was reminded of Medak's movie, but that's just history I suppose, and in some respects, I kind of envy people who see this first, as they will go into the film with fresh eyes.But all in all, it's a great movie, the narrative wasn't needed, the technical parts of the film involving Hardy and Hardy are flawless, you really believe that they are doppelgängers and not the work of special effects.But I feel that if you had the cast of the nineties version and replaced the Kemp's with Hardy, it would be up there with The Long Good Friday as one of the all time great British gangster films.And there is one scene in Legend, where Hardy is sitting at a table in a casino.......and he is Bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but redeemed by Hardy's two performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally I am not keen on viewing films about real-life gangsters because I think that is a tendency to humanise them and underplay their villainy. This account of the reign of identical twin brothers Ronnie and Reggie Kray in London's East End of the 1960s is not free of such reservations. Let's start with the title - it seems to suggest fame rather infamy. While there are scenes of appalling violence and brutal murders, most of this vengeance is aimed at other gangsters and their threat to the wider community is glossed over. The police are portrayed as flat-footed, even comic, whereas it took real courage to go after the Krays. At times, the film can't resist going for a laugh which I could have dome without in such a serious story. And then the format, of seeing the narrative through the eyes and words of Reggie's girlfriend/wife Frances (Emily Browning), is very contrived as becomes clear towards the end and only seems to present Reggie as a killer who is nevertheless an incurable romantic.For all these criticisms, writer and director Brian Helgeland has produced a fine movie that captures the spirit of the times and covers a lot of ground in its 131 minutes. Above all, this is a superb platform for two powerful performances from Tom Hardy who plays both twins: the bespectacled, homosexual, mumbling, paranoid schizophrenic Ronnie and the handsome, smooth, calculating, conflicted and loyal Reggie. The viewer almost forgets that there is one actor rather than two on show here and this work must cement Hardy's reputation as one of the finest British actors around (he would make a great Bond). Helgeland presents the story as a kind of love triangle with both Ronnie and Frances vying for Reggie's affections but, like a Shakespearean tragedy, nobody is left standing after the gang and the law have finished their long-running struggle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a real shame. From looking at the trailer it had lot's of potential due to cast, setting, storyline and styling. However it was evident from early on that pretty much all of this failed.Whilst humorous at times, Tom Hardy looked unconvincing in the dual role. Granted, the screenplay of the two different characters was done well and coherently, but the acting was inconsistent for each character. The storyline was a bit of a myth. There is no focus in this film. It's not quite sure whether or not the focus is on the dynamic of the twins, the twin's escapades or Reggie's relationship with Frances.The music for this movie left me distraught. Terrible choices throughout, songs that were more appropriate for a Rom-com.This could have been so much more. 10* for trailer, unfortunately the actual movie ranks much lower.For movies like of this kind to pull off i think the director needs to have a certain mindset.. it seems Helgeland just couldn't see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made violent romantic comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were many aspects of this film to like. Both Tom Hardy performances were excellent, and I cannot imagine any other choice for the lead roles would have worked better. The cinematography and production was also very good with a nicely constructed sixties London. The choice of music also complemented the film well, giving a comprehensive viewing experience. The basic viewpoint of the film was also interesting as it is taken from the double edged sword perspective of Reggie's wife. As an added bonus, it was actually pretty funny too.However, there are many elements of the film that I felt could have been done better. The threat of violence was there, but somehow the film made both characters slightly too smooth to be menacing (this is the intent with Reggie but not with Ron and so the chemistry doesn't quite work). There was also a distinct lack of character development for the other players. Although the focus of the film was clearly meant to be around the brothers and Reggie's wife (Emily Browning) and what those relationships showed about their characters, there were so many other peripheral elements that could have been developed further to make this a more rounded film. The presence of the police was almost an afterthought for example, with the hint of an ominous outcome, but with no real impact other than to say the police were ineffective.Is it worth a watch? Yes. However, do not go in expecting this to be the ultimate Kray movie, as I believe that film is yet to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was pretty good and I didn't know until just now that Tom Hardy played both main characters. I thought the director had found two similar looking actors for the roles. However, for me, the feature of this movie is the choice of clothing that Emily Browning was given to wear to play her part in the movie. I don't know if the garments were based on genuine period pieces or modern creations of 60's designs but whatever, they looked amazing on her. The most exciting aspect of the movie for me was waiting to see what she was wearing next. I'm not a fashion designer or student but I do like clothes and I think the items she wears in this film could easily be worn today. Well done the wardrobe.</fullReview>

It was vaguely familiar but is definitely not on the soundtrack. Heard it twice in the film....could not place it. This particular song is not on the soundtrack. I have listened to the samples on AMAZON that song is missing for sure......anyone else know what song I might be thinking of? It is not "Chapel of Love" but definitely subtle familiar female voices over a familiar melody. It almost sounds like it might be The Ray Charles Singers and I thought at first it was "Love Me With All Your Heart by the Ray Charles Singers ? Anyone know what I might be thinking of ??

		<fullReview>The Legend, a film about the Kray brothers, the notorious London gangster who loved their job from the 60s ("swinging sixties"),is a film for gangster lovers. And when you consider that, in the last few years a very good mood and versatile Tom Hardy is playing a double major role or two physically somewhat similar, but completely different characters, I expected a real cinematic treat. It's for dark theaters and the big screen. Not for TV and laptops. That simply do not make sense. However, I was wrong. Do not get me wrong, this is not a bad movie, much less boring (although lasted over 2 hours and at several places in the pace of decline), and Tom Hardy in it has a double show program. The problem is that it is not nearly as good as it could be, and how topics and miles of it so requires (read biographies of twins and you will understand how important this cinematic story in itself), and it is again the result of a series of wrong decisions copyright. Legend just seems too refined, construed according to the wishes of the audience and ultimately insincere. Although filmed on location in London and the British-French co Legend acts as a generic Hollywood gangster movie and it is responsible screenwriter and director Brian Helgeland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There must be loads of myths about the Krays so I can't go into what's true and what isn't because I don't know and it doesn't matter. All I do know is that I'm glad I didn't know them. For some of us who were alive in the 1960's the name still evokes secondary anxiety, mystery and repulsion, fuelled by newspaper headlines at the time and stories that came out later. The film glamorises them as on the one hand handsome and charismatic and on the other as bullies and racketeers who ruled those who simply wanted a peaceful existence. Thugs who got lucky or cockney princes? The film starts at a point when their life of crime is already a success and is going to get bigger and better. The story of Frances (Shea)is for me a new insight and might explain some of Reginald Kray's (and indeed Ronald's)actions.The setting is nicely evocative of the times, a big plus for me. The script at times is a bit Dick Van Dyke, and as another reviewer said, the violence is cartoonish (think maybe Kingsman church scene on a smaller scale) but it's not meant to be a documentary so that doesn't matter either. If you like a bit of history, a bit of gangster movie, a bit of love interest and a bit of humour - you're in luck.I saw the film twice and recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prospect of Tom Hardy playing one character in a movie is enticing, so the thought of him playing two had me licking my lips. Sadly the result isn't what it could have been. In the past I've found the films Brian Helgeland has directed to be misfires that ultimately had a lot of squandered potential. 'Legend' is no exception. Hardy is as great as he ever is, but the rest of the film is really lacking. You never know if you're supposed to be laughing or intimidated by the violence. Even the violence is often comical itself. While Hardy is great in both the roles he plays (espcially that of 'Ronald Kray') the script and directing really hold him back. Great roles demand great opening scenes where the character completely establishes itself and we are made aware of what we are in for the rest of the film. 'Legend' however is completely void of that scene. Also the narration by Emily Browning's character 'Frances Shea' does not work because nothing she says is the least bit interesting. I think they were trying to take a leaf out of Martin Scorcese's 'Casino' but it failed miserably.The film isn't completely awful, it simply isn't what it could have been, which is disappointing. There are some clever scenes here and there and the odd well timed bit of humour (mostly down to Hardy's delivery) but all this can't save it from being a pretty forgettable 131 minutes. I went in hoping for a brilliant cross between 'Goodfellas' and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. What I got was closer to a very violent episode of 'EastEnders'. Very frustrating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hardy pulls it off ? twice and simultaneously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in primary school in the 1960s when the subject of this real event based film occurred, half a world away in London. And I don't recall the Kray twins from news footage that must have reached our southern shores then either. But this longish gangsters, cops and their associates film provides a convincing view into their world of manipulation and extortion. Tom Hardy, aided by really smooth technology, appears as both identical twin gangsters Reggie and Ronnie Kray, simultaneously in many scenes, and is the glue that holds this captivating film together. I feel for Emily Browning's Frances Shea, who falls for Ronnie but pays the price many times over for her decision. The psychological dimensions of both twins were effectively acknowledged, and contributed to an empathetic understanding of their characters. I'm not sure that the rest of the cast quite reached the same level as the two key leads. But it's a well made film that held my attention for a bit over two hours. The east end London looked spot on to me, aided by Humber and Prefect cars from that time, contrasted with big American cars of the same era emphasising the flashiness of the Kray protagonists. The blood and gore flows, but the portrayal of this aspect of the film is probably a substantially toned down view of the reality of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerous to name it Legend when it becomes a middling muddle of a watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were many parts of this film that left me wanting something more, but it just didn't give.The acting was for the most part great - as Ron, Hardy was at times awesome, showing real and off the rail menace, but did slip towards silliness on a couple of occasions. as Reg, I just didn't get him, he didn't carry it and couldn't convince me of any underlying menace. Now, I spent a large part of my time watching this wondering 'why is this an 18?' something which (I guess) is justified by one scene in my opinion. If this was the reason for rating it thus, then they should have gone to town with it and injected a lot more of what the subject matter could demand - otherwise a 15 would be more appropriate.There were some excellent moments in the film, mainly with Ron in play, where the mix of humour and violence really worked, but again I just felt it was marred by some predictable lead ins and sequences, certainly where the twins were arguing/fighting with themselves, I couldn't really see any emotional tie between them. Difficult to portray I guess, playing both roles.Another issue for me was the soundtrack and film editing. The editing was poor and sometimes it just seemed to move scenes or even years with no cohesion or real nod to the time gone. The 'feel'of scenes changed too, I know this has to happen sometimes of course, but the whole vibe shouldn't change unless the characters drive it.The soundtrack was just utterly misjudged and out of kilter with the film.If it was trying to focus on the romance between Reg and Francis, it didn't really allow enough development or insight to this, but then neither did it offer enough of the gangland side of it to convince. As such it was an aimless film also damaged somewhat by a 'hollywood' touch to it - and I think it may have been much better for this to have been an Amazon or Netflix series, allowing development of both sides of the story. I'm thinking 'Peaky Blinders' as an example of this working well. I'm glad I saw it however, and it was for the most part and entertaining and well done ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legendary story that may not be everyone's cup of tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They were the best years of our lives. They called them the swinging Sixties... and me and my brother ruled London. We were %$#@ untouchable." - Ronnie KrayWalking into the cinema... If you are a Tom Hardy fan, this one delivers two for the price of one. Overall Rating: 3.25 stars Cinematic rating: 3.75 stars Bigger questions rating: 3 stars Ronald and Reginald Kray (Tom Hardy) have been the subject of books, films and the subject matter of London's East Side folklore since the 1950's and 1960's. They were considered some of the most feared gangsters of that era. Even though many people from around the world may not have heard of these brothers, Legend brings forward their story to the world stage and shows their influence on London over two decades. The story is narrated by Reggie's wife, Frances (Emily Browning), from the time she met her husband in their East Side neighbourhood and throughout the highs and lows of their marriage and his criminal activity. The young bride's haunting narrative delivers the bittersweet experience of being married to a gangster. Her coming to the realisation that the most challenging part of life with Reggie would be enduring his twin brother. Director Brian Helgeland's (Mystic River) film is a personal journey through the couple and the brothers' rise and fall within the sorted world of organised crime. He is able to show how family loyalty can have its positives and negatives in regard to business dealings. Reggie being the sensible and measured leader of their gang called "The Firm", sees the value of the psychosis of his brother, which assisted in the muscle and fear that was needed to move the organisation. The challenges come when their personal lives get mixed in with the family business. Reggie's marriage to Frances, Ronnie's homosexual relationships and their brotherly allegiance expose the twins blind spots when it comes to their their criminal dealings. The Kray's tale is one of violence, protection rackets, murder, and familial ties that prove that blood runs deeper than water and ultimately leads to their demise. Tom Hardy continues to prove his acting credibility by taking on both Kray brothers. He convincingly takes on each character and develops each with an exclusivity to their own personalities and life style choices, but managing to capture the unique bond between twins. His portrayal of Reggie is balanced between his charisma and calculated criminal mind. While he manages to provide the ferocious and unpredictable nature of Ronnie, but shows a fierce sibling loyalty. The only difficulty with Hardy taking on these notorious twins, if you know the story, is he is too attractive to portray them accurately. It is not enough to derail the film, but for purists it might be a distraction. Brian Helgeland was able to utilise the right cinematic technology to make this dual role work on screen and it rarely becomes a distraction for the storyline. Emily Browning is able to hold her own against the tour de force that is Tom Hardy. She has matured in her career and characterises the innocence of Frances, but delivers the necessary darkness of her life. To the credit of all involved with the film, the performances were excellent, the script was well thought out and the story is captivating. The only downside to watching Legend is that the nature of the Kray brothers criminal dealings limit the appeal of this biopic. As would be expected with any gangster film, the level of violence and lack of any moral centre leads to a well told story that screams for some light to be allowed into this dark world, but that illumination never arrives. This an honest portrayal of the gangsters lives and pulls no punches, so be warned that this film is a rendering of a tragic and dark world of the criminal underground which may not appeal to every viewers palette. Sibling rivalry and loyalty have been the fodder for a multitude of books, films and are even central to many of the key stories in the Bible. From Joseph and his brothers to Jacob and Esau to the sons of thunder, the apostles James and John, brotherly love shows how deep tensions can run across family lines. The term, 'Am I my brother's keeper?' comes from one of the original and most notorious sibling rivalries, Cain and Abel. The first set of brothers became one of the best known stories of jealousy and murder in human history. Based on it's history, loving your siblings or others can seem an impossibility. Yet, the Bible also tells us that we are to love our brothers and enemies. Showing us that loving our 'brothers' might seem to be an impossibility, but that through God's strength it can be achieved in this lifetime. Leaving the cinema... A brilliantly portrayed story of the dark side of the lives of The Kray brothers. Even though it is a well done, it will probably not be everyone's cup of tea. Reel Dialogue: What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about brotherly love? (Genesis, 4, Roman 12:10, Hebrews 13:1) 2. Can we ever find justice? (Proverbs 21:15, Romans 12:19) 3. What does this life have to offer?

		<shortDescription>An average gangster flick, with Tom hardy giving his career best act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about the Cray brothers Reggie and Ron before watching Legend, and even after watching the film I kind of feel I still don't know too much about them. Though the film was a biopic of sorts of the twin gangster brothers, who ruled London in the 1960s, the film was very confused in its plot. Like was Legend a gangster flick or a love story? The trailer of the film in my opinion doesn't portray the film properly, because people like me going into theaters to watch a film on the 1960s London mafia and except a decent amount of action thrill etc in the film will come out a bit underwhelmed. However this real life inspired film did still have a lot of great moments, mostly thanks to Tom Hardy's career best act, but the film also had faults, but more on that later.Story wise suave,charming and volatile, Reggie Kray and his unstable twin brother Ronnie start to leave their mark on the London underworld in the 1960s. Using violence to get what they want, the siblings orchestrate robberies and murders while running nightclubs and protection rackets. With police Detective Leonard "Nipper" Read hot on their heels, the brothers continue their rapid rise to power and achieve tabloid notoriety.Acting wise Tom Hardy puts his heart in the double role of Cray brothers Reggie and Ronnie. As Ronnie he plays the very complex schizophrenic cray brother who is completely out of control, and in this role Hardy shows great histrionics. As Reggie Hardy plays more of sober, and straightforward gangster who has more brains, and also dabbles in a love life. Hardy must be applauded for making both characters so different, and when both brothers are together on screen you can't tell there both the same actor. And that tells you the greatness of his act.Don't be surprised if Hardy gets a Oscar nominee or even wins best actor, he was that good, its his career best act.The biggest problem in Legend was the muddled,story and screenplay. For example we are not given any back story of how these brothers became gangsters, how they came up in the ranks, we are just shown them already being made men who just rise higher. The plot also gives Reggie's love story too much importance, half the film almost deals with his love story, and though some of those scenes are good, it takes away from being a gangster biopic. The Director seemed like he was confused which genre he wanted to portray more. The films pace was also snail like, and by the end of the film it feels like this 2hr film was more like 3 hrs long. However the film does have Tom Hardy to make up for a lot of the films flaws, he delivers a superb, electrifying act, and whenever his character Ronnie is on screen he makes every scene light up with his literally crazy antics.Watch out for the scene when Ronnie admits he is gay, and the scene were he hammers people to pulp in the bar fight scene these scenes are extremely entertaining. As Reggie his pre climax scene when he stabs a man to death is a highlight. The films clothing's,the cars, the sets, etc were all pitch perfect. The production values were top notch. The films background score was the best I heard for any Hollywood film this year. The film dialogues deserve applause, they were really fiery and impactful.The films action was okay. There are a couple of gory scenes, but thats standard in a movie about gangsters. Overall if your a fan of Tom Hardy, or if your intrigued by the Cray brothers story you can give Legend a watch, its a decent film about the London mafia in the 1960s, but there is a lot still left to be desired in this story. For many they could wait for the film to release on DVD.3/5* or 6/10</fullReview>

Hardy's acting skills, like many of his other films, are put to the test and he's come out triumphant. I couldn't take my eyes off of him and relished in the two different personalities he portrayed. However, the point lost was down to the story written about the Krays. It wasn't true to the behaviour of Reggie Kray and made him out to be a funnier and nicer man than he actually was. Particularly with regards to his wife, who suffered a lot at his hands. The film seemed to avoid too much emphasis on this, and created a more comical version. All in all, fantastic film, fantastic characters and fantastic actors. The steer from the truth is a minor blip, thinking past this the film is an absolute smasher!!

In fact, if you don't know much about the Kray twins, there's too many unanswered questions, It's difficult to grasp the story behind the character. The ending didn't grasp you emotionally. All the top films do that, they make you empathise and sympathise with the bad guy, you know about all they've been through, so when he gets the sh-it, you feel it too. Also the sound was wack, sound effects play an important part to build the mood.The film has plenty of one liners and Hardy has many catchphrases to play with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lovable club owner Reg wants nothing more than to settle into domestic bliss with the gorgeous Frances: if only it wasn't for the fixes his dozy twin Ron keeps getting them into, especially when he doesn't take his tablets! And then there's that annoying Nipper Of The Yard, constantly being a nuisance...Let's get one thing straight: Tom Hardy does a phenomenal job of creating Ronnie and Reggie Kray as two distinct and distinctive characters, and the special effects used to put the two twins together through much of the film are so good that you are never aware of them. And it is a fact that this film is very entertaining, if overflowing with profanity (and I would not argue that the profanity is out of place).I saw this in a fairly full cinema. A lot of the audience were Women Of A Certain Age who, I suspect, had come along in order to get a double dose of Tom Hardy (it wasn't as uncomfortable as when I was the only man in the audience for magic Mike. I digress). The point is that there was a lot of laughter during the film, and the laughter sometimes came at the most inappropriate moments ? Ron makes a quip after blowing the back of George Cornell's head off: call me a reactionary old traditionalist, but I don't think that's very funny, personally.The film does show us some savagery but, when it does so (Reggie killing Jack The Hat, the murder which saw him put away for the rest of his life), it provides a large chunk of mitigation for it. The Krays are made very sympathetic in this film and, while one appreciates that they were something of folk heroes in their local patch, the fact remains that they were ruthless, murderous thugs, and this film does rather obfuscate that by portraying them as a couple of lovable lads living in an offshoot of sitcomland. It's a good film, but with a worrying absence of moral judgement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterclass in acting from Tom Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess if you want to know the history of the Kray Twins, you can google it and I'm sure all the historical facts will be there. The thing which makes this film so good, is everything about it. You could be tempted to say as I have in my heading , it is a masterclass in acting but it is just so good in all other respects right down to the two brief cameos by John Sessions as Lord somebody to Kevin McNally as Harld Wilson.Everything about it was utterly believable without all the stylised stereo types we have grown accustomed to with films about East End gangsters. Oh yes and whilst we see blood occasionally it didn't take on the proportions of a cartoon which again seems to be the stock in trade of most Hollywood efforts. This was an extremely well made film about real people who were larger than life characters but at no point did it stray into caricature largely due to excellent directing and outstanding performances from Tom Hardy , ably supported by Emily Browning Paul Bettany and of course Chris Eccleston. The periodness seemed perfect to me again without all the silly stereotypes associated with films set at this period and the street sets were stunning in their film noir appeal . If Tom Hardy doesn't get at least nominated for an Oscar then there is no justice but the entire production was nothing short of superb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second Time Around Not Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to this film with high hopes. I expected a grittier, meaner and, perhaps, even shocking version of what I already knew to be a gritty, mean and shocking story. "The Krays" was a film that really hit the bulls-eye. Unfortunately, Martin Scorsese made a movie that same year ("Goodfellas") and it was so powerful that it just made "The Krays" seem a bit weak, somehow. But that's the problem with movies that don't hit you over the head, but try to sneak it in with room-service. "The Krays" was a very British version of a brutal gang-land movie. The unfortunate fact that "Goodfellas" merged with it somehow in the imagination of film critics doesn't make "The Krays" into something less. "The Krays" was a work of genius, albeit one in which the psychology of brutes is explored in a way that make no effort to arrive at moral judgments. The Kray brothers were weird and dangerous. To make a new movie about them would, it seems to me, invite the filmmaker to explore just how weird and dangerous they were. Where that might lead, I don't know.I don't believe we'll ever know, because "Legend" is a bit flat. It really isn't about anything shocking or weird, and that's probably because the filmmakers lost their nerve. It just isn't weird enough to cause nightmares, and when you're following an act like "The Krays" you really should try, at least, to arrive at that place where nightmares are a possibility. "Legend" is just a flat and remarkably dull telling of the same story. No surprises. Nothing really disturbing. Just two lads being naughty.Well, I expected more. I expected something truly perverse--and I'm not afraid to admit it. "Legend" would have shocked audiences in 1970. It would have raised every hair on your head in 1960. It says something about how things are now that, today, it doesn't even raise an eyebrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardy's surpassing talent wasted on a long drawn out boring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It goes without saying that Hardy's performance is out of this world in this film. He majestically masters the dual role of the Kray brothers, squandering nonetheless and much to my regret a wealth of talent against the backdrop of a story which I personally found boring and rather long drawn-out. The beginning seemed promising, but the initial effervescence started to fizzle out miserably when we are peppered with a series of isolated occurrences randomly depicting the Kray's wrongdoings that barely have interconnection or worse still some of them are lacking in completion. The film is also romantic to a fault which contributes to defeating the purpose of the violent and savage nuance that was expected of it. It seems to center on Ronnie's romance with Frances, rather than focusing more on the two brothers' ruffianly and reckless misdeeds. Apart from Tom Hardy's superb performance, the film is not something exciting to write home about; primarily because it doesn't produce, at least in me, the desired exhilarating results of having watched an entertaining epic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I drove a half an hour just to see this movie. Tom Hardy is one of my favorite actors and seeing him play two gangsters in the same film? Yeah count me in. The problem is the film around Hardy isn't all that interesting. There are moments of greatness but it's lengthy runtime (or at least it felt long), unoriginal direction, and a messy script can only take Hardy's great performance so far.The movie does however deliver on what the marketing promised, two great Tom Hardy performances. Not only is he unrecognizable as Ronnie Kray, but the scenes with both brothers on screen are seamless. Those are by far the highlight of the film. The strange but real relationship between these brothers parading through London during the 1960's as gangsters should have made for a great film. Moments come and go where you can see shades of the great gangster pictures, but the film doesn't come together as well as it should have.However, a definitive highlight from the acting side besides Hardy is Emily Browning. I thought she was exceptional as Reggie's wife. Some also may have an issue with Hardy's other performance as Ronnie, which can be understood as some of his actions turn out to be more cartoon-ish than realistic, but when the two are on screen together, it's magic. Overall, the film is worth the price of admission if you're a Tom Hardy fan, but don't expect much in terms of a fluid and functionally directed picture.+Hardy+Great individual scenes+Browning-Sloppy script-The story doesn't pop6.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Language not fit for decent people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when it was recently decided that the "N" word is so hateful and hurtful that we're not going to use it anymore? This movie was so filled with a word that we'll call the "C" word, it was actually unbelievable. This attack at women is so disgusting, so vulgar, can we just agree that we have enough decency left to never permit this word to be uttered again? Do you realize that this is exactly how words like this get passed from generation to generation? Mindlessly, without thought, without any consideration. And, as bad as it is in a movie like this to have men saying it over and over again, it's even worse when a woman says it, trying to be "cool" and "equal". Who would want to be equal to anyone living in the gutter who says this? Let's demand more, shall we?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Crime Drama That's Completely Devoid Of Any Sort Of Escalation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite featuring Tom Hardy in not one but two roles, Legend still ends up falling incredibly short of whatever it was trying to accomplish for the story about the notorious Kray twins &amp; their organised crime empire in the East End of London during the 1950s &amp; 1960s which its writer-director attempts to bring to life on the film canvas is absolutely devoid of any sort of escalation.Legend chronicles the rise &amp; fall of the Kray twins, two of Britain's most infamous gangsters who rose to power by controlling a larger part of London's criminal underground. The plot is more focused on Reggie's life and follows his journey, covering the start of Kray empire, his stint with love, and the blood bond that keeps the twins together despite their differing modus operandi.Written &amp; directed by Brian Helgeland, Legend begins on an promising note but very soon, all that promise goes out of the window as the story just keeps going around in circles. The entire movie is, more or less, one flimsy moment after another and stays on the same level throughout its runtime and even Helgeland's efforts to bring conflict into the story fails to leave any lasting impression.Coming to the performances, Tom Hardy steers the film past its finish line despite it running out of fuel before the halfway mark and does a good job in his dual role of Reggie &amp; Ronnie Kray, the former being a levelheaded, calculative &amp; charming Kray of the two while the latter is a violence-oriented psychopath. Plus, Hardy gets fine support from Emily Browning &amp; David Thewlis who play Reggie's love interest &amp; Krays' business manager, respectively.On an overall scale, Legend had all the ingredients &amp; a capable cast to succeed as one thrilling crime drama but thanks to improper execution of its plot &amp; its failure to dig deeper into the moments that had little glimpses of greatness, it finishes as a bland, flavourless &amp; highly mediocre movie that left me quite unaffected in the end. A disappointing, forgettable &amp; lacklustre cinema that's completely oblivious of its very own potential, Legend isn't worthy of your time &amp; money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film with a stunning central performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some poor films recently, e.g. 'No Escape' and (on DVD) 'The Holiday'. But 'Legend' makes up for them. It's a riveting film with a stunning performance by Tom Hardy as both Ronnie and Reggie Kray. His split-screen role never seems odd and his acting is simply spellbinding. The film has its faults. It's too visually arresting at times. A little less gloss and a little more spit and sawdust would have been appropriate. Some of the external scenes seem more like studio ones such is their overly pristine nature. And the character of Frances, Reggie's girlfriend, is not adequately developed. The reasons for her mental fragility are not properly explored. The soundtrack is superb. There are scenes of graphic violence but they are wholly germane to the film's theme. The talented supporting cast is uniformly excellent. But, above all, 'Legend' is Hardy's film. I rate it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fox News and CNN's Anderson Cooper won't repeat . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . the names of serial killers or mass shooters, unless they're Islamists. Instead, they run "One Shining Moment"-type music (like at the end of the March Madness Title Game) over a victims' photo collage as soon as they can get their paws on some pictures. But this artificial Grief Porn doesn't change the fact that there's never been so much as a made-for-TV or even a direct-to-video feature film made about any previously anonymous victim of either a mass killing or a serial slayer. "The Krays," on the other hand, have had at least TWO feature films playing on the Big Screen (including current release LEGEND) to carefully detail their sordid gangster careers and all the people they killed. The nationwide Family Video chain in America has carried multiple flicks about John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Ted Bundy because that's just what U.S. citizens crave in the way of family entertainment. Anderson Cooper and Fox News do Americans a great disservice in making us wait five or ten years for the mass and serial killer details we have a right to learn for our own protection. Someone's going to make a killing when they give Americans the All-Crime, All-the-Time channel they so desperately need and crave!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film with an amazing performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this film had me so excited for this film and I can report that this film does not disappoint because it is fantastic. The premise of this film sees two identical brothers who are the biggest gangsters in London and sees there rise to power. Now tom hardy plays Reggie and ron kray and my goodness this is the best acting I have seen because of how unique it is and how different the two characters are. First to the lead Reggie, he is the charming one of the two and you truly see that as the film grows and he is complex but flawed at the same time. He had allot of confidence and swagger but you see sometimes how low his confidence can get. Then you get to ron and he is one of the funniest characters of the year. You can tell there just isn't something right with him but he is lovable and you end up liking his character. Emily browning plays Reggie's wife and she does a great job in this film. She truly brings out the humanity in both of the krays and she was a great cog in this film. Taron Edgerton was good in this film even though he didn't have a huge role I'm looking forward to seeing him in more things in the future. The story is fantastic just seeing these two completely different brothers interact and rise in power is enthralling. Also the romance was great in the film really adding a great emotional level to the film. The script is utterly amazing, the humour is constant and it always works. The drama was all fantastic too and brings the best out of the story and characters. The style of the action scenes were fantastic and really were great when they happened. However, there is a bit of a pacing issue in the film and it does hurt the film overall. Overall this is a fantastic dramatic film with two performances worthy of an Oscar by tom hardy and is a must see.</fullReview>
