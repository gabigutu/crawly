		<shortDescription>Ambivalence hurts this comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maggie's Plan (screened at the 59th San Francisco International Film Festival), along with many indie films like it, uses a more ambivalent tone in regards to a character's reaction to dramatic shifts in their lives. It's a popular approach towards acting these days, but it can sometimes make a film seem like it is mocking a situation that should otherwise be dealt with in a genuine and serious way- even if it is a comedy.Greta Gerwig plays Maggie, a teacher at a local university. She is single and seeking to have a baby on her own very soon. She begins spending time with John (Ethan Hawke), another teacher, who is married to Georgette (Julianne Moore). Maggie agrees to give John notes on his book that he is writing, and soon the two fall in love. They consummate their relationship the very night Maggie has inseminated herself with sperm from a guy she knew from High School. Three years later John and Maggie are married and have a beautiful three-year-old daughter. However, Maggie is done with John and realizes she doesn't love him anymore, so she hatches a plan to get him to back together with his former wife.As the film is called Maggie's Plan, it may have been better to only follow her around the whole time. She is a character with a quirky nature in a cast full of overtly strange characters. If the story remained firmly told from her perspective, rather than from others in the film, she may have stood out more, and her motivation might not have been lost. Instead, everyone is just as quirky and just as detached as her, making it hard to become attached to any of them, as none of them feel like they are taking their lives seriously.Gerwig (Frances Ha) is a good character actress, and she manages to represent what this kind of millennial character is supposed to be according to the world: passionate but passive about their interests. With no genuine moments or emotions. She's like a more idiosyncratic blonde Zooey Deschanel; usually this shtick works for her, but this story is so fraught with what should be pure human emotions that it lessens the impact of the situation.Julianne Moore's Georgette is an intimidating character. Moore sports a very confusing European accent, the only reason seeming to be that it adds even more quirkiness to the movie. She has an almost militaristic strategy towards raising her and John's children and how she approaches her relationship with John. In one scene, she says Maggie ruined her life by taking her husband, but she is completely passive about it when it comes to her actions. She's the most well adjusted wronged woman in the world. This is an example of how the characters will talk about emotion and love but perform no action to back it up. Ethan Hawke's John is such a clueless man that it's kind of sad. He works and works on this book that he is writing so much so that he doesn't even notice the games the women around him are playing with his life.There are some truly fun and funny moments in the film, which comes naturally with such a tone. Maggie's interactions with the children are amusing, and she has a few good one- liners in there about the state of relationships. Director Rebecca Miller (The Private Lives of Pippa Lee) may just love this type of film making, which is fine; she is in the same camp as Jim Jarmusch and Yorgos Lanthimos. The ambivalent formula does work for many people, but it seems counter intuitive to make light of love and marriage while also insisting how important it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a Woody Allen wannabe. It doesn't rate the noble title of, "Screwball Comedy," because the contrived and humorless "humor" doesn't come close to that sparkling genre of yesteryear. To compare the film to the likes of, "Bringing Up Baby," or "My Man Godfrey" is sheer wishful thinking, either on the part of the viewer, and/or the writer-director. Miller's work never seems to rise above film school caliber, with incoherent plot lines, annoying characters and an overall quality that this writer-director has no greater message or story to convey without having to resort to the bizarre. The incestuous overtones between father and daughter in, "The Ballad of Jack and Rose," or, in the novel, "Jacob's Folly," a human being reincarnated into an oversexed fly come to mind. This is the story of Maggie (Greta Gerwig), a control-freak who can't maintain a relationship but wants a child, and decides to achieve this end by artificial insemination using the semen of a--pickle entrepreneur. Seriously. In a disgusting scene Gerwig, spreadeagled, inseminates herself with a turkey baster only to have the married John (Ethan Hawke) show up at her place to declare his love for her. Another example of the Self-Absorbed so prevalent in this movie, John is unhappily married to the highly successful Georgette, played by Julianne Moore using an accent that's supposed to be Danish, but sounds like something between bad Eva Braun and Frau Bluuker from "Young Frankenstein." The impression left by John's sudden love of Maggie ties into the fact that she loves the book he has been writing for years while his current wife ignores it. In poor story construction, from the night John shows up at Maggie's place and has sex with her apres her self-insemination, a sudden jump of three years into the future finds the couple now married to one another--unhappily--with a child of their own. John has turned out to be a deadbeat non-supporter who saddles Maggie with the bread winning, housework and child rearing, including his children from his previous marriage to Georgette still absorbed in writing the book he has never finished. So Maggie devises a plan to reunite Georgette and John once again, freeing her to the happy realm of single motherhood. We're supposed to sympathize with, or find amusing, this ditz who has no compunction to get involved with a married man, marry him, uproot his children, and then wants a divorce from him because she can't live with the consequences of her actions. I wish it could be said this movie had lines worth mentioning. It defeats the purpose of a dialogue-driven movie when the script is mediocre and not in the least bit funny. Ethan Hawke does a good job of playing the deadbeat John as though he's wise enough as an actor to know he is in a film of not much importance and doesn't take the job too seriously. Greta Gerwig has a field day once again, playing Greta Gerwig in an Indie film, a serious reincarnation of all her previous roles. Somehow, it gets tiresome. If you enjoy films about self-absorbed New Yorkers who relate only to their own shallow inner circles, this might be your cup of tea. Especially if you equate far flung sympathy to their apocalyptic over reaction when their selfish and shallow plans, that no one else can truly relate to, except perhaps for a spoiled brat with a trust fund fall through, makes you find this relative or amusing. But overall, the feel and execution of this film reminds me of rushed, school girl projects hashed out at the last minute in a college dorm. It's an arrogant attempt to paint modern life into the slanted cosmic view of the writer and director, all the while leaving the strong impression this person knows nothing of the real world, or life, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An indie film without indie charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among many other things, the best dialogue-driven character studies can create a sense of real connectedness between the viewer and the people depicted on screen. If well narrated, those films can serve as a mirror to your own experiences or open up new perspectives on life in general. Directors that have managed to achieve this in the past like (the early) Woody Allen or Noah Baumbach are also often named as references when it comes to Rebecca Miller's latest film Maggie's Plan.Indeed, when you saw the trailer, you got the feeling a new Baumbach is coming up: set in New York, starring Greta Gerwig playing a Gerta Gerwig-character and a plot revolving around existential questions of a group of well-educated, slightly quirky people. I love all of these elements and mixed with a cast including Ethan Hawke and Julianne Moore I was very excited to see this film.However, the aspects of indie films I mentioned above which I deem so important are all missing here. Once you have accepted the awkward premise (which is far-fetched enough) that the protagonist Maggie (Greta Gerwig) desperately wants to reunite her husband John (Ethan Hawke) with his ex-wife (Julianne Moore), the film misses all its chances to handle the characters' issues with precision and depth. This starts with the poor writing which does include some amusing lines and interesting insights (my favourite being John's take on unborn babies) but still fails to make the characters' motivations and intentions appear reasonable. Despite the fact that they are always quite short, films like The Squid and the Whale never feel rushed. In Maggie's Plan we see many rapid developments and turns in attitude that are often hard to make sense of.Apart from problems in the script, the film suffers from the way it is directed. One major element is a trope that is more than predominant in recent cinema which comes down to a formula many directors seem to have internalised deeply: Shaky camera = Authenticity. In order to immerse the viewer within a scene, many films employ this technique, however in many cases in such a exaggerated manner that it becomes a parody of itself (Exhibit A: The Hunger Games; Counterexample (how it should be done): Children of Men). The same is the case in Maggie's Plan. It is the film's ambition to live up to its predecessors by offering a perspective that feels true to life. But unnecessary zoom-ins, shakes and pans occasionally disrupt the viewing experience. Films that rely on quiet, emotional scenes like this one benefit from a rather still, observant depiction, so that the viewer likely forgets that there is a camera.Having said all this, I still consider Maggie's Plan an average film which is mostly due to the cast. The actors do what they can to give the weird script at least some emotional depth (even though I add Julianne Moore's choice of accent to the list of things that bewildered me). My harsh critique is probably due to high expectations. But I just didn't assume they were that high, as I would have been happy, if some main elements that separate these kinds of films from major blockbusters had been displayed.My main concern with this review is to counter the many voices comparing this film to indie masterpieces like Frances Ha or Annie Hall. Maggie's Plan is not even close to being in the same league. To quote Pulp Fiction, it is not even the same sport.</fullReview>

I honestly can't tell if this is all an elaborate trolling effort.The only humor in this "comedy" are a few bitter lines from the comedians.I would write more, but honestly, there's nothing more to say.

		<shortDescription>Smart with heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Allen by way of Noah Baumbach is as close as I can come to give you an idea of how amusing, smart, and awkward Rebecca Miller's Maggie's Plan is. But, then, the adjectives as well describe indie-fav Greta Gerwig playing Maggie, whose plan to send her husband back to his ex wife reveals the layers that make Maggie one of the most complex romantic heroines in film.Having fallen in love with hot "ficto-critical anthropologist" John (Ethan Hawke) at The New School, where she works as a career counselor for grad students, Maggie in her quietly innocent but manipulative way has a child with him after his divorce and their marriage. One of the comedic elements is her previous plan to have an artificial insemination from hippy pickle entrepreneur Guy (Travis Fimmel). She has no need to produce the baby in a normal way, an eccentricity never explained but for me felt to be another facet of her quirky and honest personality.Although you can see the goofy and formulaic elements, underneath is Maggie's genuine wish to have a normal love, a situation not really meant for her given her wacky judgment and clueless orientation. Throughout the wryly wacky plot are numerous elements of truth in modern culture: having a child purposely without father involved; career taking precedence over family (Julienne Moore as high-powered ex-wife academic); step kids as complicating elements; and so on.Writer/director Miller is deft at playing the elements off each other to make it feel as if all of this confusion is just part of a larger plan. Maggie, as a self-confessed meddler, goes through a labor-intensive series of challenges that go beyond the clichés of the romantic comedy formula. Although the accumulation of challenges may seem too many, each one resonates with a human predicament common to us all.It's romantic comedy with brains and heart. So human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous (as it is so empty)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing at all in it. It looks like a children fairy tail with poor characters. The story is predictable, the screenplay is boring, the way actors play is mediocre, the characterization is ridicule. I decided to go see this movie as I've read good reviews on cinema websites and I couldn't help but notice these days people don't really evaluate movies for what they are. In this case, a waste of time and money. As Julianne Moore can still be saved (still, why do good actors accept such poor screenplays?), the movie itself is a low-concentrate of fine sentiments, romantic narrative and some (few) absurd situations which should be funny but they actually aren't. It can easily enter the top 3 worst movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maggie's plan: Realism could be Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maggie's Plan is a (quite depressing) story about our selfishness, our pointless lives and our capricious nature. It's, under many respects, a good film: it has quality dialogue and the plot is coherent to itself from the beginning to the end. Rebecca Miller moreover showed talent and an unquestionable sincerity, which is what I appreciated the most.But she's not ironic, whereas she should be (people struggling to survive, all over the world, would agree with me), as if she were too involved with her characters. This made movie's theme more psychoanalytical than universal, which is poorly catching. Realism could be boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Maggie's Plan"is a screwball comedy. Of screwball comedies, the less said the better unless. (Could anyone summarize 'Bringing Up Baby,' and what would it mean if he succeeded?) All you need to know is that Maggie (Greta Gerwig) hears her clock ticking and decides to have a baby husband or no. As the case is NO, she finds a donor and self- inseminates; and then everything goes to hell in a hilarious handbasket, which is to say there is an endless series of complications as the nest-laid plans of Maggie and pals gang agley about as aft as possible. Gerwig's terrific and so is everyone else: Ethan Hawke, Julianne Moore, Maya Rudolph and some winsome kids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the pickle enterprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. A significant portion of Woody Allen's film career has been projects that seem designed to appeal to (sometimes only) the New York intellectual sub-culture. You know the type ? those who thrive on talking (incessantly) about all the things they know, often without really accomplishing anything themselves. They are the kind of people we usually laugh at, rather than with. Filmmaker Rebecca Miller appears ready to accept the passing of the Woody Allen baton, and at a minimum, her latest is heavily influenced by his comedic-brain food.Ms. Miller casts perfectly for her first film in six plus years (The Secret Life of Pippa Lee, 2009). Greta Gerwig plays Maggie, whose ever-evolving "plan" is both the title and focus of the film. Ethan Hawke plays John, the middle-aged crisis guy who wants desperately to be showered with attention. Julianne Moore plays Georgette, John's slightly odd and brilliant wife, and mother to their two kids. Other key players include Travis Fimmel as Guy, a pickle entrepreneur and the center piece to Maggie's master plan; Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph as friends and confidants of Maggie; and Wallace Shawn, always a treat on screen.The story starts out pretty simple, and then gets complicated, and then kind of loses focus before ending just right. Perpetually whining Maggie has admittedly given up on ever finding the kind of true love that results in a happy family. Because of this, she has recruited former schoolmate and math whiz and pickle dude Guy to supply the missing link for her artificial insemination. This leads to one of film's rare cheap laughs and one that not even the quirky Gerwig can pull off. A payroll mishap brings Maggie and aspiring novelist John (a 'ficto-critical anthropologist' by trade) together, and her willingness to read his writing and offer some support, is all it takes to finish off John's slowly disintegrating marriage to Georgette (Ms. Moore dusting off the Euro accent she used in The Big Lebowski).Writer/director Miller is the daughter of famed playwright Arthur Miller, who wrote Death of a Salesman and was once married to Marilyn Monroe (after Joe DiMaggio). She also directed The Ballad of Jack and Rose, which starred her husband, Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis. Much of her latest film feels contrived and over-written ? as if every scene carries the burden of generating a laugh out loud moment. It shouldn't be too surprising that the ultra talented Julianne Moore creates the most interesting character, though unfortunately, she has the least amount of screen time among the three leads. It's good for a few laughs, as well as some cringing ? and an ending that actually works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are some very good aspects to this and it is worth seeing, but really I was a little disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I thought I was rescuing him from her." Maggie (Gerwig) is a strong single woman who wants a baby, without the complications of having a man in her life. When she meets John (Hawke) her plans change. He leaves his wife and the two start a life together. 3 years later Maggie begins to rethink her decision and wonders if she can undue her mistake. This is a movie that tried so hard to be be good. It was a different kind of love story that attempted to show the fallout from a whirlwind affair. The problem, to me, was that it was just so slow moving and a little repetitive that it made it hard to stay interested in. There is also one big thing that both helped and hurt the movie; Ethan Hawke. He helped it because he is a very good actor and really plays this part perfect. He hurt the movie because it make me think back to the Before Sunrise series and when compared to those movies this one just isn't near as good. There are some very good aspects to this and it is worth seeing, but really I was a little disappointed. Overall, a movie that could have been really good but it was just missing something to keep it from being a little dull and repetitive. I give this a C+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a richly satirical, funny and entertaining post-feminist comedy about sex and marriage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The eternal triangle and the romantic comedy have been soulmates forever but how many ways you can tell the same old love story? The era of female empowerment and emotional recycling is upon us, so it is refreshing to see Maggie's Plan (2016) take an old story formula and update it with offbeat humour centred on modern marriage. Contemporary lifestyle choices such as wanting a baby but not a man or handing a used lover back to a former owner are just some of the scenarios played out in this intelligent and delightful rom-rom.The simple triangular plot pivots on independent-minded Maggie (Greta Gerwig), an over-controller who loves falling in love but cannot keep a relationship longer than six months. Wanting a baby without the strings, she arranges for a sperm donor just as she meets John (Ethan Hawke), an insecure academic who is emasculated by the stellar career of his imperious wife Georgette (Julianne Moore). John's need for constant mothering is no longer fulfilled by the dynamic Georgette, so Maggie and John inevitably pair up and one corner of the triangle disappears. Three years later, Maggie is over the needy John and his permanently incomplete 'great novel' so she hatches a plan to reunite John with Georgette. A clever script laced with tangled textual barbs like "ficto-critical anthropology" (Google it) and one-liners like "nobody unpacks commodity fetishism like you do" are rapid-fire and hilarious send-ups of the pretentious world of academe. It is at this level that the film shines brightest: not with belly laughs or madcap comedy, but through a whimsical lens focused on the world of intelligent people who think they control the ebbs and flows of the uncontrollable.The acting performances are all top-shelf. Julianne Moore plays the understated dominatrix with a hilarious deadpan Danish accent, and Ethan Hawke is perfect as the hapless male out-powered by the females in his life. The standout performance is Greta Gerwig whose big doe-eyed innocence and naivety about the ways of the world make her scheming utterly forgivable. While the story has a predictable narrative arc, the dialogue is richly satirical, funny and totally female-centered. It is also an entertaining post-feminist comedy about sex and marriage which imagines a future where males are only needed for sperm and are then recycled amongst whoever will tolerate their innate weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Subtle, nice, funny, lovely, smart, wise &amp; warm, this is a brilliant tale of relationships in our time. A young woman, Maggie, looks at her failures in coupling and decides to have a child alone, before hooking up with a married man, John. After a great barrage of conception gags, the film settles into a deeper exploration of blended family dynamics and good-girl behaviour.Maggie, Greta Gerwig (Frances Ha, Mistress America), falls in love with John, Ethan Hawke (Boyhood) destroying his volatile marriage to the brilliant and difficult Georgette, Julianne Moore (Almost Heaven, The Kids are Alright, Still Alice).Greta Gerwig plays a slightly deeper and more rounded young New Yorker than her 2 brilliant previous efforts &amp; Ethan Hawke again creates a deeply flawed yet sympathetic father as he did in Boyhood. Julianne Moore entertainingly pushes the boundaries of her comfort zone as a fierce Danish academic in a supporting role. The trio's 3 children are also terrific.Set in NYC, you have to be reminded of Woody Allen and he'd be proud if he'd made this one; a brilliant piece of cinema in every way. Maggie's Plan is an original, timeless but contemporary story full of domestic tension, rich characters, interesting locations and beguiling images. The writer/director is Rebecca Miller, daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Arthur Miller (Death of a Salesman, The Crucible, Streetcar Named Desire).I loved it for its intelligence and I laughed a lot right up until the satisfying ending. At 99 minutes it's taut, neat and spot-on with modern love issues. One of the year's best so far, 4 &amp; ? stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greta Gerwig as "Maggie" (an independent woman) bakes up a plan to become a single mother and in the process 'the plan' works but then backfires and puts her into a situation 'the plan' did not include - marriage.Gerwig gives a charming performance as Maggie steering a course through a relationship with a overly analytical writer once divorced husband, raising her three year old child, working her job as an instructor in a local college, and realizing her husband is still in love with his first wife! Maggie is in a pickle so she devises another plan!The setting is the New York City intellectual society living in row houses and meeting in cafe's to socialize. The cast includes Bill Hader, Ethan Hawke, Maya Rudolph, Julianne Moore, Wallace Shawn. This is a simple 'slice of life' type story about modern people looking for and finding happiness and direction in their life. It's probably a film more appreciated by a viewer that likes a romantic flavor in a story that looks into the feelings and emotion in the human spirit.This is a cheerful light story that includes just a touch of sorrow mixed into a picture of mostly happy people getting on with life. And don't forget the pickles!</fullReview>

There is also not a really exciting moment..but that is Greta's style. Subtlety..with clever pretense..clever dialogue..clever situations..clever..clever...clever..And, as always, it's Gerwig's persona that is so uniquely compelling. Let me repeat..Greta Gerwig is a very unique persona, unique in a very delightful way. That innocent, humble,honest, center is surrounded by an aura of enlightenment that somehow makes her a bit of a lovable sage. Several of Greta's starring roles/movies resemble Woody Allen's style. This is no coincidence. And, give Greta another pat on the back for actually being more entertaining..more clever than..the Woodster. There aren't any really laugh out loud moments..no, much too subtle for that, but, after digesting the entire flic, one is left with a satisfied, entertained- BURP ! In fact, I give this movie 4 of 5 burps. Thanks Greta Gerwig. Give us another tasty helping...soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another winning NY relationship rom-com starring Greta Gerwig</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Maggie's Plan" (2015 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Maggie. As the movie opens, we see her walking the streets of New York, meeting with one of her friends and talking about wanting to become a mother. She talks an erstwhile college friend into donating sperm, Then one day she meets John at The New School, where Maggie is a business development director and John a part-time faculty in the Anthropology department. They hit it off, but there is a problem (John is married), or is there? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Rebecca Miller ("The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"). Here, Miller decides to take a lighthearted look (with some serious undertones) at the relationship issues of a young New York woman in her late twenties or maybe early thirties. And who better to cast than Greta Gerwig, who seemingly plays this role in a lot of her films (Lola Versus, Frances Ha, Mistress America). I bet she can do this role in her sleep. But that doesn't mean she doesn't give her usual all. John is played nicely by Ethan Hawke. But for me the big surprise of this movie turns out to be Juliette Moore, here playing John's wife Georgette, a woman originally from Denmark. So yes, Moore does the Danish accent, and their two kids eve speak Danish at times. I think Moore is hilarious as the 'scorned wife'. Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph play the married couple that is friends of Maggie. The movie clips by in a crisp pace, and before I knew it, the theater lights came back on. By the way, if you see the trailer popping up anywhere, run away as fast as you can. It reveals way, way too much of the movie's plot."Maggie's Plan" opened at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, to great acclaim. The movie finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at what attended okay. I am sure this movie will generate positive word-of-mouth. I know that I enjoyed it, even though there is no new terrain being broken, but the cast is delightful and the tone mostly light. If you have a chance to see this, be it at the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, do not miss it!</fullReview>

Fantastic script focusing on a uniquely circumspect millennial and mother wanna-be. Many plans go awry here but all things work out nicely and in an utterly unexpected way.

		<shortDescription>The Acting Carries This Rom-Com, Not Quite as Funny as it Could Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tons of history and your mom tell you falling for a married man is a chancy way to find happiness and a father for your baby. In this romantic comedy by writer-director Rebecca Miller, the unlikely happens and aspiring novelist John Harding (played by Ethan Hawke) actually divorces his self-absorbed, chilly wife Georgette (Julianne Moore) and marries the girl. They have a lovely baby. A couple of years on, though, the marriage is just not working. That's when Maggie (Greta Gerwig) develops her plan. She'll try to get John and Georgette back together. There are some nice moments and some funny moments, though the comedy is never quite as screwball as it might have been. As a tale of female manipulation, Maggie's efforts don't reach the delicious complexity of Lady Susan Vernon in Love &amp; Friendship, also in theaters now. Lady Susan plows ahead like an ocean liner, let the devil take the hindmost, and that creates a more comic effect than the rather more realistic angsty New Yorkers in Maggie's web. Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph are a prickly married couple, long-time friends of Maggie, stuck to each other like burrs. Mina Sundwall is John And Georgette's teenage daughter, a perfect adolescent cynic. Gerwig gives an engaging performance, Hawke is always interesting, and Julianne Moore shines as the ambitious academic?with a Danish accent, no less. There's a real New York feel to the film, too. Says Christy Lemire in RogerEbert.com, director Miller "truly gets the city's rhythms and idiosyncracies, and her dialogue frequently sparkles."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quirky-style comedy too subtle for big laughs but still incredibly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maggie's Plan is only technically a Greta Gerwig movie as she is the star of the film, and it displays her style of comedy. I should take that into consideration, because I became a fan of hers after I saw the film Francis Ha, which no movie I've seen her in has topped, but this one is close.Gerwig is once again cast as the type of New Yorker, I will politely say, I have nothing in common with. Her plan is to have a baby using the sperm of a math genus turned pickle maker and raise it all on her own. As they do in life, plans change when she falls in love with a College Professor, played by Ethan Hawke, and he leaves his troubled marriage for her. Deep into the commitment her feelings for him change and rather than end the relationship, she comes up with another plan to get him back together with his ex-wife, played beautifully by the beautiful Julianne Moore.It's a complex plan to a a complex situation, which is perfect for someone like Gerwig and this is what makes the movie interesting to watch. I did giggle a few times but the comedy overall was too quiet for me, but I believe that was the filmmaker's plan, considering you had such heavy hitters as Saturday Night Live alum Bill Hader and the spectacular Maya Rudolph as supporting characters, who could have easily turned this up to eleven. So I did not laugh that hard, but I find Greta Gerwig to be more about real life than artificial comedy and the overall punch line makes Maggie's Plan a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maggie (Great Gerwig) is planning on having a baby of her own, but her plans are derailed when she meets John (Ethan Hawke), the two fall in love and he divorces his wife Georgette (Julian Moore), yet things don't seem to go as well as John and Maggie had planned and when Georgette and Maggie meet, a whole new plan starts coming to life in Maggie's head. Written and directed by Rebecca Miller, "Maggie's Plan" also stars SNL cast members Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph.The description above might not reflect the movie in all of its delight and fun, but it might be indicative of the sweat messiness of the characters we get to spend a hundred minutes with and whom, by the end of the film, I wouldn't have minded spending a little time more.Going into this film I just really wanted a quirky, classic comedy with good heart and drama and that was exactly what I was handed. "Maggie's Plan" can't be commended for particular originality in storytelling or cinematic language, it also has a very derivative style from the New York indies of the recent years, but nothing of the above takes away from the fresh take we get to experience on characters who all have depth and interesting struggles to overcome that and with who we spend a very pleasant time alternating between moments of joy and fun, which are the ones that work best, and moments or dramatic dynamics that fit perfectly in the tone by remaining lighthearted but keeping a weight to what is going on.The direction the film has is very straight forward, I really enjoyed the off beat comedy sprinkled around the film, it was a very nice touch and fit in the very non invasive staging. We just get to see the five performers go at it, on a well written and thought out screenplay which is just the proof of the fact that when you have a good story and passion for it there will always be something to stick behind to for an audience.The cast is really the beating heart of the movie and the reason for its success. Greta Gerwig as always lights up the screen with her infectious energy and quirky charisma, she might be playing the character she has already done many times, but it doesn't really matter when the results are so pleasant. Juliane Moore sells her character perfectly and doesn't come off as a unlikable presence she could have been, you get her arch and stand with her as much as you do with the other characters. Ethan Hawke is as flawless as always, I think I've never seen him give a bad performance and even if this isn't exactly his best work it is another one where you just loose the actor and only see the character. The supporting cast is just as good as the main one and they are the reason for many of the big laughs in the film. Bill Hader doesn't even have to move to be funny, Rudolph plays off him pitch perfect and she even manages to overcome his titanic presence at moments. And then there is a revelation: Travis Fimmel, I think this guys has something special and I'm really rooting for him. After really liking him in Warcraft, here he does something totally different and crafts a cameo character that steals every scene he is in. He is hilarious and manages to get laughs by just moving around, it's really inspired work."Maggie's Plan" is such a welcome entry in this year's movie list and whilst nobody I think will come out having had their lives changed, it is not its purpose to do so and with the heart in the right place it tells and absorbing story having loads of fun in the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The label "Screwball Comedy" is not accurate, although the movie will make you smile and laugh. There is a little slapstick but lots of situation comedy and hapless behavior by libidinous intellectual characters. If you liked Woody Allen's "Mighty Aphrodite" you will like this also. The acting is good, especially the actresses. Mina Sundwall is terrific as Justine. Greta Gerwig carries the movie well; Julianne Moore is just right as Georgette. Ethan Hawke's character often behaves badly but he's quite believable in the part. R rating is appropriate for modest nudity and sexual content; you could take your parent but leave your sixth-grader at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Julianne Moore should get a nomination here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without Ms. Moore, the movie would still have been good, but not a 7. Every scene she's in glistens, and all you can do is watch her. Credit must also go to the writer/director, Rebecca Miller (Arthur Miller's daughter) for a tight screenplay and terrific direction re Ms. Moore's performance, but the life the actor breathes into the role is awesome.Moore plays an academic, and although early on you think she is a stereotype, that does not develop: she turns out to be the most human of them all.Now for Greta Gerwig: she plays, essentially, the same character she played in "Greenberg" and the disappointing "Francis Ha." That is, the somewhat neurotic, ineffectual woman confused about relationships. She should def broaden her repertoire before she ends up committing career suicide; perhaps change agents. Oh--she is a talented actress to be sure--but she's got to get out more.Ethan Hawke is good and believable, but is not asked for much here. This is a movie written and directed by a woman and about two women; the men are written well, but the character development focuses on the Gerwig and Moore characters. The movie kept my interest throughout and moved along. But do not expect a comedy that will have you laughing out loud, because all you will get are a few chuckles. Also, this is a very New York City- centric work, so if that is not your cup 'o tea, do not bother. But no matter: although I have never seen Ms. Miller's previous works, I will certainly look forward to her next. Congratulations to you, Rebecca Miller, on a thoughtful and enjoyable movie. And nice casting with Julianne Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a woman who teaches in a college. She wants to get pregnant by artificial insemination, but her beautiful plan goes haywire when she meets another fellow teacher and then falls in love with him."Maggie's Plan" is about this woman who works hard to make her life the way she envisaged. I applaud her for that, and Greta Gerwig gives a good performance again as a very natural and realistic woman, who can easily be someone that the viewers know. It is also quite a positive surprise that the film is filled with big names, namely Ethan Hawke and Julianne Moore. It is worth watching just for these three names! The story is fast paced and heavy on words, and somehow it appears to me that I have watched the film for a long time but in fact I am only half way though, but in a good way.</fullReview>
