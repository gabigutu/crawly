		<shortDescription>Shamefully bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's illuminating, I think, to consider the fact that "bad" movies have as much complexity and dimensionality, in their way, as "good" movies. After all, there are nearly as many facets to a bad movie is there are to a good movie. Just like a good movie, a bad movie must have music, sound effects, visual effects, a story, actors and acting, lighting, recording, editing, and so on.In the same way that you could take an entire university course on what made "Citizen Kane" a great movie, you COULD similarly take such a course on what made "American Conjuring" a bad movie. You wouldn't want to do it, of course, but the point is that there would be that much information to study and learn about what made it such an incredibly awful picture.That being the case, it would take far more than the space I have here to fully elaborate on the depth and breadth of the execrable- ness of this movie.But I will make one observation. For every human endeavor, and especially in art of any kind, sometimes an example is so incredibly appalling that it makes you feel bad for the people involved with it. You get the sense that they've "been punished enough" by simply being associated with such a steaming pile that you don't want to be responsible for adding to their misery. Let them mercifully scatter into the dark and concealing night."American Conjuring" ALMOST achieves that forgivable state. Almost.The reason it DOESN'T is because the movie is CALLED "American Conjuring". Anyone with a suspicious mind might think that the creators of this movie were attempting to capitalize on the success of other relatively recent but unrelated movies that have the word "conjuring" in their titles, and that they were hoping to confuse people into paying good money to watch this fly-blown manure accidentally. This would suggest evil intent and malice aforethought rather than a sad and hapless set of talentless people tragically exposed for their artlessness.Personally, I'm not suspicious of such a thing at all. Nope. Not suspicious.The sound and video masters for this movie need to be taken out on a moonless night and buried deep beneath cursed ground, sprinkled with salt, and hosed down with holy water. I'm precluded from suggesting what should happen to the people responsible for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tedious And Choppy (No Pun Intended)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No great stuff to write here, just a (very) small chuckle for the title of a horror film set and filmed in Canada. If they'd left the original title 'Bind' it would at least have been a bit different. Regular (read boring and predictable) stuff happens here and the movie - especially the ending - has no cohesion or clear story line.When one can't produce a scary enough story, they always go for killing animals - people hate that. Kill 100 people, okay - but kill one dog, oh the horror!BUT if you want to fast forward to the end, you'll see a lot of famous names (and horror sites) listed under "Special Thanks". I wonder how many of them would pay to be removed from that list?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous, Has a lot of spoilers, only read if you've watched.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other reviews are fairly accurate. The plot isn't that bad but the actual script is ridiculous. There are so many moments in this movie that make you angry and wish there was a way to slap the director in the face. The teenager forced to call her stepfather "dad", the arguments and anger between the family are over the top. The way the mother finds the pictures drawn by the child and as she cycles through them the same image is shown every time. So many moments when someone does something and the reaction from the other actor is just stupid.The imagery / editing / audio was fine so no complaints there. Please only watch if you're bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the 'beep' did I just watch ((Spoilers))</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I start, oh boy!!!! This movie had the potential to become a good horror piece, instead its a 'sh**' horror piece. Seriously what was the director thinking, or should I say why wasn't he thinking? So many bad scenes, bad camera angles, over the top acting, weak script, story started really well but what the F*** happened with the ending? Was he dreaming everything while out cold? Or was it the alternate ending? When the wife looks at the drawings, the same image is shown like 3 times. When the husband keeps saying, "I saw her" the wife doesn't even bother to ask "Who". She just keeps yelling and yelling. Why wasn't this movie made sensibly? Towards the end the movie suggested that Ben and Laura had an affair. Nothing was established. They should have at least shown us the flashback or given us some idea about the events that they both are talking about. But if the whole thing was a dream then that would have been senseless too. All in all this movie sucked. Please save your time and do not watch it. I am giving this 2 star only for the effort, and also because I never give any film 1 star.</fullReview>
