		<shortDescription>a new classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>22 years after "The Unforgiven", a new classic has arrived on screens. Finally, a movie that is worth the price of the (way too high, nowadays) ticket. The movie is a western, without twirls or fripperies. The classic, evergreen, canonical revenge plot, splendidly photographed, directed and interpreted. The dirty, twisted face of Mikkelsen is rock solid. The man is hurt, never broken, and gets his final revenge no matter the personal cost. Hollywood has lost the capability of producing non-bullshit movies, Europe comes helping :) John Wayne, James Stewart, Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, Gregory Peck and Clint Eastwood are probably welcoming Mikkelsen in the hall of fame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the one hand, 'The Salvation' is a classic western. Good citizens versus evil villains. A steam train. A stage coach. Horses. Lots of shootouts. Barren desert landscapes. A dusty frontier town. Name a western cliché, and it's there. Except Indians. They're only talked about in this film. On the other hand, this is also a western with original, non-classic elements in it. Lots of languages. Parts are spoken in Danish, but you can also hear Spanish and Italian from time to time. Plus: a very strong female character, who radiates power although she is mute. Thirdly: the South-African locations. They're not very prominent, because they look very much like the American West. But when you know it, you can't help but think about it. The film tells the story of a Danish immigrant, who kills two men who raped and murdered his wife. One of them is the brother of a local outlaw, who terrorizes the town until the culprit is found. But the Dane, an ex-soldier, is not easy to capture and confronts the outlaw. Overall, this film seems to be very much inspired by the Sergio Leone westerns. The visual style is superb, and director Levring uses every trick in the book. Aereal shots, slow motion, close-ups: it's all there. I was amazed by the colours in some scenes - it looked as if they were heavily digitally enhanced. The result is astonishing. And just when you think you've seen it all, Levring surprises with a beautiful and, in a way, revealing end shot. Sergio Leone created the spaghetti-western. Maybe the time has come now for the sm?rrebr?d-western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense and unforgiving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this on premiere-night in Denmark and left the cinema relieved and with a smile on my face. Director Kristian Levring delivers a very believable, dark and uncompromising western set in a very classic western atmosphere.The story is straightforward and although it moves along slowly at times (fast paced at others), it's quite intense and is generally beautifully shot.If you're going for a feel good movie, this is not it, but if you like classic westerns, you'll enjoy it.Mads Mikkelsen and Mikael Persbrandt deliver solid performances as the danish brothers Jon and Peter who've emigrated to America after fighting the Germans in the danish/German war of 1864. But for me, Eva Green steals the show as the mute Madelaine (princess). She has a very mystical and powerful presence and leaves you wondering, wanting more. All in all a very enjoyable picture that is a great testament to how far danish cinema has come. This is quite uncharacteristic for a typical danish movie, but Levring really pulls it off and I think any lover of westerns will find this a solid addition to the batch of quality westerns in the past 10 years (The Proposition, 3:10 to Yuma, True grit, Django Unchained etc.) It doesn't quite reach those levels, but it's close and it's enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Salvation" drew my curiosity for two things: the lead and the fact that it's a Danish western.The atmosphere of the wild-west is really well done and has immersed me in the mid 1800's, and with a well-paced narrative and suspense of a typical revenge-story told effectively.Mads Mikkelsen shines as the lead but the overall cast is good. Compliments to the screenwriter, too, for creating several characters that I would wish to see more of.However, what stops me from giving "The Salvation" an 8 or more is the ending, the very final scene. For me, it feels out of place, fake- looking and preachy. It's funny how less than a minute of a scenery- footage can lessen the quality of the entire story.If you like Open Range, 3:10 to Yuma, True Grit and Unforgiven, you should certainly check this movie out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Danish western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it takes Danes to do a really good Western these days? American westerns seems to be all about softer things now, while this movie was tough and, in part, quite brutal. They even killed a kid in it, which sort of never happens in American movies.Mads Mikkelsen delivers as always. His stone face is made for this sort of thing (Clint Eastwood, anyone?). Jeffrey Dean Morgan did a good job as the bad guy and Eva Green was really cool as a mute and strong woman.The Swedish feminist newspapers hated this movie because it was about two strong men, the brothers. I for one can't see what they were complaining about, given Green's role. And in any case, even if Green wasn't there: Why can't a movie be about two strong men?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight-up western, old but new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A straight up western starring Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffery Dean Morgan, and even Eric Cantona. Danish production, shot in South Africa, it looked convincingly American west. It's very old school in its story, good guy vs bad guy, revenge, gun fights, the whole nine yards. And it's a pretty fine movie too.Danish guy waits for his wife and son to arrive in America to start new lives, but bad guys are going to spoil their plan. There's no way he's going to let them bad guys go, after toiling for 7 years to start a new life only to see it destroyed as soon as his family arrives. And did I mention he fought wars in the Danish army before he moved to America? Oh yeah, this Dane know how to shoot straight too.You really do get the feeling that this guy wants no trouble and just wants to get on with his life, but it's trouble that comes looking for him. A lot of new westerns tend to be "different" and avoid the straight up good vs bad revenge trope because it's been done to death during the genre's heyday. But I think it's a good time revisit that trope with today's new talent and technology. The story may be cliché, but everything else feels fresh. The best western I've watched in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never really been a fan of Western genre films, though I do watch them, as it is paramount to view everything in order to review. The Salvation delivers on every account, an action packed storyline encompassing a range of emotion, from a sensational cast. Director Kristian Levring brings to fruition the Western life experience in a fashion that keeps you intrigued and hopeful of a sequel or certainly another film just as brilliant, if not better. Mads Mikkelsen is nothing short of magical in the lead role, sporting a demeanor reminiscent of all time Western greats.Eva Green (my personal favorite) exudes a perfect beauty in her mute role as Madelaine, without question one of the most stunning women on this planet, mesmerizing eyes and expressions which convey a story within her character, albeit a troubled past.Jeffrey Dean Morgan delivers as the villain as best anyone could and there are other familiar faces such as Douglas Henshall and Jonathan Pryce, both impressive seasoned actors.Overall, it's really 11 out of 10, enjoy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining bleak and dark Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is probably one of the best western in years. It's a dark and harrowing film, a la "the proposition" or "unforgiven". This movie is not for the squeamish: innocent people are killed without a thought, and the film does a good job portraying the lawlessness and "anything goes" ethos of the times. Mads Mikkelsen is excellent as a hardworking taciturn Danish immigrant who's spent years trying to make a living in this land of opportunity. Unfortunately, tragedy strikes when he brings his family to the country, and then the rest of the film is basically about survival and revenge. At 1.5 hours, the pacing is good, and there are no unnecessary scenes or fat bogging down the story. Action scenes are realistic and very well done, and there's some pretty good cinematography throughout. All in all, a very well crafted and entertaining Western!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the Danish, and why not? Especially if it's done as well as this was/is. Mads Mikkelsen has proved himself worthy of leading roles even in (his not native tongue) English. But there is a bit of Danish thrown into the mix with this. But it's not the spoken language that will get your attention with this movie.It's the framing, it's the "picture" language it speaks. This looks as down and dirty as Westerns come and it does a really good job throwing us into a situation Western fans know very well. So while the story itself is not new, we do get a very well made movie, that you should be able to enjoy a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western Movie in Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great movie, great performances, particularly Mads Mikkelsen, a extraordinary actor capable of unique performances, like Casino Royal or The Hunt. The best thing about this movie is that is a simple western story, without CGI or complicated plot, is just hard, straight and cruel, making you remind off certain westerns made in the 70's, but this one has 1h30 minutes, it doesn't borrow you with landscapes or infinity long horse rides. The only bad thing i have to say about this picture is Jefrey Dean Morgan performance, its just bad and incapable of captivating the audience. Just imagine if Mikkelsen was the bad guy, what villain it will be. So please, do this European guys a favor and watch this movie, not only you will not regret but you will enjoy a movie made in 2014 without CGI, naked Girls, catch phrases or dumb script.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great watch, thrillride from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six years after his last movie, Kristian Levring returns as director and writer for "The Salvation". Not only did he get assistance from Anders Thomas Jensen, who worked on the Foreign Language Academy Award winning Haevnen, but the star of the movie is probably Denmark's most known actor these days: Mads Mikkelsen. The result is a quality western film. Yes it is predictable (as most other westerns including many of the classics), but that takes away nothing from it's magnificence. I had a wonderful 90 minutes at the theater watching this.The story can be summarized quickly. The family of the main character gets killed early on. Now we did not get a revenge story that lasts for the whole movie, but Mikkelsen's character (a former soldier) kills those responsibly right away. Overkill even, but it was somehow funny how he kept pushing bullets into the killer's corpse. Sadly, one of the guys he shoots is the brother of the übervillain who terrorizes a whole town.One thing I really liked here, was the Casino Royale reunion between Mikkelsen and Green (and even some of the visual effects people). Those two have great chemistry. The villains are played by Javier-Bardem lookalike Jeffrey Dean Morgan, former soccer infant terrible Eric Cantona and some others who may not look as primary antagonists to Mikkelsen's character here, but somehow can be classified as these as well. If you have seen some of his other work, you will know how great of an actor Mikkelsen is. He delivered during the scenes when he was mourning for his wife, son and brother, but looking at the whole thing, he is possibly even too good for the role he got to play here. Not too long ago, he starred in another revenge movie ("Michael Kohlhaas"), and here he is back to his best. A great choice for a guys' movie night, or for girls who like westerns and don't mind very graphic violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a western should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic western story has been done again and again, a thousand times over. A hero is wronged, he seeks revenge, gunfights ensue, retribution is attained. It's a classic formula, and fuels countless films in the genre, even today. The tricky part is, getting all the elements right. The story is a blueprint, and all other aspects must be implemented skillfully for that blueprint to result in a worthwhile finished product. The Salvation gathers a wicked cast, a beautifully twangy, reminiscent soundtrack that brings a nostalgic tear to the eye, and stunning, drone and crane centred camera work to weave us a tale that kept me enraptured from start to finish. I haven't seen a western this gorgeously rendered since John Hillcoat's The Proposition, or as unforgiving and tragic on that note. Mads Mikkelsen stoically plays Jon, a Danish immigrant in the dust haven of America's west. Mikkelsen is an actor who can say more with two seconds of silent, eye twitching screen time than eight hundred pages of dialogue, making him the perfect fit for a tortured western protagonist. On the first day he is reunited with his wife and ten year old son, they are slaughtered by evil outlaws (an opening sequence of heart wrenching dread that will leave you with a dry mouth) prompting him to take swift revenge. They happened to be affiliated with the biggest, baddest gang boss gunslinger in the region, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. I've been waiting for Morgan to get a role worth his talent since Watchmen, and he takes full advantage of his ruthless prick character, injecting every moment with malice. The two are pitted against each other in a hard bitten, economically dry town with a bitter atmosphere appropriate to the depressing nature of the story. Caught between is mute Eva Green as Princess, a prisoner of Morgan's clan and survivor of maiming in her youth, at the hands of natives. Green has no dialogue, but can fill a scene with thunderous, glowering presence, and is one of my favourite actresses working today. All the elements mix perfectly, from story, which is standard but given new vital signs by the lush production design, acting and especially the score, a sadly meandering rhapsody that prompts dreams of tumbleweeds, tragedy and hard men doing bad things in the name of revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the Old West in 1871 we meet Jon (Mads Mikkelsen)and Peter (Mikael Persbrandt) both soldiers who fought in the war of 1864 in their old country. Here Jon has been waiting to be reunited with his wife and son after a seven year gap. Only as soon as they arrive they befall a terrible crime and the only way Jon is going to be able to re right the wrong is by fighting back.Now to say any more could be a plot spoiler ? needless to say this is a classic western of the revenge genre. It paints the bad guys really bad and the good guys flawed but essentially 'right'. There is ambiguity too and there are the townsfolk with their own agendas and greed and power stalking the prairie.What makes this outstanding is the acting, the musical score, the make up and the fantastic direction. Director Kristian Levring is clearly a fan of John Ford and those of you who know your westerns will see a few shots framed a la 'The Searchers'. Still I see this as flattery and this is truly an excellent film that will only go to prove that as a genre the western is alive, kicking and doing really well ? absolutely recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow i want more, i've been waiting along time for a half decent western and what i found was amazing. I had just watched the classic "the outlaw josie wales" a few days before. which is in my opinion the benchmark of a western,I was not disappointed, the greatest westerns were made by some Spanish guy years ago and with a bit of luck the genre has a new patron in a danish guy. It was like watching josie for the first time and the story is along those lines, wife and child are murdered, man goes for revenge. i loved it, after being let down by soooo many b-grade westerns i was not hopeful about this one, but after it started i was surprised the lead is a Eastwood type character, quiet,sad and tough, makes a change from the usual Hollywood yank hero, loud, brash and over the top. 10 out of 10 because its the best western since old Clint hung up his six shooter, maybe it will inspire that old legend to make one last stand and get back in the saddle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Salvation is directed by Kristian Levring and Levring co-writes the screenplay with Anders Thomas Jensen. It stars Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Eric Cantona, Mikael Persbrandt, Jonathan Pryce and Douglas Henshall. Music is by Kasper Winding and cinematography by Jens Schlosser.1871 and ex-patriot Danish soldier Jon Jensen (Mikkelsen) is, after 7 years of foundation building, welcoming his wife and son to a new life in America. But after they all board a stagecoach bound for their homestead, events will see that journey not be completed. And thus begins a tale of retribution and redemption. There are few smiles in The Salvation, in fact viewers will need to grab onto the sparse offerings of such very early in the piece. For it's a film of blood, brooding and misery, of intensity and a paucity of the good side of human nature. Levring has managed to successfully blend the traditions of the American Western with the feel of the Euro Spaghetti Oaters. There is so much for Western fans to enjoy here. It's a classic revenger pumped by a good versus bad heart, yet as pared down and as simple as the story may at first seem, there's interesting asides of worth. The issue of Euro immigrants trying to make it in the Wild West is noteworthy, while there's a delicious juxtaposition between two soldiers from different continents, and different wars. Jensen fought the Germans in Europe, while his nemesis, Henry Delarue (Morgan), has been through the Indian wars. A most interesting comparison, one where the characterisations are vividly opposed to each other. Add in a good old town in the grip of a tyrant theme, and a bit of carnal desires upon thine brother's spouse, and it's a spicy hot pot.Filmed at dusty South African locations, there's a scenic beauty surrounding the harsh story. Westerns don't have to be filmed in America to look authentic, and this is a case in point. The town of Black Creek has been called fake looking in some quarters, not so. This is a new up-coming town, it's meant to be wooden and sparse. Hell! The saloon is also the local store, the mayor is also the undertaker, this is a basic Wild West town without frills and fancy.Elsewhere the costuming is splendid, especially Morgan who is nicely dapper in black hat and crimson mack, and there's a whole host of face fuzz on show, which is needed to keep up the whole mud and blood, hard West factor. Levring has an eye for a nice shot, such as a full moon bearing witness, even a traditional slow-mo piece. All that said, irks do exist, Green's character is sketchily drawn, but she's playing a heaving bosom mute (her tongue was cut out by the pesky Indians), so scope for development is admittedly limited. While Winding's score is a bit too modern sounding for the key shoot-out sequences.Ultimately it's great to see the Western is still thriving in this day and age of CGI and blockbuster pandering. From the shattering and moody first quarter to the bloody and excellently staged finale, The Salvation keeps the Western genre well and truly alive. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An atmospheric and desolate Western that gets under your skin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Westerns. I fell in love with them in my mid-20's but its pretty rare to find "new" Westerns that are worth a hill of beans. When I read about The Salvation I was immediately intrigued as to how dark it sounded and star Mads Mikkelsen tends to do some pretty messed up "indie" style films so I was in this to really see something great. The Salvation does not disappoint. This is one dark, twisted, disparaging film where you can literally feel the violence and oppression of the "Wild West" as it was. You get a different perspective seeing this from the eyes of a foreigner who has spent seven years making a life for himself before bringing his family over only to have them meet with immediate tragedy and end up the target an insane killer. The film still has everything you'd expect from a Western but with a sort of "Tarantino" style to it. It is so gritty and dreary that you will just feel the rain and damp and bleak setting they're trying to convey. It is a film about Salvation I suppose but it is moreso about survival. This is man vs nature, man vs man and man vs himself in every way you can think of making it intelligent, artistic and still really fun to watch for a fan of Westerns.There is just something often creepy about Mads Mikkelsen. He has such a unique look and his Danish background makes him far from your typical leading man and yet he does so flawlessly. He shows some genuine weakness of character here but then also ferocious strength at the same time. His character just feels very real and very flawed and yet heroic. Mikkelsen was literally perfect for the part. His raw emotion will really touch you. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is the sadistic villain Henry Delarue and he is fantastic. I wish he had been giving more scenes and more time to establish his character because what they give him to demonstrate his violent behaviour is pretty flimsy but he does well with it. The supporting characters get virtually no development (one of the only issues with this film) so Morgan has to do his best and he does. He and Mikkelsen have a great Western rivalry. Jonathan Pryce who I think is a great character actor has a good role as the Mayor of their small town. He has one particularly fantastic scene opposite Mikkelsen. Douglas Henshall is very dry and underused as the Sheriff. Mikael Persbrandt is very underused as Mikkelsen's brother but he serves a purpose that works for the story. Eva Green...I just don't get this woman. Guys seem crazy for her and she keeps getting major roles but why? I have yet to see anything impressive from her and yes she looks sultry but there has to be more than that. She is almost unnecessary to this film and maybe even worse not having a single line (she is mute.) She is essentially the only female in the film so I suppose she had to be there but she is wasted as well.So there are two big problems with the film that are over-lookable given how well the movie is shot. The first problem is the sincere lack of development in all the characters but especially everyone outside of the main hero played by Mikkelsen. I know its a Western so it doesn't really require a lot of development but it feels just a little empty. The second problem is the really bad special effects of things burning. Any time something is one fire, it looks terrible. Can't they just set fire to a wood pile and film it? This is an ironic problem being one of their sets burned down during filming. So the CGI is poor at best but there isn't enough fire to make this a major irritation. Kristian Levring is a Danish film maker and his European style definitely shows through but at the same time it gives the "typical" Western a distinctive feel that makes it stand out and also gives it a timeless/location-less feel. Levring has a distinctive style and the bleak Western land is beautifully shot and there is just great use of the sets. If you love Westerns and miss the quality of Unforgiven or similar films, this is one for you. The final shootout is fantastic. I really enjoyed this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Salvation is a surprisingly excellent Western with a splendid cast and has plenty of thrilling tension moments to make this film all the worth while.Mads Mikkelsen normally isn't known for playing a heroic vigilante protagonist as he's usually known for playing villain roles such as Bond villain Le Chiffre in Casino Royale (2006) and Dr. Hannibal Lecter in the TV series, Hannibal. But Mads Mikkelsen proves he can adapt to the role and it's his great performance alone that makes this film worth seeing.Along with the other great cast include Eva Green, Jonathan Pryce and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the villainous Henry Delarue, all of which played their roles really well although one criticism I have is that Eva Green is a mute in this one so sadly you can't hear her great acting in this film.Overall I found the Salvation to be one of the many Western films such as Django Unchained (2012) that I've really enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The western seen through fresh eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Danish settler Jon brings his wife and son to the USA after 7 years' separation, only for them to be murdered by two men freshly released from prison. Jon kills the murderers, but one of them is the brother of a corrupt land baron who governs the local town with brutal ruthlessness: he wants Jon to pay, and Jon has only his brother Peter for support.A plot synopsis makes it clear that the story of this film doesn't hold many surprises for any enthusiast of the traditional western: it is a tried and tested plot, and delivered here with great efficiency. No, the reason why The Salvation is interesting is that it is a take on the traditional western delivered by an exclusively Danish production crew, filmed in South Africa. The location passes adequately for picturesque prairie, but it is photographed with what I can only describe as a visual sensibility which is quite unlike what one is used to in westerns. I remember the impact of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns (and, to a lesser extent, the totally non-American European western Shalako), and there is a similar effect here ? as if the western is seen through different eyes. Some of the night scenes, in particular, are quite unlike anything I've ever seen in a western, and the sets look authentic but feel different and unusual.The cast also adds to this somewhat oblique viewpoint. Jeffery Dean Morgan as the villainous Delarue is the only principal player who is American: Mads Mikkelsen is an excellent protagonist, Eva Green is effective as the mysterious Madelaine, and Brits Jonathan Price and Douglas Henshall, and Frenchman Eric Cantona also pop up to provide effective support.I really enjoyed this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent, but classic-style, Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Salvation' is a Warner Bros Western, that is filmed in South Africa, with European actors, and a strong Danish input, which captures well the central themes of traditional Westerns.Film opens at a train station where we meet two Danish brothers, one played by Mads Mikkelsen, the other by Mikael Persbrandt, who looks a bit like Kevin Costner, or even Lee Van Cleef! Very strong performances are given by the two Danish actors!We quickly move to the start of a stage-coach journey, that starts with great foreboding. Modern-day commuters and travellers, trapped in confined spaces, will empathize, as the suspense and tension builds.This film is rated a 15 in the UK for strong violence. Very strong in fact! The violence is bloody, brutal, and grim! It also makes disturbing and uncomfortable viewing.The two brothers have lived in the USA for a number of years. Thus through them, and others, we get the impression of a growing country expanding westwards with incoming immigrants. John Ford was always careful to populate his Wild West with 'Swede Larson' types of immigrants, reflecting reality, so this film fits in well with that vision.John Ford famously, often filmed in Monument Valley. 'The Salvation' gives us a similar look with the location shooting that was actually filmed in South Africa. There are the same strong colours that we associate with the traditional classic Western, but there are also weather extremes, no doubt reflecting reality too. Homage is also paid to those old classics too, in some shots, but done discreetly though.The supporting cast is universally good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays well the part of Delarue, one of the nastiest characters to inhabit the West, and Westerns. Eva Green wows in a strong female role, and Glaswegian Douglas Henshall, and the ever-reliable Jonathon Pryce, also fill-out believable characters. Finally, giving us the cream on the cake, is Eric Cantona. Familiar to the British for his long career in the UK, before he turned to the silver-screen, we now see him most often in an entertaining little beer ad. Here, in 'The Salvation', Mr Cantona in a part so small that it is almost a cameo, is able to give some authenticity to this period-drama.Historical note: The film is described as being set in the Wild West of the 1870's. Thus this is after the American Civil War of 1861- 1865. It is also after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. However this is not very important at all, as European politics do not intrude into the story of this Danish Western, except as the merest of a sub-text.It is a rare treat to get a Western these days, however if you are a fan of this genre, and as long as you have a strong stomach for the disturbing and violent scenes, then you will appreciate this Western film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the Reckoning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. It is initially a bit disorienting to settle in to watch a Western shot in South Africa by Danish filmmakers with a story based in 19th century America. However, any doubts are quickly forgotten thanks to terrific writing, powerful acting, and creative camera work set to a distinctive soundtrack.Blood, dirt, politics, true loss and crackling gun play accompany what is, at its core, a story of vengeance ? and of course, good vs evil. We open in 1871 America, seven years after Jon (Mads Mikkelsen) and his brother Peter (Mikael Persbrandt) left Denmark after fighting in the war. Today is the day that Jon's wife (singer Nanna Oland Fabricius) and son (Toke Lars Bjarke) arrive, and the separation has been tough on all. The reunion is destroyed in the most awful manner imaginable thanks to a couple of drunken ex-cons sharing the stagecoach. Of course, salvation and vengeance would not be required if there were no turning point, and Jon's natural reaction is what sparks the real fireworks in the story.One of the bad guys on the wagon is the brother of powerful local gangster Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). We quickly learn he is not a rational man and cares little for anything other than making money and gaining revenge on his brother's killer. Delarue stands for all the bullies of any era, while Jon and his brother Pete represent the huddled masses incited to action only through gross injustice. There are many details and elements that set this above the traditional western, and one of those is the presence of Madelaine (Eva Green) who was married to Delarue's murdered brother, and was previously disfigured and muted by Native Americans.It's impossible not to notice the similarities and influences of John Ford, Sergio Leone and the classic High Noon (cowardly townspeople, morals corrupted under duress). Director Kristian Levring even superimposes the very familiar vistas of Monument Valley into some shots, and it's done so well that our eyes simply accept the landscape. Mr. Levring also presents us a uniquely lit stagecoach in the moonlight scene that was beautiful to look at, despite the violent nature of what was happening. Composer Kasper Winding (brother to director Nicolas Winding Refn) adds a distinctive guitar that recalls the haunting effects of Ennio Morricone's soundtrack to Leone's classic Once Upon a Time in America ? a very effective complement.The lead actors are superb and well cast ? though Jeffrey Dean Morgan goes 180 degrees against type as the evil-to-the-bone Delarue. Eva Green speaks volumes with her fiery eyes, and Mikael Persbrandt (who was so great in In A Better World) adds to the quiet-wild feel of the film. The bulk of the action falls to Mads Mikkelsen, who thanks to Casino Royale, The Hunt, and TV's "Hannibal" has become one of the finest actors working today. His facial tics and emotional depth convey much with few words, and his character's expert marksmanship with a Remington rifle is a welcome shift from the spraying automatic weaponry too common in film these days.The politics of taking advantage of the unaware weak runs throughout the films, especially with the methodical "land grab" occurring so that the rich can capitalize on the "sticky oil" spoiling the water wells. You may not be a fan of Westerns, but there is much going on in this excellent script ? and the visuals combined with expert acting should allow you to appreciate what expert filmmaking this is (especially given the low budget).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western since Unforgiven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the same feeling as Mr. Eastwoods Classic "Unforgiven". Not overplayed but with believable actors and settings it creates this special raw feeling that thrills and drags the viewer into the story. Only the best westerns do that. The reason why I like these two westerns so much is the touch of reality and good story telling - I think that USA frontier life in those days was both rough and hard and the weak did not make it. Mads Mikkelsen and Mr.Persbrandt are a pleasure to Watch - so is Eva Green - although she does not have any lines she speaks convincingly with her eyes. If you like Unforgiven go see this one - you will not be disappointed. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Danish Western with superb photography, cast and performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jon (Mads Mikkelsen) arrived with his brother to the United States from Denmark to start a new life. Seven years later, in 1871, his wife and son also come to settle in the country. However, during the course of the diligence that leads to the village where she lives, an altercation happens that will result in the persecution of Jon by "Delarue" (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a criminal feared in the area."The Salvation" is a Danish Western that centres on its protagonists plans to avenge his, a bloody and ruthless portrait in a region full of corruption where the pecking order is what is actually in force. Surprised how well used and the clear vision of Kristian Levring, the use of space and arid environment, as well as in defining the characters.Aesthetically it is quite nice photography of Jens Schlosser is very successful transmitting perfectly the vision of Western film, music composition of Kasper Winding not constant but well used at key moments, the script by the same director together with Anders Thomas Jensen has a well-structured plot, but rather linear, no surprising twists and foresees what will happen.The cast is fine, Mikkelsen as always met, I liked the work of Mikael Persbrandt and Morgan as the antagonist, Eva Green is there but her character deserves much highlight. In short a successful film, with a ruthless argument it does not give concessions or respites, good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge for a revenge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a Danish western revenge flick set in the American soil, so 99 per cent it was in the English language. Well, in my opinion, it is underrated for sure. It was not anything stylish like QT's recent western films, but quite usual presentation yet very majestic. The story takes place in a couple of days in a small town in the 1871. The turnaround in the theme was great. Initially, it leaves an impression of a revenge based tale, but later becomes oil warfare, something quite resembles the original situation of the American at that time.In the last few weeks I have been watching lots of comedies, dramas and other soft themed films, so suddenly I felt too much violence from this. But as always I get used to it after some time in the watch. Great cast and their great performances. The writing was superb along with the settings. I watched it quite late, but the best western I have seen in the recent time, so I strongly recommended for western fans and others who're seeking a fine entertainment.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Modern Revenge Spahgetti Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Mads Mikkelsen in Valhalla Rising when it came out and then again a few years later. Impressive, violent and psychedelic film. After that I started looking for other films he'd stared in. I was impressed with this film. Most modern westerns are either based on the "budy" movie concept (which I can't stand) or are just insipid wastes of time from my perspective. This film took me back to the days of Clint Eastwood in his heyday and Charles Bronson in "Once Upon A Time In The West". It held my attention and was never slow. A little predictable at points for a movie watcher and reader like myself, but when it ended I didn't say to myself "There's an hour and a half of my life I can never get back." like I unfortunately have to say about a lot of films. If you're in the mood for a good "revenge" western, this is your film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not bad, has all the elements of a good western but it is too short and concise and leaves a little the mouth dry. The rhythm flows fast and relentlessly and the story is pretty simple. The authors would have to add some element, showing and maybe deepening some scenes that were deliberately omitted or too short.It is entertaining but an hour and a half, including titling, are really too few to make this a great movie as it shows it could have been. And I am sorry because, overall, it is really well done till it last, crude and brutal. It seems more like a summary of what have could been a great western movie.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Talking to a fellow IMDber about Lars Mikkelsen's superb Nordic Noir Headhunter,I found out that his brother Mads had starred in a Nordic Western.With having only seen Mads Mikkelsen in Casino Royal and tasty trailers for Mads (what a name for a serial killer!) Hannibal TV series,I decided to join Mikkelsen in his search for salvation.The plot:Meeting with his wife Marie and son Kresten for the first time in 7 years, Jon Jensen gets set to start a new life with his family.Going on a stagecoach to their new home,the Jensen's are stopped in their tracks by a gang of outlaws.Attempting to keep his family safe,Jon is pushed out of the coach.Catching up to the (now parked) coach,Jensen discovers that his son has been killed and that his wife has been raped and murdered.Grabbing a gun,Jensen shoots each of the outlaws dead.Unknown to Jensen,one of the outlaws is the brother of notorious outlaw Henry Delarue,who decides to find salvation by getting revenge on Jonsen.View on the film:Starting as a late arrival to the Dogme 95 movement,co-writer/(along with Anders Thomas Jensen) director Kristian Levring crosses stripped to the bone sets with lavish bursts of colour over the screen.Keeping parts of the original burnt down South African set, Levring &amp; cinematographer Jens Schlosser sink the Nordic Wild West into dazzling waxed yellows,browns and reds,which gradually reveal everything that Jon Jensen holds dear to melt away. Gliding across the stripped down sets, Levring &amp; Schlosser impressively use the minimalism of the sets to make the boiling sun and pelts of rain crackle,and to also give the title a deeply tense atmosphere,as Jensen and Delarue find no corners offering salvation.Allowing Jon Jensen a small moment of happiness before his family is destroyed,the screenplay by Jensen and Levring delicately makes sure to give each of the Jensen's a sweetheart moment which makes Jon's tragedy pack a real punch.Drawing Danish and English dialogue over the film,the writers keep the dialogue clipped,and fill every line with a nervous dread,as alliances to Jon and Delarue change with every quick-draw.Joined by a wonderful Eric "Ooh Aah" Cantona, Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives an excellent performance as Henry Delarue,thanks to Morgan matching his sharp fighting score with a snarling delivery that knocks everyone in its path. Reuniting from Casino Royal, Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green give fantastic performances as Jon Jensen and "Princess" Madelaine. Tied up to Delarue,Green superbly shows Madelaine's "princess" features to shatter as she learns of the Delarue's family misdeeds,whilst Mikkelsen gives a brilliant performance as Jensen,whose initial heartbreak Mikkelsen transforms into a tough as leather drive for a shot at salvation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the classic westerns from the 50's. I especially love the Stewart / Mann and Scott / Boetticher series of films. They were simple, short, and exceedingly well acted and well made. Take those stories and update them to include more modern touches in the areas of violence and you have a movie called "The Salvation." The motivations of the characters are simple. We don't have a lot of angst and political correctness being shoved in our face. Bad things happen, bad people are involved, and a good and decent man must have his revenge. This movie is short. The credits begin to roll before the 90 minute mark. I've never been one to think a movie's quality increases with its length, and this movie does its job in about an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching westerns. I was immersed in the culture. In my mind I was a gunslinger with a long coat and bad attitude. I didn't think the Man With No Name movies could be beaten but then Mads Mikkelsen made The Salvation. It is the perfect western, which is ironic as it's Danish filmed in South Africa (English spoken). But every single trope that makes a good western is present in this movie. Mads is brilliant in everything he does (although I'm hesitating over Men &amp; Chicken) but he seems made for this movie somehow. If you like the old Clint Eastwood films (especially Hang 'Em High and High Plains Drifter) then I suspect you'll rave about this one. I can't fault it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Non-American Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie for western fans; a genre in film decline the past couple decades. All the elements of westerns - damsel in distress; western town; stage coach; vast vistas; townspeople of various goodness/badness qualities; and, coup de grâce, almost singularly it's one nice guy against many baddies. Similar to the exceptional "The Dark Valley", it is a western without a direct American foundation. "The Dark Valley" was a German- Austrian endeavor filmed in Austria while this film's credits are mostly Danish, Scottish, French actors and filmed in South Africa. Lead actors are Danes as are the writer and director. As one indicator of the production quality the town sets were fully built and not just frontal facades. All of this could be a bit disconcerting to the authentic western experience, but if one thinks about it, the American west was being populated by mostly immigrant farming, ranching, mining Europeans during the classic mid to late 1800s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The West transformed into a Danish universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this new Danish Western suggests a religious content ? and so it turns out. Its father is Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter and grandfather Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars. These are pure revenge stories, which in Eastwood's case he spiced with the scorching taste of Apocalypse, Judgement and the Day of Wrath. But it is a Danish film, so Carl Dreyer comes to mind as well: I saw in the film an unlikely crossover with Ordet/The Word: the sheriff-minister recalls the vicar in Ordet, a figure of authority in his community but quite out of is depth to deal with what is going on around him. For that is needed an outsider figure untainted by social compromises, i.e. Johannes in Ordet, Jon in Salvation. And in this Manichean world of good and pure evil, the sacrificial martyrdom of the grandmother and the crucifixion of Jon have particular power from which resurrection follows for Jon, and redemption from evil for the community who have done nothing to deserve it. If you add to this the idea that Delarue's tyranny draws on memories of Nazi Occupation, you have a very Danish film indeed.It's all sustained by a compellingly dark visual style, understated acting ? Jon is, in the Eastwood manner, a master of the 'voluntary inexpressive' ? and some brilliant narrative ellipses that catapult the story forward.My blog: www.cawkwell200@gmail.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns, you don't see them made much anymore. They usually trod a path that has been very well ridden many times over. And so does this one. However, with still plenty of originality with the input of The Danish settlers.It's all mainly style over substance, but man, what style. Extremely saturated Technicolor-look colouring, the night scenes are almost to much in my opinion, and set designs straight out of Spaghetti western textbooks. It's all great to look at and it sure gave me a satisfying smile on my face.I absolutely loved the cast. These two Scandinavian actors (Mikael Persbrandt is of course Swedish) are the creme de la creme of Scandinavian cinema and they really look and play the part, with all the dirt and grime and blood and wrinkles.. awesome. Again textbook Spaghetti western. And then Jeffrey Dean Morgan; cool as hell and as mean as the devil himself, accompanied by a creepy, yet great, Eva Green, who makes the most of her role and has some nice surprises up her sleeve. Jonathan Pryce plays the role he's played before and also shines and the rest of the cast have little to do (Cantona a bit to little) but make up the rest of the town.Overall a great stylish western that owes a lot to the western greats 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review- The Salvation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Salvation is a 2014 Danish film, directed by Kristian Levring, the film boasts an very impressive cast including; Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green, Jefferey Dean Morgan and Jonathan Pryce.The film is set in 1870s America, it focuses on Jon (Mikkelsen) a peaceful Danish settler,who after getting revenge on his family's murderers, which infuriates the local gang leader, Delarue (Morgan) who in turn wants revenge on Jon. The story isn't the most complex, actually it is rather simple but it is a very enjoyable ride. There are a few very exciting action scenes throughout the film but the real focus is on this man, Jon, who has lost everything and how he copes with that.The film was very interesting being a Danish western, its nice to see a Western at all, they are probably the least made genre of film now days, so seeing a western is a pleasant surprise.Mikkelsen is great in this role and it is nice seeing a different side of him, he tends to usually be a villain so i thought it was refreshing to see him the other way round. As was Jeffrey Dean Morgan who played a very good bad guy, he was intimidating and evil with a sympathetic side for his brother which was very intriguing. The most surprising actor in the film was Eva Green, who plays Madelaine, a mute widow, Green was amazing in the role and it was a surprise to see a character like this on screen, of course being a mute she couldn't speak at all and acted a lot with her eyes, but you knew exactly what she was feeling and wanted to say.The film looks beautiful and is shot in Johannesburg, South Africa, they built sets for the town which looks exactly like you think a western town would look like.The Salvation is a very fun, enjoyable film to watch, it boast great performances from the leads but isn't an absolutely must watch, but it is a nice place holder until the next great Western debuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Jensen (Mads Mikkelsen) and his brother Peter left Europe after fighting on the losing Danish side in the war of 1864. They struggled to survive in the American west for 7 years. In 1871, Jon brings over his wife Marie and son. While traveling on the stagecoach, they are accosted by two violent men. They kill his wife and son. Jon avenge them by killing the men. One of them turns out to be gang leader Henry Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s brother. Henry demands revenge on the killers. The townfolks bring out an old woman and a drunk to appease Henry. He kills them but it doesn't fool him. He doubles the protection cost and demands the real killer. Madelaine (Eva Green) lost her tongue to the Indians and was Henry's dead brother's woman. Mayor Nathan Keane (Jonathan Pryce) is an undertaker.This is a simple revenge western. That seems to be the main critique for people but I don't see that as an automatic failure. Mads Mikkelsen is one of the best at creating a quiet intensity. He is a nice guy with some darkness. The start inside the stagecoach is a scary opening. Despite its well traveled plot, there are some small interesting outliers. The townfolks try to sacrifice an old woman. In an another movie, it would have them be sniffling cowards and turning into violent mob. In this movie, there is a quiet resignation. I think critics take that resignation as a lack of intensity. It's simply another color to paint the old style picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching westerns lately. "Unforgiven" was a high point of this so-called marathon I've been having with these films, but it's cool to see some "smaller" movies too. I thought "Bone Tomahawk" was an interesting little flick, but this one was a nice surprise too."The Salvation" is a simple movie. What it lacks in budget, originality or set pieces, it makes up for in intensity and effective flow of the story. This is a revenge movie, as pure as they come. It never pretends to be anything else. And if a revenge movie starring Mads Mikkelsen exists, I'll be sure to watch it.Our main character (Mads Mikkelsen) is a danish settler and a war veteran who's been a few years in America. His brother is there already with him. He's waiting for his wife and child to visit him for the first time. And while this movie is nowhere near original as a concept, I did love this little setup about people who traveled so far to make ends meet. The spirit of hard times is captured well enough, and there is a sense of change in the air. The settlers even speak danish to each other, and English to everyone else (90% of the spoken language is in English, so don't fret). All of this is set up quickly, and that's where the subtleties end."The Salvation" doesn't waste your time after it sets up the stage. Very soon things start to go south. Bad things happen, bad people are presented, and the struggle begins. It's extremely straightforward. There are only few surprises, if any, but the movie is just too effective to be brushed away. In a sense it's also brutal, but it's not very graphic. This can be a missed opportunity, because I normally want explicit, graphic violence in my revenge movies to satisfy my weird needs, but then again this movie has other strengths. In fact, the most tense and disturbing scene of this movie did not involve any visible violence, which is a sign of writer/director Kristian Levring knowing how to do his job.The actors are fine. Mads Mikkelsen is always intense. He can bring tons of emotion without even trying. He's got the knack for that certain visible raw emotion while restraining himself just enough, and that's exactly what he does in this movie as well. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is serviceable as a Hollywood B-lister rental, and Eva Green along with veteran Jonathan Pryce is fine too, but Michael Raymond-James was really good with his limited screen time, he nailed it. Special mentions go to Nanna Oland Fabricius and Toke Lars Bjarke. They had small roles but they were important ones, and I believed what they were selling. Mikael Persbrandt was alright as Mads' brother. Good job, danes! The budget wasn't huge, and it shows. Sometimes there is a bland look to this film. There is a weird amount of poor and strangely placed CGI and some of the effects are very noticeable, but once you get past that you will find some raw beauty in this movie too. Some night scenes, for example, are beautiful. Not necessarily scenery-wise, but execution-wise. I found some cool visual elegance in the simple things, such as light coming through bullet holes, and some nice camera-work here and there. This movie is well-shot without resorting to pretentious trickery, and there is a sense of style. That style is certainly fluctuating in quality and sometimes brought down by the budget limitations, but it's there.I liked "The Salvation". It's not spectacular, original or even deep, but it knows exactly what it is and it's loyal to its roots all the way. The simple, effective nature of it overcomes some budget restraints and weird effects choices. There are well-directed scenes in this, one tense scene in particular left a lasting impression on me. There is actual talent involved. If these movies can be charming, I would call this one charming. Check it out if you're in the mood for a good old-fashioned revenge western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Dutch Western is well shot, and occasionally well acted, but the movie buckles under its own stereotype-filled plot, flat characters, and awkward misogyny which remind you of all the reasons the Western died. Standout here is the Dutch protagonists' inexplicable superpowers and moral supremacy, turning what could have been an interesting look at the immigrant experience in the early days of the United States into a surface-level jaunt no more complex than the worst 60s Westerns, with the added bonus of several on-screen sexual assaults. I went into this film expecting to at least be pleased by Mads Mikkelsen's performance, but he wasn't given anything unique or interesting to do. He's still quite good, but don't expect anything like The Hunt or Valhalla Rising, or even Hannibal.Mostly I'm disappointed that the movie decided it was so perfectly happy staying within the prison of the genre it was trying to pay homage to. If anything it was more dry and unimpressive than it was genuinely offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jon Jensen (Mads Mikkelsen) is a peaceful American settler who has just welcomed his wife and son to the country. Regrettably their family reunion is cut short when two outlaws kill Jensen's wife and son. Jensen catches up with the outlaws a short time later and murders them both in an act of retribution. Henry Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is the man who runs the local town with his gang of nasties and he also happens to be the brother of one of the outlaws killed by Jensen. Upon discovering this Delarue employs some tough measures to get the townsfolk to aid him in finding the man responsible for his brother's death. Jensen learns that a group of outlaws are looking for him and soon finds himself in a life or death battle with the outlaws against seemingly impossible odds.As I've mentioned in my summary The Salvation is a fairly generic film; the feel of the film and the story have an old-fashioned feel to them and I'm sure if you stripped it all apart you'd probably find a bit of nearly every 'revenge' themed Western that's in existence. This, however, does not make it a bad film and I think the main reason that it works is down to its presentation...The Salvation remembers to keep things simple; it's a straight-forward 'eye for an eye' revenge story complete with a likable protagonist who its easy for the audience to get on side with and it also helps that he's the underdog in this battle making it very easy to have a vested interest in him as a character. Although Jensen is an easy character to like, I think Mikkelsen adds to this by giving his character a certain pathos; you always feel that violence is the last thing on his mind and that he only fights here because he has to. It also helps that he's a believable character and more often than not he has to employ a brains over brawn mantra to overcome the outlaws which is always entertaining to watch.From an acting perspective this is a rather mixed bag; Mikkelsen and Pryce for me were probably the best players here and whilst there were no real bad performances I did find Eva Green's character a bit of oddity here; she's given a lot of screen time, but absolutely no dialogue. I presume that she's supposed to be mute, but this is never made clear.There are some minor weaknesses with this picture; firstly I felt that character development could have been better. It also seemed to have a mini sub-plot revolving around Delarue buying out the town which never really went anywhere, but these are very minor things and if I'm being honest I'm probably just 'nit-picking' again.The Salvation is a cold, brutal &amp; gritty western which is perhaps a little too generic to be considered as anything special, but at the same time is also too good to be ignored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice kick-start but poor visuals makes it all-around ludicrous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie inverts the developing-tragedy type of story by kicking off with the tragedy and then going to the main action. I guess it may be called a revenge plot. And although not much original, it hits you strong in the first few minutes. After some years living abroad, Jon (Mads Mikkelsen) finally gets to see his wife and son who came to live with him on this western strange land (USA).Only a few minutes after their arrival their coach ride to wherever home was is transformed into a rape and murder scenario by two typical gunmen. Jon got his revenge too soon too easily but what he didn't know was that he had killed the brother of a fearful western gang head, Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).And then this is it: Delarue seeks his revenge while Jon tries to survive. The villain has the unlikely aid from the town's sheriff, and also the consent from most town members, just because they relied on the gang for protection albeit obvious mixed feelings.The other supposedly main characters are nothing but forgettable, like the mute wife of Delarue's brother, who would surely be far more interesting if she could say a word, and also Jon's brother (and his major helping hand in his ordeal) who was also a man of few words himself.Even so, I think this movie could be pleasant to watch if there was no ludicrous CGI all over the shots. When I say "all over" I mean something like every other five minutes you get that perfect background scenery that just does not go along with the foreground. Besides this, you also have completely crap CGI fire and rain (CGI rain, really?). I simply do not understand how other reviewers are able to miss this (a simple web search will tell you that "some 900 shots visually altered through CGI and various digital and backdrop alterations"). Almost everyone with good taste will agree that Mikkelsen is a great actor, too great to be fronting such a mediocre movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good solid modern western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining revenge western in the 1970's Clint Eastwood vein Maybe not quite as gritty as High Plains Drifter or Hang 'Em High, but it certainly taps into that 70's western vibe that isn't as romantic as the 50's / 60's western pomp. The plot is nothing new but at 90 minutes long it doesn't outstay its welcome and there is little flab. The movie looks beautiful. The sets are very cool and realistic. and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Eric Cantona steal the show as charismatic but completely reprehensible villains. Mads Mikkelsen puts in a solid performance as the tragic hero but he's blown off screen by Morgan's firepower.On a lighter note I think this must be one of Eva Green's easiest jobs ever. If glowering intensely was an Olympic sport she'd be taking the gold medal home for France every time and that's basically her role here. It's kinda fun watching her carry her role with her eyes, which, I guess most people would agree, is one of the largest factors in her popularity anyway. I guess you'd say she was tailor-made for this role in a way, but its kind of an obvious choice.I'd recommend this movie if its on the TV. Its a decent action movie, maybe not particularly original but if you are looking for something to round off the evening before calling it a night, you can't go wrong. I wouldn't waste my cash on buying the Bluray / DVD. though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to Sergio Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As already mentioned the influence of Sergio Leone is clear with the usual assorted mysterious characters. None more so than Madelaine, played by Eva Green. The mute "banker" for the ruthless gang Henry Delarue played excellently by Jeffrey Dean Morgan.There was even a moral backstory about good people being turned bad by big corporations who used Delarue to force people to sell land rich in "Black Gold", i.e. oil. Their need for an air of respectability meant their dealings with Delarue were kept secret and although they didn't want him to use bully-boy tactics and violence it was obvious that this was in order to maintain plausible deniability.What made this film stand out, apart from a very decent revenge storyline, was the superb cinematography whose director of photography, Jens Schlosser, did a fantastic job aided by a large special effects team. He actually knows how to do night/low light scenes where you can actually see what's going on. I see so many movies today where anything could be on the screen. It's a case of the proverbial black cat, in a cellar, with the lights switched off. He should give classes on how to do it properly. As already mentioned by other reviewers the colours were superb and I agree the SFx team probably had some influence in everything being so vibrant. Overall a standout film with a bonkers ending but it's what you'd expect from a very good cowboy film. The heroes have to ride off into the sunset.</fullReview>

Typical western bad guy, with a good guy fighting tyranny. I love westerns so I don't really care. I'm not sure why they ask for ten lines of text just to post a review, some movies don't have enough content or story line to do that. So after your initial opinion, it becomes just rambling.

		<shortDescription>Formulaic western, but it works for the most part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those westerns where a lone stranger comes to town or forced into coming. Except with few differences, like how he didn't really have that much of a choice. He became a man with nothing to lose after all. This is a traditional western with slight modern touch to it, maybe because of the vibe I got from it or the way this movie was filmed. Anyways the town is overrun by a gang of outlaws or bullies and there just wasn't a person in town that would stand against them. So they just constantly give the bad guys what they want and hope for the best. Which in the real world, doesn't turn out all that well for the innocent folks. This is a vengeance western, where a man gets everything taken from him and he does get his payback early on. But it focuses more on the effects that comes with vengeance and what follows because of it. The main reason I wanted to check this not very well known western was because of the cast. Mads Mikkelsen, Eva Green and Jeffrey Dean Morgan and they put on a good performance. I wonder why they made Eva Green's character a mute in this though, she doesn't have a prominent role but still. Anyways my heart went out to the character Jon that Mads Mikkelsen played. Mads Mikkelsen played in another movie called "The Hunt" in 2012 and this movie is what could have been if the character in "The Hunt" was born in the 1870's. He plays another innocent character that gets treated like a criminal by the town folks which pushes him to the edge. Overall this is a good western that is sure worth a rental. It probably won't be a classic western, but it's a western that got most of the execution right. It just lacked the essence and soul of a true western but again it's still a western that works.7.8/10</fullReview>

If you like Westerns then you like this film.There is just enough emotion to make the characters feel real without overdoing and over extending the scenes. The characters' motivation is clear and their actions are pointed. The rustic set gave the film a great raw and edgy feel that kept my attention. Western fans will see familiar images and scenes from other classic Western films, which makes this film a tribute film in a way but it also stands on it's own merit as Western.Overall, it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irresistible, no-nonsense western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems the planets must have aligned perfectly, since we've been blessed with a new western, a Danish one no less. I would call westerns a dying breed, but save for the occasional one, it seems they've been dead for the longest time. The Salvation is not without its flaws, but it's wonderfully violent and takes no prisoners.It's the 1870s. Jon (Mads Mikkelsen) awaits his wife and ten-year-old son's return at the train station. They arrive and get on a coach to Jon's house, but two drunk guys interrupt the happy reunion and after a tussle, toss Jon out of the carriage. Jon runs after them, finds his son and wife dead. As you can imagine, he kills those responsible without the slightest hesitation. It turns out, however, that one of them was the brother of Delarue, a gang leader. Delarue terrorizes the town and the people are forced to essentially betray Jon, who finds himself almost alone in facing Delarue. But the widow to Delarue's brother, the mute Madelaine (Eva Green) will also play a part in all this.If anything, The Salvation won't signal the return of westerns. There's no denying we've all seen these types of Westerns before. The first film that springs to mind about a lone hero is High Noon. (There's a few other westerns The Salvation also tips its hat to.) But The Salvation explores some darker territory. It's more interested in the tragic cycle of violence and revenge than the idea of a lonesome hero. As such, the film is filled to the brim with violence and tragedy, sometimes to the film's detriment. While the sparse storytelling enhances the immediacy of these themes, it can make the amount of violence feel like an endurance test. While the cycle of revenge and violence are themes that come across loud and clear, less successful are other themes like the corrupting nature of oil and money. These aspects of the story tend to linger in the background.Despite all that, The Salvation is graced with some stellar acting and cinematography. Daytime scenes are bathed in that golden sheen whereas nighttime scenes are filtered to look almost black-and-white. The gunfights are also wonderfully shot. Director Levring thankfully prefers clearly choreographed action that doesn't hide behind rapid editing to 'enhance' the action. And who could forget Mads Mikkelsen, the man who can convey so much with so little. Eva Green is wonderfully cast as well. Her lack of dialogue allows her to convey everything with those dramatic eyes of hers.It's a bit of a pickle. The sparse storytelling and the lack of needless melodrama give The Salvation a rawness that I find really compelling in westerns. Then again, this same sparseness does tend to undermine the story's main themes and, to a lesser extent, its emotional impact. Like I said, it's not perfect, but in the end there's something about a hardcore, no-nonsense western like this that's irresistible.</fullReview>

The town is very depressing and the lead character Jon has as much bad happen to him in this movie as Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) in all of the 5 Death Wish movies.Mads Mikkelsen doesn't have the charisma of a John Wayne, Eastwood, or Cooper, but he's adequate as the one man army of revenge. The stand out performance is of the villain Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Very convincing and very intimidating. Mikael Persbrandt who plays Jon's brother also puts in a good performance. Eva Green has no lines but looks gorgeous! Darkest scene of the movie is of Delarue killing innocent townsfolk because his brother got killed. Overall a decent revenge western.</fullReview>

Your main character is weak and under developed. I hate it when a movie takes no time to develop it's main characters, and it doesn't take a lot. Quick glimpses of who they are, little nuances from the main players, both good and evil so that the viewer is invested in loving and or hating them. When you don't care about the characters you lose interest in the film. I hated it after the first 10 minutes and it only got worse from there.

		<shortDescription>The Hero Must Live so That We Can Have a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I somewhat enjoyed watching the film. Nice scenery, shootouts, greed, revenge, trains, horses, etc. that make for a classic Western. Now what's wrong with this picture? The script calls for the protagonist not to die. First, the filthy rotten bad guys throw him out of the stagecoach instead of killing him. "Sure, let's kill his kid and his wife, we'll deal with the guy later. Let's hope he's cool about this next time we see him!" Later on the ruthless psychopathic brother of the dead guy gets a hold of our hero. What does he do? He roughs him up then ties him up and waits around so the elements could do their work. I was thinking in the line of hanged, drawn and quartered, but never mind; wind, cold weather and the sun are just as bad, only that it would take a little longer and the guy would die in relative peace slowly losing consciousnesses and die. Another problem with the movie is its predictability. You knew sure as hell what was about the happen next till the very last moment like all Hollywood movies. I'm aware this is not Hollywood movie making, I'm saying it's like a Hollywood script. And the pretty girl was kind of an afterthought of a subplot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danish immigrant avenges family deaths due to oil corporation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kristian Levring's great Danish western draws less on the American classic than on Sergeo Leone's operatic extension. Hence the soft-focus opening on a railroad station, as if the Leone set of Once Upon a Time in the West has receded in memory ? as the ideals of the American west have. Like Leone, Levring uses the western to examine contemporary America and how far it has strayed from its original ideals. Where Leone used the western to address America's engagement in Viet Nam, Levring's interest is America's contamination by and sellout for ? oil. The nation's Edenic lure to immigrants figures in Jon and brother Peter coming to America to escape the ravages of Denmark's war with Germany. After seven years Jon brings over his wife and son, only to have to imperil his and his brother's lives to avenge their rape and murder. In the last shot the camera pulls back from the villain Delarue's charred ruins of empire, revealing a landscape of primitive wooden structures drilling for oil. In the classic western the villain is the unvarnished outlaw or his civilized successor, the imperialist rancher or the banker. Here the villainy is in the oil oligarchy, the corporation that hires Delarue to drive out the settlers, buy up their land too cheaply, all the while maintaining the pretence of law and order. That is the new "civilization" in name only.Delarue sells the town "protection" like an ur-Mafiosi. The germinal town has an undertaker mayor and a preacher sheriff ? both emblematic ? who cowardly submit to Delarue while futilely waiting for help from the remote feds. In an early scene the town serves up a legless man and a widow to try to appease Delarue's vengeance. That surrender evokes Obama's appeasement of Iran. We've met the oil in passing. It lurks under the town's name, Black Creek. In a few shots it's a burbling infernal pool, like a living evil force. It has contaminated the well water. Worse, it contaminates the roots of American society here, as it undercuts the town's feeble attempt to bring civilization to the desert. It poisons the promise of freedom and equal opportunity that has lured generations of immigrants to America. And still does.The film contrasts two pairs of brother. Delarue glosses over his wild brother's tendency to rape and to murder, to justify his vengeance. Peter and Jon risk their own lives in each other's defence, Jon finally driven to avenge Peter's death. In morally opposite ways both prove themselves their brother's keeper. The mute Madelaine comes to embody a more courageous and moral America than the town officials. Captured by savages, who cut out her tongue, then corrupted by the Delarues' business, she tries to escape after Delarue forces himself on her. The corporate villains have brutalized her badly as the supposed "savages." When the righteous citizens want to kill her Jon intervenes. By saving him from Delarue she has earned her salvation, as Jon earned his by avenging his loved ones' murder. Of the townsfolk only the murdered woman's grandson moves to help Jon, fatally. He, Jon and Madelaine, by their active will and uncompromised values, earn the salvation that the town seems undeservedly to get. But those oil derricks suggest otherwise. The town has been saved from the Delarues but the more pervasive poison of the oil wealth looms. That brings us back from the wild west of myth to our too sadly real now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We've been hoping, praying that someone like you might come along to save us from our misery." Jon (Mikkelsen) has been in America for many years when his wife and child finally arrive. What starts off as happiness turns terrible when two men he is sharing a stagecoach with do the unthinkable. After taking revenge Jon returns to his home to get ready to leave the town. When one of the men's brothers (Morgan) shows up he is forced to face his destiny. I was looking forward to this. I love westerns and there really hasn't been a really good one in a while. The cast alone made this one appealing. While this is not one of the best westerns I have seen it is one of the best in recent years. Mikkelsen does a good job of playing a man bent on revenge, but Jeffery Dean Morgan really steals the movie. He is a perfect choice for a rough and unlikable cowboy looking to exact revenge of his own. Western fans will like this OK, and Morgan turns in a movie stealing performance much like Kilmer did in Tombstone. Overall, an OK western that is worth seeing for the performance by Morgan if nothing else. I give this a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danish interpretation of a "western" is for the tough-minded only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Salvation" (2014 release from Denmark; 92 min.) brings the story of Jon (played by Mads Mikkelsen). AS the movie opens, we are reminded that this is "American, 1871", and that Jon and his brother came over in 1864 after the Danish war, to start a new life. Jon and his brother are at the train station , awaiting the arrival of Jon's wife and young boy. Things go horribly wrong in the stage coach on their way to Jon's house, as two sadistic thugs brutally attack and kill Jon's wife and son. Jon is now out for revenge. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first, this is a Danish production all the way, as in: most of the crew that worked on this film is Danish, from director Kristian Levring all the way down. In other words, this is a Danish interpretation of what life in the rugged American West was like in those days. In the director's and photographer's mind, that apparently meant a very tough environment, barren and windy most of the time, with stark colors. Furthermore, this western was filmed in very southern South Africa. It all makes for an interesting 'cocktail' of a western. The biggest short-coming of this movie for me lies in the story (or the lack thereof): this is a revenge movie, with few words, literally: Eva Green (in the role of 'baddie' Madelaine) plays a mute woman whose gorgeous eyes do all the talking, and Mikkelsen is a man of few words as well, whose guns do all the talking (reminding me of Clint Eastwood, of course). The movie flashes by as if in a blaze of glory, to quote yet another western, and so in that sense it works quite well. Last but not least, I really enjoyed the instrumental score, composed by Kasper Winding. Check out in particular the acoustic guitar solo that plays over the movie's end titles, just superb.I saw "The Salvation" this past weekend at the Silverspot Cinema in Naples, FL. The matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay. I can't imagine that this movie will play extensively in the theaters. If you are into westerns, this is definitely worth checking out, be it in the theater or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Salvation" is an engaging Danish film telling an intense story set in the American West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The business of making and distributing movies seems like it's becoming more international by the day. British films like "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and "The Imitation Game" were very successful last year, both in terms of ticket sales and end-of-year awards. Movies like "Kingsman: The Secret Service", "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" and "Paddington" have gotten the Brits off to a great start in 2015. At the same time, a Mexican film called "A la mala", a Mexican-German production called "Buen Dia, Ramon" (and "Guten Tag Ramon"), an American-Belgian remake of "The Loft" (originally, a Belgian-Dutch production) and a vampire mockumentary from New Zealand, called "What We Do in the Shadows" have been among the most creative and enjoyable films so far this year, with the South African film "Chappie" making quite a splash as well. Enter "The Salvation" (R, 1:32). It's mostly in English and takes place in the post-Civil War American West, but its male and female leads are Danish and French, respectively, and this is a film from Denmark that was filmed in South Africa. That's quite a mixture of influences ? and this is quite a film! Mads Mikkelsen (most famous as the Bond villain in "Casino Royale" and, more recently, as NBC's "Hannibal") stars as Jon, a Danish immigrant who came to the American West to make a better life for himself and his small family. After seven years of hard work, Jon was finally able to send for his 10-year-old son, Kresten, and his wife, Marie (played by Danish singer-songwriter, Nanna ?land Fabricius, or Oh Land). Two local men who share the stagecoach ride from the train station make suggestive comments towards Marie, one grabs her and the other holds a knife to Kresten's throat. The men throw Jon off the stagecoach and he's unable to catch them. The next morning, Jon finds the stagecoach sitting beside some trees, the bodies of the two drivers lying on the ground. The two murderers have also killed Kresten and dumped his body nearby. As Jon approaches the stagecoach, the men have just finished raping and murdering Jon's wife. This being the Wild West, and Jon, being a strong man and a loving husband and father, kills the men. And none of this even qualifies as a spoiler because all I've done is set up the film's main conflict.One of the men Jon killed was the brother of Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), the brutal leader of a local gang. Delarue demands that the townsfolk produce his brother's killer. But there were no witnesses. No matter. Delarue threatens to kill some of the people in the town and double the protection money the town pays him until he gets what he wants. Meanwhile, he'll bide his time continuing with his master plan to control the town and the land surrounding it, while sleeping with his brother's widow, the mute but tough Madelaine (Eva Green, also from "Casino Royale" and also currently starring in a TV series ? Showtime's "Penny Dreadful"). All this sets up a climactic showdown between Delarue and Jon, who is receiving almost no support from the town's residents. This is the kind of town where the mayor (Jonathan Pryce) doubles as the undertaker and their priest (Douglas Henshall) also serves as the sheriff. The residents of this small town are too scared, too callous or too self-interested to help anyone but themselves, and some will stab you in the back if you give them half a chance."The Salvation" is a very engaging western. The cinematography and editing highlight both the beauty and danger of the film's setting and add to its tension. This is a very dark story without a lot of winners, but it feels very personal and it works as a great drama. The main reason it's so effective is the terrific performances. Along with a strong supporting cast, Mikkelsen, Green and Morgan are all burning intensity who, while varying degrees from perfect, are just trying to survive doing what they think is right. While the plot may not be ground-breaking, this foreign take on the American West feels fresh and real, while providing its audience with a powerful cinematic experience. "A-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a decent enough Danish-made spaghetti western. Nothing more and nothing less. It could easily have been a young Clint Eastwood in this movie. Instead the lead character is Mads Mikkelsen who makes a quite reasonable performance as far as I am concerned.I have to say that it felt a bit funny when the characters spoke Danish in the first parts of the movie. It did add a bit of special touch, at least for me, to the movie though. I guess that people who do not understand Danish may be less thrilled about that though.The movie itself is a fairly straightforward good guy versus bad guy revenge story. It is a good old-fashioned Western without any silly complicated plot and without trying to make any attempts to show the "real" west or put a social spin on it. It is clearly made to entertain those who like classical spaghetti westerns. Personally I find it nice that someone are still willing, and can get funding, to make those kind of movies. I liked both Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green, although her role is mute, as well as Jeffery Dean Morgan as the bad guy.Having said that, the movie falls a bit short of being a great spaghetti western. It never really manages to create that grim atmosphere around the lead character when he embarks on the road of revenge and I have to say that the end fight felt a bit meh.Nevertheless this is a decent enough movie which should please most fans of classical old Western movies. I for one consider it a worthwhile addition to my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As westerns go this feature film was above par but still left me with an appetite for wanting a lot more. Understanding that the Danish are not well known for the classic western genre they did develop a relatively good cast with the lead actor Mads Mikkelsen playing Jon Jensen. Now Jon arrived in the United States six (6) years prior to get a head start on building a life and a ranch before sending for his wife and ten (10) year old son from Denmark. Jon also has his brother Peter Jensen (played by Mikael Persbrandt) around as his trusted side kick and all around bad ass brother.No sooner do Jon's wife and son arrive by train for the long awaited reunite and single embrace than the three are loaded on to a stage coach with two vagabonds who just got out of prison and who have a hankering for some cheap booze and female company. The plot is easily understood that these two criminals want Jon's wife for their own relief and quickly turf Jon off of the stage coach leaving his newly arrived wife and son to the desires of these two bums. This film is not like Clint Eastwood and Gene Hackman's Unforgiven where the good versus evil is delivered with panache'. Jon does catch up with the stage coach but he is too late. So Jon does what any struggling farmer from the old west would do, he quickly exterminates these two cockroaches who have taken away the lives of his wife and only son. What Jon does not know is that one of the two cockroaches that Jon has taken out his revenge upon is the brother of the feared gang leader Henry Delarue who will want his revenge quickly and with no compassion. Cast as the villainous Henry Delarue is Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is equipped with the stereotyped black beard and an ankle length black leather coat, and a dozen or two cowboys that jump at his every command. As is the case in most westerns there usually is a scene by a late night campfire where the cowboys are eating re-fried beans and black coffee from tin cups. But since this is a Danish production they chose to leave out a common camp fire scene and we get the re-fried beans scenario replaced and way overdone by a burned out CGI town that is the hole in a wall hangout for Henry Delarue and his gang. As I am a devoted fan of the western genre I despise when the computer generated imagery (CGI) is utilized to save production costs and time. The Salvation utilized CGI technology in Delarue's burned out town throughout the film. I did like Mads Mikkelsen's performance even though I find it difficult to believe that someone who is capable of taking out the villainous Henry Delarue and a dozen gang members was the same farmer who was incapable of killing two low life cockroaches on a stage coach after getting the upper hand on them.As westerns go I do believe it is worth watching. As for the re- fried beans reference the film was more than a bit over cooked with the plot done a thousand times before. The CGI was unwarranted as well as was the mute and saddened Madelaine wasted on Eva Green's hollow characterization of the gangster's Delarue moll. What's that smell? A 6 out of 10 rating. More coffee and beans please!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We've been praying for someone to come along and save us" from bad modern westerns. No need to saying anything more about this sweet Danish that others haven't said better. Leave it to the Danes to strip down the baggage of the Italian spaghetti western and reinvent it. Fantastic cinematography, expert casting and streamline story telling. The first five minutes are in Danish without subtitles but in a unique way that adds to the growing tension. I would warn viewers that the build up to putting Mads into Eastwood mode in very nasty and, personally, was hard to watch. Find a way to watch this dark, brutal take on frontier savagery and justice...love to see a sequel..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True cinéphiles will get my reference, and that is how I felt, having a second western for the evening after watching this film. Well I may dust off "Silverado" or "Unforgiven" for tonight! I am so glad westerns are made from all over, New Zeland, Mexico, Denmark, Italy, and I completely disagree with the "pastry" reference from one of the reviewers...Denmark has proved enough about good film-making, not just that, Hollywood itself likes re-making Denmark's series/ movies (Bron/Broen -The Bridge, "The Killing", "The girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "Headhunters", "Easy money",to mention some of the list) And Mads Mikkelsen, has become one of my favorite actors he is what Liam Neeson, in my book,has never accomplished, that is... real acting. Whenever I watch Neeson I think he is going to burst laughing in the middle of a dramatic scene.Well this is a review for a good western, and even though Sergio Leone was awesome, "The Salvation" stands on its own.The best of all, there is not gratuity nudity or offensive language, but it has all the elements and a good story behind the shootings and violence, not great but good enough!.My only complain would be the acting of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Delarue, and thankfully Eva Green do not speak a word through the whole movie (I also believe she may burst laughing in the middle of a dramatic scene).After my meanness towards Neeson and Green I have nothing else but recommend "The Salvation"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like a good revenge story, I also enjoy an atmospheric tale about the wild west. What I don't like is being conned by pretentious cinematography and overly 'earnest' acting.This film has all the ingredients required for the makers to congratulate themselves around the table at a dinner party... but has gaping holes through which the audience find little hope of finding entertainment.'Revenge' stories are difficult to set up. The trick being to make the 'baddies' rotten, but believable. The 'baddies' in this set up, are cliché ridden, and the 'goodie' is skillful, clever and grossly incompetent all at the same time. In short... the set up is irritatingly implausible.Good actors then engage in a roundabout of 'serious' stereotypical mugging. and the 'ending' of the film becomes obvious in the first 20 minutes. It's not that it's a bad film... it's that it is a 'project'. The sort of film that we can say we've seen... but only in hope that someone will think we are film buffs, as a result.The set up is preposterous. The manipulated sense of evil is absurd. Quite what Eric Cantona is doing in it is beyond me. I like him... but he has made better adverts than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm barely a 1/2 hour into this "movie," and am about ready to turn it off. It's a typical revenge movie, set in the west. But, it seriously lacks credibility.Our "hero" carries a gun, and actually gets the drop on the two scumbags who are about to rape (and probably kill) his wife. If he's carrying a gun, and this good at turning the tables on thugs like these, why didn't he shoot them right there? After not ending the two thugs, they probably would've put bullets into him before chucking him out of the stage.Next, the "brother" of the lead rapist and leader of the thug-gang in the territory arrives in town. His demand is justice- The Sheriff either bring the "suspect" who killed his brother and co-thug to justice, or he will kill 2 people from town. I was laughing as the Mayor and Sheriff marched two people over to the lead-thug. But, I laughed harder when he shot another random townie.Maybe they got the stupid out of their system; I'mm gonna force-feed the rest of this "award- nominated" movie (of course, the nominations were for set design, costumes, and score... certainly not for writing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mads Mikkelsen is one of my favourite actors and I try to watch all the films with his participation - managed far more than half so far... Thus, I was naturally referred to The Salvation, and I can say that the 1 hour 20 minutes fascinated me! Well, Mikkelsen is always great to follow, but sometimes happens that he fills out the screen, but his supporting actors and/or plot leave to be desired. This is not the case here: in spite of both smaller/limited fame and presence on the screen, the other actors are equal to their tasks, particularly Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Delarue, Mikael Persbrandt as Peter, Jonathan Pryce as Mayor Keane; Eva Green as Madelaine was stylish, but her character was not too exacting. Although the plot was typical Western, it had his twists, the events-scenes rounded up in a smooth manner, paving the way for vague, yet understandable ending.Thus, a intense and good movie, it should be given more attention and praise it has obtained so far. And admirers of Mikkelsen will not be disappointed again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Salvation" (2014) isn't the most original western, but it's a damn good one. It's been a long time since i was so captivated by a very simple story set in the Wild Old West. This is a very well made western. There is a good acting by all involved, good cinematography - not epic, but the one that captures this story very well. It's not very original in terms of story, but what western was very original? It's a simple story very well told. Overall, if you like western genre, you should definitely check "The Salvation". It has everything a good western should have - a very bad villain, a very good central hero (for whom as well as his brother i was rooting for a whole movie), calculated for this kind of story and mood cinematography, good directing and good set design. It's not an Oscar material, but for one evening it will do it's justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong, loving tribute to classic westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic, Sergio Leone-like western movies are becoming a rare treat these days. Once in a while they make a good movie like the latest True Grit, but most of the ones coming out nowadays are nothing to scream about. However, this Danish labor of love is a solid tribute to the likes of Once Upon A Time In The West and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly that stays true to the traditions.This movie has all the classic trademarks of the genre: a protagonist with a tragic backstory, a ruthless and despicable villain, intense gunfight and a grim, gripping story about righting the wronged. While it doesn't add anything new to the formula, what it does it does incredibly well. Despite being made in Denmark, the cinematography isn't any inferior to the best italowesterns. The harsh setting and the gritty atmosphere keep the audience at the edge of their seat.While the characters aren't the most memorable, they're still strongly written and acted. Mads Mikkelsen looks and sounds the part perfectly for a man that has nothing to lose anymore after losing everything, Jeffrey Dean Morgan brings the right amount of threat and brutishness to the villain role, and even Eva Green, whose character doesn't speak at all, leaves a strong impression with only her expressions and actions.The Salvation certainly manages to bring back memories and feelings evoked in Sergio Leone's work, but at the end, it sort of leaves a feeling that it could give more. As much as hardships and intensities our main character goes through to triumph it the end, it doesn't have as big of an emotional impact as Harmonica's struggle, since the blunt tone of the movie doesn't have as much room for character development or humor present as in Leone's films. That being said, The Salvation is a great testament to the western genre, and worth sitting through more than once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddle up for The Salvation (No spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hard-boiled tale of revenge hearkens back and pays homage to the great Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie, but found myself very pleasantly surprised. I think this movie's secret is that it walks a razor's edge of realism; the action and storyline are believable but epic at the same time; the characters are colourful but still feel authentic; it's more stylized than a film like The Unforgiven, but doesn't got too far that it becomes cartoonish. From the get-go, you'll be drawn in by the edge-of-your-seat suspense. Mads Mikkelsen plays the stone-faced protagonist flawlessly. He emotes so subtly, never overplaying his hand. And, Eva Green shines without saying a word, fierce and sublime. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Delarue, the antagonist, to perfection, like he sprung from the pages of Cormac McCarthy novel.If you love westerns, you will love this movie. While it's not perfect, I still rank it up there among the best of the genre, a must-see. It's so nice when you stumble on a rare gem like The Salvation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence driven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a very thin layer of plot, The Salvation is driven largely by its brutality. The plot serves only as a background for the violence. Visuals and camera angles are good. Character portrayal of the main protagonist and the main antagonist are also fine. However, the lack of proper conversation leaves them one dimensional.All the main characters retained constant, changeless expressions through the whole movie. Yes, the villain here is really cruel and Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrayed this cruelty well. Unfortunately, no basis for this cruelty is revealed - is he a sadist? Greedy? Avenging something? Craving for power?Same thing can be said for the characters of Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen. Both actors maintain a constant expression being far far away from their charm in 'Casino Royale'One more drawback is the jumps between scenes in several occasions. In one frame someone guards a home, in the second he is dead. And since there is no mystery involved, it looks a bit awkward.The good thing about the movie is that it's relatively short, and feels accordingly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible journey to the Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an industry that is crying out for more Westerns, it's always with excitement that genre fans like myself can look forward to a higher profile western like The Salvation as we're always ready, baying for more dirt, more gun-slinging and more guitar twanging but low and behold the Salvation is sadly not our western starvation salvation.A film so bereft of any type of identity or purpose that it's quite bemusing, Kristian Levring's film is like a mash up of classic Western staples, but not even in an homage sense does it make the lifeless 90 minutes of this tale worthwhile. Directing with an odd sense of detachment that disallows the audiences to feel even the slightest bit of empathy or pity towards any of the Salvation's participants, Levring feels like a director lost in the hope that he can mask his productions shortcomings with bouts of confronting violence or some undeniable neat camera movements, but there is no hiding from the fact that almost every element of the Salvation is dire.A hugely impressive actor of great screen presence, Mr. Lector Mads Mikkelsen can't even save this films troubles with a character that is like many another wild west staples yet doesn't possess any ounce of there often nameless charisma. We feel none of the love or loss that Mikkelsen's Jon feels at his woes and when plumped beside a scene chewing yet once more off the boil turn by Jeffrey Dean Morgan as villainous Delarue and a totally unwarranted addition of a mute Eva Green, the ensemble rounded up here produce nothing but blanks where other Westerns unleash a barrage of precision shots. Forgive me in mentioning once more ? Eva Green is mute! Her casting one of recent cinemas most pointless and when her Madelaine offers absolutely no plot advancement you get the feeling someone just wanted a pretty woman around the set.We all know the simple joys that Westerns offer us and of course fans of the underused genre don't expect a Searchers or Good, the Bad and the Ugly every time a new wild west player comes out but fans are also deserving of efforts much more rewarding than this dire, dull and downright dreary tale of vengeance and unlucky stage coach travellers.1 and a half pairs of stolen boots out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

Jon's helper dies without us having much knowledge or empathy with him. Madelaine, the abused woman suffering under both the evil brothers, does not show much that makes us like her, and therefore she also seems a bit irrelevant, even when she obviously is supposed to be a central piece in the movie.I am growing so tired of these hyper violent movies, like Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive and this, that I will shun these instructors in the future.

Man,and family are wronged ,and the hero sets out to right those wrongs.Plain and simple.That said ,its pretty standard formula stuff.However,if you like to be entertained for the running time ,this will work.I have seen films i thought were a complete waste of my time.This was not one of those.I enjoyed the movie ,guessed what was going to happen almost all the way thru ,but i still really enjoyed it.Some stories a told often,and it will always be that way.There,s an old saying ,that there are only 7 stories in the world ,they just change it up a little,with each re-telling.I often think thats true ,and i,ve been watching movies for over half a century.This film is really not bloody ,nasty ,or boring.It is simple story telling done well ,and after all ,isn,t that why we watch them ? Check this one out if you just want to see a good western.The overall look is nice.The attempt at period sets ,dress ,and speech is spot on ,and it looks like it was shot well,like maybe even shot on film.It does not look cheap ,and shoddy ,like a lot of low budget horse-opera,s are these days.you could do a hell of a lot worse.I liked it.don't let my score of 4 fool you,i,ve seen 80% of every movie ,from every country ever made ,and have yet to see a 10.I once saw a 9. Maybe someday i,ll tell you about that one.....we,ll see,but for now ,check out The Salvation .</fullReview>

It was fun to see a swede and a danish actor, I'll give them that. But the rest of the actors overplay didn't amuse me the least. The plot is the basic revenge story. Nothing wrong with that, but here it doesn't work. It gets old quite fast. The sex scenes with the clothes are as uninteresting as the rest of the cinematic effects they don't achieve. Nope, sorry, better luck next time. But with that said, If you don't have anything else to do and are curious how a Danish western may look, please take a look.

		<fullReview>The attraction of this film for me, was Mads Mikkelsen and Eva Green and my curiosity at the prospect of watching a Danish western. Unfortunately I didn't get more than fifteen minutes into the film before flaws in the writing appeared. The American West in the 1870's was a hard and in many ways vicious place occupied by such characters as James Hikock, Billy the Kid and Wyatt Earp. Life was cheap and the law was mostly absent. The wife of the lead character (Jon) is assaulted whilst he and his son are held at gunpoint by two other coach passengers. To imagine that having gained the upper hand, Jon would not immediately kill both men without a second thought is simply not believable. It smacks of utilising modern morality in a historical context and just doesn't work. The rest of the movie is formulaic and predictable. Great performances, although it's a pity Eva Green's character is mute, reasonable production let down by inaccurate writing.. although you do learn something new every day..

		<fullReview>I have to admit, this is one of the few movies I went to see because of the hype.But now after seeing it, I have to admit, that I just don't get why this movie is so hyped. Some seem to like The Salvation because it is a big budget production AND a western from Denmark. For me such anomalous occurrences don't make it instantaneously a better viewing.I saw the movie at a theater, which was obviously good as a smaller screen would've most likely left me bored with what I'm seeing. The acting is good. As in not embarrassing, and occasionally the actors succeed in masking the dull writing this movie is plagued with. Except Eric Cantona, who was more charismatic with the red shirt of his football team.As noted, the script had my eyes wide as saucers more than once. Not because it was surprising - and indeed I do not feel the need to be constantly surprised - but because I was astonished that they went so by the book. If the viewer has seen a single classic western, they will know how this formulaic movie will pan out.That's no spoiler, just a warning not to expect too much.Unfortunately, despite everything this movie does well, it does nothing exceptional. Violence exists, but causes neither excitement nor revolt. Love on screen appears to the viewer like it appears to an autistic person, people acting out things they are supposed to do because that's what people do when they love. And as stated before, if you've seen a western movie, the only gimmick here is the highly intermittent danish language.This movie IS like Arizona: a gritty surface, but a lot of nothing inside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is an easy "tell" (as in a poker tell) ...If you read a review where the reviewer compares this oddball neo-western to the original "spaghetti" westerns of the 60s, you can be ASSURED that said reviewer was not actually there in the 60s to watch the films being discussed, and is simply making it up as goes along.Because there is no comparison.The year was 1964. A relatively unknown director named Sergio Leone decided to bet the farm on his own personal vision of a what an Amerian western should have been -- assuming it was done in Italy with actors that spoke only Italian (except the lead, other parts were dubbed); featured violence and gunplay so stylized that even today there is nothing in film that even comes close; and included a sound track that became over time so iconic that it actually became a collectors item on its own.Time would tell the tale. Time would tell us that Leone was not merely "a" Italian director, he was one of the best living directors of the era. (See my review of ONCE UPON A TIME IN America). The actor chosen was not merely "a" actor, he became the #1 box office star first in Europe, then in America. then picked up an Oscar for directing. And the sound guy Ennio Moricone became a legend in his own right.And what does The Salvation give us? It is nothing like the spaghetti westerns, it is much more like the Canadian "westerns" of the 1990s where the country's film-makers tried to broaden their franchise (and piece of the US film pie) by showing how Canadian scenery could be re-imagined to whatever was needed.All the Canadian westerns were completely forgettable. The same can be said for The Salvation, save for Eva Green, who finally does what her fans have been waiting for, she delivers dialog with her eyes.There is no sound track to speak of, and the directorial style is early Bergman, that is, slow and plodding, generous use of shadows and bad lighting, and, in the immortal words of Don Rickles, comes in a close second when compared to footage of a fly crawling up a drape.</fullReview>
