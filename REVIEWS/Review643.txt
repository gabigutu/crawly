		<shortDescription>A nice return to the life of David Brent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Brent: Life on the Road is written &amp; directed by Ricky Gervais and stars Ricky Gervais, Jo Hartley, Ben Bailey Smith and Tom Bennett. A camera crew catches up with 'The Office' star, David Brent, as he pursues his lifelong dream of becoming a rockstar on the road.Gervais' comedic genius was firmly planted in toe-curlingly awkward situations back in 2001, with two very successful series and specials of The Office. 'Life on the Road' explores Brent's life after the events of the show, and continues to spawn the incredibly hard-to-watch moments that Brent gets himself into. The scenes in the new office are perfectly written and performed, welcoming us back to the situational comedy that was so brilliantly crafted.Unfortunately, once we leave the office the film slightly degrades into something more average than superior. However, this doesn't mean there aren't more hilarious scenes to follow, it just seems less consistent. I also thought that as the film moved into its final 15 minutes, it seemed like a bit of Derek had made its way into the character of Brent. That said, the heartfelt scenes were satisfying. It's possible that without Merchant's co-writing the screenplay wasn't as great as it could have been, but wishful thinking is something I like to do without. A lot of the band performances felt a little repetitive after a while, but they did include some funny moments. The music (also written by Gervais) is catchy and fun, adding a new dynamic that we only briefly heard in the original series. All of the actors involved are extremely convincing and show great chemistry with Brent. I felt that some of the characters were underused, most notably Nigel (played by Tom Bennett), who was surprisingly delightful. Overall, it was as I expected it to be and I am fairly pleased with how it turned out. It's not as consistently funny or awkward as I'd hoped, but it has a lot of heart. Gervais seems to implement a lot more emotion into his work now that he has gone solo, which is nice to see. Fans of Gervais will like it. Others, not so much. Verdict; David Brent: Life on the Road is an above-average follow up to the original series and while it does lack at times, it's a pretty enjoyable experience.David Brent: Life on the Road, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringeworthy for all the wrong reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precursor: Huge fan of the UK Office, the Gervais, Merchant &amp; Pilkington radio shows and Podcasts, and Extras. Life on the Road is a tread through the same old water that does nothing with the David Brent character except make him more unbelievable. The brilliance and innovation of The Office came from the characters being true to life, and carefully written. Without Stephen Merchant Ricky Gervais is exposed as an awful writer. Like Derek, this suffers from painfully clumsy dialogue, each character having to spell out their feelings as if keeping a diary. The "mockumentary" format is now well and truly a dead horse. Gervais has steered the comedy formula he popularised into a brick wall. The characters are all regurgitated. There's a new Gareth, a new Finchy, a new Dawn. The pacing of the film is awful and the whole second half is cobbled into one rushed mess of an ending. The concept isn't so terrible on paper. Brent's band, Forgone Conclusion, are a recognisable characteristic of every backwater British town, the group of ageing, leather jacket clad rock and rollers who can't let go, and want to give it one last push to "make it in the music biz". The problem is this shtick isn't enough to carry the film, and the fuddy duddy rock lyrics are a joke that wears thin. To combat this, Brent inexplicably writes songs like "Be Nice to the Disabled(s)", and the character is uncompromisingly steered into social calamity. Another problem with Gervais' sledgehammer approach to subtle writing is that the characters intended to come off as "cool" (Doc Brown's rapper character, the label reps) feel incredibly corny, while those intended to come off as corny come across as something far worse.We have little time to get to know or care about anyone in Brent's new office, these scenes are forgettable and do little other than trying to re-hash the TV series. Fans of the old XFM shows will notice a welcome return of Ho-Lee Fook, the little funny Chinese fella, in one of the funnier scenes in the film. There's not much else to get your teeth into: it's a pointless film. If Gervais and Merchant actually put their heads together and wrote something original, they'd be dangerous. As it is, like Derek, Life's Too Short and Hello Ladies, this is a tired vanity project with no purpose, no insight, and no imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A squirm-athon from beginning to end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life on the Road" is a mockumentary sequel to the classic British version of the TV comedy "The Office" (obviously later remade for the US market and featuring Steve Carrell). Ricky Gervais played the ego-centric David Brent, a monster of a character who exercised what little control he had in his managerial role at a Slough paper company.Here in "Life on the Road" we join Brent 15 years later where he has taken a rung or two down the career ladder and is working as a sales rep for Lavachem, a sanitary goods manufacturer, also based in Slough.But Brent still harbors a dream of making it big in the rock world with his middle-of-the-road band called 'Foregone Conclusion (2)'. Gathering around him his ethnic rapper 'friend' Dom Johnson (Doc Brown) and a band of session musicians (who can't stand him), Brent cashes in "several pensions" to fund a tour of the venues of Berkshire... or at least, those that will give stage time over to a "shite band". As the tour delivers predictably diminishing returns, and no record-company interest (at least, not in him) Brent is forced to face his inner demons and some uncomfortable truths.Bringing TV comedy characters to screen is fraught with difficulty, and few have successfully done it. Even legends like Morecambe and Wise struggled with a series of lacklustre films. Perhaps in recent times Steve Coogan's Alan Partridge has come closest with "Alan Partridge - Alpha Papa" and indeed there are a lot of similarities visible between Partridge and Brent: both have extreme ego issues and self-centredness. But there are significant differences as well, for while Partridge is just an irritatingly loud and obnoxious minor-celebrity Brent - as this film makes much clearer - has real mental illness.Is this therefore a comedy at all? Well, yes, but in a very black way. There are certainly moments of excellent humor, with the tattooing scene being a high-point. But the result of watching Brent's progressive decline, with his nervous laugh as a constant 'fingernails on chalk board' reminder of his insecurity, results in a level of audience squirming that is palpable. Everything he does is perverse, from describing in excruciating detail every song before singing it, to spending his money on multiple hotel rooms when every gig is within the County of Berkshire.As a black comedy its important that it doesn't outstay its welcome, and at 96 minutes it doesn't. However, the film lacks the courage of its own dark convictions, and unnecessarily switches tack in the last reel to provide a degree of redemption for Brent. Whilst 'sweet', it is also implausible given what's happened before and I would have suspected the interference of the director in lightening the mood of the writer's original intent. However, as Gervais is both writer and director, there is no such excuse. That's a shame.So, in summary, an uncomfortable watch that aligns appropriately with the high squirm factor of the original TV show. Prepare to laugh, but feel a bit guilty in doing so.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review, and to provide feedback).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's fair to say that 'The Office' was a well-observed mockumentary sit-com about the everyday mundanity of office life. A rare thing in a sit-com that seemed to improve as it went, making strong social comment along with laughs. But since the success of 'The Office', the Gervais-Merchant writing team have delved into difficult areas; the social comment, and laughs, declining as they went. 'Extras' felt indulgent and 'Life's Too Short' short on a lot of things. Much like Steve Coogan with Alan Partridge before him, Ricky Gervais - after some time away in Hollywood - has now returned to the character that first made his name. However, this time Stephen Merchant isn't anywhere to be found. As explored in the final Christmas episodes, David Brent is now working in the Berkshire area as a sales rep for a cleaning company. But, self-absorbed as ever, having saved some money, he takes some time off work, hires a backing band and sound engineer and organises a 'tour' of the region, living out his dream of being a musician. But, inevitably, his dream falls short for a second time. The film, therefore, is a building on one of the famous 'The Office' moments, where Brent 'went home to get' his guitar and tells the story of his former dream during a rather unsuccessful training day. What starts off as an adlibbed piece in a thirty minute episode becomes a feature film. There is a hint of over-indulgence here. When asked why there were so many songs in 'Bigger, Longer and Uncut', Trey Parker and Matt Stone replied that they 'wanted to be rock stars.' Gervais himself is a former musician, in a band that never quite made it. 'David Brent: Life on the Road', therefore, is a vehicle for Gervais to have his music heard on a wider scale. While these are songs designed to be comical, they are passable as songs written by someone who knows his stuff, rather than coming across as too amateurish. But with so much screen time dedicated to live performances, the songs are neither good, nor funny, enough to justify the focus. No doubt one of the funniest elements of 'The Office' was Brent's awkwardness when faced with sensitive subjects, such as race, disability and sexuality. A lot of the songs featured are along similar lines (literally), with awkward lyrics bordering on the offensive. While no offence is intended, the fact that it has become such an important part of his comedy over the years shows perhaps the frequent post-irony at play has left Gervais confused as to his own thoughts on the subjects. Moments become awkward, but for the wrong reasons. There are laughs here: some office bants still feature; and some of the songs do hit the funny bone on occasion. But one thing that's missing here is the others: Gareth, Tim and Dawn were all important parts of 'The Office' structure, and Brent's playing off them is what made it so strong. Here though, they are not present, and his interactions with the band - with the exception of Doc Brown's Dom - are kept on stage, lacking the natural flow of the series.But, more importantly, it may be the absence of Merchant that is most noticeable. Gervais needed the second writer to reign the Brent within and stop this feeling like life imitating art.As Richard Herring would say: 'They should have put Tim from 'The Office' in it.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painful Comedy Showing The Character 'David Brent' unsuited as a subject for a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of both 'The Office', 'An Idiot Abroad' and Ricky Gervais, so went to see this with high expectations. If follows up on David Brent some years after the previous 'BBC 2 documentary'After a period of depression where he was treated in an 'institution', Brent is now working as a sales rep for a sanitary products company. No longer a manager, his fellow reps tend to despise Brent's antics and 'humour'. Still with his dream of being a rock star, Brent cashes in pensions to fund a ' a rock tour' with his band '4 gone conclusion (mark II) with him as lead singer.Hiring musicians and a tour bus he takes unpaid holiday from work to tour at various venues where Brent has managed to obtain 'gigs' for the band.He aims to show case his singing and song writing talents and get signed to a record label. The resultant cringe-worthy performances by Brent and his band are predictable.The film is not disastrous, there are laughs but it struggles to be a comedy. In The Office Brent is a major character among several, so the cringe-worthy aspect of the character was diluted into what was a generally good comedy as a whole. However, in the film it's all 'David Brent' undiluted. Such a large dose of the crass character does not sustain comedy well. Sadly it's a watch once and never again. Big disappointment 6/10 .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brent - no coming back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in the opening scenes of Gervais' new film it would be hard not to compare Gervais' character Brent and Coogan's Partridge. Both top of their game, before being knocked off the their perches, spiralling into depression and weight gain and then seemingly bouncing back! Let us be clear Gervais is no Coogan, as it seems he has now written Brent into a Cul-de-sac, shattering the illusion of the relatable colleague we all loved to hate. Gervais' film Life on the Road tries to show the audience that this character is still as delusional as ever as he self-funds a UK tour (mostly around the M25) for his band Forgone Conclusion, hiring an indie band and throwing good money after bad. At 96 minutes long, it's a shallow concept, with the same old Office jokes making an appearance time and time again. The songs, while in parts are funny, were long and used as filler for what should have been at best a 60 minute Christmas Special. Brent is unrecognisable, and the traits the audience recognised and fell in love with in the noughties lost in an awkward, annoying wimpy laugh that begins to grate after the first 15 minutes. The whole film is focused on Brent striving to make himself a rock star. There's no sub plots, introductions to the other characters or any further depth given to Brent, thus making it a very long 96 minutes indeed. It is not too wrong to see Gervais' desire to become a silver screen actor satisfied by the film and maybe is the perfect example of life imitating art. Unfortunately Life on the Road is a misjudged film, where you can't help but feel has been a vanity project for Gervais. Perhaps his next project will be Millman chasing his dream of becoming a serious writer/actor and self-funding a film which inevitably flops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringe-inducing, well-made and funny but never truly exceptional and generally unmemorable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'David Brent: Life On The Road' marks Ricky Gervais' return to his beloved cringe-inducing creation seen in the 'mockumentary' entitled 'The Office'. This time around, David Brent is finally moving forward with his musical career; the film is set up as if a documentary crew were once again following him as he decides to go on tour with his band 'Forgone Conclusion Mark 2'. I've never seen the television series, and Gervais isn't a comedian who immediately appeals to me; in the past, I've found some of his appearances to be quite annoying and occasionally arrogant. I'm glad to say that, here, none of that was an issue. I really enjoyed my time with 'Life On The Road', finding it funny yet also surprisingly poignant and heart-felt at times. Its central message is a positive one and, when it is brought to the forefront, it isn't as cynical as the rest of the feature or Gervais' trademark bleak humour.The picture actually does have a cohesive plot which, whilst unstructured and sometimes repetitive, doesn't feel stretched to meet the longer run-time. Having said that, there isn't any real reason for it to be a theatrical release: sure, it's well executed but it does come across as an extended television special ? there's no reason to see it up on the big screen. The flick plays it fast and loose in terms of a traditional framework, but it's mostly successful as the little moments add up to an emotional climax as opposed to a necessarily narrative one. The film doesn't really dwell on setting up its title character, but I still managed to get a grasp on what they were going for rather quickly. It doesn't really matter that I didn't watch the show, as all of Brent's wishes and traits are made apparent within the first ten minutes. His most prominent feature is the uncanny ability to make any situation awkward, and to continue making his situation worse by simply refusing to stop talking. For the majority of the piece, we're laughing at him rather than with him. A lot of the scenes are genuinely cringe- inducing and they go on for an agonisingly long time, allowing us to feel just as uncomfortable as the people on screen. You often want Brent to just shut up, not because he isn't funny but because you feel bad for the guy. By the end, I truly felt sorry for the character as most of the time he clearly means well and doesn't cause offence on purpose. This emotional core surprised me, as I felt more connected to the character than expected, and it can actually be rather sad. The final segment of the movie shows Brent's more human side, which paves the way for some genuine attachment and a shows off a little bit of earnest profundity. It isn't too sappy however, and the jokes do come at a relatively fast pace. The picture is very funny at times, remaining mainly chuckle worthy for its run-time, but some of the jokes don't hit ? especially some of the more mean-spirited ones. I enjoyed watching it throughout and none of it offended me, as the character never means to cause harm. The movie was well-made technically, too. It is directed by Gervais, and he understands the documentary style. The interviews to camera and fly-on-the-wall segments work well, and he frequently utilised cuts to emphasise or create jokes. Sometimes, the documentary aesthetic falls away though a little - as some angles would expose the crew and there is a prominent drop in the amount of interviews.Gervais is great in the lead role, often coming across as an exaggerated extension of himself, and he displays good range when he has to. There are moments when his humanity shows and he accurately depicts someone trying to hold back raw emotion. He generally succeeds at making the character seem real and relatable, allowing the audience to feel an attachment even when his intentions are hilariously misguided. His little looks to camera, oddly embellished laugh and perfect timing all add up to a humorous screen presence; his presumed improvisation skills work wonders too, extending scenes awkwardly for minutes at a time. The other characters don't really have all that much to do, they basically just serve as surrogates for the audience as they too wince in discomfort as Brent digs himself further into his own little hole, but they all feel like real people and portray their characters well. Comedian Ben Bailey Smith, also known as 'Doc Brown', is fantastic here and really shows off his underused acting chops. An essential part of this movie occurs on-stage when the band are performing Brent's songs. Gervais has worked hard to release a full album in character. The music is actually well composed and performed, with a more than capable band and a good lead singer ? Gervais himself. Many people may not know that he started out making music, but the experience is evident; he's a good singer. A lot of the songs have catchy tunes, too, and a few were stuck in my head a while after leaving the cinema. The joke, then, isn't that the music itself is bad but that the lyrics are as ill-advised and graceless as Brent himself. He is definitely not politically-correct, singing about everything from the Native Americans to the disabled, though he doesn't know that he is perhaps causing offence. The time spent on stage does become a little repetitive, but its Brent that makes them watchable as the questionable lyrics and his bumbling demeanour make for some true laughs. Overall, 'Life On The Road' was a funny ? at times, hilarious ? feature with a surprising emotional core and cohesive style; sometimes, the aesthetic falls away a little and the story can be unfocused though. I enjoyed the film, but it was rather unmemorable and never truly exceptional: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately Ricky Gervais looks to have just taken this film for the pay check. This film is cringe worthy as expected from David Brent but offers nothing new to the character, is very simplistic and is very predictable throughout.Having watched much of Ricky Gervais' clever and thoughtful television series such as the original office, extras and Dereck I was hoping for something similar in the return of Brent. Unfortunately this is not it and the writing doesn't have much thought in it.For Ricky Gervais it seems that he should stick to making television series that he cares about and wants to say something about rather than making these poor and dull films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70 Miles Per Hour But No More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge Ricky Gervais fan, particularly because of The Office, part of me couldn't wait for this film, but the other part of me had its reservations. And as was the case with Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa, I feared the TV to film transition might be a bit of an obstacle, and this unfortunately seemed to be the case.The film starts well with the laughs cumin (ask me how I'm spelling it. C-U-M-I-N) every few seconds, introducing us to his new office and from the get-go, we establish who will play which role in the film - the love interest, the bad guy (if they can be called that), the geeky, lovable friend, and so on. These roles stay consistent, rarely challenging the audiences' expectations, moving forward a predictable narrative throughout the film. That being said, twists and turns weren't necessarily expected and the pay-offs at the end were still warmly welcomed and, as with The Office finale, quite emotional.Having started strongly, the film slows down quite considerably in the middle third, without a lot of story and/or complications. It really becomes a montage of failures for Brent where he is almost always the butt of every joke. And as the film progresses, Brent goes from typical Brent - arrogant yet embarrassing - to pathetic, to just feeling sorry for him. And at times when we're supposed to be laughing at him, I just felt like I couldn't bring myself to laugh at him anymore. It's at this point that he strays from the character of David Brent in a film which could have easily been renamed Derek: Life on the Road. The film becomes very much an emotionally-driven experience at the expense of humour. The emotional elements of the film in the last 20 or so minutes were strong however, but they just felt a bit too sad for the spin-off of one of the most loved UK comedy characters of all time. It cannot be disputed, however, that we do not see a concluding development of Brent as a person, because to see the more human side to Brent was refreshing.The cast of the film, unlike The Office, which consisted of largely unknown actors at the time, consists of almost every actor in a UK sitcom in the last 5 years and a handful of comedy panelists. Ricky does act brilliantly in this (although his vocal exhale/laugh combination does start to get a bit annoying after the 50th time of hearing it). Mandeep Dhillon, as the receptionist, was brilliant and did a great job of maintaining the documentary feel and therefore the real emotion of the film and of the character of David Brent towards the end. Doc Brown as Dom was also very good and I'm glad he was so involved after their Comic Relief single 'Equality Street' a few years back. The songs used throughout, as released in an album alongside the film, are so funny yet also brilliant melodically.It's a must-watch for any David Brent fan, and as much as I'd love to give it more than a 7 (I gave The Office a perfect 10), the title song summarises the experience quite nicely - foot down to the floor, the film only ever gets to 70 miles per hour and no more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been 15 years since we first saw the Office and the idiotic boss to which it starred. Now the mockumentary crew are back to do a follow up on that idiot as he decides to go on tour and prove it's never too late to chase your dream... Let the cringing begin. David Brent: Life on the Road is what you would expect of the title character and the writer/ director/ actor who brings him back to life in this film. It's cinematic marmite that I seemed to like the taste of.This spin off is all about one man as opposed to the original TV series. Ricky Gervais writes, directs and stars in every scene of this film, so if you aren't a fan or can't stand Ricky Gervais then simply don't bother with this film... But if you like Ricky Gervais, his humour and the shows he's made like The Office and Extras then you should love this film. I for one found this film rather amusing, not as many laugh out louds as the rest of my cinema audience found, but still laughs are to be had. Criney situations and rude humour make up most of this film and I honestly think it worked well. I found this film to funnier and less cringey than I expected making this more enjoyable than I thought it was going to be. Thisis a half decent comedy in my books.The story is simple; David Brent has a mid life crisis and goes on tour to resurrect his dream of being part of a band. What I liked about the plot was its shifting-of-the-goal-posts as, SPOILER ALERT, Brent's dream of being part of a band shifts to being accepted by the band and to be liked. Without this shift the overriding story would have been extremely depressing as, SPOILER ALERT AGAIN, David Brent has no chance of being signed as an artist. This narrative change brings a somewhat satisfying end to Brent's story even if you do think he's horrible. You have to admire his optimism and the fact he never gave up. The only issue with this shift is how sudden it is. SPOILER ALERT X3, you never get any indication that anyone likes Brent (except Nigel, Pauline and Dom), so when Dan says he likes David my reaction was to say "Really? You're just saying that." There isn't any slow development of liking David which I think the film should probably have had just to make it that bit better.Overall, Brent's back and he's back at it again with this marmite of a film. People are going to hate this film but equally people are going to love it. I would give it a go no matter where you stand as love him or hate him, you have to admire the spirit of David Brent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Ricky Gervais. LOVE the Office, the podcasts, Extras, the stand up shows. Brilliant. Couldn't watch past Episode 3 of Life's too short or through a whole episode of Derek. Something very obvious when Merchant isn't involved.I was fearful of this film, I wanted it to be good. I had watched all of the Learn Guitar with David Brent videos on Youtube and even saw the Foregone Conclusion live show at Hammersmith, so I knew a lot of the songs. The songs are well crafted and funny, so it's a perfect formula right? I feel Gervais tried too hard to go back to the Brent character, it's too tragic, too painful, too much.He says in all the interviews that it would be odd to have the same characters as in the office, still there after 20 years. But then he DOES have an office and the same characters are there, Finchy, Gareth, Dawn, the love interest (or versions of them)Don't get me wrong, I did laugh in this film, and it is rewarding, at the end to see the band end up thinking he is 'alright, actually' but it's so contrived. The end to the film feels very rushed. He packs all the classic Gervais things in, the slightly crying heartfelt interview (which he pulled off to perfection in the Extras Christmas special, when he was in Big Brother) but since then he seems to be trying to do that in everything he does. The film settles into a rhythm once they hit the road, they do a gig in a different location and you see one of the many funny songs performed. There was a scene where he 'picked up' two women after a gig, but he asked them back to his hotel room at a cash point, it all felt over the top desperate, why couldn't he have just me them in the club and then ended up at his hotel room, the jokes that followed would still have worked. Gervais wanted you to feel sorry for Brent, and he really hammered home this message, this worked in The Office because it was a lot more subtle and over 2 series, in a film, it was very hap-hazard and rushed. As the title says, this film is everything I expected, unfortunately I didn't expect much after seeing the trailer. This film COULD have been good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original series of the office was released whilst I was at university and still do this day I find myself reeling off quotes and chuckling to myself if something triggers a reference point. The two season and Christmas specials were fantastic therefore it is fair to say I had a lot of expectation coming to see this film; So where did it go wrong? Don't get me wrong, there are some laugh out loud moments and it is a perfectly watchable film.. however the biggest surprise for me is how Ricky Gervais seemed to forget how to play Brent! Every few minutes he makes a nervous laugh which is over done and wasn't his stand out mannerism in the originals so why does he do it! There is also too much criticism of Brent in this film, in the originals it was more awkwardness or reluctant smiles' it was more subtle whereas there is pure nastiness in this film which detracts from the comedy value. there are none of the original cast in the film which I think is a mistake and perhaps the biggest omission is Stephen Merchant as co script writer. Overall I think this film strayed too far from the original concept and time has diluted the mannerisms and ad hoc pieces of advice that we loved in the originals. Most Office fans will need to see this, perhaps you have more of a favourable opinion with lowered expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the Fans of the Office</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ricky Gervais writes, directs and of course stars in this main feature spin-off from his massive TV mockumentary, The Office which aired for the first time back in 2001 and spurred a USA version later in 2005. It's fair to say this was Gervais' biggest break, after a failed pop music career with Seona Dancing and managing Suede. He is undoubtedly one of the funniest and shocking guys around, however, that is subject to individual taste. Fortunately for me, I happen to be a fan of Gervais' material, especially having seen him live performing his stand-up. However, unfortunately for me I'm not so keen on his reinvention of the sitcom but I understand, it is great writing adding a sense of perverted realism to his comedies such as The Office and Extras. David Brent has been voted by many a poll as one of the greatest comic characters of all time, returns, however not the office manager he once was and instead, takes some holiday and unpaid leave from his sales repping to pursue his fame and fortune as a rock star. For those of you familiar with David Brent, you can imagine how ludicrous his tour pans out. Now, knowing about Gervais' background within the real music industry I can't help but think this is a self parody, maybe exaggerating past experiences from gigging and promoting bands including an unrealistic, blind ambition about hitting the big time. There was a prior resurrection of David Brent back in 2013 with a short and a nine episode series of 'Learn Guitar With David Brent which quite possibly was the start of this film. David Brent embarks on a tour with his band Foregone Conclusion in true office style as a mockumentary. The rest of the band hate him and the crowds (those that accidentally attend) don't like him, which guarantees awkward and inappropriate drama. I say drama, because, though cringe-worthy, it's not actually funny. But you can't fault the performances, the film's portrayals and not the gigs. The band is made up of Ex-Razorlight drummer Andy Burrows, Ex-Dumdums bassist and guitarist Steve Clarke and Stuart Baxter Wilkinson and ex-Clarksville keyboardist Michael Clarke. The latter three recently forming The Sad Professors. Oh, and of course rapper/comedian Ben Bailey Smith who is better known as Doc Brown.Surprisingly, the music isn't actually bad, with catchy hooks and good melodies but the lyrics are obviously outrageous and so unPC. Not sure if Office fans will be disappointed, but Brent is the only original Office member you'll see here. No Freeman, no fellow comedian Stephen Merchant and not even a Mackenzie Crook. However we have a Jo Hartley, Mandeep Dhillon and a silly Tom Bennett who is very good playing the fool (see Love &amp; Friendship.) Gervais is obviously a very busy man, undeniably successful but like many of the other Brit sitcoms moving to the big screen, it doesn't quite make the grade. It's seem to be tragedy of programs like Bean, Alan Partridge and this year's AbFab. I'm sure fans of the series will enjoy this but non-fans will possibly find it pointless. Was nice to see the recently closed Camden Barfly (now the Camden Assembly) The Electric Ballroom and I think Waterrats in King's Cross, just a shame they're not credited as they're doubling for somewhere else.

		<shortDescription>Very funny....if you like that sort of humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, many funny moments.My wife wasn't as enthusiastic and when i asked her why she said she was cringing because of the awkward moments brought on by Ricky's character...David Brent.The only thing Ricky Gervais has in common with other British comedians is that they love to laugh at themselves...make a goose of themselves....e.g John Cleese...Apart from that he is definitely one of a kind.The humour is an extension of his character in "The Office", if you liked this series then you will get the humour and will enjoy this movie.The plot centre's around David wanting to have a shot at fame and self finances a thrown together band and books a week's worth of venues. Barely anyone turns up and even his own band doesn't like him.The plot is OK...You can tell that David Brant despite all the 'foot in mouth' moments is a genuine tryer and does garner some sympathy towards the end of the movie. its apparent the humour does disguise an individual seeking acceptance and genuine friends. I had many good laughs - an easy 8/10 for me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Five-Word Review: Delightfully Excruciating, Funny, Unnecessary Diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing his unique brand of horribly awkward humour that made The Office such a success (with remakes in the USA, France, Germany, Canada, Chile, Sweden, and Israel), Ricky Gervais resurrects the phenomenon that is David Brent, idiosyncrasies and all. Following on from the Christmas specials, the hapless eponymous character is still a sales rep for a cleaning supplies company, yet still harbours dreams of going on tour with his band, a resurrected Foregone Conclusion. This film feels a little unnecessary, but that certainly doesn't detract from its enjoyment levels. After the perfect ending given to us by the Christmas specials back in 2003, the character was at peace and it felt like he had achieved some sort of catharsis. Nonetheless, this is premium Gervais - it probably helps that I binge watched all of The Office in the week before watching this, so was in a real Office-y mood. The humour is on point, from Brent's tics (the perfectly judged nervous laugh, the shifty grins to the camera) to his own form of inadvertently offending people. There's a good amount of pathos, too, with Brent really sinking to new lows over the course of the film. The plot is well-suited to the character, and another highlight is the songs - the standout being 'Please Don't Make Fun of the Disabled' - which are just hilarious when delivered by Gervais.Ultimately, though, it won't stick in the memory for long and it didn't need to be made - nor are the side characters as compelling as the likes of Tim Canterbury, Gareth Keenan, Dawn Tinsley, and Keith Bishop. It also feels a little sweetened and watered down at times, especially towards the end. It feels a little too perfect and not bittersweet enough. Still, an enjoyable 90 minute diversion for any Office fan, and good fun. 66/100.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bit of a shambles really, The first 30minutes concentrates on character intros and 'plot' development. The second 30 is all gross,innuendos and non-PC jokes, where the audience hardly laughed. The third 30 is where it becomes a movie worth watching - Brent shows his very vulnerable side, realizes he will not achieve his dream of becoming a rock star and goes back to sales rep-ping.But at least he tried and his heart was mostly in the right place. Rewrite some of the humour and screen as an hour long TV special would have been so much better.</fullReview>

Many laugh out loud moments, as well as some very cringey ones. Anyone who is a fan of the office and David Brent should see this.

		<fullReview>When political correctness met a sledge hammer, a shattering romance ensued, gobby as hell, and my gob I laughed till the very end credits! What makes this film so funny you may be wondering, and the short and simple answer is that it takes the mockumentary ideas fleshed out in The Office, and transports them from that bygone era into today's utterly self-controlled, regressive, politically correct world, where the right to not be offended trumps and invalidates comedy as much as it does society. This is the antidote, and whilst it is heartening to have seen a great many films this year that are not afraid of pushing the boundaries, if one were to declare leadership, 'David Brent: Life on the Road' would perhaps be crowned the King!

		<fullReview>So i was sat in a nearly empty cinema last night, watching the latest David Brent installment. I was hoping to watch the office again back to back before the movie, i didn't get time, but to be far i didn't need to! Ricky Gervais quickly reminded the small audience who David Brent is and was. Very clever. The opening sense where classic Brent so to speak, a few cheeky and a few rude jokes thrown in for good measure! The small audience reminded me that the office really was like mar mite to people, you loved it or hated it! Either way, this film whether you are a Office fan or not, it is still worth a watch! Ricky Gervais took you on a roller-coaster ride, he made you laugh, cringe, laugh, feel sympathy and even cry! Which is something incredibly difficult for a comedian to do. All in all, a great film and i look forward to watching this over and over again like i did the office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ricky Gervais' fictional character David Brent returns to grace audiences on the big screen, in a film that's equal parts funny as it is sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Life on the Road, David Brent (Ricky Gervais), the former manager at the offices of Wernham Hogg Paper Company (the fictional office from Gervais' 2001 TV series The Office) decides to pursue a career in the music industry, by taking his band Foregone Conclusion on tour.Gervais brings the character back to screens after being absent for the last thirteen years, in his own feature film. He plays him so well that it's as if he never stepped away from the role. The character of Brent is hilarious, but really only in small doses. By the end of the film he almost stops being funny, after we realize the man has some serious problems (which is touched upon slightly in the film), to the point where you start feeling guilty about laughing at him ? and for the most part you're laughing at him and not with him.Gervais, who takes on directing duties here, is well known for including this humanistic element in his work (see his show Derek for a perfect example). It works for the most part in this film, but the balance is a bit off. One minute you're laughing at the inappropriateness of the character's comments and the next you're cringing and starting to worry for him. If that was the effect the director was aiming for then he succeeded, even though a focus on the pure comedy may have served the film better.Even with all that, the film is hilarious in parts, and it's all due to Gervais writing and portrayal of the character. His supporting cast which includes Doc Brown as Brent's young rapper protégé Dom Johnson are all fine, but are really just there to portray the grounded normal people, further emphasizing Brent's eccentric personality.The featured music in the film is also great, with Brent spitting out completely tasteless lyrics to songs with themes that many politically correct people would likely find offensive. This is definitely not a film for those types of people.Fans of the UK Office, as well as fans of classic, sarcastic British humour will be glad to see Brent back in front of the camera. It's possible they might find him overbearing, however the humour in the film is perfectly reminiscent of the character from back when he debuted fifteen years ago, and in that sense it's a welcome return.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb addition to the Brent legend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have decided to write my first IMDb review in light of the strange trend of negative opinions on here about this film. We see David Brent a few years down the line at a new place of work but in a similar environment to Wernham Hogg, with a matching cast of characters in the office (there's a Vinnie Jones lookalike who takes on the "Finchy" type character in the TV series), but the unremitting bleakness of his situation is at least softened with a couple of office girls who like him and one even develops into a love interest. The self-financed "tour" takes up much of the film, with a band of hired hands who have so much antipathy towards Brent that he even has to pay them to have a drink with him after gigs. The music is superb, with a blend of cringworthy lyrics and surprisingly catchy melodies, with plenty of recognizable styles including Bowie, Dire Straits, Elton John and even Coldplay. Towards the end, just when you think it might end on a tragic note he starts to elicit sympathy and even a grudging admiration from some of the main characters which gives an unexpected feel good feeling at the end. As a big Gervais fan I was ready to be disappointed but he's done it again, a consistently funny film that will bear repeated viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cringe, cringiest, cringeworthy...so not a bad big-screen version of The Office.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My reservations about this film (and Gervais, as I'm not a fan) proved unfounded, for Life On the Road proves to be a bang-on continuation of the themes, humour, style, carefully constructed scripts and wince-inducing dialogue and pratfalls of its TV forbear.'Cringe-worthy' is a phrase that could have been invented to describe The Office and Gervais' own brand of humour. Prepare to cringe big time in this film folks as no target or minority group is left untouched.Gervais does, however, in a rare show or mercy and charity, gift Brent a happy ending he would never have received on TV. Gervais must be turning into an old softie, that Hollywood tinsel rubbing off on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at all, to some extent, very much so, don't know.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That title sums up how much I enjoyed this David Brent movie. The first half hour delivers loads of brilliantly cringy Brent-tastic moments as he shows us his new life in a new office with a new company 'Lavichem'. The good thing is despite Ricky Gervais being all over everything for the past 15 years, watching this you forget about Gervais and only see David Brent. He just plays the character to perfection, and although it's all familiar territory it was still enough to have me cracking up.However the film slowly but surely begins to get weighed down by its own plot line, and the constant talking-head style interview snippets with Brent's band Foregone Conclusion and his rapper sidekick Dom seem unnecessary as they are all basically portraying 'normal' people, not funny people. From the mid point the film increasingly tries to get all melodramatic and morose, but whereas The Office did that stuff amazingly (the scene where Brent pleads with Neil not to sack him might be one of the saddest and most moving scenes in TV history), here it seems a bit heavy handed and emotionally manipulative.As you'd expect there's a lot of music in this film. The band's songs are amusing enough but there's nothing here to rival 'Free Love Freeway'. I'm also guessing the Brentmeister General might be a big fan of Fountains Of Wayne, because one of the new songs sounds curiously similar to FoW's '92 Subaru', and later on there was a musical interlude which was the exact intro to their song 'Hey Julie'.Aside from its flaws, if you liked The Office and find David Brent funny in any way then there are easily enough laughs here to justify watching. Don't expect to be laughing all the way through though, and at times it does get a bit tedious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many Laugh out loud moments but with funnier songs and a better ending it would be a tiny bit better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Brent ,from The Office UK, returns and this time he's on tour with his band Forgone Conclusion.Not being the biggest fan of The Office UK or the trailers for this film I wasn't really sure what to expect from the return of Ricky Gervais' comic creation. But as always I went into the screening room with an open mind and to my surprise I actually found this film quite funny. The majority of the jokes in the film are very Hit Or Miss but luckily most of them are hit's and only a couple do seem to unfortunately miss with most of the audience. Seeing as this is a film based on a band tour there are obviously a number of songs throughout and one or two of them aren't very funny as they seem to be intended but there are some which are successful especially one about halfway through the film which does possibly go out to ,from the eyes of Gervais seeing how Brent would see things, unintentionally offend. But the majority of the possible offensiveness does seem to be done with a moderate amount of taste and not to anger or majorly offend people to the point of complaint and uproar, it does make the majority of people laugh and it's the way Brent is, unintentionally offensive and that's what makes him funny in this film. However, luckily not all jokes go along this line and there are also a number of safer/ less risky/ cleaner jokes that also muster up a lot of laughs. There are many points where the audience begins to laugh out loud because of the barrage of gags being thrown towards them from the cinema screen and this is one of the reasons that some people might want to go and see this film again. One of the downsides to the film is that it does seem to end to quickly the pacing throughout is good and well done but when it gets to the end of the film things seem to become rushed as if the writers want to make sure that the film definitely doesn't drag and yes this is something that the film does well but I think if it did have an extra five minutes it wouldn't affect it very much and would most likely neaten out the ending and give it a more comfortable, less cramped time frame. One more thing Gervais is able to do is ,like in his previous TV series Derek but not as strong, is the plot/ script has a certain amount of emotion that gives a different feel to the film but it doesn't get to the point where things begin to seem weird and feel awkward. Overall it's a successful funny and mildly emotional film.David Brent returns with lots of laugh out loud moments and a small amount of emotion in David Brent: Life On The Road. If the ending and some of the songs were better then the film would be that tiny bit better.*** &lt;-- Three Stars (Out Of Five)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun comedy film 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Brent: Life on the Road was a very entertaining movie, simply put both as a send of for this character (David Brent) and as a standalone comedy. what Ricky Gervais does with this character is what the best comedians do when playing a fictional character, playing themselves that is, or should I say playing a lesser manifestation of themselves, being able to convince you that they are playing a character and believing that character but still being able to successfully stick consistent to that comedians persona,letting the comedian play around via this character this is Ricky Gervais but it is also David Brent. This allows for a self aware self deprecating brand of humour for the comedian to chew on. Louis CK does something very similar in his show Louie. Furthermore Gervais fits back into this role perfectly arguably as the role that defines him,as its become a staple of his career since the office started back in 2001. I appreciated that the film did not devolve into fan service with throwaway cameos from the show or winking to the camera moments of 'hey remember the office' looking at you Terminator Genesys, it's a very focused 'character study' of David Brent and doesn't stray from that. Overall what surprised me the most about the film was how much heart it had, I expected a funny film which is what I got but the film was not as cynical as I might have expected. To elaborate what I mean the character of David Brent is a character you can initially feel sorry for but eventually is written as a character that grows on you and are even able to admire by the end. Gervais made this film with no sort of portentousness and simply intended to make a straightforwardly funny, tightly paced and entertaining package, which I think he achieved in a heartbeat 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good for a TV series spin-off movie but a definite step down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie spin-offs to beloved British sitcoms have been released frequently over the years and the results have, on the whole, been atrocious. The mistake that the writers make time and again is to make the movie version 'bigger' or, specifically, more 'cinematic'. To achieve this they transplant the TV characters into situations they are not normally situated in. Pretty ironic and misguided for a sitcom movie if you ask me! A recent example was Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa (2013) where the central character was removed from his mundane existence (which made the character hilarious) and transported him into a high-profile hostage situation (which didn't feel true and made him somewhat less hilarious). The Partridge movie is the closest equivalent to this David Brent film in that both characters, while having a lot of similarities, were also two of the finest comic creations to grace TV over the last twenty years. It has to be said that with the Brent movie we have that rare beast, a film whose plot-line actually feels true to the TV character. In it Brent has managed to get another film crew to follow him as he tries to break into the music business with his band Foregone Conclusion; in doing so he goes on a UK tour of the Slough area.It's good that creator and star Ricky Gervais has managed to concoct a plot-line for a movie spin-off that feels genuinely connected to the series 'The Office' in terms of content. I guess a problem inherent in this is that 'The Office' was easily one of the finest TV comedies ever made and the Brent character was played to perfection by Gervais. The film just can't help but pale in comparison. It's not bad, in fact it's a pretty good comedy, but when the bar has been set so high its deficiencies do stand out more. The story-line invites us to witness and hear Brent's song craft and this is surprisingly one of the highlights of the movie. Comedy songs are usually completely trite in that they always feel so forced, yet the songs here do sound like the kinds of things Brent could conceivably have written. They are just professional enough to be believable which is important; yet the lyrics are often hilarious ? his ode to life on the road has the moderately hard-living Brent putting his 'foot down to the floor, at 70 miles per hour but no more', his heartfelt celebration of the Native American describes them as 'soaring like an eagle, sitting like a pelican' and as for his good intentioned song about the handicapped, well, that has to be seen to be understood.The comedy otherwise is a bit hit and miss, there are a few funny Brent moments but unlike 'The Office' he is the only one with any funny lines here and he could maybe have done with some support. Most characters just tolerate him in a similar disdainful way. For this reason the ending does come across unrealistically schmaltzy. Gervais finished off both 'The Office' and 'Extras' on upbeat endings which partially worked so well because they were kind of unexpected given what had gone before but it seems to be a formula now and so here once again we watch a character squirm their way through the film only for things to end on a happy note. Only here if feels tacked on, after all even his band-mates required to be paid ?25 pounds an hour to even socialise with him a few days previously yet by the end think he is a good guy and the relentlessly humiliating tour experience was now considered to have been good fun; while there is a poorly executed final scene in his office where everything works out great, including the 'bad guy' getting a glass of water in the face. So the movie ends in quite a naff fashion if I am being totally honest. But, on the whole, there are actual laughs here which is more than you can say for most comedy films and Gervais is still pretty good as Brent. It's certainly a pretty good attempt at a TV movie spin-off even if it pales against the series that it evolved from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never liked The Office. There, I said it! So I'm more surprised than anyone that I quite enjoyed Life On The Road. Firstly, the acting is great. I was especially impressed with the straightforwardness and believability of all the key characters (particularly Brown and Basden). Gervais is the star though, and this is his film. Although Brent isn't really a likable character (hence everyone finding him irritating), Gervais does give you a way in - he always means well and tries his best, but always manages to screw it up somehow - a combination of good writing and acting.The story, even at 97 minutes, does sometimes feel baggy - the start is a little slow moving, and the end is kinda cheesy. The main issue for me though, was the comedy. I just don't find Gervais funny, and the film hinges on that. Like all the characters, when the 'funny' moments happened I just cringed - only a few times did I actually smile, which is really disappointing.The best thing is undoubtedly the music. Some of the songs (not lyrics) are brilliantly written, arranged and produced. Fantastic band too, but maybe too good; the more quality the music has, the less it fits with the awkward tone of the movie.For me, Gervais did a good job of characterising Brent - hard working and well meaning, but self-ruining and cringy. I just wish it made me laugh more.3/5</fullReview>
