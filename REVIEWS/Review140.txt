		<shortDescription>"Only when he learned he would die did he start to live!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru ("to live")is a Kurosawa film devoid of samurai or Toshiro Mifune. It is an oddity in his canon, neither an adaptation, nor an epic, or even a detective story. Instead, it is the simple and touching story of the last months of the life of a man, Watanabbe, public official, who decides to give a meaning to his life by transcending the obtuse and stiff mind of government bureaucracy to get a small public children's park built. As a parable for the soulless workings of modern bureaucracy, the goal is set pretty high, and Kurosawa goes even further, giving this story a lot of character, frequent humor, life and, most of all, heart. And going beyond the strengths of the direction and script, is the central performance by Takashi Shimura (later Kambei in Seven Samurai). Shimura gives his character such a transparently good heart and such great pain that every second of Watanabe's plight and struggle tugs at your heart, not in an overwhelmingly sentimental manner, but in one than feels honest and pure. If even many hardened souls will be drawn to tears, it is not for pity, but, admirably, because of envy for Watanabe's beautiful human dignity in the end, and for a film to have such power is beyond pure accomplishment, as the need to see this and, more importantly, feel it, goes beyond pure necessity...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most moving and human film I have ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can safely say that I have seen no finer film than Kurosawa's true masterpiece, Ikiru. The story of a dying petty bureaucrat in 1950's Japan, Ikiru is as uncompromisingly honest and beautiful a film as has ever been made on the subject of life. Kurosawa elevates a story that could have been simple melodrama to the level of masterwork with a genuine love of his characters, and with an incredible technical direction. The film's structure accentuates and deepens its many, many lessons on life, and the performances, including a heartbreakingly earnest turn by Shimura are all flawless.In short, Ikiru is easily one of the greatest works committed to film, and no discerning film aficionado should avoid experiencing it. Had Kurosawa directed only this film, it would still be enough to include him in the pantheon of the greatest storytellers who ever lived. Fortunately for us, it is simply the pinnacle of a staggeringly amazing career. It is the absolute definition of a 10/10 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Brilliant - Kurosawa's Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kanji Watanabi is a quiet, melancholy man who has spent all his life behind his office desk doing sweet eff-all. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he realizes that he has been petty much dead his whole life, and searches desperately for away to live again.This is Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, yes, even better than Rashomon and The Seven Samauri. It is a perfect true story of everybody's life- how we don't even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi's quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it's one of the greatest film performances of all time. Not everyone will love this movie. It was made a long time ago, the main character is an old fogey, it has subtitles, and it's pretty long. Many people today, especially young kids, would find it boring. Well, let 'em. There's no need to worry about them, they'll always have Pirates of the Carribbean, they'll always have The Matrix. Leave Ikiru and films like it to the true lovers of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Live in Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the most difficult aspects a film like "Ikiru" has to overcome is the very rough march of time. To actually find someone these days, let's say a crowd of regular movie-goers to sit down and watch a film about an old Japanese man dying of cancer would be too much to ask.Long held shots, hardly uplifting subject, to westerners very foreign. An array of reasons not to see it. And yet, once you actually start getting into the picture it doesn't let you go. Which is why it may be rightfully considered to be a classic.Of all of Kurosawas film this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on an universal level. Because at its core it is about one of the most basic desires of human existence...namely to be able to look back on your life and say "It was worth it."In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched. A glorious moment in 20th century cinema, that will hopefully be preserved for decades to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex and thought-provoking masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Our hero is Kanji Watanabe, the most unlikely 'hero' of all time. He works in a dreary city office, where nothing happens and it's all very meaningless. Watanabe is particularly boring, which has lead to him being nicknamed 'The Mummy' by a fellow worker. He later learns that he is dying from stomach cancer and that he only has six months to live. But Watanabe has been dead for thirty years, and now that he's learned that his life has a limit; it's time for Watanabe to escape his dreary life and finally start living. What follows is probably the most thoughtful analysis of life ever filmed.Ikiru marks a departure for Akira Kurosawa, a man better known for his samurai films, but it's a welcome departure in my opinion. Kurosawa constantly refers to Watanabe as 'our hero' throughout the film, and at first this struck me as rather odd because, as I've mentioned, he's probably the least likely hero that Kurosawa has ever directed; but that's just it! This man is not a superhero samurai, but rather an ordinary guy that decides he doesn't want to be useless anymore. That's why he's 'our hero'. Kurosawa makes us feel for the character every moment he's on screen - we're sorry that he's wasted his life, and we're sorry that his wasted life is about to be cruelly cut short. However, despite the bleak and miserable facade that this movie gives out, there is a distinct beauty about it that shines through. The beauty emits from the way that Watanabe tries to redeem his life; because we feel for him and are with him every step of the way, it's easy to see why Watanabe acts in the way he does. Ikiru is a psychologically beautiful film.It could be said that the fantastic first hour and a half is let down by a more politically based final third - and this is true. The movie needs it's final third in order to finish telling the story, but it really doesn't work as well as the earlier parts did. However, Kurosawa still delights us with some brilliant imagery and the shot of Watanabe on a swing is the most poetically brilliant thing that Kurosawa ever filmed. Together with the music and the rest of the film that you've seen so far; that picture that Kurosawa gives us is as moving as it is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a cinematic experience that's a near-nexus of existentialism- life, living, dying, death, and can be done while alive- remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa knew how to get in touch with human nature through his art. With his visual expressiveness and storytelling, he could pierce through his subjects, even in his big and occasionally comical samurai films, and find the elemental things do work. What he probably learned off of Rashomon probably helped out with Ikiru (To Live), a story of an old man who finds out he will die within a year, as both stories deal with perceptions of the significance of a life spent and a life wasted. Though that was to a different degree in Rashomon, with Ikiru Kurosawa expands into full-on existentialism. The old man Kanji Watanabe (in a wholly believable and often heart-breaking performance by Takashi Shimura) knows his life hasn't amounted to much as a (chief) clerk for the city. He knows he hasn't had a great kinship with his son. He's accepting his fate with a heavy soul. One of the tenets of existentialism is that there's free-will, and the responsibility to accept what is done with one's life. Kurosawa might've (as I speculate, I don't entirely know) caught onto this for his lead, and it works, especially with the little details.Such little details, unforgettable ones, have been expounded upon by other reviewers and critics, such as the drunken, sullen singing of "Life is short, fall in love my maiden" in the bar. A scene like that almost speaks for itself and yet it's also subtle. But one scene that had me was one not too many talk about. It's when Watanabe is in the Deputy Mayor's office, asking for permission so that a park can be built. At first the Mayor ignores him, but then Watanabe begs, but not in a way that manipulates the audience for sympathy with the old man. The mayor must be sensing something in his eyes, desperate and weak, however determined, and it's something that probably most of the audience can identify with as well, even if they don't entirely identify with the character.But aside from the emotional impact Ikiru can have on a viewer, composition-wise (with the help of Asakazu Nakai, wonderful cinematographer on less than a dozen Kurosawa films) and editing-wise the film is ahead of its time and another example of Kurosawa's intuitive eye. There are some to-tomy shots sometimes (which could be called typical via master Ozu or other), but everything appears so precise on a first viewing, so descriptive. I think I almost can't go into all of them without a repeat viewing, but there were two that are still fresh in me. The first was right as Watanabe was about to sing in the bar, and there were these bead-strings looming in front of the camera. Perhaps mysterious, but definitely evocative. The other was when Watanabe and one of the other clerks are on a bridge during a dark part of the day. Both characters are in silhouette, and Watanabe gives an indication to the character that he will die soon. But for me, I wasn't even paying a terrible amount of attention to the words. The way the two are lit as they are, with the light in the background and darkness in the foreground, it could maybe give an indication of what Kurosawa's trying to say: we're all not in the light of life, but it doesn't have to be an entire down-ward spiral if the will is good. Whether you're into philosophy (ies) or not, Ikiru won't disappoint newcomers to Kurosawa via his action pictures. A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film touched me in a way no other film has. Filmed in black and white and gorgeous, both in the visuals and in how the story unfolds. Behold the clever manner of gradually unfolding the story as people jog each other's memories at his funeral (an obligation for them, that gradually turns into a real eulogy). Everything is told in flashbacks: the mourners' memories unfold naturally, as people remember what the man did and struggle to comprehend why.This film I would nominate for the golden five of the century!I first saw it in 1956 or so at a small theater in downtown Chicago. A second viewing, years later, confirmed my initial pleasure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A quiet, but very moving film. Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a clerk who has been living a dull, unsatisfying life working in the government's offices who is diagnosed with cancer and is given one year to live. He tries to enjoy his days by picking up a former co-worker (Miki Odagiri) and taking her out on the town. She finally convinces him that this is not the way to spend the rest of his life. He soon realizes that he has a strong desire to do something with his life so that it will not have been a total waste. Therefore he begins to work in cooperation with the people... accomplishing something that nobody in the office had the nerve to do before.I consider Ikiru to be Kurosawa's first truly excellent film. The story moves along very low-key and we gradually realize the power and emotion that is in this great film. Roger Ebert said of Ikiru that it is one of the few films that can actually change the way you look at life after watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being one of the Founding Fathers of Cinema, Kurosawa shines to all directions. In his diverse oeuvre it is hard, if not impossible, to find a weak work.Ikiru is the most humane film of this grand Humanist. Kurosawa's story telling skills are sublime, and he has surpassed himself with this movie.The slow pace and ditto camera movements (except in the night with 'Mephistofeles' where all is logically much more frantic) enhances the story superbly. What a pity some of the nowadays public can't find the tranquility and maybe serenity to watch a gorgeous film like that.

		<fullReview>"Ikiru" is supposedly one of Steven Spielberg's favourite films, and one can see the influence it's had on him not only in the sentimentality and the ultimate "feelgood factor" (which may be a little too extreme for some viewers, although the script never condescends), but visually, especially in the virtuoso sequence in which a reprobate leads our hero, a respectable and dull civil servant, on a whirlwind tour of Tokyo's frenzied nightlife - a masterpiece of camera placement and editing. With images throughout that will stay with you for a long time, and a terrific supporting performance by Miki Odagiri as a vivacious young "office lady", "Ikiru" is still an absolute knockout more than 50 years on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming Alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Ikuru' (Japanese for 'To Live') was one of Kurosawa's personal favorites. Prominent film critics worldwide put it, along with "Seven Samurai" and "Rashomon", on their lists of the best films ever made by anyone. When first shown in the USA during the 1950's , all three quickly earned widespread critical acclaim and strong patronage. USA film enthusiasts by then had clearly grown weary of the tired formulas followed by Hollywood studios in the timid post-war years. They welcomed the more thoughtful and challenging films from Kurosawa and from other acclaimed film directors in Japan (Ozu and Misoguchi), Italy (Rosselini, De Sica), France (Troufault, Bresson), and England (Lean). All of these great film directors were also able to hold and move their audiences while developing somber themes. 'Ikuru', however, is even more deeply philosophical than any other film that I recall by asking what is needed for us 'to live' well.Takashi Shimura gives an absolutely convincing performance of a tired old man, numb and alone. After learning he has terminal cancer, he learns that dissipation offers no solution. Then he clings to a cute, vivacious girl, taking her to shops and restaurants. She wearies of his dreary, cringing manner but agrees to have one more dinner together. In the powerful climactic scene at the restaurant, he learns why she is happy in her new job packaging toys. 'I feel all the babies in Japan are my friends!!' This gives him an idea. He, too, can do something to help children. 'There's still time!!', he cries, and runs off while she stares in bewilderment. He keeps moving quickly towards his cheerful new life. Shimura reminded me of Albert Camus' essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus.' Sisyphus plods off to yet another day of struggle but has won over the gods, after all, because he is aware of his quest. 'We must imagine Sisyphus happy,' urges Camus. We must also feel the same for the old man in Ikuru when we see how he is reborn and truly alive for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The examined life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This great film by Kurosawa is probably less well known than his Samurai tales, but is none the worse for that. The film is both long and slow-paced, but the impact is incredible.We begin with 'our hero' (as Kurosawa calls him) Watanabe's stomach x-ray, and we are told that he has cancer. We then see Watanabe sitting at his desk in the Tokyo city civil service, slowly marking a great pile of papers with his little rubber stamp. He sits at the head of a group of people doing much the same thing, shuffling papers from one place to another, and we are told that he has been doing this for 30 years! We see a group of ladies complaining about stagnant water directed from one office to another as the bureaucratic machinery churns mechanically onwards.Against this background, Watanabe goes to the doctor with his stomach complaint. He meets a strange man who precisely describes Watanabe's symptoms, and tells him that the doctors will lie to him, as the disease is terminal. This comes true and Watanabe realises that he is to die soon. The stunning waste of his life then becomes apparent to him, and in a really powerful scene he falls asleep, crying below a commendation from the office for 25 years of service. He isn't worried by dying, rather he's worried by never having lived. He stops going to work, he buys expensive sake and goes to the bright lights, but this fails to make him happy. He then spends time with a young girl from the office, and it is on an evening out with her that he realises what he must do. This realisation is combined with a roomful of people singing 'Happy Birthday' for a friend...but it is clear that they are singing for Watanabe's rebirth. Watanabe goes back to the office and picks up the file concerning the stagnant water...he is determined to do something about it after 30 years of doing nothing!The next section of the film is the real key to its impact. We are at Watanabe's funeral, with a number of the technocrats from the City Council. My expectation was that they would all be complimenting the memory of Watanabe and his achievement in clearing the stagnant water and building a park in record time...but they aren't! I was frustrated...I wanted them to recognise that he knew he was ill, and fought the established order so as to achieve something with his life.As they drink more and more, they begin to reflect on what Watanabe had achieved. They become emotional, realising that he knew he was ill, and realising that with determination, the system can be used to achieve things. The final scene, however, is of one of the men present at the funeral subsiding below a pile of papers, unable to change anything.The bitter ending is tempered by the powerful feelings stimulated by Kurosawa during the funeral scene. I reached the end feeling that one man can make a difference if he is determined, and that this can only be achieved by reflecting on your life and achievements, and then making a conscious decision to do something!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own. Akira Kurosawa's "Ikiru" (To Live), 1952 is one of them. The film of rare humanity, profoundly moving and often funny "Ikiru" tells the story of a dying man's last crusade that turned out to be his triumph, the best thing he had ever done in his life; something he will be remembered for. The film reveals both absurdity of life and the ability of man to find meaning in it through selfless action.Two years before he played the tough lead in "Seven Samurai", Takashi Shimara gave even finer performance in a very different role as a government bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe who seemed to lead a life of quiet desperation at his job and at home. Then, he learns that he has terminal cancer and faced with the fact of death, he first tries to take from life as much as possible and spends the half of his savings on gambling, drinking and women. It leads him nowhere and gradually he determines to achieve one good thing before he dies, and settles on converting a junkyard into a playground for children. Rather than make a feel good movie with co-workers helping Kanji Watanabe in his quest and his family around him at his last moment, Kurosawa portrays him as a lonely crusader ? no one can understand why this park is so important to him. The answer is very simple ? he does not have time and he wants to live to see the park open. His family and co-workers don't even know how ill he is what makes some scenes even more powerful and poignant. His words, "I am not angry with anyone, I have no time for that"; the look at his face when asked by a mafia member if he did not care for his life - the film has many quiet but compelling moments like these.For me, watching "Ikiru" was as close to earth shattering experience as it goes. I think it is one of very few films that could really change one's life. I could not help comparing it to "Cries and Whispers" - how devastated I was by the theme of inevitable death, how ugly it is, and how helpless we all are while facing it. "Ikiru" is about a dying man, too but how hopeful and life affirming it is. The film did not tell or teach me something I had not known before but it confirmed once more that it is never too late to do something even if you have only few months to live.</fullReview>

The movie is told in two parts, one showing Watanabe final days and the other showing flashbacks between guests at his funeral. Kurosawa tells the story by showing a man who has never lived and finds out he doesn't have much time to live. Kanji says this phrase many times in the movie. " I cant die,I've never lived"-Kanji Watanabe. Ikiru is a true masterpiece of international cinema. The greatest scene and most climatic scene in Ikiru (little spoilers ahead)is when Watanabe is swinging on the swing in tha park he saved and sings "Life is Breif, Fall in Love Dear Maidens" in the snow. I give Ikiru a 10 out of 10 and will always be one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

While dying, he finds the meaning of life, and fights for the construction of a playground in a poor zone of the city and the legacy of his existence."Ikiru" is another beautiful movie of Master Akira Kurosawa. The story is very touching and shows the lifestyle of Japan in the 50's. The performance of Takashi Shimura is amazing and heartbreaking, in the role of a man that finds that he spent his life for nothing: his son, motive of his sacrifice, does not care for him and his unproductive job does nothing but useless paperwork and a pejorative nickname of "Mummy".

		<shortDescription>a movie I shall undoubtedly come to understand and cherish more and more as I grow older</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people consider "Ikiru" ("To Live") as the greatest movie that Japanese director Akira Kurosawa ever made. And remember, this is the same man who also directed acclaimed masterworks such as "Ran," "Kagemusha," "Seven Samurai," "Yojimbo," and "Rashomon." Many of Kurosawa's movies also touched on a human level amongst their scenes of gritty, visceral violence and the brilliance of "Ikiru" is that its emotional levels outscore all of those without one clip of actual, physical barbarism unless you count a death threat scene near the end of the picture.No swords are swung, no blood is sprayed in "Ikiru" because this is not a period piece like "Seven Samurai" or "Kagemusha." Set in modern-day Japan, a middle-aged bureaucrat discovers despite his doctor's attempts to hide the truth from him, that he has stomach cancer in that he will die in six months...or less. The bureaucrat, Kanji Watanabe, played by the great Takashi Shimura in what may be his finest performance, mourns over the lack of a real life that he has had so far. At work, one of his unenthusiastic employees calls him "the mummy" because he does live life to its fullest. He has spent his entire life stamping sheets of paper without bonding with his son or enjoying the time he has on earth. As the title would hit, Watanabe decides that he has "to live" before he inevitably dies, and leave something for him to be remembered by.The ways that Akira Kurosawa tugs on our heart strings is utterly brilliant. The level of sympathy that our souls generate for poor Watanabe is simply amazing as even the younger generations can identify with his fears. I don't think there's a person alive on this earth who is not at least subliminally afraid of the dreadful disease of cancer and the even greater fear of knowing that you only have a short time left to live. Like John Wayne's last film "The Shootist," we develop incredible amounts of sympathy and remorse for the protagonist and the tender moments are truly tear-jerking.Kurosawa's storytelling skills are displayed to their absolute fullest in the first two-thirds of "Ikiru" when Watanabe discovers he has cancer and then begins to encompass all opportunities that he has left to him. There's a wonderful subplot where he begins to bond with a younger woman who has an unbelievable passion for living. Now this sounds like a formula for a creepy, off-putting payoff, but it does not. Rather, this becomes one of the most enthralling elements of the picture.Now, I will admit it, "Ikiru" is not, to my mind, a perfect motion picture and therefore it is not on the same level (to me) as some of Kurosawa's other films. The reason why is because the last third of the picture, I'm terribly sorry to say, runs out of steam. It does not stretch out with the same passion and enthralling emotions that the previous two-thirds did. Perhaps it just did not flow through the way I had wanted it to.But then again, I am still rather young. Film critic Roger Ebert has stated that "Ikiru" was his choice for Kurosawa's best film and that every time he saw it, it became more powerful for him because as he grew older, he identified more and more with Kanji Watanabe. I shall undoubtedly come to cherish and adore "Ikiru" as I grow older. As it is now, in my youth, I see it as a wonderful movie that does a tremendous job up to a certain point where it only runs slow just by a smidgen. Everything before that is absolutely wonderful and absorbing. "Ikiru" is one of Kurosawa's most emotionally-strong pictures and one of the greatest to tackle the subjects of cancer and more importantly, life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking back at Akira Kurosawa's impressive fifty-year career in filmmaking, it's impossible to determine which film was his best. Fans of the late Japanese legend might cite The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress, while critics believe that it should be Rashomon or Ran.A growing band of Kurosawa worshippers has recently named Ikiru as his indisputable masterpiece. Unfortunately, I don't see myself joining the latter soon. Yes, Ikiru is Kurosawa's most deepest and reflective film, though in my opinion it's far from the masterpiece that it's touted to be. Ikiru is a film best described as 'a game of two halves'. The first hour is vintage Kurosawa. It starts out with an X-ray image of a stomach diagnosed with cancer, and then introduces the film's pitiful lead character Kanji (Takashi Shimura) to the viewers. Kanji is a government official who has been loyally serving his department for many decades.Upon receiving news that he's suffering from terminal cancer, he decides to take an extended break from work (which he has never done before) to reflect about his life. After some inner soul searching, Kanji realized that he has been missing out on life since he began working. He sets himself on a quest to live out his final months with a motto, "I cannot die until I'm satisfied with my life".Cancer has taught people that life cannot be taken for granted. Kanji is a character that we can all relate to, from his humble personality to his simple outlook on life. Kurosawa cajoled out a magnificent performance from Shimura, not only was Shimura able to make us feel sympathetic toward his character, but his character was also able to earn our admiration by the end of the picture.However, Kurosawa is no Yasujiro Ozu (Tokyo Story, Late Spring). Those familiar with the works of these two Japanese legends will know that Ikiru is the kind of story that Ozu would have relished. Kurosawa is simply not as capable in handling intense dramatic material as Ozu. This is perhaps the reason the second hour of the film fails to capture the greatness of the first. Kurosawa focused too much on the bureaucratic aspects and its faceless officials during the long funeral sequence than Kanji's final farewell gift to the community after an immense struggle involving politics and red tape.Ikiru's lackluster second half dilutes the film's emotional value. Kurosawa did not have an off day; it's just that he was too ambitious to have attempted such a complex urban drama, though his ambitions have often led him to more successes than failures in life.GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru is a beautiful film conceived by an incredible filmmaker at the peak of his talents.The film portrays a fatally ill Japanese bureaucrat, Kanji Watanabe (played by the brilliant Takashi Shimura), attempting to reinvigorate his life for the last few months that remain. The opening few scenes depict a group of empowered local women appealing to various bureaucratic departments to clean up a polluted residential playground in their neighbourhood. They are sent hither and thither to various departments to no avail until Watanabe decides to use his clout to see the park restored to its natural state.Several scenes stand out as memorable: In the early-going, Watanabe's son and young wife (or fiancée) come home only to see the ghastly figure of Watanabe staring blankly in the darkness of their room. The expression on his face conveys his emotional state so well.Later on, Watanabe is confronted by some threatening gangsters opposing his desire to clean up the park. One of them warns Watanabe that he is "risking his life." Watanabe could not be happier to hear this and smiles jubilantly at the gangster. The gangsters, up to this point very tough and menacing, are startled and confused at Watanabe's sheer disregard for his own life.Lastly (you should really just watch the movie) there is the scene of a drunken Watanabe tearfully singing a mournful song accompanied by a jazz pianist. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful scenes in all of Kurosawa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How shall we than live?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose it isn't truly a spoiler to say the main character, Watanabe, dies of cancer at the end of the film. For most directors, this probably would have been a overly sentimental death drama. Kurosawa is far to talented and sophisticated for such triteness. This is a rich, meaningful, touching story of a man's attempt to live. The themes of this film are so universal, we can access it even 50 years after its release. Several good films have been made along similar themes. "Wild Strawberries" is one of the best. I have not seen "Umberto D.", but I understand it is very similar. Bergman and Kirusawa are very similar filmmakers. Bergman seems to me to be more metaphorical and Kirusawa is more aesthetic. They are both superb writers/directors. "Ikiru" is a heavy layered film. After listening to the commentary on the Criterion Edition, you learn that this film makes many significant social comments on Japanese life. At the same time, as I said earlier, the emotions and themes of this film are ubiquitous. You don't have to possess a knowledge of 1950s Japanese politics to understand it. You simply have to be human and possess a desire to live a meaningful life. There are many images from the film that linger with you. Kirusawa, like Bergman and Hitchcock, was so good a composition. His films are so visually active that you can know everything you need to know without the dialogue. However, the dialogue is simple and very effective. The characters talk the way normal people talk, yet the say things normal people don't say. That to me is great dialogue. I was disappointed in the film stock from which the DVD came. It was not in good condition. That is a real shame. I am not sure why that is. Criterion does great work with the classics. They must not have been able to obtain anywhere near pristine stock. This is such a beautiful film. It would great to see it from the original negatives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incompetent Watanabe worked in a government organization. Although he was a manager, he could do nothing but affixed his seal on countless papers. He had been working like that for nearly 30 years. One day he learned that he got lung cancer and had half year to live. His peaceful life did not exist any more. How to deal with the rest days was an imminent task for pitiful Watanabe.Comparing with another similar movie My life without me, Ikiru was more uplifting and meaningful. Maybe what Watanabe did was too late. But in my eyes it is never too late to mend your way.Japanese master Akira Kurosawa brought us many excellent movies. For example Shichini no samurai, Rashomon, Ran etc. I think that Ikiru is his best work.An all time classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Ikiru during Japanese-my teacher would often have us watch movies to try and pick up on some of what was being said. I instantly fell in love with the film: it's symbolism and the way in which the subject matter was held. It really captures that government dead-end, run-around that see far to often when trying to get something very important done, while also dealing with the let-downs and triumphs that we sometimes see in our own lives. This movie was so wonderful that I borrowed it from my teacher to show all my friends, and even my parents (my dad needed to see in particular as he was a state worker vaguely resembling Wantanabe). I found this to be a very touching, very inspirational, yet also sad and cynical movie. I think that anyone who watches it would understand what I mean. I would definitely suggest everyone see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly well-written and acted story about the meaning of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main character, so ably played in this movie, is an older bureaucrat whose life has little, if any, significance. After 30 years on the job, he has little to show for himself. This becomes very apparent once he finds out that he is dying from stomach cancer and has only months to live.Now, so far, this does NOT sound like a movie most people would want to see. However, instead of dwelling on death and the meaningless of life, Kurasawa goes beyond that. Much of the movie actually focuses on this man trying to find meaning in his life and ultimately deciding to devote his final days to fighting for the creation of a park in some godforsaken part of Tokyo. Despite a general atmosphere of apathy, he ultimately succeeds in getting the park created.About 2/3 of the way through the picture, the man dies. I thought the movie was over, but then it cuts to a scene at his funeral. A group of bureaucrats and the deputy mayor attend, but few others. What happens next is important, as the movie becomes very philosophical and those in attendance begin to ponder his life and their own as well.In many ways, this movie is both uplifting and cynical. I won't say much more but encourage you to see it for itself. I will say, though, that unlike Bergman's films (which often have talked about death or mental illness), Ikiru is unusual in that it seeks meaning and goes beyond "life is meaningless and then you die".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern version of a timeless theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru is unafraid to set itself in contemporary Japan, with the modern threats of bureaucracy and sloth (as opposed to The Seven Samurai, which was guised in a historical setting). The characters are more recognizable and real to the viewer because of this, and Kurosawa exploits their personalities to the fullest. We have the novelist, who can comment on everything but practice nothing; the businessmen, who do their jobs; and the young and vibrant girl, who just lives, and doesn't even understand how Watanabe can envy her. This movie is one of a very few that leave a lasting impression behind, and push the viewer to further pursuits. What is motivation? Is it possible to meet Watanabe's standard, or your own, without the threat of death directly in front of you? Few other movies can express this theme so realistically.</fullReview>

I don't cry in many movies (not even Schindler's List), but this one made me weep like a little baby. Kurosawa brings human emotion to the forefront in Ikiru, making us all sympathize with Watanabe. The final scene in which he swings in his newly made sunset just hours before his death, amidst raindrops and singing "Life is Short" is in my opinion, the greatest scene ever filmed. Takashi Shimura gives the performance of a lifetime as Watanabe. The close-ups of his face are some of the most moving still images ever put onto the screen. I think that this is a movie that is so emotionally engaging and powerful that it could actually change a person's life.</fullReview>

It is a story about a man that has to face what most humans fear to even talk about the most: death. It is his journey to cherish the last days of his life that he felt he took for granted all these years. Ikiru is only one of two films that I have ever cried to. Kurasawa makes you feel for this man with the greatest empathy. He takes you into the movie and really makes you question what life is all about and the importance of it.

		<shortDescription>Ikiru: In death, one learns to live</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ikiru" is Akira Kurosawa's greatest film. Ikiru in Japanese means "to live." And the film tells the story of a man who, upon learning he is terminally ill, doesn't just realize he has lead a meaningless life ? but that he hasn't lived at all ? a story of a man who begins to live only after he learns he is dying.The first part of the film shows us Watanabe's "life" before, and after, he learns he has stomach cancer, and has only three months to live. He realizes he has never really lived. The film informs us that Watanabe thrashing his way through empty efforts to live, to find some meaning to his life. At the end of the film's first half, he finally sees something that opens his eyes to how he must spend his remaining days.The film then takes us to its second half ? which begins at a wake held in honor of the late Kanji Watanabe. The rest of the story, how Watanabe spent his remaining days, is told in the flashback recollections of Watanabe's former workmates. Ikiru opens with Watanabe, a widower, at work stamping papers in his dreary civil servant job at Tokyo City Hall. He hasn't missed a day of work in 30 years, and never takes vacations. He lives with his callous son, and his inheritance-obsessed daughter-in-law.The film begins with a group of women arriving at his department to complain about a cesspool in their neighborhood. They want it filled so the site won't be a health hazard; it should be filled in so the site can be a playground for their children. Watanabe dismissively tells them they must take their problem to the engineering department. Off they go, shuffled from department to department until they end up back at Watanabe's department, empty-handed. When Watanabe discovers he is terminally ill, he fails to show up for work. No one at the office sees him for days. He wanders the streets, until one night he is at a bar and begins to talk to a novelist about his fading life. The young man takes Watanabe on a tour of Tokyo's night spots. Maybe a little frivolity is the missing ingredient in Watanabe's life.At one of these places, Watanabe kills the festive atmosphere when the piano player asks for song requests. Watanabe mumbles that he wants to hear an old song, "Life is Brief."As the pianist plays the sedate, lovely, tune, Watanabe tearfully sings the song: Life is brief, Fall in love, maidens; Before the crimson bloom, Fades from your lips; Before the tides of passion, Cool within you; For those of you, Who knows no tomorrow.It is a beautiful scene, which will be revisited in a different, more memorable way near the end of the film.Night turns into morning, and Watanabe doesn't want to have another night on the town. He then encounters a young girl who used to work at his office, and they eat lunch.He begins to spend a lot of time with her, and is able to laugh with her hoping part of her liveliness will rub off on him. However, the girl tires of the dour old man, but agrees to meet him for one more dinner. Watanabe tells the girl he is dying and was hoping he could somehow discover from her how to live.During the dinner, she does something that gives Watanabe his breakthrough. He now knows what he must do. He goes back to his office, and digs out the proposal to fix the cesspool and build a park at the site. He immediately takes the proposal to another city department to shepherd the proposal to completion.Next, the movie takes us to the wake, where we learn the park was completed. The women who stormed city hall at the beginning of the film arrive to mourn for Watanabe. And they really mourn, while the opportunistic deputy mayor ? who tried to kill the park proposal, then later took credit for it ? silently watches. Tellingly, the women have nothing to say to the deputy mayor or the other city officials present. Kurosawa's camera focuses close-up on face after face, the embarrassed expression on the face of each city official reveals they know the truth they won't admit: It is Watanabe who deserves credit for building the park.Later, Watanabe's former co-workers debate his dogged dedication to building the park. The officials, by now drunk, recall his final successful struggle to create the park, but cynically misinterpret everything he did.The fact that they fail to grasp the simple kindness of Watanabe that redeems his otherwise wasted, unhappy life underscores something the funeral party does not comprehend: that Watanabe, not any of them, was the true victor and happy man. The last person to see Watanabe alive, a policeman on patrol, comes to the wake to honor Watanabe. Watanabe's body was found in the park the night before. But the policeman describes, what seemed to him, an eerie site.The film's last flashback shows us what he saw: Watanabe is at the park late at night, using the park's swing set while snow gently falls on him. While slowly swinging, he sings "Life is Brief." This scene is one of the most beautiful, memorable experiences in all of cinema. Try watching it without tears welling up in your eyes.Ikiru is a masterpiece -- It doesn't call attention to itself. It is only afterward that Ikiru's brilliance becomes plain ? the perfection of style and the dignity and sorrow of Shimura's acting.By Brian Cole</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Take My Word For It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to find the words to make someone ready to see something you love without revealing your own pomposity. To put it another way, you can damn with hyperbole just as surely as you can with faint praise. And I really don't want to do that to this movie, because it's amazingly well done, definitely worth seeing, and you'll be a better person if I don't turn you off before you scour the library and independent video outlets for it. So if, like me, you're the sort of counter-dependent brat who revels in ignoring advice that isn't your own, please rent the movie just to prove what an ass I am.For the rest of you who don't use your late fees to prove you cultural sophistication, I'd nonetheless recommend using extended rental policies to see this one a few times. Admittedly, I haven't seen this movie since my VHS days, so the DVD might include the usual goodies that I have no business commenting on. I'll poach off another commenter here and describe Ikiru as a movie about a life almost unlived, and how we find real reasons to overcome the inertial slide to death. Watanabe is the sort of bureaucrat that makes Kafka look like Schwartenegger, and his tentative walking coma at the movie's outset still resonates among those of us making our living in cubicle farms, whacking computer keys like lab rats for our paycheck-pellet rewards.The news that he's dying forces Watanabe into a painful contemplation of the life he's wasted, and the scenes that reveal his back-story are touching and human. When I saw Watanabe's anguish in his doctors' wait room, I was reminded of the pediatrician's office I visited as a child. And when Watanabe's young son humiliates him with embarrassed shame at the boy's baseball game, I felt the guilt a son feels when he doesn't honor his father. When Watanabe finally decides to act, we are moved by his humble desperation to feel alive.I'd agree with other commenters that the final third of the film is a bit stilted; considering the subject matter, however, we can hardly fault Kurosawa for being accurate. Furthermore, I'd rather not take any of the slow, subtle joy you'll get out of this movie by endlessly pontificating about it. Go see it, and if you're not the dork I am, tell others about it too.</fullReview>

You may recognize him from his role as the wise leader Kambei in Shichinin no Samurai, but this is his greatest achievement.

		<fullReview>This Kurosawa favorite veers awfully close to *Now, Voyager* territory; to "Beaches" territory; to *Love Story* territory. In the final analysis, a director -- even the greatest one who ever lived -- is never so manipulative as when he chooses a cancer victim for the subject of his film. We all know someone who has, or has had, cancer, and we all know just how horrible it can be for those it strikes. Therefore, Kurosawa has already plunged the knife in our hearts from the first frame, which shows us an X-ray of our protagonist's cancerous stomach. All Kurosawa has to do from here on out is twist the handle.Thankfully, the director listened to the wise counsel of co-writer Hideo Oguni, who insisted on having the main character die -- unseen -- a little more than half-way through the film . . . thereby setting up what is perhaps the greatest 45 minutes in all of cinema: Watanabe's Wake, With Flashbacks. To tell the truth, this "second part" of *Ikiru* stands completely on its own merits, and would by any reckoning rank as the greatest "short" feature film ever made. Which is not to say that there wasn't any great stuff in the preceding hour and fifteen minutes. Believe me, there's great stuff. However, there's also a lot of maudlin stuff. Put it this way: one thoroughly sympathizes with a young woman who exclaims to Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), "There's that long face again!" Kurosawa frankly overdoes the closeups of actor Shimura's face, which is half hangdog, half agonized. It's also half comical, after a while. And while I can dig the verisimilitude of Watanabe's incoherent mutterings and unfinished phrases (he always says, "What I mean to say is . . ." but he never finishes the sentence), that doesn't mean that the whole thing isn't slightly irritating. The film finally threatens to become downright bad when Kurosawa zooms in on Shimura as he sings a sappy old Japanese love song from the turn of the century: the hushed voice trembles, the tears spill.&lt;SPOILERS THROUGH THE REST OF THE REVIEW&gt; Yes, enough is enough . . . but perhaps we required this nadir of maudlin despair for us (and Watanabe, for that matter) to bounce back and re-engage us. Kurosawa masterfully raises the stakes with each set-piece that follows, until the last time we see him alive he's back at his civil service job, heading off to survey a site for a recreational park. "You can do anything, if you put your minds to it!" he declares to his dubious subordinates. And then, CUT!He's dead, and we're at his wake. Kurosawa, who loved American-style detective fiction, proceeds to give us a mystery, of sorts: was Watanabe REALLY responsible for the city's beloved new park? and if so, how did he manage it? AND did he know about his stomach cancer, or was it unexpected? what accounted for his odd yet heroic behavior during the last months of his life? The rest of the narrative is related via flashback by Watanabe's various co-workers and subordinates. Of course, the "proper" thing for a critic to say is that we should NEVER be in doubt early on, as to whether or not Watanabe made the park possible. But the first time I saw this, I had been put off by the sentimentality just enough to where I questioned the whole thing, and had thought how funny it would've been if this little bureaucrat had been forced to rely on his dreadful "colleagues" to finally accomplish something worthwhile in his life. The fact is, I can't tolerate saints. (Oh well, I guess I'm not a very nice person.) But the wonder of this sequence comes from the exceedingly witty manner in which Watanabe's feats are told and retold during the increasingly drunken wake. The little old man, at least in the memory of his fellow bureaucrats, disproves the adage that you Can't Fight City Hall. The crescendo of the wake sequence, followed by the sober-light-of-morning denouement, are together ruefully true-to-life.A final observation: I don't think *Ikiru* is as "existential" as some critics have made it out to be. Watanabe in the end makes a tangible difference in the world he leaves behind. That park EXISTS in the Real World. Kurosawa was a HUMANIST, not an existentialist. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watanabe realizes how inessential most of his life has been. "the mummy" has been dead for many years when he finds out about his body's illness. The coming of death awakens him to life. All previous considerations of remaining stable and safe are shattered (the man having slept for 30 years awakens to the emptiness of his life). What happens here is the neglect of the Delphi oracle "know thyself"; the approach of death forces Watanabe to examine his life, and this reveals the horrifying void. Many men postpone Socrate's question "What is a good life" until some shock awakens them to the decades lost to thoughtlessness (perhaps many only awaken to quickly fall back asleep, like a slave awakened from wonderful dreams who demands to return to them). Watanabe's courage, as noted by the drinking novelist, is his serious consideration of his life (stand and fight) rather than going back to sleep or suicide (run like hell).Watanabe's courting of the working girl is a determination to find something in life, and at their last meeting she gives him the necessary clue. How can you be so happy? She answers that she makes bunnies and thinks many children are happy thanks to her. She lives with some meaning, however trite. Watanabe returns to work determined to do something meaningful. He is happy as soon as he gets the idea and until he dies, working honestly to help create something beautiful.The song sung by him, in the first instant(when drunk) seems to suggest a passionate hedonistic life - given the atmospher this interpretation fits; however the second singing (his last words) is Watanabe swinging on a swing in the park he helped build. In the first he is melancholy and weeping, in the second he is joyous. The words can be paraphrased "life is short. fall in love maiden. don't let the passion in your heart die". Watanabe's message is not to indulge in drunken forgetfulness but to find something worthwhile to love, and use one's passion to create something good. It is an appeal to not fall into self-forgeting, but awaken to the urgency of life and the need to love beauty and create it.Watanabe says, "I don't have time to be angry". The urgency he feels makes this clear - there is only time to love and admire. In light of his purpose, anger is pettiness.while admiring the sky "This is beautiful. For 30 years I have not noticed".The movie also comments on the apathy of people in bearocracy. He reveals that one man can do great things and that apathy is evil that destroys society.Kirasowa asks us to examine out lives, to awaken and look about. Beauty is going unadmired, and men capable of creating beauty are passing the bucket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru (To Live) gets my vote for movie of the century. If you can tolerate an older, slow-paced B&amp;W film with subtitles, give it a try. It's set in urban Japan, around 1950, so it's less "foreign" than some other Japanese films made around that time. I've seen it in several video rental stores over the years, both dubbed and subtitled.In order not to spoil the plot, let's just say that as a result of a series of events, a bureaucrat approaching retirement age realizes that his life to date hasn't amounted to much, and, given an opportunity to reflect, tries to do something about it. Then, just as you find yourself thinking "Gee, that sure was a short, sweet movie!" there is the bonus of a long and fascinating denouement. As movies go, it's a two-fer.Now I'm firmly in the camp of "keep your expectations under control and you'll have a better chance of enjoying the film." But, much as I believe that another Kurosawa film, Rashomon, illustrates human truth (one truth per person), I think Ikiru illustrates, in a wonderful story with no preaching, the meaning of human life: it's what we put into it.</fullReview>

Takashi Shimura, playing the dying bureaucrat, Watanabe gives one of the finest performances ever. In this feature, he looked so weak and fragile. But in SEVEN SAMURAI (as the head samurai Kamebi), he is strong and able. Some might think it was two different actors!The man is dying of cancer for goodness sake. Not everyone handles the situation the same. Watanabe is just another soul trying to cope with the despair, and for me this was powerful stuff. (I should give kudos to Kurosawa. The man was able to do more than just epic samurai movies).Hollywood tearjerkers don't compare with IKIRU. And eventhough this is a 50 year-old black and white foreign movie with subtitles, it shouldn't be an excuse not to watch this. Expand your horizons. You may be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1952 film by Akira Kurosawa, about a civil servant learning he has terminal stomach cancer, and trying to do something socially meaningful in the last months of his life to redeem his boring and uneventful life, has become a bit overrated. Some people has even called this film a masterpiece. The material is certainly moving, but the movie is stilted and static, the performance of the main actor is of one note, and the dialogue explains often what is obvious to the viewer. Realistic movies were not Kurosawa's forte. One cannot help but notice that at about the same time Ikiru came out such directors as Ozu and Naruse were making much stronger, fluid and unmawkish movies dealing with the everyday life in postwar Japan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its a movie which makes u feel that simplest emotions can be so beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is my favorite movie of all time. there are so many movies and television series that have made me excited and happy over the years but there are few which can so repeatedly make you feel the happiness as does this movie. I being a doctor in a country like India where people are generally so simple also helps me realize how does this movies protagonist feels as the events turn up. Few of my friends say all he did was a simple job in the end, but they are actually missing the whole point of it. Its just that all of us are bounded so much by our limitations in daily life that only whenever we just try our level best to do whatever our heart says, are we actually fulfilling our purpose, no matter the size or impact of that thing or emotion. Please watch this movie with your parents and family once to even enhance this beautiful journey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Post-War Tokyo, when the bureaucratic chief of department of the City Hall Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) finds that he has a terminal cancer, he decides to intensively live his last months of life. While dying, he finds the meaning of life, and fights for the construction of a playground in a poor zone of the city and the legacy of his existence.Ikiru means 'to live' and it is an undeniable masterpiece. With a story like that it would no doubt go the top-down preachy approach, but Kurosawa never treads the well-worn path and he has achieved something simply extraordinary here. There are a few scenes which are simply amazing and I will mention just one.Watanabe is still at a loss with what he wants to do with the rest of his days. While baring his soul to his spunky ex-co-worker, he found his direction in his infinitesimal life. It is not what he realized that is incredible, it is the setting of that scene. It is at a restaurant with a staircase leading up to the seated area. In the background we see a group of office-type excitedly anticipating something. In the foreground we see Watanabe and the woman. The two different parties in the foreground and background are in the perfect juxtaposition. When Watanabe finally knows what he wants needs to do he walks with twinkling steps down the long stairs with a smile plastered on his face, and the group of office workers started launching into a birthday song for a person walking up the stairs. If that's not one of the most sublime scenes in cinema I don't know what it is. You see, the happy birthday song is for Watanabe's rebirth. Kurosawa is saying that it is not the number of days in your life that is important but what you do with your lot, however short it is, that is most important. My tears rolled...Kurosawa is a master storyteller. It would be so easy to go the heart-rending route after that sublime scene but Kurosawa pulls everything including the throttle back to show Watanabe's funeral a few months later. It suddenly felt like a missed opportunity, a wasted move. It felt like a full-stop! But this final hour is a tour de force of sublime power as it becomes a critique of typical top-down human behavior and we also get an in-depth look into Watanabe's end days through the third person. Think a variation of Rashomon as we see flashbacks of Watanabe's efforts to do something not for himself but for a bunch poor folks. The narration by various people at the wake culminates to a haunting picture of Watanabe that I know I will never be able to forget forever, likewise with the life lesson learned.Watanabe has left an indelible mark in a bare landscape and left a legacy behind, but the thing you have to remember steadfastly is that is never his intention. His intention is simple - he wants to cut through all the bureaucracy to build a playground for the common folk. For some people that is ludicrous and small, but for me life is about committing your best effort to performing a task that you deem meaningful. Taking religion aside, life is ultimately meaningless when everything is said and done. What everyone thinks about Watanabe is utterly beside the point. The lesson learnt here is that one's life is about bringing your best to anything you know is the right thing to do, like for me at this point, it is penning down my thoughts and feelings in this small little review. Masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dying man learns to appreciate life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru is directed by Akira Kurosawa, is written by Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni and Shinobu Hasimoto, has music by Fumio Hayasaka and cinematography by Asakazu Nakai. The film stars Takashi Shimura and Miki Odagiri.Kanji Watanabe(Takashi Shimura)is a weary office worker who has been suffering from stomach problems for a while. He goes for tests and scans and is called back to get the results. While he is in the waiting room a fellow patient is talking about different illnesses and unknowingly gives him the results as he describes the symptoms of stomach cancer, Watanabe recognises what he is describing as what he is suffering from. In this scene Shimura's face tells us all we need to know, he is terrified and the realisation of what he is suffering from hits him.He realises that for so long he has let life pass him by and he sets out to try and understand life and enjoy it. He befriends Toyo Odagiri(Miki Odagiri)an outgoing young woman from his office, she is so full of life and he thinks that enjoying life is something he can learn from her, when in reality learning to appreciate life just happens to you. Enjoying life doesn't just mean going to parties and having a good time, it can be marvelling at a sunrise or sunset or sitting quietly and enjoying what's going on around you. The scene where he tells her he is dying is so powerful, she looks at him like he is somehow going to suck the life from her and becomes afraid of him, he is so pitiful in that scene because he hasn't been able to tell his family of his fate but he has reached the point where he can no longer keep this knowledge to himself any longer, he has to tell someone.Ultimately he realises he can use his job to be helpful to some local people and build a park for them. Takashi Shimura gives possibly his greatest performance in this, his face is a kaleidoscope of emotion and lets us see how scared this man is, his face really lets us see into this mans mind and soul more than any dialogue ever could. He knows his life so far has been wasteful but there is still time to do some good. The famous scene where he sits on a swing in the snow is so beautiful and we see from his face that he is at peace with his situation, he's enjoying life in a quiet personal moment. This is a powerful, moving and uplifting film from one of Japan's greatest directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving, heart warming tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't mean to sound cold or insensitive when i say that Watanabe's death isn't the problem. He is going to die, it was told to the viewers back at the beginning through a remarkable use of narration (Pay attention, Hollywood). The sad part is that he didn't really live all the years his heart beat. I, also, don't think this movie is meant for everyone. It's pretty old (Almost 65 years) and has subtitles. The character isn't that connectible if you weren't in his position a long time ago and the plot develops pretty slowly. But, actually, none of these are flaws. They make the movie as good as it is. They make "Ikiru" the masterpiece it truly is. Back at the beginning, when we first meet Watanabe-san in his daily work routine, we may feel sorry for him (if you've been at his place) or even something that remembers pity. Because, and this is a sign of how brilliant Kurosawa was as a director, with a single take we can understand most of the character. Shimura acts brilliantly, as usual, as a every-day-man who has nothing really special. I don't think i've seen character development as amazing as this one in any other movie, not even a Kurosawa one. The way the character grows around it's own core and, in a amazingly shot and directed scene, has it's peak. He, after all, did live. And, of course, life is brief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far, Ikiru has been a favourite among Kurosawa's movies for me. While Takashi Shimura is featured in most of his movies, Ikiru witnesses one of his best performances. Unlike Kurosawa's many other movies, this one lacks of violence and battle save for the protagonist's battle against a deadly stomach cancer, threatening to perish him and his monotonous life to oblivion.Bureaucracy, a choking network with unbiased existence in most countries in our world, can break the best of the stubborn. Wanatabe(our protagonist), a natural victim realises his folly after painfully boring 30 years of his life. This movie aimed neither for a happy ending nor for a revolution but just the daunting reality.And undoubtedly the soundtrack 'Gondola No Uta' deserves a special mention. It is a most wonderful music, apt for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru (To Live) is partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's novella The Death of Ivan Illyich. It's a simple story of Kanji Watanabe an aging bureaucrat who one day discovers he has a stomach cancer and less than a year to live. He dedicates his remaining time to overcome the bureaucratic issues and turn an infested cesspool into a children's playground.Ikiru is divided in two parts; the first serving as a captivating introduction to all characters presented in a moderate pace, and the 2nd part which seemed to complement the 1st part, and is notable for its slow pace and limited character use. Personally, I prefer the first half (it also has a way better soundtrack). And I love those hopping bunny toys. The characters in the film are well-aware of the flawed system they live in, but do absolutely nothing to change it. After Watanabe's death, they drunkenly vow to act like him, but in the end nothing changes and they end up hidden behind mountains of paper. The scene where Watanabe is confronted by a threatening gangster, who leaves him alone immediately after seeing his "do what you want with me, I have nothing to lose anymore" face, is one of the best ones. The swing scene is also unforgettable. The snowy background accompanying it is a running Kurosawa theme of creatively utilizing weather elements. In his films, snow was always a synonym for inner peace and serenity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, unsentimental masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based loosely on Tolstoy's "Death of Ivan Ilych", this is a tale of the tragedy and redemption of a man whom few directors would dare featuring: a faceless, lifeless bureaucrat. Takashi Shimura plays said bureaucrat with stolid grace, never overplaying the physical and psychic pain that defines him for the first third of the film. He is estranged from his family, his employers, his life, until an improbable encounter with a lively, lovely former coworker and a pet rabbit. At last he sees how his life, so close to its end, can mean something.I highly recommend the 2-disc Criterion set, which includes two documentaries on Kurosawa's life and work, and a commentary track by Kurosawa scholar Stephen Prince, who's done similar work for Criterion's releases of "Throne of Blood", "Seven Samarai", "Ran" and several others. My lone complaint is with the transfer; typically a strength of Criterion's classic discs. While most scenes are clear, bright and unblemished, others have long stretches of vertical scratches and faded black tones. Knowing the attention to detail that other, even older, films have enjoyed, it's a bit jarring to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ikiru (To Live)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru is poignant and directly profound through contemplating life's meaning in Watanabe's dealings with mortality. Watanabe is an old-aged bureaucrat whose life was obsessed with work until discovering he has terminal cancer. Whereas Ikiru takes its time in reaching Watanabe's revelation of his terminal cancer, audiences are told at the beginning. Audiences being aware of this made Watanabe's mundane office environment extremely bleak. Firstly Watanabe and his colleges are unresponsive at a joke by a younger, immature employee and a montage of citizens being moved around from department to department regarding their queries. Ikiru firmly establishes Watanabe's routine occupation as somber which is emphasised in Watanabe's acknowledgement of his terminal cancer, that he had wasted his adult life.Ikiru's theme of morality became significance in Watanabe's reactions to his impending death. He rejects his bureaucrat duties and becomes engaged with his human desires. Wantanabe disappears for days at a time drinking and reminiscing about his past as one memorable scene showed him singing an old love ballad to the stunned silence of those around him, reflecting Wantanabe's realisation towards death. Watanabe also becomes infatuated with Toyo, a younger employee through her quirkiness giving him revived senses of youthfulness. Yet this soon flames out only emphasises Watanabe's loss of time. These scenes in Ikiru relate to Watanabe's notion of "a protest of my life up to now" provoking internal questions of morality and one's use in life.From protesting his life to giving it meaning, Watanabe becomes the catalyst for long-standing plan for a children's park which had previously been ignored by his department. Watanabe's determined vest to complete the park before his death continued to emphasis Ikiru's profound message regarding life. Once Watanabe has passed on and his achievements are recognised, his former co-workers say "compared to Watanabe we're just trash", consolidating Ikiru's profoundness for life. It is this message which audiences should take away from Ikiru.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is not visually stunning like other Kurosawa's efforts(though still very good in that aspect),but I think the way it was edited and how it told well the story is what matters the most about this film and it's structure is what makes it a masterpiece.The film can be divided in two parts: The first one, is about the Watanabe's story, told through his point of view. The second one, is all about a bunch of guys(Watanabe's job mates) getting drunk and discussing about Watanabe's life.Is a heart breaking and sad story in the end, depending of the point of view you adopt. It is a happy ending if we adopt Watanabe's point of view, but is rather depressing if we adopt the point of view of the guy in the second part, who wants to change his life(inspired by Watanabe) but he can't, due to his lack of courage. Is a film full of meaningful themes and is really a class of filmmaking. A masterpiece indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For There Will Be No Tomorrow ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kanji Watanabe is a widowed government section head near retirement who is informed he has stomach cancer and not long to live. After a period of high-life and introspection he resolves he must do something meaningful with the precious time remaining to him.The premise of Ikiru (which translates in English as "to live") is an old and clichéd idea; the plot is nominally derived from Leo Tolstoy's The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, but probably a thousand other stories. What distinguishes it, and what makes it still as relevant as ever, is the depiction of Watanabe as someone drab and ordinary, with whom we can all relate. When he is faced with the horror of his own mortality he looks back over his work, his family, his contribution to society, and he can find nothing he has done which made any difference. He has slept through life, keeping his head down, following whatever path was the simplest and easiest, either afraid of or indifferent to the possibilities around him. Kurosawa's amazing gift is to present the story of a man painfully similar to ourselves, living in an all-too familiar world where almost everybody is either bland or corrupt, and yet somehow still produce a gripping, profound and intensely moving drama. Shimura is remarkable in the lead, his body bent by the weight of his predicament, his eyes shining with fear and regret as he searches for truth and clarity in an unfeeling world. His outcast status is beautifully encapsulated in the scene where he sings an old song, Gondola No Uta, and those around him move back in fear, lest they somehow catch his affliction. Kurosawa isn't telling us to pity this man - he's saying we are all this man, and everything we do, in our lives, in our work, in our relations with others, affects us and everyone around us. We must all face our own mortality at some point, and consider what account of our deeds we can give. The supreme irony is the lengthy wake sequence, in which Watanabe's colleagues initially downplay his role in the building of the playground, then gradually confess their admiration, then pledge that they will follow his example - only to carry on in the same thoughtless way, doomed to repeat his mistakes. The movie is full of wonderful shots (the shell-shocked Watanabe hearing no sounds on the busy street, the incongruous toy bunny between him and Toyo at the restaurant, the water reflected on his face when he is revived on the building site, many others) which subtly emphasise his plight, as does Fumio Hayasaka's mournful score. Written by the great team of Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni and Kurosawa, who (along with another frequent collaborator, Ryuzo Kikushima) wrote fifteen films together, nearly all classics of Japanese cinema. Ikiru is a picture of great humanity; without simplification or sentimentality it tells a story of hope in a world where the greatest enemies are conformity and inaction. Kurosawa shows us that everyone can make a difference - the choice is up to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant, heartfelt, slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic-length movie sure to test the patience of most viewers weaned on modern, short-attention-span fare, IKIRU is a very different change of pace for Akira Kurosawa in comparison to his period samurai action films. It's a slow, poignant and utterly heartfelt tale about a bureaucrat who discovers he has terminal cancer. The film takes that as a starting point and we the viewer proceed to watch as he undergoes a journey of discovery.The story takes inspiration from the likes of Goethe's FAUST in places, but elsewhere it's all it's own. It is admittedly very slow in places - an entire hour seems to consist entirely of men sitting in a room while they drink and argue - but at the same time it's oddly watchable. It helps that Kurosawa is a master of his form, and that he elicits a painfully human performance from his long-time regular star, Takashi Shimura.Come the end, I was most reminded of Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, the classic starring James Stewart. However, IKIRU is the more realistic of the two films, stripping back the fantasy and the sentiment to reveal a starker truth entirely, but one equally as profound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru is an emotionally sincere wonder of international cinema. This is one of Kurosawa's best films - though that may not sound like a lot considering that almost his entire filmography is beyond perfect. Nonetheless, this is my favourite Kurosawa film based on the story.The film's protagonist - played by Takashi Shimura, in what may be his greatest acting contribution to the world of film - discovers that he only has a few months left to live due to terminal cancer and starts to actually live and not just pass time. Kurosawa takes the audience on an honest journey of a man's last moments on earth. What the character does and feels is quite understandable. He is miserable, afraid of dying, and trying to the find the last shards of solace and peace before moving on.The film's cinematography and editing are also aspects of the film to marvel about. What a brilliant piece of film-making this movie was. It's a hard movie to forget about. I highly recommend viewing it; if not for the mere fact that Kurosawa directed it, then at least for the artistic genius behind the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Way Way different than any Kurosawa movie I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the Kurosawa movies I have seen yet were either samurai based or mythological. Ikiru is way way way different than all those movies. To begin with, this is the most philosophical Kurosawa movie I have seen explaining life and death. The movie is about an aged bureaucrat who has not taken official leave for 30 years, lives his life almost like a robot or a mummy - lifeless. His life takes a massive turn when he comes to know that he has about 6 months to live because of a terminal stomach cancer. The things he does in the remaining part of his short life constitutes the movie. The movie is not only about living your life, it also states that one does not need to party 24/7 or go travel the world for the remaining life-span to enjoy it, if one does the work given to him in the most honest way and enjoys it, it leads to a fulfilled life. The movie also talks about the petty politics that takes place in the low-level bureaucracy in any government system.Takashi Shimura has been in all the Kurosawa movies I have seen. The difference though was those movies also featured Toshiro Mifune who always hijacked the movie and fairly so. This movie was meant for an aging actor who you would not even consider if he stands next to you. Takashi Shimura fits the bill perfectly. He has done a splendid job. Sometimes though, I wanted to shout and say, 'Why are you silent, slap your son and tell him your illness'. His portrayal of helplessness forces one to do so. Bollywood classic movie Anand can be said to have inspired from Ikiru. Enough Said.Rating : 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's greatest achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As difficult as some Japanese films can be, Akira Kurosawa was always welcomed by Western audiences due to the director's embracing of the cinematic, as opposed to, say, the static, conversation-heavy work of Yasujiro Ozu. Still known primarily for his samurai action films and his film noir homages, Kurosawa's movies were action-packed and grandiose, shot beautifully through a lens that brings to mind the great American westerns or the shadowy mise-en-scene of Orson Welles, making them almost Western in tone. Ikiru, one of Kurosawa's most spiritual and tonally dark films, took a few years to make it across Pacific Ocean, and it's not hard to see why. Although, in my opinion, this is probably Kurosawa's greatest achievement, the subject matter is sobering, it's satire alarming and it's story-telling techniques unconventional.The film opens with an X-ray of our protagonist, Watanabe (Takashi Shimura). The narrator tells us he has stomach cancer, but he does not yet know this, and so we join him, reluctantly, as he goes about stamping his papers in his stagnating job as a bureaucrat. Quiet and eternally hunched, Watanabe is an introverted man, spending little of what he earns to the frustration of his selfish son. When he learns that he has only about a year to live, Watanabe goes through the familiar stages of acceptance as he drinks, parties, fails to turn up for work, becomes involved with a much younger woman and angers his family. But he soon turns his attention to building a children's playground, a project he has seen passed around by the many pencil-pushers in the various departments within the council he works for, which has frustrated the residents of the decaying area.It's with this shift of focus that comes the true masterstroke of Ikiru. Up to this point, we have been with Watanabe every step of the way, but suddenly, as the narrator informs us, he's dead. We no longer get the first-person perspective, but the third-person perspective, as various colleagues and political players gather for Watanabe's funeral. The film becomes less a human drama, and more of a social-political statement, as the other dead-eyed civil servant's in his office slowly come to realise the greatness of the man. The deputy mayor is there, claiming Watanabe's work was within the confines of his job and proving the bureaucratic machine works. This, of course, is simple electioneering, but the others reminisce and the truth begins to slowly reveal itself in the final months of Watanabe's life.A lot of the film relies on the performance of Shimura, a long-time collaborator with Kurosawa. He is utterly magnetic here, remaining a hushed presence and developing his persona into a weapon to ensure his work gets done before he bites the bullet. In a heart-breaking moment, he croaks a quiet song in a packed bar for it to fall silent. The young hipsters slowly move away, while Watanabe's companion, a booze-addled writer, looks emotional. Kurosawa, only 40 at the time, was also making a comment on the post-war social outcasting of the elderly, embodied in the aforementioned bar scene and in Watanabe's success and money-drive son. Ikiru is many things, but it's the humanity of the story that will linger on in your mind after the credits have rolled, and it ends with one of the finest closing shots in history.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic and a masterful work of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's little that I need to say about Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest film-makers to have walked the earth. This is perhaps his simplest and most stirring movie. A simple setting, a very straightforward story line and very real characters. There was nothing extraordinary about this movie, except the journey that it will take you on.For a little over two hours, you become a bureaucrat in the pre- reformation Japanese society. You start off as a corrupt officer of the government and you then go on to experience apathy, sorrow, grief, revival, struggle, disappointment and then finally inner peace.The movie is not just about Japanese society. It is not a commentary on the state of affairs at that time. It is a brilliant take on the human condition itself. A telling tale of transformation, by whatever means, of a human being into a humane being. Yet, it is bitter-sweet in the sense that even such a metamorphosis doesn't really change things too much. People see the man and his transformation, they hear his story. Some of them even weep for him and grieve, but in the end, they all move on. C'est la vie!A must watch for all movie aficionados and a movie worthy of being cherished. A classic and a masterful work of art. I assure you that when Watanabe sits on the swing and sings his final song, you will feel that lump in your throat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. FAIR WARNING!First, I want to get the negative out of the way and in so doing, point out that this film was finished and released in 1952. Perhaps melodrama of this type was the norm, but I came away feeling that this man's immanent death and his reaction to that inevitability was a bit overplayed. There, that is out of the way.I love the way Akira Kurosawa put this together. The film opens on the dull and crushingly boring life of Kanji Watanabe. He is a bureaucrat in the office of public affairs. For thirty years his primary responsibility has been to shift what ever comes to his office to some other department. In short he does nothing. He is a "rubber-stamp" official.Early in the film Watanabe realizes he has terminal cancer. Worse he is not told the truth by his doctor, but finds out from another patient. It is clear he is going to die; and he realizes that he has lived too regimented a life. He has done nothing useful and this, not his impending death, is what really bothers him. The fact that he has managed, for three decades, to waste not only his own time, but the time of others.Fortune is kind to him though. In his despair, he first encounters a novelist who has a penchant for words. This writer, played by Y?nosuke Itô, perfectly expresses what Kanji is going through and applauds his every effort to rectify his wasted life, but it not enough for Kanji.The next day he runs into the youngest coworker in his office. He soon realizes that she has a childlike joy of life and he begins to experience envy and a longing to see life as she does. He eventually frightens her by wanting to spend so much time with her. This is perhaps the best casting done for the entire film, Miki Odagiri as Toyo, delivers such boundless joy and enthusiasm you forget that she's acting.Eventually Kanji finds a purpose for his life and the first three fourths of the film closes on his death. You don't know what he actually accomplished, but you do know by this point that he found a purpose; perhaps now he can die in peace.The last quarter of the film is Kanji's wake and the revelation that he almost single-handedly got this special project completed. His co-workers refuse to believe it at first, but as the wake wears on and the participants become more inebriated, revelations come about that prove that the lowly Watanabi did indeed accomplish his task.It is interestingly done. This could be a very dull story about a small and almost insignificant man and his life. But Kurosawa completely immerses us in Kanji's pain, dismay, and confusion. We become Watanabe. We cannot help but feel very deeply for this character.Just when you would expect the story to tell of Kanji's triumph Kurasawa kills the character and tells the remainder of his story through a series of flash-backs revealing the truth of Kanji's deeds at his funeral. It is almost astounding how many flash-backs there are yet Kurosawa manages to keep the story cohesive and easy to follow.It is a masterwork of story telling, though it seems overly melodramatic by today's standards of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The strongest point of this film is the simple but brilliant script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real question of this story is: if you knew you were going to die, what would you do? Would you spend your last days doing everything you wanted to do? any form of pleasure you can imagine, or would you do something importance, something that would actually mean something.An old man (Takashi Shimura) named Kenji is dying of cancer and feels his whole life has been wasted. For the past 30 years he's been working at Tokyo City Hall behind a desk accomplishing absolutely nothing, mainly just stamping papers with his rubber stamp and warming his chair.When he does find out he has cancer in the beginning of the film, he simply stops going to work and one day meets a stranger (who does a terrific job with his role) in a bar and in a conversation he says that he has money but doesn't know how to spend it for sheer entertainment. The stranger has pity on the man but at the same time envy since he doesn't just kill himself, but faces the facts of life and so of course he helps the old man have a good time but with his money as they go out on a night of night clubs, women and booze.Akira Kurosawa is one of my personal favorite directors and has many masterpieces but this doesn't exactly rank among those masterpieces like "Ran", "Throne of Blood", "Yojimbo" and the forgotten gem "The Bad Sleep Well". But that doesn't mean that this isn't a good film because in reality it's a great film, and the strongest point of this film is the simple but brilliant script as it tells us to appreciate life and the beauty of it, while we have it, hence the title of the film, "Ikiru" which means "To Live".One thing I didn't like about this film is the way the old man talks throughout the film; as if he can barley speak and you can barley make out what he is saying. But then again that is his role, moping around with this performance, you really believe that this man is dying of cancer and is truly upset with himself for not "living" his life all these years. One of his co-workers even tells to him over lunch that everyone has a nickname at the office and his was "The Mummy". He pauses for a minute and she thinks she has offended him but he reassures her that she hasn't in-fact; she has named him perfectly as he realizes that's what his life has been ever since his beloved wife has left him 30 years ago.Kenji feels that the worse part isn't dying; he feels that he has wasted his whole life and doesn't want to die before he does something of importance, meaning he wants to live his last days and not just exist as he has been doing all his life. He feels that he has been dead for a long time now but is just realizing it now when it's too late.There is a great moral to this story and a novelist in this film says it best with this beautiful and unforgettable quote: "How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ikiru" means "to live"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something to be said about the five-decade-long career of the late Japanese cinematic master craftsman Akira Kurosawa. I've only seen a few of his master-works, but every film I have seen of his is a brilliant, breathtaking exercise in cinematic master craftsmanship. Case in point: his 1952 dramatic masterpiece "Ikiru" (which when translated from Japanese, means "to live").The story itself (co-written by Kurosawa himself, Shinobu Hashimoto, and Hideo Oguni) is pretty simple and centers around Kanji Watanabe (Kurosawa's most prolific go-to man and my favorite international movie performer, the late Takashi Shimura), a faceless government bureaucrat who at the beginning of the story, learns he has been diagnosed with stomach cancer and has less than a year to live. He then sets about trying to make sense of his life and to give his existence some kind of meaning in his few remaining days.Throughout "Ikiru," the one thing that I was continually amazed by was the sincere, heartfelt and ultimately, heartbreaking, performance of Takashi Shimura as this film's dying middle-aged protagonist - and the film's most significantly developed character - Kanji Watanabe. Also throughout the film, I was constantly reminded of Shimura's later performance two years down the road as the wise, headstrong, brave, battle-tested, and heroic samurai master Kambei Shimada in Kurosawa's epic masterpiece "Seven Samurai" (1954) - my all-time favorite Kurosawa picture and my all-time favorite foreign-language feature; Shimura's Kambei Shimada was my favorite warrior from "Seven Samurai" for his bravery and leadership skills.Here, Shimura's Kanji Watanabe is weak, frail, panic-stricken, and fearful of his impending demise. In a few other ways, I'm somehow reminded of Nicolas Cage's Oscar-winning turn in "Leaving Las Vegas" (1995), where he played a failed screenwriter who was determined to drink himself to death and nothing, not even love, was going to stop him from accomplishing his goal. Kanji Watanabe is much the polar opposite of Cage's character, who doesn't just want to live a little bit longer, but just wants to give his few remaining months some sort of meaning and to affirm to himself (and us), that his existence meant something to the world.It's a bold and brilliant statement of what it means to live a life worth living; I've often pondered what it means to go through life and to work in meaningless professions rather than simply living the rich, fulfilling lives that we all really want to live, and not waiting until it's too late to realize it. This is much of what I gather from "Ikiru," though like any great film (or any film, really), many statements and messages can be gathered from it. But this is what I got from "Ikiru."After all these years, "Seven Samurai" remains my favorite Akira Kurosawa picture, followed by "Ran" (1985), "Rashomon," (1950), and now this film. I think Takashi Shimura really gave his all in this picture, a tragic, career-defining performance that is all too real and for some, could possibly hit a little too close to home (though I will always regard Kambei Shimada from "Seven Samurai" as the greatest character he's ever played). Why he was never nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, I will never know. But there's no question that after watching this movie, he deserved the greatest official recognition an actor can receive for their work on a motion picture...10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and a masterpiece acting job for Takashi Shimura for his incredibly moving performance as Watanabe, a dying bureaucrat who realizes he has squandered his life in his unrewarding, dead end job. What to do, now that he is facing death? That question is the key to IKIRU, perhaps Kurosawa's best picture and one of the best I have ever seen.Action fans, there is no action, no fighting, no battle scenes. This is an intense character study which hinges on Shimura's bravura acting job, who was himself an action hero in other Kurosawa films. I thought his ability to plumb the depths of sorrow and despair was astonishing, and he was able to sustain the overall impact despite the fact that he was in virtually every scene.I don't think IKIRU could be made today, or if it were it would have a very limited audience. It moves slowly for its length and requires too much involvement with its characters for modern audiences with their abbreviated attention spans. Movies for grownups are such a chore in 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is a long widowed &amp; long time (over 30 years) city government clerk whose married son &amp; wife live in his home. W's job, as section chief, is to review paper work produced by his section and apply his stamp to make them official. It's always been a meaningless, pretend work job, just as is the work in all the other sections.W. has increasingly suffered from stomach and digestive problems. He finally sees a doctor but, just before seeing him, he chats with a fellow patient in the waiting room from whom he learns that, if he has certain symptoms (all of which W. has), his doctor will tell him he has a mild ulcer, to eat the foods that agree with him, etc.--but he really has stomach cancer and less than a year to live. After examination, his doctor tells W. he has a mild ulcer and to eat the foods that agree with him, etc. W. realizes his life is near its end.He tries to tell his uncaring son but he's disinterested and doesn't hear. W. has been frugal, saving money--but for what? He withdraws some and a new acquaintance suggests W. live it up with drink, dance, and wild women and serves as W's guide through his futile attempt to find meaning this way.A spark happens when a young woman who works in his department resigns because she can't stand its meaninglessness. W. is attracted by her vitality and spends time with her until she pushes him away. But then he finds a purpose to accomplish: some mothers have been trying to get a swampy, buggy area in their neighborhood drained and converted into a playground for their children. But, typically, they've been shuffled from department to department fruitlessly without any progress. W. takes up their cause and accomplishes the deed just before his death. During his last breaths, he gently swings in the new playground in the snow, smiling, at peace, softly singing a song about seizing life before it's too late.After W's death, there's a wake at which his supervisors and coworkers drink and discuss W's legacy--did he accomplish anything?--did he know he had cancer?I saw this in a "great films" group. All others probably rated it as 10/10 stars--they were very moved by and loved it. I also thought it was good, worthwhile, but I'd rate it as 7/10. The cause of my disappointments: I thought ALL of the characters were VERY one-dimensional stereotypes and that the work situation &amp; appearance were over-the-top caricatures. Those qualities reminded me most of plays in puppet theaters and that resemblance diminished its power for me. But the film DID give a worthwhile experience and message (although not ANYwhere near that of "Rashomon").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fact: Akira Kurosawa was a genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no surprise that this is another beautiful film from legendary Akira Kurosawa. Only this time we move away from the samurai genre and move into modern (1952) times. Ikiru is about a bureaucrat in the city office named Kanji Watanabe. He has worked in the same building, at the same desk, with the same papers for over 30 years. And then one day he finds out he has terminal stomach cancer, left with only six months to live. Upon learning this, Watanabe reflects on his life, coming to the realization that he has no close ties to friends or family. His life is empty. In the six months he has left, Watanabe attempts to fill his life with the things he never experienced in his dull life. From the get-go we expect a strong centralized character development story, and Kurosawa delivers just such a thing in his own beautiful aesthetic.This film covers a lot of ground, and many ideas are presented. It's the story of a dying man, as well as a heartfelt study of life and death, and even a commentary on bureaucracy. There's a lot going on but Kurosawa masterfully organizes it so that it works wonders on the mind and heart. In the beginning we establish just how overcomplicated and heavily structured the bureaucratic system is. It's organized, rigid, and very, very dull. The character of Watanabe acts the same way. He is an empty shell of a man. The film quickly takes a turn down a sloping emotional path when Watanabe learns of his inescapable death. From here this character makes a dramatic switch to actual life. The tag line of the film is "Only when he learned he would die did he start to live." This is such a telling sentence that beautifully sums up the bulk of the emotion in this film. Watanabe begins to explore life and what he can make of it before he dies. Kurosawa's fantastic ability for storytelling provides a great narrative style that stays lively and interesting. Watanabe goes through multiple phases of coping with his inevitable death, each phase revealing more and more about his complex and wonderfully crafted character.The narrative changes it's style in the last act of the film after Watanabe dies. The last hour or so of the film is set at his wake, and what happened in the last couple of months of Watanabe's life is told through flashbacks. This was a fantastic storytelling decision that keeps the already compelling narrative all the more alive, especially when the film runs at two and a half hours. Kurosawa even manages to bring his bureaucratic message back around in the end, when Watanabe must battle the own system he worked for diligently for 30 years, in order to achieve his last great service to the world before he dies. Everything comes full circle to close nicely. The film comes to a beautifully tear jerking end that I'm sure, even after only one viewing, will be unforgettable. Kurosawa treats this smaller scale story of a dying man with such care and respect. It is a fantastic example of his range and ability to have an emotional impact, even out of his usual setting of feudal Japan.I could continue to regurgitate the brilliance of Kurosawa but there's not much need to. This man, in his career, established himself as one of the greatest artistic minds of his time. He could tell a story and then visualize it in such an immaculate and grand way. Ikiru is no different. It's another fantastic Kurosawa film that entertains and stirs emotionally. The man was a genius, and every film of his reflects it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's best film? It just might be...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terminally ill civil worker lives out his last 6 months as a changed man, with a new found urge to live as he realises his life has been wasting away for the past 30 years. In other words, he was a mummy; a corpse. Sitting on the same desk everyday, looking busy but not accomplishing anything of substance. This film really touched a nerve with me although you'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it. I could especially relate to Watanabe sacrificing his own life for his motherless son, something my dad had to do when my mother passed. One scene that especially moved me was when he requested a song at a bar, and to everyone's surprise he started singing it himself. Similarly, the scene near the end where he was on a swing, singing the same haunting song, was heart wrenching. For the last quarter of the film, after Watanabe has died, we witness his wake as various co-workers discuss his life and piece together what made him change so drastically. Through the scenes at the wake, Kurosawa manages to provide an excellent critique of bureaucracy in post-war Japan but we also get to see how others viewed Watanabe through their rose tinted glasses. A masterpiece, and quite possibly, Kurosawa's best film.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still let me begin with maybe one of the things that seem to work the least. The ending or should I say "the endings". I'm not going to spoil the ending of course, but if you thought Lord of the Rings (3) had too many endings, you could be excused feeling the same (or worse) with Ikiru here.But if you really think about it, even this minor flaw is necessary in the eyes of Kurusawa and therefor as he deemed it rounded up the story, agree with him or not, but it does take the movie to another level. If you are willing to go there and still have the strength to go there, you will be rewarded.But then again, the whole movie is a great experience. And while in other hands this could have become a very muddled affair, trying to push on the morals. A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sort of movie that improves with age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru, one of Akira Kurosawa's most underrated films, is among my favorites. The reasons for this are many. I don't want to over-analyze the film, because a simple story warrants a simple review, so I'll keep this brief.Kenji Watanabe is a mid-level, middle-aged Tokyo bureaucrat. Every day he reports to City Hall and review memos. Actually, that's being generous. Really, his job is to glance at papers and stamp them, showing that he took a few seconds to look at them. It's not that he hates his life, he just doesn't have anything to live for. His wife is long dead, his son is married and simply doesn't care about him, and he's worked at the same department for 30 years. Not exactly movie material.However, his soul is crushed when he finds that he has stomach cancer, with months to live. After this revelation, he tries to think of his accomplishments (none), and hopes (nil), and realizes that he has nothing ahead of him but a painful death. He decides that if he has nothing left, he should at least try to find some pleasure in his last days.He attempts to find relief in a hedonistic, party-life, as well as pursuing a woman many years younger than he. Naturally, this fails. Finally, he decides that if he can't find fun in living for himself, he will try to change the world for the better. He attempts to have a public park built in the stead of a garbage dump, and dies soon after, triumphant.Still, putting it like that make the film sound much more depressing than it is. Yes, it's not the most happy ending in the world; after all, the last hour of the film takes place at Watanabe's funeral, with him already dead. However, in a particularly memorable scene, he is challenged by a local Yakuza boss because of his ventures, and simply turns the other cheek, leaving the mobster with his tail between his legs.One of the main reason the film works, besides Kurosawa's careful direction, is the main performance of Watanabe, played by Takeshi Shimura. Hardcore movie buffs may recognize him as Shimada, the old man from Seven Samurai. However, this is his best performance. With his wide, sad, puppy-dog eyes, it is nearly impossible not to sympathize, and indeed love the guy. He walks hunched over, slowly, as if walking afraid of his own shadow. But by the time the film is nearly over, he is able to look up into the sky and sing his beautiful farewell as he dies peacefully, in the snowy playground which he has created.But the most important aspect of the film's success is the fact that it actually improves over time. No, the film itself is still in outdated, ugly, faded black-and-white, but viewing it as a teen, and viewing it as an adult will render completely different reactions. Roger Ebert put it best; "Over the years I have seen "Ikiru" every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us." Well said, Mr. Ebert.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To live.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like you can expect from basically every Kurosawa picture, this movie is something unique and beautiful. It's a very well crafted movie, that this time for most part gets uplifted by its story.It has a very simple and also very effective concept about a middle-aged bureaucrat, who suddenly finds out he only has a couple of more months to live. He then realizes he has never achieved anything or enjoyed live and only committed himself mostly only to his work. Even though it of course has a sad premise, the movie itself is really about life and how you should treasure and enjoy it and don't only commit yourself to one thing your whole life without any change, fore before you know you're life will be over and you'll not be able to look back at a fully lived one.It's a character movie that also gets very well constructed story-wise. Seems that Kurosawa had been inspired by "Citizen Kane", since it pretty much uses the same way of storytelling. The movie is basically one of two parts. In the first we get to know the main character and see how he tries to cope with his nearing end and tries to enjoy life and achieve something significant as well. The second halve mostly consist out of flashbacks after the death of the main character and shows how he achieved to do something significant and also affected a lot of people around him, mostly his colleagues, who realize that they way they are conducting their jobs is not in the best interest of everyone. It's also a movie that is a comment against the bureaucracy it seems. It's not a movie though that tries hard to be sentimental or preachy with any of its messages. It's a real subtly done movie, that therefore also tends to become a real effective one. It's also more an ode to life than a sad movie about a dying man really.Granted that the movie is a bit too long, making some of its sequences a bit overlong at times but this is something you more or less always have to take for granted in an old fashioned Japanese production. It's also hardly a complained for this movie but I guess it will still turn some people off.Takashi Shimura is really great as the dying man, who is mostly expressing himself with his face, rather than words. You see his pain, grief and desperateness in his eyes. Shimura also was only in his 40's at the time but they did a great job with making him look much older but credit for this of course also has to go to Takashi Shimura himself for this. Shimura is an actor who used to work quite a lot with and is also in some of his best known movies like "Shichinin no samurai", "Rashômon", "Yojimbo" and "Kakushi-toride no san-akunin". Yet he never had been that well known or recognized as for instance Toshirô Mifune. Perhaps because he was mostly normally playing the secondary characters but in this movie Kurosawa really allows him to shine and gives him a stage for perhaps his greatest performance. It at least is his most memorable one.A really fine made and told movie!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Watch this movie and take the opportunity to reflect on how you may be running through your brief years with little to show for them...Though at times rather heavy handed and didactic, the vitality and generosity of this movie are a wonderful antidote to our cynical age, and the performances are quite good. My only complaint is that the last third of the film is largely told in flashback, which leads to jerky, abrupt breaks in the movie's flow.

There are so many terrifying and tender moments in this film. The scenes with the young office mate went from charming to cold-- we knew there was no more than companionship, but she can't really even give him that anymore. The scene when he is about to tell his son about his condition and the young man goes off on a rant about how embarrassingly his father has been acting actually brought me to tears. Of course, it's the price he pays for his cold distance all those years. Then there's the whole bureaucratic nightmare of the office. Even at the wake they don't want to give credit. All the buck passers want a share of his legacy. Maybe families who are living on the edge should watch this movie. Even after more than 50 years, it wears extremely well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live the Cosmic Wow Right Now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our leadsman in Ikiru, Kanji Watanabe, is an older, exhaustive looking man caught up in the rat race of everyday, robotic living. Exuberance stripped, joy absent, utterly banal. It is only when he learns he's contracted an incurable stomach cancer that he begins to suffer from an existential crisis, plagued by frustration and the dread of approaching death. His language becomes almost ineffable, his soul harrowed up with an array of unwanted emotions, his memory elusive and soon to "vanish away." Realizing his life is near expired and with no significant contributions etched into the hallmark of the living, something inside him changes; the instinctive will "to live" overwhelms him. As the disenchanted novelist he meets puts it, "We don't realize how beautiful (or precious) life is until we chance upon death." The words resonate in Watanabe's mind. He seems to understand Sartre's credo, "Death must enter life only to define it." Suddenly, he fearfully and frantically yearns to define his life, overcome the petty existence he's wasted and atone for the quality of life and gratification he's lost, thus rendering death ineffectual. It is a message not only for Watanabe, but for all of humanity?to live the cosmic wow right now without reserve or fear of death.The difficulty Watanabe faces, however, is that the person he's shaped and ultimately become is without adequate faith and determination to face the future. Not only is he ill-prepared to be ordained with vitality, he is without dreams, goals and direction on where to foster his newborn energy to live. It would be likened unto a small child wanting to drive his father's brand new dodge viper yet without the necessary skill, maturity and knowledge needed to operate such a heavy piece of machinery. Watanabe is no different. He only knows that he desires a second chance at life?a life lived to its utmost potential. Clinging to this desire for positive self-transformation, he begins his newly awakened journey by touring the fleshpots of Tokyo, seeking joy through transient means: nightclubs, girls, liquor and other places of revelry. None of these places seem to bring about the type of life he's looking for. He moves on. He tries to make retirement arrangements with his much adorned son who ironically misperceives him. He fails.He then endeavors to capture the secret to living life from his dainty female colleague who appears to have it all: zest, humor, vitality, etc. The secret, he discovers, is not grandiose but utterly simplistic?she enjoys making wind-up bunny rabbits for "the children of Japan." It's a timely message to understand because it shows that the great and grand secret to living life is found where most would have it not be found. There is no secret. According to the film's subtext, "to live" a life most fruitful is to be found in a collection of seemingly insignificant moments: laughter between two friends, a chocolate ice-cream cone, a gathering at the theater, the smile of a lover, etc. Watanabe, like all of us, is learning to extract the extraordinary from the ordinary. And slowly but surely, he is.At the close of his journey, he turns his search for life's meaning to a civil service project buried deep under bureaucratic red tape, each member of his department having passed the buck from one office to the next. He personally takes it upon himself to see the project through?to turn a sewage gauntlet into an established play park for children. Though the end product isn't revolutionary, it is Watanabe's last chance for redeeming all of those years of self-absorption, self-loathing and regret. It is his last charitable contribution to life's hallmark academy, be it ever so small; that final part of his positive self-transformation. When he finally dies, the impact it makes parallels the proverb "our work is never appreciated until we are dead." Likewise, people are usually never venerated until they pass on. There is something deeply mystifying about death's impact on the human consciousness that causes it to understand not its own depth until the hour of separation. The film is remarkable in this way in that it creates a hoped for paradigm shift in the viewer, showing the precariousness and evanescence of life. Life, to be fully appreciated, must be threatened with death intermediately throughout and finally absorbed completely in the end. As the poet Tweedy observed, "You have to learn how to die?if you want to be alive." Kurosawa makes an astute commentary on the culture and values of bureaucracies, how we are all to some degree mini-bureaucrats caught up in the cyclical nature of zoning out, taking life for granted, and becoming programmed automatons who seek nothing but self-preservation and creature comforts. Life for Kurosawa is not to be lived by hiding in the seas of faces, hoping to be unobserved, but by making something of one's self, taking healthy risks, living Socrates' "life examined" and recognizing the small and simple things that make life worth defending. The secret to life is the recognition of the simple, the ordinary, the plain and mundane. It is that recognition that creates a sort of exuberance in the traveler's life?one that follows in existentialist shadows and gains genuine and authentic meaning by one's active level of participation in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old and alone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After ten pages, most of which laud the mastery and humanity of the director, page 11 seems to denigrate this masterpiece. Why? There have been few films that explain what is like to be old and alone as well as this film does. Only DeSica's "Umberto D" and Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" even come near it psychologically. Kurosawa's hero is more than a passive observant, regretful of the life that has passed them by. Here the civil-servant is hell-bent on living the life that he might have had, had he the courage to live. Has there ever been anything in cinema as touching and pathetic as this old man's attraction to the simple, self-absorbed and not too bright office worker whom he befriends and entertains only to be rejected by her as a creep. Emil Jannings in "Blue Angel" gets caught in the net of self-hatred and self-abuse, but Kurosawa's hero learns from what's left of life, moves on and does something positive, only to die without due credit for his act. It is a supremely ironic story, devoid of sentimentality. Has there even been a Western director who has told the story of old age with such clear-eyed honesty???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is this Japanese movie so very impressive? And I mean impressive not as a melodrama, as a Russian pastiche, for murky sentimental reasons?but as a radically achieved work?something radically valid and achieved. It has vision; this is obvious from the first frame, or from the very beginning; also, it signals itself as the movie of someone who sets himself up for something.Kurosawa's means are here satirical, symbolical, lyrical, though of course all within a certain generic realism. But what is admired in IKIRU is not, of course, the realism?but the masterpiece, the artistic achievement. Also the supreme inspiration and the depth and exactness of vision, and the astoundingly just touch. Kurosawa's ingenuity in the search for human universals served him excellently; he was wisely pragmatic in adopting what he felt that it served his purposes?and his purpose was neatly defined?that which best and most aptly defines the humanity of all people. His art is intrinsically sapient and exists only in relation with his claim at seizing and defining features apt to characterize the generic humanity; a program that is sapient, classic and realist. At Kurosawa, art goes beyond itself?in the understanding of the humanity.In other words, realism with original, lyrical means; and IKIRU is indeed, for several reasons, deeply satisfying and amazing. I underline this category of aesthetic wonder, of surprise, the power of this impression of original and strongly astounding?even eerie.What a fine thing is the long scene of the oldster's wake; how do alcohol, food, interaction, words, gestures?how do they bring people, in fact most people, towards a common conclusion, or towards the recognition of some facts ?.Kurosawa is not pessimist; he is satirical, but he invites us to wait and see what happens next, because it will happen in virtue of laws that govern the people's behavior. I believe that Kurosawa is very wise here; and strong, as well. Satire?but not indignation; he says, as it were?let's see what will alcohol and food and company and talks and spontaneous sincerity from one?what will all these make to the people gathered for a wake?people tightly controlled by their _interiorized obedience and servitude. All this is keen and in fact surprising.There are a variety of inner realms here?and not a single false note. The joy of the young woman; her cruelty; the leap forward in narration; the copious scene of the funeral wake; the diversity of portrayals, the fundamental and deep, soothing common sense and balance, the justness of the approach, the genuine independence and ingenuity in using various means, from satire to melodrama, all sorts of flashbacks and even heartbreaking tunes, all amounts to a healthily popular sort of cinema?more like the French Old School. I consider IKIRU a masterpiece of tangible beauty and thrilling interest, and a gift to the buffs, a wonderfully rich elegiac meditation. I would not like to argue here about which Kurosawa is the best; yet what he gave me in IKIRU is absolutely above, it seems to me, what he could furnish in his later historical movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How tragic that man can never realize how beautiful life is until he is face to face with death.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening of this film was just what everyone would think of bureaucracies that we deal with every day. The people wanted a park and they just got shuffled from one office to another. No one wanted to do anything that they could later be criticized for.Wantanabe (Takashi Shimura) was no different. He spent 30 years in government and rose to section chief without doing a thing. He just came to work every day and avoided "rocking the boat." His life was so boring that others called him "The Mummy." When he found out that he had stomach cancer and less than a year to live, he searched for something to give his life meaning. He went out with a writer (Y?nosuke Itô) to bars and strip clubs to find something, but it wasn't enough.He started hanging around with a young office worker (Miki Odagiri) who gave him pleasure (non sexual, you pervert) until she was tired of being with him. But, before she left him, she gave him an idea, and he started his life anew trying to build that park. Even as a Section Chief, taking on the bureaucracy was an uphill battle.We do not see the struggle until after he dies and all the other functionaries at his wake start telling his story as they try to figure out why he did what he did.Kurosawa and Shimura gave us a treasure about life and one that would do us well to watch over and over.Sacrificing yourself to serve the many. What a message!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the last three months i have discovered the films of Japanese Director Akira Kurosawa. Thanks to some superb recommendations my movie watching experiences has been broadened and enlightened . Kurosawa's is a masterful story teller and although his films aren't perfect they leave an indelible mark on your brain that will forever be there. Ikiru is my favourite of his films that i have seen so far and i urge anyone who is thinking about discovering Akira Kurosawa's movies to make this one the first. Ikiru is the modern-day tale of a lonely man confronting death in post-war Tokyo. One of the greatest actors of Japanese cinema, Takashi Shimura, plays Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged civil servant who has slavishly devoted himself to his job for thirty years, only to find that he now has inoperable stomach cancer. With limited time left, and the feeling that he has never truly lived at all, Watanabe embarks on a quest to make the most of his remaining days. After bouts of self-pity, a spell of hedonism and a doomed attempt at a platonic relationship, he commits himself doggedly to the task of converting a city dump into a children's playground.Takashi Shimura was an am amazing actor. His facial expression were masterful. He could light up the screen when he smiled and when he was sad the audience felt his misery. His portrayal of cancer stricken watanabe is amazing. When he says" I can't afford to hate people. I don't have that kind of time." you believe every word.Ikiru is a story that makes you wonder why we trudge along in our everyday lives and what would we do or say if we were told we only had months to live and why would we wait for news like that to start living our lives?Ikiru translation into English is "To Live" and you have not lived until you have seen this movie.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie made me go a big rubbery one. this was way more emotionally resonant than Kane. when happy birthday swells....how do i explain this to friends? how do i recommend this to the derelicts and scumbags i proudly call my friends? i'm not even sure what to say to recommend it. it's something intangible but raw. i can't really refer to anything in particular except the movie was just strong. well worth the $10 criterion disc. this may be one of my new favorites. maybe it's all the cold medicines talking. or maybe that this is kind of like Kane in reverse. the big emotional pay off right in the middle. or maybe it's because unlike Kane our protagonist Watanabe is actually a sympathetic character. is it even possible to watch this movie in groups of people?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw part of this movie in unusual circumstances - while eating noodles with a friend in a Japanese restaurant. It was playing (no sound) in the background on the opposite side of the restaurant. I couldn't keep my eyes off it (no offense to my friend), especially the scene where the main character is dragged on a tour of the night hot spots of post war Tokyo. The editing and photography was dazzling - I knew immediately it had to be Kurosawa, and I had to see the movie. At the time, i was only interested in seeing his samurai and historic epics.To say this movie didn't disappoint is a huge understatement. It is simply a masterpiece, this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. It is of course (as anyone reading the reviews here will know) deeply human and hugely moving. It is a very beautiful and thought provoking movie. But its also quite amazingly structured - it breaks so many rules of film making - it 'ends' half way through and an almost completely new movie starts - a brilliant third act at his funeral, where the formerly minor characters become stars (a brilliant ensemble piece of acting) as the former colleagues argue about what the deceased stood for. I can't think of any movie that has used flashbacks in time to such great effect. Each segment of the movie - the initial funny set up in the government office, the nightclub scene, his dating with the simple but funny office girl and of course the final playground scene - each is perfection.Some reviewers have drawn many comparisons with Ozu's Tokyo Story, made the same year. It so happens that Tokyo Story is maybe my all time favorite movie. Well, Ikiru is right up with it. While Tokyo Story is much more subtle, like 'a strong current under still water' as Kurosawa would have put it, this is much more muscular, direct film making. Its occasionally sentimental, even manipulative, in a way Ozu would never have dreamed of trying. But it is also a '10' in my book. An absolute must-see for anyone interested in cinema. Hell, its a must see for anyone interested in living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3 approaches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can almost be considered three different movies, as each act contains its own very different approach to the drama of a bureaucrat affected with a lethal cancer and a sudden need for life.The first part is the most self-consciously cinematic, containing the most amounts of wipes, fades, dissolves, flash-backs, and even voice-over of the entire production. Akira Kurosawa backs up the introduction of a lifeless person with stunning set design and deep focus throughout, but these features in conjunction with the cinematic processes described provide a rich and layered detailing of something that normally would be very tedious to watch. This, then, is when Watanabe is still alive. However, he lives while he's dead.The second part, or middle act, is after he discovers his illness and learns that there's no hope for his life nor comfort from his family. 3's appear throughout this work (and Kurosawa was always fond of triangles), and this fateful number appears in the different ways Watanabe attempts to find "life"... first is the attempt to live it up in a disturbingly entrapped and claustrophobic Westernized style life (the bitter imagery in conjunction with the bureaucratic theme makes this movie a rather vehement protest against Westernization in Japan). Unfufilled by that, he then attempts to live vicariously through an energetic ex-coworker. After that relationship turns sour, he takes her advice to try to "make something" for the world. This part of the movie is the most directly narrative. The film-making is a little more reserved, and it is used transparently to detail the slowly ailing life and the obsession for hope the character has. This is his mis-guided struggle for life, but also contains a scene wherein he is pretty much "born again" (the characters in the background singing the happy birthday song don't know it's for him).The third part is a narrative-within-a-narrative, as all of the characters from earlier in the film (save the energetic young woman and the Mephistopheles-like poet) come to reminisce about Watanabe, and in the process begin to understand how much he was actually able to do. Now the story is being told from a completely different perspective, Watanabe isn't even there, and yet... now he's finally alive, as his legacy and his presence is respected by everyone (either immediately or gradually). The narrative-within-a-narrative approach helps to put the audience in the place of the bureaucrats who try to take credit for Watanabe's success. After they promise themselves to become better people and save the world (don't we all after narratives like this?), they soon get sucked back into their real lives, showing that it is not one's intentions, but one's actions that truly define what it is "to live." As usual, Kurosawa shows his skills of consummate artistry, but this time he shows an acute structural approach that transcends narrative to create a rather poignant and undidactic theme. And best of all, he never falls into sentimentality.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch at least twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend watching this movie at least twice before coming to any sort of judgement. The theme of people realising themselves after they learn they are going to die is not new, and has been repeated in numerous (sometimes good) movies. But the real value of this movie is in the detail.*Following contains Spoilers* A part of the movie that really got me was the intense scene in the restaurant when Watanabe asks the girl what is so special about her. The girl says the all she does is eat and work. She makes toys, but when she makes them she feels like 'she is playing with every baby in Japan'. She asks him 'why don't you make something?'. There is nothing much he can do in a government office like his, and it is too late for him to change. But suddenly he realises that there is something he can still do, and runs out from the restaurant.All the time they were talking, there are children in the back excited trying to organise a birthday party. Kurosawa intentionally shows this in the background to give a feeling that something good is about to happen. And the moment he realises that he can do something and runs out, they start singing 'Happy Birthday' for the friend who is arriving. A life has just been born... I only noticed this the second time I watched the movie.Go ahead and watch this great movie many times. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This may change how you view your life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You should not watch this movie unless you are prepared to look at how you are living your life, particularly if you have, or have had, a routine job.The protagonist, Kanji Watanabe, is an aging civil servant, the Section Chief of Public Affairs, in a large Japanese city (presumably Tokyo). Early in the film Watanabe discovers that he is dying of stomach cancer and this forces him to take a sober look at his life, and he is not too happy with what he sees. He sees that he has effectively been dead for thirty years working in an organization where people fear to take vacations lest it be discovered that they would not be missed.The story is not played for sentiment. For example when Watanabi shares the secret of his disease with a young woman, Toyo, and admits to having lived a sterile, spartan life, he tries to excuse his behavior by saying that he has done it all for his son. But Toyo does not let him get away with that excuse, saying that his son never asked for such sacrifice. She notes that Watanabi made his choices regardless of whether he recognized them as choices or not. Watanabi is ultimately taken to the depths of existential despair which forces him to try to salvage some personal meaning in life before he dies. Salvation lies in the passionate and persistent pursuit of a personally meaningful endeavor, ironically at his job. While the main thrust of the movie is in detailing Watanabi's crisis, many other themes are dealt with.We get insights into the state of Japan in the early 1950s, just after the end of the Allied occupation of Japan following WWII. One thing we see is a government mired in bureaucracy. When a group of women come to the local authorities concerned about cleaning up a sewage pond in their neighborhood they are routed to some sixteen departments (including Watanabi's) getting a royal runaround - should be Pest Control, should be Parks, should be Child Welfare, etc. The women finally give up in frustration making the comment, "This is not democracy." The office buildings are run down and many still show scars from the war. Mambers of the Yakuza even make an appearance.Another thing we see is a generational gap. The older generation lives simply and is financially conservative. This distinction is made between Watanabi, who lives in sparse surroundings, versus his son and daughter-in-law who live in the same house but have more possessions and are much more concerned with material things. Also, Watanabi's first attempts to "live" after finding out his diagnosis are to frequent the pachinko parlors, jazz clubs, strip-tease bars, and crowded dance halls where young people are congregating. We see that Japan's move to Westernization is well under way. You can interpret Watanabi's death as a symbol of the end of the old Japan and his reluctant passing of his estate to his estranged son and daughter-in-law as the transition from an old self-disciplined Japan to a new more materially oriented, Westernized Japan.In addition to the generational gap, there is an unequal distribution of wealth. When Watanabi and Toyo are at a restaurant there is a birthday party going on in the background. The convivial carefree atmosphere of the birthday party is contrasted with Toyo's jealous gaze as she realizes that she will never be in that class. Initially Toyo works in the same department as Watanabi, but she is smart enough to see that it is a dead end - she is horrified when she realizes that Watanabi has been there for thirty years. But when she quits, the best job she can land is working in a factory that makes stuffed rabbits."Ikiru" reaches its true distinction in the extended scene at Watanabi's wake. Here Kurosawa touches on some of the same themes as in "Rahomon," showing how we all filter experience through our own unique outlooks, frequently ignoring the facts. Watanabi's relatives have interpreted his unusual behavior, due to his illness, as resulting from his having an affair. People rewrite history to present themselves in the most favorable light. Instead of reacting to Watanabi's achievement by reflecting on their own impotence, some of his coworkers actually criticize him for having been so aggressive and not following the rules.All of this presented through masterful black and white cinematography. The civil servants sit around a desk and are dwarfed by huge stacks of paper. It is interesting that in a scene where Watanabi rides through the streets of Tokyo the neon lights of the city are reflected off the car windows in exactly the same way that the same scene is played with Bill Murray in "Lost in Translation."The Criterion Collection DVD is of good quality, even though there is some significant flicker in some scenes. The subtitles have been made current using phrases like, "I can't wrap my head around it," "bummer," "you actually *get* it". There is some explicit profanity that would not have been in the early versions. The commentary track is excellent.This film may have its strongest impact on older people who are forced to look back at their lives, but it should have a powerful effect on younger people as well. As one of the characters says, "But any one of us could suddenly drop dead."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Kurosawa film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sandwiched in between the international breakthrough of Rashomon and the momentous Seven Samurai, Ikiru is a smaller, more personal film from the master. It's an involving meditation on humanity, isolation, and change. Poor Watanabe is diagnosed with terminal cancer and must find some meaning in his life, something that will give it value before time runs out. Unlike Rashomon or Samurai, this picture is set in a more modern Japan, post WWII, instantly making it more relatable, even to those foreign to Japanese culture. The film is almost two and half hours, but Watanabe is so sympathetic that you can't take your eyes off his almost pathetic figure, even when the film shifts to others' perspectives in the second half. This film is highly recommended for all fans of excellent cinema!**** out ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the best movies ever made. Every time I see this movie Im stunned by the fact of its sincerity:the sincerity of Kurosawas vision, and his courage to without compromises follow it through. Embedded in a story of an old man, civil servant, who one day gets the information from his doctor that he suffers from stomach cancer, are all the the big features of great storytelling: allergorism truth, symbolism-take any choice from the dictionary. And its all told by the great humanist Akira Kurosawa, in his downplayed, earthy and somewhat warm ironic way. If you ever wondered about what Kurosawa was all about, watch this one.It is a true catharsis.Watch it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A life not wasted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Kurosawa's greatest films. Deeply moving exploration of the life of everyman who ever aspired to greatness and never achieved it. This film shows that great men often perform small acts that live on in the lives of those affected by their acts. It also illustrates the type of "credit takers" in elective office who try to claim the glory achieved by the small people who are their subordinates. The theme song is enough to make me cry, and I'm an old man. I first saw this when I lived in Japan over 35 years ago. I heartily recommend this film to everyone who has ever toiled in a cubicle or at any mundane job that gives no inner satisfaction. Violence and sex are not necessary in the telling of a story like this. This film MUST be available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Life Unfulfilled Poignantly Observed by Kurosawa at His Quietest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder if it's a coincidence that Yasujiro Ozu's 1953 "Tokyo Story" and this 1952 masterwork from Akira Kurosawa were released just months apart in Japan, as both deal with the disappointments between parents and children in similarly penetrating ways. It's likely that post-WWII Japan, especially after the Allied occupation ended in 1951, saw an overall deterioration of the family unit as Western influences took hold of the socioeconomic structure. This one goes even further in adding local government bureaucracy as a key factor in diminishing the self-worth of those who sacrificed their lives in meaningless jobs. A particularly effective sequence early in the film involves the local bureau's reaction to a proposal to build a park with each department representative claiming that its hands are tied and passing the buck to another department in ceaseless red tape.The focus here is on Kanji Watanabe, a stamp-wielding chief of affairs who routinely halts civic project proposals that come across his desk, which is covered with stacks of unread documents. At his job for thirty years, Watanabe earns the nickname of "The Mummy" for his catatonic manner, but when he learns he has stomach cancer and has six months to live, he takes stock of all he has left undone. Saddled with a son and daughter-in-law who hypocritically feel burdened by him (even though they live in his house), Watanabe embarks on an obsessive journey to find redemption. It takes him from Tokyo's seedy nightlife - some of the more vibrantly surreal scenes are contained here - through an oddly erratic and strictly platonic relationship with a young female colleague named Toyo, whose spirit inspires him to do something right before he dies. The last hour of the lengthy film suddenly becomes a flashback from Watanabe's wake, which retraces his monomaniacal effort to support a group of housewives to build a children's playground where a toxic cesspool exists. The switch in perspective is initially jarring, but it gradually makes sense as it is meant to show the effect of Watanabe's good deeds on others and questions whether they will have a lasting effect on them. As it turns out, the cancer liberates Watanabe from the futile life he led and makes him a greater man than anyone could have imagined with the park as his undeniable legacy.Truth be told, Kurosawa is not as subtle as Ozu when treading such sensitive subject matter, for instance, Kurosawa films actual flashback scenes to understand Watanabe's evolving relationship with his son, whereas Ozu would merely imply the distance between them. However, Kurosawa builds the appropriate gravitas as the story unfolds in a sometimes glacial manner. Takashi Shimura, a Kurosawa regular who would gain greater renown as the leader of "The Seven Samurai" two years later, is deeply affecting as Watanabe. With his frozen cow-eyes and slumping posture, he captures the discomforting nature of this hapless man who finds his purpose just before it's too late. He achieves a brutal poignancy with his nightclub-set singing of his theme song, "Life Is Brief", his lips hardly moving and his eyes cast in a downward stare toward oblivion. The last shot of him on the swing, magically framed by a jungle gym in a light snowfall as he sings his theme, is an utterly transcendent moment. I am on the fence about Miki Odagiri's performance as Toyo - on one hand, she fully embodies the free, uninhibited spirit of her downscale character, and yet, she can go overboard with her ebullience during key moments. I also feel the nightlife sequences go on a little too long as they appear to provide simply an opportunity for an indulgent novelist, played by Yunosuke Ito, to go on about the joys of the road not taken.Minor flaws aside, this is a moving film that encompasses the importance of bringing purpose to one's life even if you have little time left in this world. The two-disc Criterion Collection set contains plenty of extras - an informative commentary track provided by Stephen Prince, author of "The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa", as well as two documentaries. One is an 81-minute film, "A Message from Akira Kurosawa", about Kurosawa's late-career creative process around the filming of 1991's "Rhapsody in August", and the other is a more engrossing 41-minute film, which focuses exclusively on "Ikiru" and has a rare interview with Shimura.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having everything by Akira Kurosawa, I picked up a copy of Ikiru. Having been slightly let down by "Sanjuro", I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was pure heart-wrenching power, the sort of stuff that one believes is possible by telling a good story, but rarely finds. I'm not going to repeat what others have said, as you can read many a fine summary of the movie, but here is what I will tell y'all...Ikiru gives us the finest of Akira Kurosawa the director and Takashi Shimura the lead actor. And unlike most Japanese films, this one is not about feudal Japan! Instead, one gets a peek at the Japan of 1952, one that remains more unknown to most folks, including myself. Just observing the surroundings is an adventure, a discovery of the hereto unknown.The story itself possesses more raw emotion than, well, forget the comparisons. I'd put it up with Schindler's List. I'd buy it. Wait, I did. Oh never mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-key, free of sentiment and touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For pretty much his whole working life, Kanji Watanabe has been a bureaucrat in one of the departments of the city. In terms of long service it is impressive but in terms of living or achieving something, it is practically the equivalent of having never been on Earth in the first place. This is just one of the realisations that hit Kanji when he discovers that not only does he have cancer but that his options are limited and death is perhaps only months away. Determined to try and capture what he sees others doing and unable to really talk to his son, Kanji makes several new acquaintances before decided on his final actions.I've been using my DVD rental subscription to catch up on "classics" that I have never actually seen and recently that has seen me focusing on Akira Kurosawa who I consider a great filmmaker ? but mainly because that is what I'm told, hence me seeing for myself! The last few films were very famous ones and also period pieces in feudal Japan so Ikiru was a bit of a change of pace for me and I wasn't even sure what it was about. The rating and high esteem it is held in is probably a bit misleading because those expecting to be amazed or blown away by "one of the greatest films ever made" etc will be disappointed because it is a very low key piece. This makes it less roundly enjoyable than, say, Yojimbo, but no less great a film ? just very good in a different way. Being a very slight film, we do not see Kanji blow the world away or decide to go sky-diving, climbing a mountain or any one of many things that make their way onto these "things to do before I die/ turn 30/40/50/whatever" lists but rather he just looks to feel energetic, less old and just have small fun that his drab life and focus on work has seen him lose.In trying to discover something that will give him this, we see him almost desperate and I loved the mix of pity and fear in the eyes of some of those around him ? as if death is perhaps catching. We see it in the bar where he sings and kills the mood and also in the eyes of his female colleague who he so desperately wants to be brought alive by. Ultimately his act is not one of self but one for others; nor is it a heroic act of his own labour but one of gentle persuasion to make others act ? in fact it isn't even anything amazing but just a small achievement to try and make him forget the years of inactivity and bureaucracy. It is touching in the simplicity and the meaning of the journey and I did also like the structure of the film at the two-thirds mark where we start looking back instead of following the story forward. Although less full of spectacle than his other films I have seen, Kurosawa delivers some great shots but is more impressive in the detail. He stays very close to his main subject and we are not allow to stay distant from the loss and sense of waste that he feels at the end of his life. It helps greatly that he has drawn a great performance from Shimura, whose face is so expressive and eye's are like a direct link to the character's thoughts. He is the heart of the film and a bad performance would have killed it, but no risk here.Ikiru is perhaps not as well known as some of Kurosawa's work and it is not as easily enjoyable as some of his other films but in this low-key piece there is a real gem of a film that is beautifully delivered without sweeping sentiment, big gestures or lies in the narrative or characters. For this it is all the more touching and another reason why the director is held in such high esteem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru (To Live), by Akira Kurosawa, is sort of a 'lost' film. No, it was never really lost, but it is unlike the archetypal Kurosawa film Western audiences think of him making, and thereby lost in his canon. It is not some historical epic filled with honor, samurais, and swordplay. It is more in line with the genre of retrospective life films in the vein of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane or Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, in that we drop in the on the life of an ordinary man- in this case lifelong low level Tokyo city bureaucrat office head Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura), a few months before his death by stomach cancer, and witness how this 'living mummy', as his co-workers chide him (one of the nicer things they say about him), reclaims meaning in a life long since blanched of it. Unlike Charles Foster Kane, a business magnate, or Isak Borg, a renowned Academic, Watanabe is the sort of man most people would ignore.His devotion to his work life only accentuates his forgetability, for he seems somehow pleased with himself and his existence (or maybe just narcotized), merely rubber stamping projects here and there, or assisting his underlings in giving grieving citizens the bureaucratic runaround. Yet, as soon as we, and he, get confirmation of his cancer (although his doctors, in Japanese tradition deny it, and Kurosawa deftly skewers this absurd tradition in a hilarious scene where another stomach patient- played by Atsushi Watanabe- tells Watanabe exactly what horrors to expect from the doctors and the disease, and is right) something within Watanabe shifts. A mere month shy of setting the all time record for perfect attendance, he skips out of work for a few days. The non-news of his impending demise has shattered all his desires for conformity?. This is a great film, and Shimura (a veteran of the Godzilla films I loved in my youth, as well a Kurosawa regular film player) gives a great performance. The way he imposes his will on the gangsters, bureaucrats, and politicians to get the park built shows smart subversion at its best, and possibly enough to make up for the years of living death between his wife's death and his graves-edge rebirth. Like Rashomon, which preceded it in the Kurosawa canon, Ikiru deals with perspective, but not the perspective of many on one event, but the perspective of many on many things: life, a man, a park, accomplishment. It is, in that way, something like Rashomon 2. It is one of the many reasons this is such a great film. Another is that while the first two thirds of the film, while Watanabe lives, is great, there have been Hollywood films that come close to it- in construction and true sentiment. But, no Hollywood film has ever done what the last third of this film does, craft a stage play that can basically stand alone as an existential debate on life and art, purposiveness and meaning. This daring and depth is what soars Ikiru past lesser films. Even Citizen Kane, as great and influential a film as that is, was not as daring narratively, as this film, for the themes of the film, while profound, are not really original. It's all how the film presents these issues, starting with the film's first shot of an X-Ray of Watanabe's stomach cancer. Despite all that is to occur, Kurosawa never lets us forget that all of what occurs is due to a few cells in a man's stomach that forgot how to behave. Without the cancer, Watanabe remains a mummy for years more, and the slum children have no park to relieve, however briefly, their misery.Yet, even more profound than the philosophy of the film, is its realism. By the end of the film, we see that Watanabe's co-workers truly are bureaucratic scum. They talk the talk at his wake, but refuse to walk Watanabe's walk. Watanabe's victory is small, and temporal. Likely, the gangsters will find another way to corrupt that area, and with Watanabe gone there is no one left in his office who will care. Kurosawa has shown us victory, but acknowledges it may be Pyrrhic, at best. It is also the greatest artistic indictment of bureaucracies ever made, and not just of Post-War Japan's problems, nor even Japan's for the three tenets of Japanese bureaucracy- be punctual, never take off, and do nothing, are universal, even if only codified in Japan. We see this most eloquently in the scenes of Watanabe skipping work, for the office work comes to a halt and the mountain of paperwork continues to bloat.Some believe that the famed Tolstoy story, The Death Of Ivan Ilyich, is the basis for this film, since both involve petty bureaucrats who die, but Ikiru is the far greater work of art, for it about life, not merely its waste. Ilyich cannot cope with life, while Watanabe, however, acts upon his demise's coming, but why he does, is a bit of a mystery. We can only assume his motives, for Kurosawa keeps much of his motivation a secret, as Watanabe spends quite some time 'offstage', even when alive. Perhaps the only flaw in the film is in the subtitling, with white subtitles almost blanched out in some of the shots, but that's not anything Kurosawa had control over. That which he did shows mastery, something he never seems to have lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kurasawa masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb acting, camera work, cutting, blending of past and present -- Kurasawa and his team take what could be a hokey, sentimental story and create a masterpiece about (sorry to be so trite, but...) the meaning of life. It may be a bit far fetched but this movie recalled to my mind Homer's Odyssey, in the sense that it too is about "doing the right thing" -- honor -- heroic response to challenge. In the case of the movie, this is set in a banal, "everyman" context of the timid petty bureaucrat Watanabi. The B&amp;W photography, perhaps not deliberately since that was still common in the early '50s, emphasizes the metaphorical aspects of the story.Watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows bar none that Akira Kurasawa is not just a samurai film director he is pure genius. From cinematography to acting this movie is flawless. Unless of course you don't want to cry yourself to sleep (be warned this movie is extremely a downer). *Note beyond this point there may be spoilers*The movie tells the story of a bureaucrat who finds out he has a stomach tumor and will die in at least 5 years but he most likely has one year left to live. Only at the realization that he doesn't have any time left does he realize that he hasn't done anything with his life. He falls into depression and begins stop going to work, to drink, and to see a young girl that used to work for him. When she leaves him she more or less tells him to do something with his life. Shortly after he returns to work and begins doing his job the way it should have been done and works to build a park. After the park is completed he sits happily on a swing set as it snows (a cinematography gold mine) and looks at what he has done with his life as he drifts to sleep never to wake again.This movie is brilliant I give it my highest recommendation</fullReview>

Relative to movies of the 1980's and 1990's the pace of the story is relaxed, or even sedate, but it truly fits the serious nature of the story being told. Furthermore the movie provides a rare peek into the japanese society and its workings.(Spoiler) This is a truly amazing story of a city clerk's reaction to the fact that he is told he is about to die. In short he tries to accomplish some good before his passing, and thus faces the system, that he was so much a part of whilst unaware of his own mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless classic about values and meaning of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, I have to confess in advance that I might be called prejudice as I think that Akira Kurosawa is one of the great moviemakers ever as he is an artist.Maybe eccentric in some ways but making movies in a special way which you find today not much more, simple and clear, letting the viewer concentrate on the psyche and character of his movie characters without splitting them up in good and bad like light entertaining movies from Hollywood. This movie is another good example of giving us a view into different personalities and their different ways how to deal with life and death.The movie does leave it, like most Akira movies, to the viewer to make our own decision about the characters and their actions. Showing us like in different mirrors the light and shadow sides of our all psyche which we have in us and which we often prefer to deny even from ourselves.Ikiru makes this even clearer as it plays in a modern society instead of the old feudal Japan, which is too distant to most viewers.But the problems showed in the movie and the good and bad traits we can see in this movie are timeless as they show the whole facets of human emotions and traits and how we can grow beyond ourselves when we get confronted with certain situations. Showing without a lifted finger how a single individual can touch the life of others and set a shining example for bravery and determination.And like so many other movies of Akira does also Ikiru leaves the viewer behind with stirred-up emotions, making us once more clear to what positive or negative actions human beings are able to, leaving us with shame and pride at the same time and open the mind for asking ourselves what we often did good and bad in our life and how this decisions affected others.I can just highly recommend watching this movie and showing it also to teenagers to give them something to ponder about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you MUST see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru was my favorite Kurosawa film even before I saw it. I had read Roger Ebert?s wonderful commentary at his "The Great Movies" page and told myself many times that I must get it and never quite got around to it. I had purchased "Seven Samurai" and "Hidden Fortress" and found both of them delightful. The former is probably the greatest action movie ever made and the latter has scenes as intense as anything modern directors ever put on celluloid. But somehow while I figured Ikiru to be more my type of movie than any of the samurai flicks, I still held off buying it. I told myself many times to do so, and searched high and low for the DVD, but no American company is willing to come out with a version yet. I finally settled for having one shipped from China and as of this writing it has yet to arrive. Then I found out a co-worker is dying of cancer. Having read multiple reviews, searched for months for the DVD and visited almost every Kurosawa site out there, I felt comfortable recommending a movie I had never seen when I almost never recommend a movie to people at all. I immediately purchased a copy of the video and the afore-mentioned DVD from eBay; the video for him and the DVD for myself. I received the video last night, banished the wife and kids to bed and for the next three hours sat awed as the story of Watanabe?s life unfolded before me.  I could not have made a better choice. The story takes hold of you and you follow it and never want to let go. There are several slow spots that you have to work through, but that is the point of this movie. This is not a movie to check your brain at the door for. If you are looking for action and adventure with a plot you'll forget about when you try to tell your friends about it the next day, you are in the wrong place. If you want a deep movie that will make you think and re-examine your life then this is your ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extraordinary film about an ordinary man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IKIRU is a great film, and a universal one as well. It could translate to any society where there are individuals who live their lives in jobs that are meaningless, who have little personal joy, who don't really know how to enjoy the blessing of life that they have. They won't die homeless but they often die alone and unrecognized. The message of IKIRU is amazing in that it's about the difference one man can make without being preachy or contrived. Mr. Watanabe isn't a great man, nor is he a bad man. He is an ordinary man, undoubtedly drawn from real-life examples of Japanese government workers in the post-WWII era. The thing about his life is that everyone is comfortable with his state of being, until he finds out he's dying and sets out to fulfill a nearly-impossible building task. After that, no one, including him, is comfortable, and that splits between the people who think he's out of his mind and the people who realize that he is driven to make a positive difference before he dies.The most remarkable facet of IKIRU is that we get a sense of this division without seeing any truly evil characters. Mr. Watanabe's son is not likable, but we sense he's got more of a backstory with his often-absent father than we could suspect and don't just hate him (though he's most outspoken about refusing to try and understand what his father was thinking). And the transformation of this man, from a catatonic civil servant to a dynamo obsessed with change, does include an element of madness, albeit in a focused and positive form. And that made me have more respect for Mr. Watanabe than I ever could for someone who was the classic white knight figure. He fought through the barriers that had delineated his spare, safe life and really accomplished something. That's the lesson here, one that Akira Kurosawa presents without jumping up and down about it, and that makes IKIRU a timeless masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's overlooked masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Kurosawa was one of the best storytellers of the 20th century, appreciated by critics and audiences alike. Still, when mentioning his greatest achievements, most people place "Rashomon", "Ran" and "The Seven Samurai" as his most notable pieces. Only a few will remember this little film that has so much more significance than those others. "Ikiru" is a movie that can bring you to tears with very little manipulation. It's a movie you will not forget, a life lesson. It's a movie that will forever change how you think about movies. It is a social criticism. It is a discourse on bureaucracy. Improving on Rashomon's non-linear way of storytelling, this is a film that forces you to pay attention. There are no samurai fights here. There are no melodramatic dialogues where characters scream at the top of their lungs. There are no forced tears in the character's cheeks. This is a movie of very subtle, inner conflict, with a very simple premise: What would you do if you had three months to live? Kurosawa's answer is so devastatingly powerful, smart and original that it will change you forever. Or maybe, it won't, proving that the director's pessimistic view of humanity was correct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of Kurosawa's unique humanist approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a great fan of Kurosawa, and of Japanese cinema on the whole, Ikiru was a great find for me, rarely receiving the exposure of Seven Samurai, Rashomon et al (although they too are unique and defining films).The story of aging clerk Watanabe discovering he has cancer manages to be deeply moving without stooping to maudlin sentimentality, as is so common in Hollywood productions that deal with the same theme (just watch Terms of Endearment). Here it is a process of catharsism that leads him through the early days of hedonism to the enlightened finale where he justifies his life as a human being of worth.One of the defining post-war Japanese films along with the likes of Tokyo Story, it reflects a society amidst the turmoil of reconstruction, both politically and economically, and ultimately emotionally. The image of Watanabe on the swings is one of cinema's greatest moments, reflecting a poignancy that for me has become synonymous with the best of Japanese cinema, from Mizoguchi to Takeshi Kitano. A profound and personal film from the most renowned of Japanese directors.Anyone with a modicum of compassion and patience will recognise it for the masterpiece that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurosawa's symphony to the lived life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this wonderful film for only the second time in thirty-five years, I was reminded of how much it resembles Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich. Both stories are efforts to grapple with the the imminence of death when it finally arrives for a believably human person who touches us deeply because we so readily recognize our own weaknesses and strengths in his. Much in both stories can also be connected with theories on death developed later by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.Like most symphonies, the film can be divided into four movements: 1) Background and diagnosis, 2) Making up for the waste of the past I--a night on the town, 3) Making up for the waste of the past II--a pathetic infatuation, 4) Funeral scene and flashback on the building of the park. Ikiru is less about a corrupt and obstructionist "system" than about one man's struggle to achieve something memorable before he dies. Everything about this masterpiece is graced with a subtlety that is uniquely Japanese and uniquely Kurosawa's.The sad little infatuation of elderly bachelor Watanabe with a young former office underling is a superby honest appraisal of human nature on the parts of both characters. And the moment during the funeral when the committee of mothers arrive, kneel, and spend a minute in deep keening was one of the most wrenching emotional experiences I have ever received from a film.Takashi Shimura is so good an actor that watching him is like a form of meditation. Just looking at his photo on the funeral altar brought tears to my eyes. It is astonishing that this harmless-looking little man also played the role of the leader of the Seven Samurai!</fullReview>

Coming to this decision is a rocky road itself, as he turns to alcoholism and begins to stalk a young woman.Shimura's amazing performance can bring repulsion one moment and pity the next. He cuts off the personal space of a young woman and you can feel him sucking the life out of her. In other scenes, his frustrating passiveness wins your heart as you see where it may have come from.Ikiru is a a dark comedy as well, a sad social commentary of the red tape and bureaucracy of post-war Japan. Wantanbe eventually makes it his mission to press through this tape and turn a sewage ditch into a park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The affirmation of life through the exploration of death. A powerful film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ikiru" is a film that expresses itself through two separate parts. The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality, recalled by those whom he knew best.Kanji Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) is the protagonist of the story, a bureaucrat whose job provides him with little more than paper-shuffling and pen-pushing.The movie opens with an x-ray of Watanabe's stomach and the cancer that thrives within it. His doctor tells him he will die soon.Throughout the first half of the film, Watanabe stumbles about helplessly, remembering his life and trying to figure out what has come of it. He lives with his son, whose resentment for his own father has peaked over the years.Watanabe realizes no one in his life actually knows or loves him. He walks about in a permanent stupor of self-loathing. He embarks on a friendship with a younger female co-worker, but even she soon hates him and thinks he is "creepy." Towards the end of the film, Watanabe finally dies and the second half is the recounting of his final days by co-workers. We realize Watanabe's life changed drastically towards the end and he dedicated his final days to the construction of a playground for children.The Criterion DVD is excellent, and inside is an essay written by a Kurosawa biographer. He notes that the film is a study of existentialism and mirrors a few themes from Orson Welles' "Citizen Kane," which is true - I was very much reminded of Welles' film at certain moments throughout "Ikiru." Both films offer solid examinations of life and death and what propels the man stuck in between - in both cases the cruelties of life broke apart the men, leaving hollow shells where souls once existed. In Watanabe's case, his seeking of his own soul finally brings him to a state of contentment and inner satisfaction - his death is, at the beginning of the film, a lingering doom; and at the end a peaceful pact.This movie can change the way you look at life if you open your eyes. Kurosawa might have made better films but "Ikiru" is his most emotionally resonant and powerful that I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without denying Akira Kurosawa's greatness as a director, I can't help feeling that he would have accomplished more by saying less. There were any number of points in the latter part of the story when it could have, maybe even should have ended, and it managed to drone on with one bureaucrat after another opining on Watanabe's (Takashi Shimura) role in establishing the children's park in Kuroe. At least the payoff there was cleverly done; when all the administrators fell well under the influence of their Saki, it was at that point they were able to think clearly, and admire Watanabe's ability to work outside the system where protecting one's turf was the primary objective.What struck me most about the story was Kurosawa's acknowledgment of the strangling bureaucracy in government more than a half century ago. Apparently the Japanese were as well experienced in the matter as we here in America. The frustrating aspect of viewing the film today is that it's certainly gotten worse, made even more egregious by the polarization of ideologies among opposing political parties. How that vicious cycle gets resolved is anyone's guess.Undoubtedly there are many who will find Kurosawa's message about being worn down in a meaningless job as striking very close to home. It's only when Kenji Watanabe learns that he's dying of cancer that he's up to the task of finding something more meaningful in his life to extend his legacy. It was striking to see his son lament the fact that his father never told him about his condition, when it was at that point when Mitsuo excoriated his father for dallying with Toyo (Miki Ogadiri). An errant judgment that would create yet another misunderstanding between father and son.So once again, another brilliant treatment of the human condition by Kurosawa done to exquisite but time consuming effect. Although I felt the same with "Seven Samurai" and "Rashomon", but felt more appreciation for both of those films upon a second viewing. Unfortunately, I don't feel I would be up to the same task with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru, a film directed by Akira Kurosawa, is, in my opinion, one of the four or five best films ever made. The plot is so simple, it defies reason: Mr. Watanabe is dying of stomach cancer and only has a year to live.That's it. However his fellow workers from the city Waterworks Department including a newly employed young girl who'd become a fast friend with Mr. Watanabe during the last year of his life, each talk about him at his funeral - each telling a little of Mr. Watanabe's life, but none telling the entire story until we hear from the young girl. This part of the plot is like the nine blind men each telling a little bit about each part of an elephant - the tail, the trunk, the feet - they are all touching, but none telling the story of the elephant completely.However the theme - the story of his last year - the 'real' Mr. Watanabe comes to life as each individual describe the Mr. Watanabe they all know. The girl puts the last piece of the story together.Ikiru is quite slow moving and if you're use to car chase scenes and blood at guts, you will not find Ikiru exciting or interesting at all. But if you want to see life, Ikiru (To Live) and love, then you will be in tears at the end of this beautiful great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru, another strong work by master Akira Kurosawa (the samurai guy), is not without its weaknesses. There is some over-acting, particularly with Toyo, the young government employee with whom our protagonist Kanji Watanabe, played by Takashi Shimura, is infatuated. I also do not see a reason why the film requires the flashback narrative, but alas.The real enjoyment of the film comes in the form of the bureaucrats who debate the merits of Watanabe's accomplishments, starting with defensive rationalization for their own failures and morphing into humanistic realization of this fact, all the while placing the viewer in their shoes. These scenes have the feeling of Sidney Lumet's version of 12 Angry Men, which was originally written around the same time and released in theaters several years later. Much like the defendant in 12 Angry Men, I got the feeling the bureaucrats have put Watanabe on trial in a way. It is worth nothing that Lumet referred to Kurosawa as "the Beethoven of movie directors." Again, the comparisons between these two films are uncanny.While the movie is imperfect as noted, it gets 3.5 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deals With Cancer Admirably.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cancer is a tricky subject to tackle in art. It can be added shamelessly, or it can be used to reveal amazing depth of how an individual strives regardless of how severe the affliction. "Ikiru" (To Live) is an extremely admirable effort that quite possibly stands as my favourite Akira Kurosawa picture. It's sorrowful and unflinching, but it also keeps its hopes and optimisms dignified.Mr. Watanabe (Takashi Shimura) hasn't missed a day of work in his entire life. There he sits at his table with a never-ending mountain of paperwork to file, and his peers questioning his health and eating habits of late. A trip to the Doctor unfortunately reveals the worse, he has stomach cancer and not long to live. His uncaring family remains oblivious as Watanabe escapes into Tokyo's nightlife to find solace. There and along the way he meets the individuals that will see him make use of the remaining time he has.The pacing in "Ikiru" feels very well thought out and while the unique approach to the 3rd act has it's ups and downs, it still feels like something no one has attempted since. Takashi Shimura is absolutely wonderful. His face says it all when it comes to realising both the predicament he starts in, and his final thoughts and intentions. The main theme is a haunting and soft lullaby, whilst Kurosawa's camera-work is fearless in it's portrayal. That stunning minute of a man singing whilst on the swings will never leave my memories, and the great little subtleties like when the frame drops down a couple inches on an office worker and his stacks of paperwork is wonderful emphasis.Final Verdict: With ever passing year "Ikiru" feels more and more mature when I see it. I would happily revisit this film as often as possible, and it's another one of those timeless works where you look forward to growing old with it. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depressing, Long, and Boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed on DVD. Restoration = seven (7) stars. To say this is a film that "deep dives depression" would be an understatement. How to confront living with a terminal disease tied to the aftermath of nuclear fallout may have been especially relevant for Japanese audiences in the early 1950's. And profitable at the box-office. But when viewed today, the theme remains relevant, but it is obvious that the movie itself is depressing in it's conception and execution. In short, what we have here is a depiction of depression that is, well, depressing. The script and direction relentlessly milk the sad subject matter resulting in tedious monotony quickly followed by boredom. The film seems to come alive only after the protagonist has died (starting with the scenes at his wake). But by then, most viewers may be beyond the point of caring or long departed. To provide comedy relief (and to keep theater audiences in their seats?), the director has mixed in some hilarious depictions of the inherent dysfunction of contemporary, local-level bureaucracies. But the impact of these scenes is insufficient to prevent being buried under the unrelenting, repetitious plodding that depicts the depressing subject matter. All of this makes for a film that is much too long by half. (If cut back by starting with, say, the wake and using more flashbacks, it might be more tolerable and a bit better at holding the viewer's interest.) Restoration is adequate, but still a work in progress. Vertical wear lines appear through out the first half of the movie, and some scenes remain just too dark to see much of anything. Music is heard sporadically (the best accomplices the opening credits). The voice over is gratuitous (and distracting). Subtitles are fine and especially needed to decipher the muttering and slurred dialog delivered by the lead actor (Takashi Shimura). Sound stage "exteriors" look pretty phony. One take away: Humans are mortal; bureaucracies not so much. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ikiru - Doesn't quite live up to its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can't say I agree with critical acclaim for Ikiru, all critics seem to be in perfect unison that it's a masterpiece. Perhaps, but also a very tedious one.Yes I can appreciate the message about finding your meaning of life and making a difference etc but a film having a serious message doesn't mean it has to drag; Ikiru was very slow and rather long as well. Not a good combination. What cheered up the film a bit was the female lead, the girl from the office... Ikiru, imo, has only one great scene; The girl showing her emotions at the restaurant, her sheer disgust/pity was quite fascinating to watch. Other than that it was the sad puppy face and slumped shoulders of the protagonist for almost couple hours which sure is memorable but also one note acting.The wake scene, which consisted of almost last hour of the film, was some sort of critical social commentary on Japanese culture, way of thinking and bureaucracy - but also rather poor storytelling since it was hard for the viewer to relate to arguments by characters that had not really been introduced properly earlier in the film. More emotionally effective would have been to actually witness the protagonist perform his life altering bureaucratic heroics himself. Well, to be fair, Kurosawa actually did show some of it using flashbacks...It seems that Kurosawa has a fetish for flashbacks, as seen in "Rashomon" as well. Yet those scenes in Ikiru were pretty much protagonist merely nodding and begging in apologetic manner. I found that less than convincing way to get the job done... or to achieve a legacy for that matter. Oh well, at least they played Pachinko and visited a strip tease show. But couple breaks from tedium and the life altering philosophy just couldn't save the film from its slow pace, predictability and dare I say rather mediocre cinematography. I'll give it 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond the Veil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on Leo Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich", Akira Kurosawa's "Ikiru" stars Takashi Shimura as Kanji Watanabe, a middle-aged bureaucrat who discovers that he will soon die of cancer. Determined to indulge in pleasures he spent a lifetime avoiding, Kanji begins partying about town. Finding little joy in such self-centred activities, Kanji eventually decides to do something which he believes will give his life "meaning". As such, he embarks upon a quest to get a children's playground built where once lay a cesspool."Ikiru's" early scenes expertly convey the alienation and drudgery of an increasingly bureaucratic post-war Japan. People are consumed by monotonous work, countrymen wrestle with red tape, compassion is deemed an inconvenience, everyone's erecting personal barriers and Japan's state apparatus is sketched as a wholly dehumanising and indifferent thing.Like Tolstoy's tale, "Ikiru" then develops into a little philosophical parable. For both Tolstoy and Kurosawa, lives dedicated to self-interests are hollow and ultimately harmful. Their characters aren't only dying of medical ailments, but already dead - already living as dead - and so in desperate need of connection and so life. Both artists then recommend that such states of despair be assuaged with compassion, communal responsibility and service to others."Neither fear nor self-interest can convert the soul," theologian Bernard of Clairvaux once wrote. "Only charity can free man!" Unsurprisingly, Kurosawa identified as a radical when in his teens. Following the mass arrests of members of Japan's Communist Party in the late 1920s, he'd join the Proletarian Artists' League and was for years involved in illegal underground socialist organisations, even serving a brief stint in prison for his activities. Tolstoy was himself a bit of a Christian Socialist, and believed that society should be directed toward social-ethical ends. Today, of course, 21st century man's overriding stance is the opposite: individuals determine "ends", individuals must be given the "freedom" to pursue their own desires and self-interests, man is "nautrally selfish" and such "selfishness" ultimately works out for the good of everyone anyway. Such a stance is today not chiefly contested by the church or religion, but by science, post neo-classical economists and neurobiology. Here desires are seen to be inherited or imported, never originating from "authentic selves", and the societal rules and laws which foster individual "self-interests" are mostly not in either the individual's or group's best interests anyway. Studies into things like William's Syndrome, in which missing chromosomes cause patients to be ceaselessly friendly to everyone, even if such behaviour results in self-harm, likewise show that kindness has a genetic underpinning. In short, compassion, altruism and self-sacrifice often make selfish sense."The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society," Albert Einstein wrote decades ago, "but he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives progressively deteriorate. All human beings are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society." This tension between "accentuated drives" and "social needs" is conveyed well during "Ikiru's" final act. Here Kanji triumphs against the odds and successfully creates a children's playground. Now essentially a Frank Capra hero, Kanji finds himself exalted by co-workers and various politicians, all of whom promise to learn from Kanji and be more responsive to community needs. These promises are subverted by Kurosawa, who launches into a subplot in which these men slowly renege upon their resolutions. Whether these betrayals are due to something innate in human beings, to ideological forces, to Japan's whole mode of social organisation (characters constantly complain about "bogus democracy", Japan is clearly still under the thumb of US Imperial designs and civil services and public institutions are seen to be serving something other than common people), or whether Kurosawa believes collective actions as a method of social change always begin with almost militantly "individualistic" people anyway, is left ambiguous."Ikiru" boasts an interesting narrative structure. It opens with a shot of an X-ray, cancer eating a gut. From the diseased internal wirings of a man, we move outward to the workplace, where humans depressingly toil. The film then dips into an orgy of pleasures, sights, smells and sounds, "antidotes" to the workplace which Kurosawa swiftly deems unsatisfying lest shared. From here the film shifts from the personal, private and the interior to the social, communal and the exterior; Kanji launches a campaign to build a playground. Bizarrely, the film then dwells on the lives of Kanji's successors, who spend a long time cynically evaluating the "worth" of Kanji's life. These successors eventually decide to dedicate their lives to social causes, but find themselves unable to. The film then closes with Kanji, ghost-like, singing "Life is Short" whilst crying on the park swing he helped create.Interestingly shot and widely regarded as a masterpiece, "Ikiru" is also mercilessly unsubtle. Sentimental, cartoonish and heavy-handed, Kurosawa conveys every point and emotion with the grace of a sledgehammer. Takashi Shimura's sad-faced performance, overly emphatic, is also at times comically ridiculous. Other Kurosawa trademarks - screen wipes and a talkative narrator - seem unsuited to a film whose material demands restraint.8/10 ? See Zhang Yimou's "The Story of Qui Ju".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not only among Kurosawa's best but among the best ever made, indeed, in my top 25 film list. Kurosawa shoes not only that he knows how to do samurai films but also ordinary dramas set in the present day. Beating Ozu on his own game in the process. This masterpiece fully deserves a perfect score: 10/10.Some have called this film manipulative. Well, that's a bit unfair since every film that is not something made by Tarkovsky and Bergman's two most artsy titles, Persona and Seventh Seal, is indeed manipulative: take Grave of the Fireflies, for instance, that's a manipulative film all right, and it is also one of the greatest tear jerkers, like this one as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot afford the time to hate this movie - A timeless masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with Red Beard, Ikiru still stands amongst my all-time top favourite movie, and it has proved me wrong for underestimating classics just because of the fear of being outdated and dull as the movie is over 50 years old. The script, the acting, the direction, the cinematics..and...most importantly, its level of depth is equal to even the most thought-provoking movies of all time. Utterly deep, depressing, sentimental, but inspiring, positive and life-changing...as a classic they don't even need an epic sad music score or narration to deliver the message. Many movies emulated Ikiru in terms of the issue and involving older actors that somehow had their characters reminiscing some parts of their pasts that they regret, or looking towards the remainder parts of their lives with sentimentality, but none of these hit the spot as well as Ikiru did. I will never forget the main character's words, when he said 'i cannot afford time to hate people' it just forced my tears to flow right away..powerful! It deserves a 6 star! thank god for great Japanese films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Takashi Shimura is Watanabe, a man in late middle age who discovers, almost by accident, that he has stomach cancer that will kill him within a year. He can't stop it. What can he do with the time he has left? For thirty years he's worked in one of those Kafkaesque bureaucracies where everyone is buried in sheafs of papers. The shelves are full of binders and folders. The desks overflow with petitions. And when a citizen's committee of poor housewives show up to complain about a sewer in their neighborhood -- it smells terrible, the water tastes awful, it breeds mosquitoes, the children are sick -- they get shuffled from one minor bureaucrat to another, from the Parks Department to Pest Control to Sewage Disposal to the Transit Authority, until they wind up where they started. It's all meaningless and Watanabe, like everyone else, has been doing his best to keep it that way.And now he's faced with dissolution. He tells no one about it. His son and daughter-in-law, with whom he lives, treat him as part of the furniture and behind his back they whisper about how much money he might leave them some day. No good trying to tell them.So he stops going to the crowded office for a few days to think things over, and the first thing he decides to do is what I would do. He goes to a bar and falls in with a dissolute but sympathetic novelist who decides to introduce the old chap to la dolce vita. There are some whirligig scenes of Watanabe buying a ridiculously unbecoming hat, learning how to play pachinko, and getting drunk in jammed nightclubs.It only works for one night. The next day you have to start all over again -- and this time you're hung over. So he latches on to a young lady. She's far from beautiful but she's smart, vivacious, full of life, you might say, and he hopes to borrow a little of it. But by this time Watanabe, nicknamed "The Mummy" at work, is getting positively creepy with anxiety. His eyeballs are beginning to bulge with it. And despite his showering her with gifts and free lunches, she becomes both bored and scared and runs off.Well, Watanabe has found that self indulgence isn't the answer -- but what is? If there is any answer at all? He discovers something that will lend meaning to his remaining days. He goes back to work, rips into the petitions on his desk, strips away all the qualifications and rejections, and by dint of sheer persistence, even in the face of physical threat, he sees to it that the sewer those ladies from the citizens committee complained of is covered over and turned into a park with a playground for children.A narrator tells us that Watanabe has died and there is a very long (too long) sequence at his wake. When the "Big Shots" from the office feel they've spent enough time at the wake, they leave politely and promptly. The remainder, Watanabe's co-workers, get drunk and swear things will change from now on, now that Watanabe has set the example. But they don't change.Kurosawa was both writer and director of this 1952 film, and movies about fatal illnesses have to be treated very delicately otherwise they wind up like "Love Story." In these movies the elderly don't really need a fatal disease. It's understood that they won't be around long. "Old age," says Mr. Bernstein in "Citizen Kane", "it's the only disease you don't look forward to being cured of." Kurosawa does a good job of avoiding cheap sentiment. Ozu did at least as good a job in "Tokyo Story" without any flash. In American movies, the moribund tend to find whatever passes for an answer within themselves. In "Harry and Tonto," Harry loses Tonto but finds he's still capable of loving. In "Whose Life Is It Anyway," Richard Dreyfuss finds the strength to tell them to shut off the machine. But this is a Japanese movie. Instead of relying on inner strength, a final act of self actualization like John Wayne in "The Shootist," Watanabe finds the answer in a contribution to the community. His final determined act leads to self fulfillment but also promotes the general welfare. And he does it all with humility and politesse. He sits in waiting rooms for days. He knocks on the mayor's door timidly. He stands and holds his stupid hat while others ignore him. Yet he gets the job done in the end and it stands as a more enduring monument than the drunken praises of his mourners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Live - for there will be no tomorrow...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa's "Ikiru" ("to live") is a film - you might have guessed it - about life, or more precisely: about the absence of life. It's about that hole that suddenly emerges when our time inevitably draws to an end, that hole that we couldn't fill with meaning. For the old civil servant Kanji Watanabe (played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Takashi Shimura) it's a pretty big hole. He moved papers around for years and years in his stuffy office, got awards for the monotony he got used to, never questioned what he did and why, was satisfied with what he was and never got the idea to change. But he is ultimately alone when he understands that he will die soon. And as moments of his past flash before his eyes, the value of life hits Watanabe, and he needs to make a decision what to do with the little time he still got left..."Ikiru" shows us a struggle to escape the ways we are used to and to make the difference. Sounds familiar, right? But if it is kept real and is shot with less sentimental bombast than western productions unashamedly throw at us, then a downtrodden bureaucrat with a sudden fate inspired verve to make something happen turns into a hero. For Kurosawa this film was also a plead for individualism, especially when seen in the face of the Japanese society he lived in, where everybody played his role and life of the single man and woman became just inconveniences. Watanabe represents that flickering of hope, nothing more, but also nothing less, and his key moment occurs when he walks off with a plan, while teenagers celebrate one of their own with singing "Happy Birthday" in the background. But well, a single man won't change the world, and to fully appreciate life one needs to be almost dead. One can get a slight advantage by watching "Ikiru" though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kurasawa's most moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a great fan of Akira Kurasawa, Ikiru is not just Kurasawa's most moving film it is one of his very finest alongside Seven Samurai and Ran. It is as always beautifully made, sumptuous in look and the cinematography simple yet interesting. Kurasawa's direction is at its most delicate, making a story that could easily be mawkish and manipulative into a genuinely moving, powerful and quite inspiring one instead, and making us also care every step of the way for the dignified central character of Watanabe. Together with a hypnotic score, a thought-provoking script and a powerful, yet in a discreet and heart-wrenching way, lead performance from Takeshi Shimura, and you have a fantastic film.Overall, I can't praise Ikiru enough. Any complaints of how the final third is not as good as the rest of the movie is valid but I didn't care so much after being moved and inspired so much by the film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To leave and yet 'To Live'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Akira Kurosawa's brilliantly-directed films. Kanji, Chief of Public Affairs, is a hard-working man who spares no time for leisure throughout his career. He's a cagey, aging man who is the butt of jokes in his office. He gets diagnosed with cancer and that leaves him shell-shocked. The scene after he leaves the hospital is where Kurosawa's true direction comes into play. He has brilliantly shown a dejected, depressed Kanji walking in the streets, lost in oblivion. The sepulchral silence is interrupted by the honking of a truck and Kanji snaps back to reality. Kanji leaves his home trying to find the meaning of life. He enjoys all the earthly pleasures instead of succumbing to the fact that he would die soon. He doesn't let the cancer make him immobile and his brain quiescent. He approves a long-pending project of setting up a park that would improve the lives of the people living with poor sanitation facilities. He not only approves the project as the Chief of Public Affairs, but also makes sure every single department concerned with and involved in the project nod their heads for the project. He endures the pain and ensures work on the park is done and finally dies on a bench in the park. After his death, his co-workers and family members discuss how and what brought a change in the behavior of Kanji. They first assume he was unaware of the fact that he had cancer. But after detailed discussion and citing of instances, everyone agree he did know that he had cancer and yet fought for the betterment of the lives of slum-dwellers. They think better of him after his death and take him as an inspiration.The movie is verily the one that would make an impact on you, especially if you have someone in your family who succumbed to/survived cancer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Universal Ode to Life ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I hear the word "Ikiru", I see and I hear ?I see a haunting look engraved in Takashi Shimura's face, a penetrating sadness contemplating thirty years of a wasted life. This unforgettable face, these shocked eyes, these tense lips deadpan like a theatrical mask, is the tragicomic realization of the meaning of Life, and the meaninglessness of a life, the life of Kanji Watenebe, the hero? and what a hero!And I hear "Gondola no Uta", this beautiful ballad about the shortness of life and the soul of "Ikiru" as a drop of hope in an ocean of tearful despair, hardly audible in the hero's raspy voice, but whose effect is beautifully showed in a scene where people listen to him, silent, calm and solemn, like meditating on what has been done and even more, what should be done, before it's too late."Before it's too late indeed, "Ikiru" is oddly characterized by a slow pacing combined with a desperate sense of urgency. Kanji Watanabe in a veteran civil servant working in Tokyo's City Hall, but officiously, he's only one of the many links that constitute the post-war Japanese bureaucracy. A group of women come to complain about stagnant water in the neighborhood and the healthy risks; they go back and forth, from a Bureau to another. Kurosawa handles this part not without a certain humor, but it's only because it would make people laugh if it wasn't so tragic. This waste of time, of energy doesn't bother anyone until it affects one's life.The urgency conveys a more disturbing feeling of despair that can be summarized in one sentence: how can a man who wasted thirty years live his life to its fullest for six months. This question is even more disturbing when you think of the way Watanebe knew he was doomed. In a harrowing scene, one patient tells him that the worst omen is when the doctor allows you to eat whatever you want. How Kurosawa makes the viewer able to penetrate the very soul of the hero is a directorial stroke of genius and a tribute to his genius as a storyteller. Indeed, when Watenebe hears the same words from the doctor, we understand that these lies equals a sentence to death, indirectly mirroring the very lies that made Watenebe's life.His job was a lie; he never truly helped Tokyo citizens all he did was to press rubber stamps on documents to signify that their complaints were taken into account. His love for his son was a lie to convince his mind it was that reason that prevented him from getting married while his son never looked reactive to his father's love. The doom of death ironically provides the relieving blessing of a cathartic lucidity. Watenebe finally knows he wasted his life and Life is goddamn too valuable to be wasted. Two ambivalent feelings for two contradictory reactions: to drink sake despite the gastric cancer, as a "protest against his life" and to hide under a blanket, crying like a little boy. The heartbreaking moment showing his reluctance to kill himself is the illustration of a man who simply wants "Ikiru". And Kurosawa chronicles through his masterpiece, all the possible meanings of life, starting like an existentialist journey into Tokyo's post-war society. Watanebe tries to find comfort with the help of an intellectual who buys him a new hat, shows him Tokyo's nocturnal life with girls and music. But Watenebe doesn't find the answer yet. In a desperate attempt, he spends time with a joyful and full of life employee. He learns from her that he was nicknamed 'the mummy' in the office, and god when we see Shimura's face, again we know it would make us laugh if it wasn't so tragic. His look indeed incarnates the condition of someone who was indeed barely alive his whole life, and who, more than anything, was alone. The realization of loneliness finally occurs in a pivotal restaurant scene with the employee, when she reveals that she quited the City Hall to work in a toy manufacture, for a job in harmony with her state of mind. Watenebe incarnates this sinister world she finally got rid of, a face that gets more and more unaccommodating. She doesn't want to see him anymore, no one would, Watenebe understands that Death is loneliness, no colleagues, no friends, not even family. Watenebe realizes that he only and he can do something of his life, because if he's barely respected in his lifetime, it will be even worse after. How fitting that we hear 'Happy Birthday' in the background, as if Watenebe's rebirth was celebrated. The story finally takes off, the pacing gets faster as Watenebe decides that a park should be built in the wasteland before he dies. The next sequence is the very illustration of death's insolent effect: Watenebe is dead and the park is built. As witnesses of Watenebe's tormented soul, we know he is the craftsman of this miracle, but all the colleagues and the family members attending his funeral, underestimate Watenebe's role. A series of flashbacks illustrate Watenebe's hardship and inspiring determination to overcome the adversity of an oppressing bureaucracy, of crime syndicate, as he knew how to translate his doom into a force. Watenebe had nothing to lose anymore, except time. At the end of the sequence, the men finally come to the very conclusion we expected, and realized the heroism of Watenebe. Watenebe's whole life was about inaction, the first month was a reaction to a death sentence, and at the end, it was action. A man is only remembered for his actions, and Watenebe's life will forever be defined by this ultimate victory, incarnated by one of the most beautiful and poetic cinematic shots: Shiumura sitting on a swing under a freezing wind, singing 'Gondola no Uta' ...... a universal ode to life, just like Kurosawa's "Ikiru".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ust like, Bergman's Wild Strawberries, Kurosawa's Ikiru is a film about life. Constantly complex and thought-provoking, although simple at the same time; it tells a story about life's limits, how we perceive life and the fact that life is short and not to be wasted. Of all of films Kurosawa made, this is probably the one movie that works perfectly on an universal level, because at its core it is about one of the basic truths of life- death.In its starch and unforgiving black-and-white form the movie records the time of one man's life in such a beautiful and yes, colorful way, that by the time the final moments of the film play out, it will be very hard for anybody not to be touched. The film details the existential struggle of one ordinary man in his desperate search for purpose.Ikiru is a film that expresses itself in two separate parts. The first half is the exploration of a bitter man's death and the second half is an affirmation of life provided through the awareness of mortality, recalled by those whom he knew best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Akira Kurosawa's Greatest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru is a Japanese film co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film examines the struggles of a minor Tokyo bureaucrat and his final quest for meaning. It stars Takashi Shimura as in the bureaucrat named Kanji Watanabe together with Shinichi Himori,Haruo Tanaka, Minoru Chiaki,Bokuzen Hidari, and Kamatari Fujiwara.The film details the existential struggle of one ordinary man in his desperate search for purpose. Upon learning he has terminal stomach cancer, a low-level government bureaucrat leaves his job of thirty years without a word to find meaning in the year he has left to live. He is completely alone in the world -- his wife is dead, his son is practically estranged, and his co-workers (the people with whom he has more contact than any others) are little more than strangers. Rather than face a death alone in pathos, Shimura opts to make up for lost time by going to the bar (for the first time in his life), spending every last yen in his wallet and drinking himself to death. There he meets a black-clad artist (a Mephistopheles to his Faust) who leads him on a hellish (and darkly humorous) tour of the city after dark as the two crawl through every booze-soaked juke-joint in town (Kurosawa's classical training as a painter surfaces in this sequence; many critics have noted the striking similarity of the crowded dance hall scenes to the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch, (particularly Walpurgis Night). Realizing he has missed nothing, Shimura then sets his sight on a pretty young girl from the office to divert his attention from his looming mortality. Although the girl fails to serve as a lifebuoy, she does give him the inspiration to do something meaningful -- to leave a legacy, however small, that makes the world a better place.This is a well-acted and deeply moving humanist tale about a man facing his own mortality.As we get to view this movie,we get to relate to the main character in terms of our imperfections,humanity,mortality, and legacy as well as a person.The greatest achievement of this movie is definitely it will help us to probably get into self-introspection to assess how we have lived our own life not only when faced with the same situation with Shimura but probably right after watching this movie.Aside from being well-acted,it is superbly directed by Kurosawa.It may seem slow and draggy but nevertheless,I think that the film's pace was perfect since how one assessment of his life does not need to be hurried for it takes a while for a person to realize his own failures especially after living the same way and doing the same job for the last 30 years of his life.I believe that the director did it that way to move the viewer and make it realize that we are watching a compelling and powerful film about a person who realizes that his life was definitely not worth living and full of imperfection.Just like Shimura,we need to little by little realize that man's journey from darkness to some kind of light is not short road.In summary,I consider this Akira Kurosawa's greatest film and its message has stood the test of time even after more than six decades it was released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The quest for annihilation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My introduction to this movie occurred at a particularly poignant moment in my own life, so I believe it resonated deeper than I could have foreseen. It is a message that bridges the gap between despair and hope. The main character Watanabe, upon finding out he will be dying of stomach cancer (in a vague, clearly paternalistic way as far as the medical system is concerned), puts his life into perspective and struggles with how to proceed during his final days. This struggle is seen very viscerally during the night club scene, when everyone around him is dancing with reckless abandon, "living their lives", as it was, yet they do so without direct recognition of their own mortality. When the idea of death comes piercing through the night in the guise of the melancholic tune Watanabe sings, dancing stops and what is translated is how difficult it really is to enjoy life when its end becomes transparent.He is led through the maze of self-transformation, through the auspices of "a good Mephistopheles who seeks no reward," and the ever-empowering feminine presence, the Anima (in Jungian terms). He desperately seeks to adopt the persona of those who are not sentenced to a more imminent demise, turn them into an eternity-conferring selfobject. But, alas, it is not to be, but rather than admit defeat and wither into the grave as a defeated wretch to the whims of time, he builds upon the energy instilled in him, and in a poignant moment new consciousness is born as a group of adolescents sing "happy birthday" just as he is descending the staircase. The transcendence of his passing manifests through the retelling of his final days during his wake, he has managed to cheat death in remaining in the hearts and memories of the ones he left behind. His ultimate demise represents his knowledge of inevitable annihilation and rebirth, the never-ending cycle that besieges all living creatures; he, in essence, "fuses" with nature and allows himself to be reintegrated into it. The meaning of life is truly that it goes on, and you can in effect conquer death by understanding what lies behind life. And that is something Kurosawa did beautifully in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may change your life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies can and do have an impact on viewers but very few manage to truly change lives. 'Ikiru' is one of those rare cases. Kurosawa, best known for his epic period pieces and innovative action scenes, tackles a delicate subject with unfailing clarity.Without ever falling into cheap sensibility the movie focuses on a man who realizes how empty his life is. His inner struggle to grapple the idea of his incoming death and the resolution to persist on making a difference are all handled with great psychological realism and weaved beautifully with a social environment of wanton excitement. 'Ikiru' combines a very personal character driven narrative with a background of indifference that adds a greater thrust of dynamism to the relation between individual and society.Memorable scenes remain grounded on daily events, they are bits of everyday things made interesting by the camera lending them its magic. In some aspects the montage is akin to that of drama and there is an aura of impending tragedy throughout it all. The resolution is the only one possible and very bitter sweet.This is the kind of movie that makes people stop, feel and think. A masterpiece that reveals itself as such in every frame its true power becomes all more daunting as one reflects about it afterward. Perhaps more than changing lives 'Ikiru' provides an emotionally charged space in which to ponder on how people, no matter how average, can make a change both in themselves and on others.Few times has a title been more true, 'Ikiru' is not about dying. It is about living.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a discovery!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew TCM was running 26 of Kurosawa's films this month. I hoped to be able to stay awake last Tuesday, long enough to again watch Throne of Blood. I had TCM on as I was preparing to go out for dinner. I noticed this film Ikiru had just started. I had never heard of it, and I was not planning to watch it as I didn't have the three hours to invest. Or so I thought.I sat and watched the entire film. Why had I not heard of this before? The film was so fascinating, in so many ways. The director takes his time, and I never felt that the film was proceeding too slowly, or that any scene could have been cut or shortened.This is obviously a stylized film: the mountains of papers in the office, the excessively entrenched bureaucracy--everything was magnified and exaggerated. An example: there is an early scene in which the women from the neighborhood were attempting to find someone to help them, and they were shuffled from one office to the next. Then there is the scene in the doctor's waiting room, when a fellow-patient gives Mr. Watanabe his own diagnosis, and Mr. Watanabe's reaction is extreme. Momentarily, I expected this to become a farce or a black comedy, due to the exaggeration. It was all part of the style, and after seeing the whole film, I was amazed at what Kurosawa had accomplished. He extracted a touching drama from exaggeration and set-ups more typical of satire.I never did get to see Throne of Blood again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated piece from Kurosawa.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Akira Kurosawa, the Japanese director more famously known for his epic samurai stories, takes us into the depths of post-war Japan in this very human story of a government official who discovers he has terminal cancer and only six months to live. With this new found information, he decides to start living his life, something he neglected to do for the past thirty years when he never missed a day of work.As the story progresses, we learn more as to why our protagonist is in such a conservative state of mind. This, in turn, propels him to take up a crusade for the people of the city and help them and change their life for the better. This goes to show the most human side of Kurosawa we have ever seen. The character of Watanabe is handled very delicately, never condescending or preaching. He is simply a man who struggles with meaning and definition of his own life but wants to change that forever.It is in this context that Ikiru also has its failures. The final third act of this film is mostly a group of men sitting around talking about Watanabe while drinking plenty of sake and getting very drunk. TO me, this scene dragged on for way to long and was in fact mostly unnecessary. There were also some other scenes that didn't fit too well with the narrative, but they were far and few in between.So, to be honest, this is a real underrated treasure from Kurosawa. And even though it doesn't have the sheer willpower or amazement from his other works, this is definitely a testament to humans and the remarkable changes we can make by putting our mind to something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stunning cinematic work that leaves one ultimately feeling elated having shared time with such a character as Mr. Watanabe. I had heard about the scene on the swing prior to seeing the film. It is a beautiful transcendental scene all the more moving as we know he has already passed away. I think it is this reconnection with his character after learning of his death that causes the scene to have such emotional weight. That and the fact that he finally achieved something with his life, finally found some purpose. It could be crushingly sentimental in the wrong hands but Kurosawa floats the camera along past the climbing frame as the snow falls gracefully over Watanabe as he sings to himself in this fleeting moment of happiness. The film has many wonderful scenes but it is the actor Takashi Shimura who steals the show. He is such a presence throughout and dominates every scene. I love the way he moves. We can feel his anxiety, his stress, his illness. I had waited a long time to see this film. It went beyond my expectations. Due to a personal experience I connected with the plight of Watanabe and this made it all the more emotional. Quite beautiful. Interesting that Kurosawa ends the film in a negative way by saying that those who take the place of Watanabe simply fall back into their bureaucratic roles and fail to continue as he had done. They say something along the lines of his death should not be in vain, but by their inaction it is. He dies in vain but it makes Watanabe all the greater as being the one person who decided to change his dull life by doing something more. Stepping outside and seeing the day differently , the sunset, the city, nothing is the same to him. His impending death finally gives his life meaning so he no longer just simply exists. We are all guilty to some extent of this. He stops to smell the flowers and how wonderful they look and how sweet they smell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The truth is, in other words, Art!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I think I've devoted nearly half a day of my valuable time watching and re-watching this multi-layered masterpiece. One of its main messages to me is : what would I do in a similar position to the protagonist of the story? Most of us belong to the wage slave class and are in work roles utterly useless to the greater humanity, what would we do if told we had a few months to live (disregarding the fact that even 100 years/1200 months is an infinitesimal fraction of a geological eye-blink)?Watanabe-san is the buck-passing rubber-stamping Section Chief of the Public Affairs Dept. in City Hall, never having had a day off in 30 years until told (in a roundabout way) that he has terminal stomach cancer. He goes AWOL, does a little drinking and flirting and finally comes to the conclusion that he needs to leave something constructive behind him. It all unfolds in Kurosawa's usual inimitable fluid story-telling style ? he left behind a beautiful b&amp;w Japanese film languidly but constructively dealing with terminal illness that can still hook people in to this day. Favourite bits: In the bar where Watanabe-san mournfully groans out his requested song Life Is Brief to the suddenly electrified patrons ? and us; the stark contrast between him and his confused state and the young and healthy flibbertigibbet he spends a few days with; the flashbacks of him doggedly pursuing his pet project at City Hall; the culmination of everything on the playground swing at 11:00 pm on a snowy night. No good doing that here ? the park would be full of losers instead of winners like him.To the impatient I suppose it would be pretty slow at times, but in the hands of this particular Master I wouldn't have minded it lasting another hour. Beautiful, poignant, elegant, thoughtful, wistful, powerful ? and imho not Kurosawa's best either! In other words, a film other directors would die for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most summaries of this film fail to mention its savage indictment of the hierarchical, hidebound, and bureaucratic nature of Japanese society. (A manage, awaiting promotion, is reminded that he has to wait for several other managers to die.) It is this bureaucracy that has made Watanabe into a useless drone; in earlier life, he had energy and hopes. At the end of the film, officials at his funeral argue about who should get credit for the park; it is only the common people who understand that Watanabe made it happen.There are memorable images in the film. The opening sequence of the bureaucratic runaround is brilliant, with the Department of Pest Control being shown as a man with a flyswatter. And, in the restaurant, when Mr Watanabe, having realized how he can at last live, staggers downstairs, a chorus of young women above sing "Happy Birthday"; of course, they are singing to a young friend coming upstairs into the shot. The film's final shot has (a resurrected?) Watanabe looking down (from Heaven?) with satisfaction at the completed park.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The majority of film directors seem to have more trouble getting to grip with directing emotion than they do with acting, and often ability to convey poignancy is a sign of a director's maturity. Kurosawa however fully developed the emotional content of his pictures with Ikiru before he became a fully fledged master of the action genre with 1954's Seven Samurai.Ikiru is one of many great films in which an at-first-glance dull, faceless character is humanised and made sympathetic. Similar examples include William Wyler's Dodsworth, in which Walter Huston's ageing factory owner is rejuvenated by romance, and of course Welles' Citizen Kane, which also resembles Ikiru due to its flashback structure. These films set themselves monumental tasks, but they end up all the more powerful for the depth they give to apparently shallow characters. Ikiru sets up this conundrum from the start, announcing the dowdy bureaucrat as "our hero" and informing the audience that "whatever we say about him now would be dreary" but that soon he will really begin to live.Kurosawa, who co-scripted all his films, created one of his most finely crafted stories with Ikiru. By showing us early on flashbacks of Watanabe's disintegrating relationship with his son Mitsuo, the audience is emotionally drawn into his life. What really works though is Kurosawa's ability to construct scenes and shots with such respect for both subject and audience. He is of course aided greatly here by what must surely be a career best performance from Takashi Shimura.Sometimes na?ve viewers dismiss Kurosawa as a sappy sentimentalist, and even some of his fans dislike Ikiru for similar reasons. But these people are missing the significance, not to mention the skill involved in making a work of sentimentality. It's true that Kurosawa would overdo his humane touch years later with Red Beard, but Ikiru is note perfect, and the sentimental side of the plot is nicely ballanced out by the satirical comedy on bureaucracy.For the final word, as with so many Kurosawa films Ikiru ends with a simple yet brilliant image of optimism. We finish with two children playing on swings in the playground; they jump off when their mother calls them indoors, and Kurosawa holds for a few more seconds on the swings going back and forth ? an apt and poignant metaphor for an individual's work living on after they have died.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is unfortunate that Japanese television calls to mind overly elaborate mecha battles and bizarre scenes of tentacle monsters, for this film portrays an altogether different side of Japanese cinema. It tells the simple tale of a dying man, Watanabe, and how he reacts to the news of terminal stomach cancer over the course of several months. Despite its serious premise, Ikiru balances sorrow with clever touches of humor, such as an early scene demonstrating effectively the bureaucracy at which Watanabe works. Those expecting the rapid and action-packed style of modern films will no doubt find it slow and even ponderous at points, but I believe it hearkens back effectively to the days before movies driven fancy special effects and action at every turn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give the movie a 12 of 10. I feel "the power of movies" from it.From the runarounds scene in the beginning, I had an anticipation of a very exciting movie. The runarounds look exaggerated, but each of the excuses officials make when they forward a petition to other section is well considered and compelling. You can imagine the background where the lead character Watanabe, acted by Shimura Takashi, had been promoted to the section manager with his belief of "Do nothing".The plot is simple and clear. No discrepancy. And great sense of humor throughout the movie. Yet, the theme is very serious. In fact, the narrator says, "In his life, nothing has ever been more serious than his acts in this period", and the audiences get drown seriously. The performance of Odagiri Miki as Watanabe's young female subordinate shines. It is compelling that Watanabe badly wanted to be with her, and that he was eventually inspired to rise up. The performance through the expressions of Odagiri and Shimura is outstanding. Since he is convinced he had a cancer, He confesses "I see nothing but darkness ahead of me. I struggle and run amok, still I have nothing to grab. I see only you", with joyful background music. "Before I die, even only a day, I want to do something, which I don't know yet". But after a while he says, "I can do something, something I can ...". It looks as if Shimura is watching straight at his own death, rather than acting. Then, he stands up determined when another group of people sing "Happy Birthday" as if they congratulate him.The long scene of lyke-wake is impressive too. In the beginning people ignore Watanabe's contribution when the city office changed a ditch to a children's play-park. But after the Deputy Mayor leaves, gradually people recognize that Watanabe was the primary driving force of the project, and eventually all of pledge to become true civil servants. The screenplay of this process is so well organized that it reminds "12 Angry Men".But the next day, no one dares to keep the decision, and they return to ordinary life of languish officers. Only the youngest officer, Kimura, acted by Himori Shin-ichi, is different. The spirit of Watanabe left in him though not visibly. He stops by the park and watches the children playing in the park. Every time he feels defeated in the city office, he will visit the park.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film takes a different path from other classic Kurosawa's films. It sets in modern daily life instead of ancient Japan. But it deeply touches my heart, prompting me to reflect on my lifestyle.I have recently written an article about "Ikiru" for a church's magazine. The first half is truly amazing. I was initially bored by the second half. But after some deep reflections, the second half actually vaults "Ikiru" into the ranks of classics. It does not only criticize bureaucracy, but it tells us that a meaningful life is not based on other people's praises and recognitions. Only one worker among Watanabe's colleagues appreciate his work and spirit. Regardless, Watanabe experiences fulfillment and joy even without any appreciations.We often wish to be glorified when we accomplish great tasks. But "Ikiru" teaches the opposite. We really live when we enrich life albeit one individual or a small community. Kurosawa calls us to serve people selflessly without seeking personal glory in the second half. Meanwhile, bureaucracy will continue to swarm and swallow people.I do not think that "Ikiru" is about life and death. Rather, "Ikiru" discusses how we live meaningful lives every day. Watanabe's terminal cancer motivates him to search a meaning for his life. I hope that "Ikiru", instead of death, prompts us to discover our lives' goals."Ikiru" deserves to be one of Kurosawa's classic or even a classic or all time. When I reflect on the movie, my tears of admiration drop every time. I purchased the Criterion Edition shortly after I had viewed it in rental. It has become one of my favourite films in my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"An emotional journey with Takashi Shimura"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ikiru is a classic piece of cinema about a man who starts "to live" when he finds out that his days are soon over, directed by non other than the great Akira Kurosawa."Ikiru" is a tragedy about a man named Kanji Watanabe (Shimura), who works as a bureaucrat. Kanji spends his whole working life doing nothing, just like his colleagues, and finds out one day that he has stomach cancer and will die in few days. Knowing that life will end very soon, he tries to live."Ikiru" is very radical in its style of narrative, for its time. The film starts with a third person narrative, that tell us about the character's situation, It simplify the story, so we don't have too use to much time, or put too much effort, to get into the protagonist's dilemma. Another example is a scene where we see how the officers reply the people who come in with questions and complaints. The scenes are shot in a very "documentary" sort of way, where it looks like that the officers are replying to the same question, a technique later used in documentary shows.The plot of the film is new for it's time, and starts right on the subject. The script is a bit confusing though, because the story focus on the character, and then goes to the world he is living in, where it makes you think that it changed it's focus to the "system", on the society, and not this particular individual, and then it comes back to the protagonist. It gives the character more dept and makes him more real, that makes sense, until a part of the film ,where it jumps back to the society again. Other than that, the sequences are set chronologically in order , with a few flashbacks that gives the protagonist, and other characters a lot of development. It gives us a better understanding of relationships between the individual characters.The cinematography, and usage of the camera gives a lot development and dept to the protagonist, and his situation. Throughout the film there are several close-ups, and extreme-close-up-shots, of Kanji. Showing us his facial expression, that shows depression, emptiness, illness, loneliness, and delivers an overall tragic feel. An example is during a conversation with a female colleague at a restaurant. The film also have a scene, just after he finds out about his illness, where shots fades into each other to create a disturbed atmosphere, this effect is used by other directors in later films, an example is the opening scene of 1980s, "Tetsou" by Shinya Tsukamoto. The flashback scenes are very clear, again thanks to the cinematography, where the picture dissolve to the flashback, Visually the story is easy to follow.Most of the characters in this film are " types ", instead of individuals, for example you got the "happy girl", "the mean boss", "the selfish son" , and so on. The characters are developed in a very "Henrik Ibsen" sort of way (a famous Scandinavian dramatist). The actors portrayed the roles very well, but the only well developed character is the protagonist. Takashi Shimura, who portrays Kanji Watanabe, menages to express Kanji's feelings through facial expressions. Because the character itself talks very unclear. That gives us a disturbing feeling of, that this man can't express his pain. The character is so real, that we actually sympathize with him. Antoher impressive thing with his character is how he develops through the film. Everything from his voice to his ability to talk, gives us an view of his condition. Shimura's acting was also appreciated internationally, and he was nominated for BAFTA award for best foreign actor (1952). The cast of this film is seen in almost every Kurosawa film, to name up a few examples : Seiji Miyaguchi, Minoru Chiaki, Daisuke Kato, Isao Kimura, Katamari Fujiwara, Takashi Shimura etc., but their roles are very different from the other films, that underlines their versatility, and is maybe the reason why Kurosawa works with them frequently.The setting is very different from Kurosawa's atmospheric samurai films, that made him so famous. The story is set in a "westernized" Tokyo. Everything from the characters's clothes and hairstyles, to the music they listen to, and the clubs they go to, is pretty western. An example is a scene, where Kanji, visits a club, the girls are wearing western skirts, are listening to jazz, and dancing in a way like they did in the US, back in the 50s. In a early interview with Kurosawa, he mentioned that one of his autheurs in his films are "the theme itself" ( Ref. "Reading A Japanese Film: Cinema In Contex", by Keiko I.McDonald ). A question, that "Why can't people live happy together"?. He claimed that this question is raised in all of his films, there are "places", in this film as well, where this question is raised, an example on that is, the relationship between Kanji, and his son.Overall the film offers some wonderful effects, and great performances, and an interesting plot, on the contrary side, the focus of the film is a bit unclear, what or who, it is about. The protagonist or the society he is living in?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent, masterful, unjustly neglected work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magnificent, masterful, unjustly neglected work on a subject that all thoughtful people will face sometime in their lives. (Yes, everyone will die, but how many truly face that reality?) And for those who have not given too much time to contemplating their life, how they will not live forever, what they have done to date with their lives, what things they may want to accomplish before dying, this film may spur on such thinking. While the details of "modern Japan" depicted in the film are from around 50 years ago, the content and message are just as relevant for today's audience. Perhaps more relevant than ever. This is NOT a "feel good" film. There is no Hollywood happy ending, no easy resolution of the conflict portrayed. The director and prime author, Akira Kurosawa, is very passionate about how people need to wake up and get out of the ruts they have fallen into and perhaps have followed for decades. He also is astute to the limitations people may have or have set up for themselves, how such limitations blind them to what goes on around them, how becoming more aware of such things and of possibilities outside their limitations can be so painful and hard to grasp, and, sadly, how often they are not grasped or acted on at all. Real life is on display in this film. The film is structured as a two part invention with a coda, to borrow musical terms. Both parts deal with discovery. The first part, besides introducing almost all the characters and setting up the plot mechanics (very economically done!), shows how the protagonist, a long time city government employee and low level manager, comes to realize (indirectly!) that he doesn't have long to live, shows how he (in several, painful missteps and poor communication) comes to terms with the situation, and what he decides to do with the remaining time left. This part is lively, bounces around from scene to scene, jarring the viewer with new scenes, situations and points of view that keeps one concentrating on what comes next. They are filled with irony. With so much activity occurring in the moment, the viewer is not given time to get caught up in bathos or maudlin sentiments. The second part reveals the Japanese way for reflecting on the life of "the recently departed." It is very regimented with the most important people positioned closest to the memorial, with those of lower status trailing away from it. It is typical for the comments about the deceased to be cool, measured, not completely laudatory at first. After a few drinks of sake, when people loosen up and become less inhibited, praise for the individual begins to appear, then take over the talk or conversation. It is in this setting, with these rituals and conventions in mores, where Kurosawa's sense of irony and rage (outrage?) are ratcheted up further. For all of them are trying in their own way to understand what the protagonist accomplished and what was his motivation. He had become a mystery to them during his last months of life and want to solve that mystery, especially after the citizens of the district - whose focus was the deceased's last public act - enter to pay their respects. (It is an amazing scene to behold, which must be seen, savored and internalized.) The viewer wants to know what happened as well. Stories are told (and acted out for the viewer) which demonstrate that what was said early in the wake clearly did not do justice to deceased. This section is much more static, and greatly, subtly depends on what the viewer has seen in the first part. The coda shows who understands the mystery and reveals how life can be so frustrating and miserable along with its possibilities. The irony and rage are at their highest fever pitch in these few short final scenes. Within this structure and plot, Kurosawa is able to touch on many aspects basic to modern life. They include: office politics, social status, the generation gap, poor communication, youthful aspirations, parental aspirations, gossip, children living at home, group dynamics. In addition, he shows specifics of Japanese culture of the early 1950's: American influence (music, shows, though no Americans are seen in the film), third world medical practices, wakes, proper gestures and bowing, etc. All these aspects are shown in context, are not unduly emphasized, and make their nonchalant contribution to the plot. Viewing the film with these in mind becomes a richer experience. By making this film, Kurosawa shows how the world could be altered and made better, that the status quo can be overcome. Yet it also shows, when someone embodies such attitudes in his/her life, how they can be so easily misunderstood and, worse, readily ignored by others. It demonstrates how so much effort is often required to accomplish so little in return. Life as it is has never been portrayed any better than in this marvelous, extraordinary film. Quite simply, it is the greatest film ever made. Technical notes: This film was made in 1952 by Toho and it shows in the poor sound quality (the shot of the protagonist heading home from the doctor's office being a special, wonderful exception), the shakiness of certain images, and the overall wear of the print. The negative for the film does not exist; it was destroyed in a fire. The film cries out for restoration, but it would be a costly undertaking. The film is 141 minutes long on the video, not 143 as printed. The English subtitles on the video are from the 1960 Brandon Films release. They need to be revised: there are some scenes where important information is not translated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even if you got decades, you cannot live a true life without cause and effort. However, only a few months is long enough for who is awake to the fact. That is strong and obvious theme of this forever masterpiece Ikiru, so I guess nobody wise enough to see the film will miss the message from Kurosawa. And warm, sincere view to Watanabe keeps the movie from being preachy. This is the most earnest love song to the human life and will.But never forget the challenge from Kurosawa to us. Near the ending of the movie, almost all bureaucrats who praised noble will of Watanabe at his funeral, turned back to lifeless, daily ostrichism. Only a young man found the hypocrisy and stood in anger, however, he could not be brave to point their hypocrisy, so sat again silently.You see? Getting the message is far from enough. Just act, or at least try to act, not to waste your precious life. Let's live truly.</fullReview>

For people who have trouble appreciating the pace, this is how a professor once explained it to me: When you're watching a football game on TV, often they will do instant replays in slow motion so that you have time to examine the action. Think of the slow pace of Japanese theater (and film) in that way. Don't just sit there thinking it's slow and boring, try to take advantage of the time they give you to examine and reflect on the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, but not the pinnacle...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film, though extremely slow. There are no real spoilers: the film is told in two parts and we understand that the protagonist is going to die within the first few minutes.Takeshi Shimura is pretty good as the reserved protagonist. Perhaps something of a character actor, his demeanor works well here. Kurosawa actually hired the same acting company for most of his well-known films from this period, so you'll see all the familiar faces from Seven Samurai, Rashomon, The Lower Depths, The Bad Sleep Well, etc.The film relies quite a bit upon the ability of the actors and actresses above all else. Much of the film takes place upon a couple of sets. The only problem here, as one reviewer pointed out, is that few people will be willing to sit through a long movie about an old man who gets stomach cancer. Especially when they already know the ending from the beginning! But still, this is classic polemic yet heart-warming Kurosawa. A little long-winded, but certainly relevant. Watch it if you got the time or are a bad guy with an icy heart.</fullReview>

After the central character dies, it drags on for nearly an hour. As is usually the case with Kurosawa, he has his cast engage in theatrical acting. Perpetually wide-eyed and depressed, Shimura mumbles his lines while barely opening his mouth or moving his lips. It's a one-dimensional performance that saps the film of whatever potential it had. On the other hand, Odagiri is charming as a young lady who's everything Shimura is not: good-humored and spirited, enjoying life to the fullest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ikiru" or "To Live"This is one of the Japanese dramas that helped define the genre and reinforced the Japanese cinema's focus on the human side of the plot with deep well-written characters one can't help but relate to. As the title might hint, Akira kurosawa tried to present his approach to life and how one should strive to live it. We follow the main character, Mr. Shimura as his life is completely subverted when he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.One of the most remarkable aspects of the protagonists performance (Kanji Watanabe) were his facial expressions. as the dialogue was kind of simplistic at times, the director relied on the actor's facial expressions to convey how he felt about the cornucopia of events taking place. Coupled with relatively interesting editing, these still expressions seemed to stick with the viewer for long after the scene is over. The sets were varied and enabled to characters to evolve by interacting with various elements of their environments. Personally, I found the music to be mostly gloomy which is in perfect accord with the movie's general mood.This is what usually call a "thought-provoking" movie, which might suitable for older audiences as they're more aware of the issues at hand and can, hence, appreciate the messages beyond.In a nutshell, This movie aims at changing the viewer's perspective and approach to life and the way it should be lived. And I think it succeeded to a certain extent, as it will certainly leave you pondering long after the ending credits roll up.</fullReview>

He has slowly climbed up the ladder by doing nothing and therefore doing nothing wrong. He discovers that he has stomach cancer and probably only six months to live. He is lost. He doesn't go to work and takes out his life savings. His son is shocked. He spends a wild night with a writer but he feels empty. He spends some time with a young exuberant female staffer. Eventually he decides to make a difference through his work.This is a movie that makes one think about one's own life. It is a compelling everyman movie. The last third isn't quite as compelling without Kanji. That part does have a point to make but it could have been done in a shorter way. This is a Kurosawa classic and an important one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ikiru" is a drama movie in which we watch a man tries to find a meaning in his life after he discovers that he has terminal cancer on stomach. Also we watch him had some problems with his family and he as unable to talk to them. After his death and especially in his funeral we watch his co - workers discuss his behavior over the last several months and debate if he knew that he had cancer or not and if he had maybe that it was something that changed his perspective of many things.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found very innovative for those times and also very different from these that Akira Kurosawa used us to expect from him. The direction of this movie was made from the master Akira Kurosawa and it was simply breathtaking. I also liked the interpretation of Takashi Shimura who played as Kanji Watanabe and he was simply outstanding on it.Finally I believe that "Ikiru" is a must see movie because it shows and represents many things according to family and an illness and how this influence a person. Also it shows us how this influences not only the person that has this illness but also his family, friends and people in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bureaucrat (Takashi Shimura) tries to find a meaning in his life after he discovers he has terminal cancer.The script was partly inspired by Leo Tolstoy's 1886 novella "The Death of Ivan Ilyich", although the plots are not similar beyond the common theme of a bureaucrat struggling with a terminal illness. Though it is an important message, that it is important to reflect. In some ways, this film is the precursor for Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" (1957).Roger Ebert believed this was Kurosawa's greatest film. "Over the years I have seen Ikiru every five years or so, and each time it has moved me, and made me think. And the older I get, the less Watanabe seems like a pathetic old man, and the more he seems like every one of us." Indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Effective &amp; Memorable Look At A Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Ikiru" is interesting and effective, and quite a change of pace from Kurosawa's action movies. (Of course, most of his samurai films were made later than this one, but it's almost impossible not to think of them whenever you watch one of his other movies.) It's long, and sometimes quite slow, but there isn't a minute of it that doesn't have a purpose.Takashi Shimura is memorable as the seriously ill Watanabe. His distinctive performance might take a short while to get used to, but he has many effective ways of getting across what is going on inside as Watanabe searches desperately for something worthwhile. It nicely combines the natural need for a meaning in life with the common frustrations that we all have with bureaucracy ("in some districts, just to empty a trash bin requires enough forms to fill the bin") and other tedious aspects of life. Kurosawa himself gives the story plenty of good touches, most of all in his interesting approach to the last half, with everyone debating what Watanabe has done. It brings out a lot of interesting things in the characters that are worth thinking about.Just a thought: it's interesting to compare this with Bergman's "Wild Strawberries". They are very different, of course, both in approach and content. But in both cases a great director gives us a thoughtful look at a leading character as he tries to figure out what his life has been about. In any case, "Ikiru" is an effective and memorable look at a life. It also shows that Kurosawa's skills work just as well in something quite different from his more action-oriented movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ikiru</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Akira Kurosawa (Seven Samurai), I read a short description about this film after seeing it being featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it certainly sounded like a worthwhile watch. Basically set in post-war Tokyo, Japan, longtime bureaucrat Kanji Watanabe (BAFTA nominated Takashi Shimura) works in a city and spends his whole working life doing nothing at all, just like his other office colleagues. Then one day he goes to the doctors who tell him has a tumour, and after hearing about the consequences of terminal cancer, he is sure this is what he has, stomach cancer, and he is slowly dying. With this looming over him Watanabe wants to find some meaning in the time has left, less than a year, but he is unable to talk to his family, and is unfulfilled spending a night with a novelist. Next has a chance encounter with one of his female fellow office workers, and this encourages him to make a change in the office work ethic, but actually doing something and doing it efficiently. After having some happiness with this woman and making some difference to the bureaucracy, Watanabe does indeed die, and his fellow workers debate about what he did before his death and why, but they resolve to be like him. Also starring Nobuo Kaneko as Mitsuo Watanabe - Kanji's Son, Kyôko Seki as Kazue Watanabe - Mitsuo's Wife, Makoto Kobori as Kiichi Watanabe - Kanji's Brother and Kumeko Urabe as Tatsu Watanabe - Kiichi's Wife. Shimura gives a credible performance as the old man struggling to go on with any kind of regular life with the thought of death, but finding some resolution, and the story in many parts is indeed moving and certainly doesn't disappoint you with you how you feel for the lead character, certainly a must see foreign language drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru (1952) **** (out of 4) A man (Takaski Shimura) without a life finds out he's going to die of stomach cancer, which causes a big shakeup in his lifeless world. He becomes friends with two people, one who helps him enjoy a little of life and the other someone who teaches him about leaving a legacy. So far this is my favorite Akira Kurosawa film, just ahead of Rashomon. This was an extremely powerful film about life and death that asks a lot of questions and for the most part it tried to give simple answers. There were countless powerful scenes with masterful direction and a brilliant performance by Shimura but the highlight would have to be the singing during the party scene. This was one of the most haunting, beautiful and magical scenes I've ever seen. Another great moment, showing the fear of death, takes place early on in the doctor's office as another character explains the pain that the man will eventually start to suffer. Another interesting and effective move comes in the change of storytelling with an hour left to go in the film. I wasn't quite sure if this move was going to work or not but the director pulled it off quite nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the centre of "Ikiru" are the massive issue of mortality and the thoughtful, poignant performance by Takashi Shimura, but Kurosawa's direction also managed to find moments of humour in the oddest places. The wake sequence is brilliant in the way it gets laughs both sad and pure out of drunkenness and bad logic, satirises bureaucracy and its servants, and also lets us think about the meaning of life, whether a wasted life can secure a legacy by attempting to redeem itself near the end, and whether those attempts at redemption, if successful, actually qualify a life as meaningful.The film could perhaps do without so much of the voice-over, which at times explains things a little too much, but that's a small complaint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ikiru is a film about life and death. It told through our hero Kanji Watanabe who is a symbol of people who work in a jaded office. I believe everyone who is not happy with his job will identify himself with Watanabe. Ikiru shows us no matter how boring our job or how meaningless and loveless our lives are, we should live a good life and make good changes in our lives long before we consider the day we die. I do not believe Watanabe is particularly boring or a "mummy" since his friends and his children do not seem to love him. That is why he is feeling outcast and he can not identify himself with his environment.Ikiru also tells us about the dis-functionality of bureaucracy. After Watanabe learns that he has six months, he not only tries to change his thirty-year life, but also the mechanism of the things at the office. This makes Watanabe a hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated, but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would rate this movie as above average, but not nearly the masterpiece that most other reviewers here see it as.**SPOILER WARNING**Plot Synopsis:A man who's life is perfectly routine and without passion finds out he has a terminal disease. Distractions, such as drink and women are unsatisfactory, so he throws his remaining energy towards a selfless act. Posthumously, his endurance and accomplishment are an inspiration to his former colleagues in a Kafkaesque bureaucracy.Analysis:On the whole, the acting in this movie is superb, with the exception of the protagonist, who constantly overacts, with his haunted, wide-eyed look that quickly becomes monotonous after the first dozen or so close-ups. However, there are some effective scenes, such as his newfound girlfriend's boredom and revulsion at Watanabe's pathetic, desperate attachment. His former colleagues are also impressive in their admiration for the deceased.The plot itself is also a mixture of successes and disappointments. Watanabe's realization of the meaninglessness of his life is presented too suddenly. Finding out that one has a terminal illness is certainly a shock. Still, I believe it would have been more effective to show the emptyness of Watanabe's life gradually dawning on him as he attempted to live it his routine way, rather than immediately running off to seek to live it more fully.However, Watanabe's disillusion with hedonism is effective and essential. Hedonism only leads to the repetition and boredom that mirrors too closely his earlier life. Watanabe buys company, but it is empty of genuine human affection: the women he is with are only interested in his money.Watanabe's attempt to live vicariously through a younger, vivacious woman is also convincing, as is her quickly growing tired of a brooding man likely twice her age.The most unsatisfactory parts of the movie come in the second half of the film, following Watanabe's decision to redeem his life through selfless service. In order for him to succeed several artificial contrivances are necessary which wind up detracting from the effectiveness of the film.Watanabe is fortunate to be in a position where he can be effective. A mere clerk certainly could not have accomplished the creation of a park. As a clerk would Watanabe have been satisfied with being responsible for the installation of just a bench, or a trashcan instead of the park? The park, though relatively modest, is still a contrived contingency for effectiveness of the redemption through service solution.Further contingencies are Watanabe's superior's eventual yielding to pressure, and the gangster's deferance to a man who has nothing to lose. Both are unconvincing.A final note should be made in comparing this film to another movie that treats similar themes of existential meaning, Groundhog Day. Both films avoid the real reprecussions and the ultimately unsatisfactory answers that their protagonists come up with by ending the movie immediately after the answer is proposed.In Groundhog Day Bill Murray is redeemed through love and caring for others, and the film immediately ends. However, had he gone through as many repetitions of his caring, selfless days as he had days to learn to play the piano or throw cards in to a hat he would likely find his answer unsatisfactory. Likewise, the reality of being married is also sidestepped by immediately ending the film.In a similar way, the park that is built by Watanabe is a fantasy park, which is really left unexamined by immediately ending the movie. Furthermore, selflessly devoting one's life to the service of others fails as an antidote to the meaninglessness of one's own life, because one is just passing the buck. Essentially, one is saying that someone else can do better with the life you give them than you can. This is not at all clear.Weaknesses like these are the sorts of things many Hollywood movies are guilty of. They pull punches in order to create an inspiring and uplifting film. These weaknesses are also what seperate this film from masterpieces worthy of the designation such as works by Kafka and Ingmar Bergman. At their best, the latter do not pull punches. Kurosawa, of course, has his own masterpiece, which I find much more mature than Ikiru. Namely, Ran. Of course, since Ran was based on King Lear, Shakespear must be given some credit.Still, there are some admirably realistic scenes even in the second half of Ikiru. Watanabe's superiors are hypocritical and self-serving in their robbing Watanabe of credit for the park. And despite Watanabe's colleagues' inebriated, freverent pledges to work as hard as he, in emulation they quickly fall back in to apathy.All in all, despite many weaknesses of philosophy and plot this movie is well worth seeing for its attempts at dealing with an issue many people find uncomfortable. Namely, how is one to live one's life?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh what a curse to be a genius! Here we have a nearly perfect film, perfect in all the ordinarily engineered respects. It is rather haunting, and if you choose to watch it you will find it memorable. But Kurosawa is not merely a maker of well engineered films, together with perhaps a hundred others. No, he is an inventor, someone who imagines new ways of dreaming. He invents vision.So when we have a film that is merely excellent but inventive, we are saddened. Missing here is the deep layering, usually three deep with different movement. Missing is the explosive turn. Missing is the grand scope, connecting in selfaware fashion to powers beyond a mere human.We do have some complex storytelling: the last third is a matter of discussion and argument among the surviving bureaucrats about what happened in the fashion of "12 Angry Men." But it centers on the humanity, indeed the worth a life. Small stuff for normal Kurasawa adventures.You may want to see this if you are a casual watcher. Or if you are serious and want to see all this master's films. But otherwise, I'll steer you away from it. It is merely strong and compelling, not lifealtering.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good rating this movie has achieved at IMDb is due to the fact that people who choose to watch a Japanese movie from the 50's are capable of appreciating such a movie. In other words...the rating has not been given be a mean of the people.Personally I can't stand the blockbusters from Hollywood, so in my search for more interesting films I watched this one. I like deep movies, but this one was just too slow. The old man was mumbling the few times he spoke, and unless my subtitles were messing with me he always ended up saying "In other words..." or "What I'm trying to say..." It gave a funny view on the bureaucratism and what life is all about, that must be said, but this is a typical example of a film being overrated just because it's different. Applause for the diversity in the film-making, but this is not worth watching unless you really enjoy the odd stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow, confusing, boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over 3 hours of sheer boredom, with elderly Japanese guys mumbling every line that comes out of their mouth. It was hard to tell who the main character was at times. The cinematography was absolutely awful and the old Japanese men are simply not interesting to enough to make a 3 hour movie about. How am I supposed to connect with the characters when I can't even understand what they are saying? even with the subtitles on it was impossible most of the time. The story is about a guy who lives a boring life, well the director sure managed to project that onto the presentation of the film. Hands down one of the slowest moving films ever made, this crap was made in 1952. maybe people then found enjoyment in this tedious wreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Reason Why The "Lesser" Kurosawa Is Easily the Most Overrated Director of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review continues my recent assault on particular cinematic themes that annoy me incessantly, and therefore require a therapeutic purging via an extensive (and scathing) IMDb review. The topic in question here is Akira Kurosawa ? hereafter referred to as the "lesser" Kurosawa, primarily because when one hears the name Kurosawa one should immediately think of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who is superior in almost every respect to this "lesser" Kurosawa, a director artificially propped up on an undeserving pedestal by a group of disillusioned followers. Sure, he had one solid film in Seven Samurai (1954), but every time I see his other movies I wonder how the hell anyone could think that this guy was a great director. It befuddles me, even though I am a huge fan of other directors from the same time period.My primary problem with the "lesser" Kurosawa is his indisputable ability of getting the absolute worst out of his actors and actresses. In Ran (1985) Tatsuya Nakadai (who played Lord Hidetora) contributes a series of embarrassingly overacted moments during any and all scenes where strong emotion is required. In Hidden Fortress (1958) Misa Uehara (Princess Yuki) gives one of the worst performances of the 1950s. Even Toshiro Mifune had a truly inept performance in Rashomon (1950). In Dreams (1991) almost everyone stinks the place out. Ikiru (1952) continues the track record for this "lesser" Kurosawa, because Takashi Shimura (who plays Kanji Watanabe) is quite simply horrible in this film. He basically has three modes of facial expression:1. Wimpering Crybaby Mode. 2. Sad Puppy Dog Mode. 3. Hallucinogenic Mode.I'll leave it to the viewer to identify the specific instances where each of these modes are employed by Shimura, but I simply cannot help but comment on #2 above. During Sad Puppy Dog phases, Shimura's face lengthens and his eyes bug-out to make even fruit-flies jealous. Basically, he looks like a 3-year-old after being scolded, not a person of sufficient maturity enduring pain or suffering. He doesn't react to situations like any grown man would. In fact, the Watanabe character is so devoid of basic humanity that he comes off as a stand-in for Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I'm not kidding when I say that Shimura's facial expressions make Ikiru both unintentionally hilarious and infuriating. I literally wanted to strike him with a blunt object or stick needles in his eyes just so he'd stop staring pathetically at me through my television screen. This whole situation ruins the entire film. The crux is that even a mediocre director should have prevented this by instructing Shimura appropriately. This "lesser" Kurosawa was apparently incapable of understanding the concept of "overacting", so he let Shimura ham it up for 140 minutes. You can almost hear this "lesser" Kurosawa behind the camera:"You're a puppy dog, Takashi. You're a puppy dog. Show me those puppy dog eyes!"It's no wonder why George Lucas found "inspiration" from the "lesser" Kurosawa's works, since Lucas practically perfected the "art" of getting the absolute worst out of his actors, regardless of how good they perform when not under the "influence" of good ole George.Like many of the other works by this director, Ikiru is about an hour too long. Watching Watanabe go clubbing for 60 minutes was totally unnecessary. The very thin premise was stretched out for so long that I was reminded of Peter Jackson, who needed 600 minutes to tell one of the most basic, formulaic stories in the history of cinema. The "lesser" Kurosawa could have trimmed the first half, but in all honesty it would have only made this agonizing cinematic experience shorter, not better. Since the lead protagonist had the reason and intellect of a 3-year-old, there wasn't much in the way of potential development, and what little occurs comes from out of nowhere. The entire maturity of Watanabe is expressed in a segment spanning a few measly minutes, when he goes to work with zeal and runs out the front door to help the people. Kurosawa ? in his infinite stupidity ? then chooses to cut the sequence off completely, only to then shoot ahead half a year in time to show a bunch of politicians reminiscing about Watanabe's tasks for 45 minutes. There is simply no way that the viewer can relate to the revelatory happiness of the main character through the third-person conversations of characters that had a combined screen time of only a few minutes previously. It's a total miscalculation on the part of the director who takes the cheap way out with an abhorrently overrated "swing" scene in the snow. Yes, the scene is pretty, but it simply cannot substitute for a lack of character development that essentially occupies 5 total minutes out of a 140-minute film. And no, I refuse to count 30 minutes of puppy dog glances as character development. The mediocrity of this much-loved "lesser" Kurosawa is even more evident in the fact that other, greatly superior dramatic directors like Yasujiro Ozu were making fantastic films like Early Summer (1951) and Tokyo Story (1953) ? films that make Ikiru (1952) look like amateur hour at best, because they have everything lacking in this film ? great acting, storyline, and character development with believable, realistic performances. It's a travesty that exceptional directors like Ozu must live in the shadows of a lesser director who is, quite frankly, incompetent. It's almost humorous that the "lesser" Kurosawa came out with Ikiru in the time period in-between Ozu's films mentioned above. We can safely call this a crap sandwich.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A New definition of tedium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could not believe I spent over 2 hours watching this film. Although the premise/storyline was good, execution was horridly lame, slow, tedious, and boring.Kanji, the "hero" of the story, whined way too much, mumbled too much, and failed to capture the emotions of the moment.Watching him speak or attempt to display emotion reminded me way too much of that sequel to "Star Trek, the movie" wherein we were tortured by having to witness this ever so slow "fly-by" of the new Enterprise.Ikiru would have been much better had the producers trimmed 45 minutes from the film.</fullReview>
