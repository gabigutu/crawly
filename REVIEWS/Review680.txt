		<shortDescription>One Of The Funniest And Most Violent Action Films In Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down "no-blood-no-swearing" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as "action" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:www.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious! This could be the surprise hit of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well folks, that's how it's done. Ever thought MI-6 (note: that's what the British call their secret service) is a club for snobbish, upper class dudes who like to watch paint dry all they long? OK, Bond is kind of cool (I hated the last two, though), but now we finally got a film that takes spy movies to the next level. Not since 'District 9' have I had that feeling during the watching of a film like "this movie just does everything right" (by which I mean of course: it plays exactly to MY taste). Compared to this film, every James Bond movie released after 'Licence to Kill' looks like a snore-fest. This is such a kick-ass, "balls against the wall" crazy ride that I had to shake my head several times in disbelief during the screening I was invited to. And I actually knew what I was in for. I've seen every film by Matthew Vaughn, but I was not prepared how far he was willing to go with this one. Thought 'Kick-Ass' was pretty crazy? Wait till you see this.One of the key ingredients is the casting of the actors. The well known stars all play against type, which makes this even more unreal. Remember that lame dude who mainly played lame dudes in girlie movies like 'Bridget Jones'? He just won an Oscar for playing the stuttering King of England, and as you will see in 'Kingsman', that Oscar was well deserved: that dude (Colin Firth) can play anything! He's more bad-ass in this than Bond ever was!A word to the wise, though, this film is not for the easily offended or the squeamish. It is a comedy but a very, very violent kind of comedy. And the language alone will shock the MPAA out of their pants. Watch this if you're into films like 'Lock, Stock', 'Kick-Ass', or 'In Bruges' and you'll probably love it - don't bother if you're more into serious films or family friendly comedies. As for me, I had a (bloody) good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy, over-the-top ultra violent fun!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just came back from a pre-screening of 'Kingsman' and let me tell you: if you liked the first Kick-Ass, you are going to LOOOVE this film! I would never have thought that a stiff Brit like Colin Firth could pull off action - but boy, does he whoop ass in this one. I thought the story was rather original (don't know the Comic), it's a bit like an ultra violent James Bond parody. Or better: a crossbreed of Bond and Kick-Ass. Finally an action movie that doesn't use kiddie-gloves. The kid who plays the recruit is also worth mentioning. I've never seen him before but he really nails it. There's a lot of humor in this film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not overdone. And Sam Jackson finally found something he hasn't done yet. I guess his role was already spoiled a bit in the trailer, but believe me: you haven't seen Jackson in this kind of part before. This is an excellent, over-the-top bloody and sexy film for fans of old-school action films. I give it 10 stars. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessentially British, Hilariously Funny, Brutally Violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stylish, brutal and hilarious. 'Kingsman' is an extremely quintessentially British flick full of over-the-top yet hilarious comedy, brutal violence and a quirky image of England. Since James Bond's debut in 1962, a number of films have attempted to reinvent the genre, with films like 'Johnny English', 'Get Smart', 'This Means War' and many more, however, none have come close to displaying the perfect blend like 'Kingsman' has. Matthew Vaughn has become renowned for taking on action-comedy projects, for instance 'Kick-Ass' (which is still stronger than this but only just), and along the way has kept that feel-good British aspect to it that makes our greatest secret agent (James Bond) such an icon. All-in-all 'Kingsman' is a brilliant, well-executed film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>#Kingsman: The Secret Service is a gentlemen secret spy-society that saves the world from a villain with the help of new recruits ... Don't let this summary fool you, the movie fantastic! It got applause at the end of the preview; for me first time ever in a cinema. Great lines, never laughed this much: Bond with a wink and fresh edge. Plus super shot "martial art" action that should make the Matrix jealous. The action has its true Shakespearian/GoTh moments and all supported by cool tech-stuff. Great aspect in this movie is the music, an extra comic dimension. When you see the movie you'll know what I mean. Next too all the clever fun and furious action, it touches on petty crime poverty and home violence. Matthew Vaugh captures the grimness yet doesn't loose it's lightness ... and I like the message: "a gentlemen is not born, a gentle(wo)men is someone who chooses to be one." The young gang, like Sophie Cookson, held up well and Taron Egerton established his position in the gang of giants. Colin Firth's aloofness was crowned with a kick-ass bite, Samuel Jackson brings his role back to old fashion comedy, strongly supported by Mark Strong and Michael Caine. It is a big 9,5 - this movie just nailed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>007 meets Kick-Ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service marks the third film in a row that director Matthew Vaughn has adapted from a comic book background. His two predeceasing being Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011) - which, by all means, were pretty damn good!Over the last few decades, both comic and superhero movies, mostly fall into the easy trap of taking themselves too seriously. Where Vaughn's vision lies, and so-far proved by his former comic adapted films is that they draw a clean balance to where drama and serious character development ends, and cartoonish humour meets, leaving a unique entertainment that stands out.Based on the comic by Mark Millar (who also created Kick-Ass), the film sees a young ? no better way to put it ? chav, called Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), taken under the wing of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a spy for her majesty's secret service. With the aid of Michael Caine and Mark Strong, they soon come face-to-face with the villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson); an ego- centric - Steve Jobs-type - billionaire madman (with a lisp), who hates the sight of blood ? yet holds a vision of mass biological warfare.Licenced to thrill, Kingsman' is almost a love-letter to the James Bond films ? but not too far as a parody, like Austin Powers - but more a homage to the franchise - a 007 meets Kick-Ass, of sorts. At a point, Colin Firth's character, Harry, even mocks the thought by saying 'give me a far-fetched, theoretical plot any day?'Fans of Bond and Kick-Ass are certain to love it, as through rollercoasters of action, comedy and espionage, comes a bucket of winks, references and nods to the world of spy movies. Just like the colourful, gadget ridden Bond films of the 1960's, Kingsman is very fun to watch, with 'wham, bam, thank-you ma'am' style of mayhem, one- liners and bonkers soundtrack crazed all over it.The comic the film was based on was already hugely entertaining ? in fact, probably the best we have read. Littered with Millar's creative quirkiness and with Vaughn's auteur film-making, has left a stylized-spectacle of ultra-violence.Portraying the lead character of 'Eggsy', Taron Egerton (also in this month's Testament of Youth), proves to be an outstanding newcomer as he brings the character to life with an energizing vibe of a comparing ethic of chav lifestyle vs. gentleman's class.Alongside, and tackling the mentor, come father type role, is Colin Firth, who based on previous filmography alone could easily be classed as Britain's most boring and typecast actor. Until now, the mold romantic films is broken as he picks up a gun and finds an encyclopedia of wit and enters openly new territory. It's Colin Firth like you have never seen before! ? and it is bad-ass.Squeezing in with a 15 rating (somehow), Kingsman is never short of violence and its guts and guns galore, when kneecapping; slicing off body parts and explosions become all too familiar. Given the calibre of talent involved, Kingsman' does not fall stereotype and gimmicky like other YA spy adventures like Stormbreaker, or Spy Kids, but instead, a well-deserved mash-up of espionage and true cinematic excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vaughn is Let Loose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People will have interesting reactions to this film. All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. There are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off. The film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.8.75</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revoltingly violent; ridiculous plot, sad reflection of today's "entertainment"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first 5 minutes of this abhorrently violent film, one of the film's protagonists is literally sliced in half, length-wise, from top to bottom, by a (yawn) hot, Asian-looking, double-amputee with some sort of "slasher foot-prosthetics" on her tawny, spandex-clad limbs. Yes, you read that right. Not only are the physics involved in this ludicrous action simply impossible, there is NO blood--nothing. Just an insipidly-dumb, ill-conceived effect designed to make sadistic killing "funny" and elicit a cheap "ooh!" from the audience. But wait--there's more. In another disturbing scene, a church full of "Westboro Baptist"-style fundamentalist bigots beat, claw, and slash each other to death to the musical accompaniment of the "Free Bird" ending guitar solo. I guess mass murder is cool and fun if it's scored to some popular music and if the victims are just ignorant bigots; hey, no foul, no crime. Are we supposed to cheer this? There are other nauseating violent scenarios, all shot in the latest hi-tech digital slow-motion, freeze-frame camera work that makes rednecks and "real men" squeal in ecstasy. Oh yeah-and at the end, the hero's "prize" for "saving the world"? Why, what every alcohol-numbed fratboy/ socially-challenged gamer dreams of; (read this with a Swedish accent)"sex in the asshole" with a winsome, blond Scandinavian princess. I kid you not, folks. This is the shallowest, lowest-common-denominator script-writing.This movie is an utterly disgusting and pathetic reflection of what passes for "entertainment" in today's mentally-damaged world of desensitized adults raised on UFC blood sport, graphic "head shots" in ultra-violent video games and a lack of real moral role models from our authority figures and heroes. It's a world of violence for violence' sake, and graphic violence as "entertainment". I felt dirty and stained after sitting through this turkey with my fiancé's friends on our double-date. Hopefully, you'll never have to experience the indignity...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't work for me on any level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with decent hopes given the high rating it had, but it's not like I was over expecting or anything. In the end I found this thing a total a mess. I think for me it tried to ride too many lines and as a result failed in most aspects. It tried to take itself serious as a spy movie, yet it also tried to be this weird comedy, and while I think movies are capable of doing both, this one just didn't do it well or right to the point where it just bounced me out of the movie completely. Far as it taking itself seriously I found it to be way over the top unbelievable and unrealistic to the point of being stupid. Far as the comedy, I just didn't think the nuclear head explosions or the McDonalds being served on a silver platter was funny at all.Granted I'm American and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I love Monty Python, Snatch, Mr. Bean, even most of the Bond films. Yet most of the funny moments in this movie I just found remarkably unfunny to the point where rather than it being a quick laugh it just completely bounced me out of the movie. And the few comical moments that were actually funny were already covered in the trailers, so for me this movie totally fell flat on the comedy scale to the point of actually hurting the movie.Now on the taking itself seriously aspect, the whole spy gig, the young recruit, it just failed on that level for me as well. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time action was good, but I thought the editing needed a lot of work. The massacre in the church I just thought was way over done and too long. I find it amazing in movies like this how fight scenes go on for many minutes and when it's all done, people are barely winded, breathing normally. Give me a break, go watch professional boxers or MMA fighters and see how they look after just one round, and they are real athletes who train vigorously. So while some of the action was okay, it was so over the top that again it bounced me out of the movie. So between the bad comedy and overcooked action I was constantly being reminded that I was watching a movie rather than be swept up into one.My last beef is with the main kid and the whole "recruitment / training camp". Probably what bounced me out of the movie the most was here we have some reckless rebellious kid who's training to this point has been gymnastics, so okay he's flexible, has good balance, etc... Yet with little to no further training at all he's the biggest bad ass? The recruitment / initiation program was a joke. It wasn't a training program of any kind, it was basically "lets throw these kids in a no win situation and see how the fend and who comes out on top." I get the idea was they were trying to weed through all the recruits to get the best one, but the whole while I kept thinking "So this kid is just a natural born bad ass because he did gymnastics and has daddy issues?" Then once he's out and starts real life spy work he's untouchable and better than all the worlds master assassins. It's like her Mom's bf who bullies him early in the movie, who he confronts in the end, and I'm thinking "So other than being this super spy what has he done to actually improve his skills as a fighter?"Overall I thought the action was decent, but very over the edge of what you'd consider to be believable "movie believability I mean." The black comedy was pretty flat and did very little in making me laugh or enjoy myself. Finally the believability of this kid taking over for his dad and his quasi predecessor was just absurd. I give it a 3 / 10. One point on principle and because I liked the main spy girl, a 2nd point because some of the action was decent, and a 3rd point for the best part of the movie which was the bare ass scene at the end, which shocked me enough to yell out "HELLO!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vaughn Supremacy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange when you consider it, how much the Spy thriller genre has changed and grown because of James Bond, there is not a single Spy movie that is made that isn't and won't be compared to double 'O' seven himself. So I suppose it's no surprise that a film like Kingsman had to be made eventually, so I suppose the reel question is will this make the Sky fall or just be a quantum of nonsense? Say what you like about Mathew Vaughn the man likes his comics. So far out of the 5 films he has directed, 3 were graphic novels first. Kingsman is one of them. The man's like the anti-Zack Snyder, he directs films based off of comics and brings out real issues in them, as opposed to Snyder who directs films based off of graphic novels and ignores any merit or comment on the wider world the books make and just makes HIS movies. I'm happy to say that Kingsman is probably the most fun I will have in a cinema screen this year.As I've already said Spy films get compared to James Bond, so let's begin with that shall we? Kingsman is a film that is both totally unique and its own movie whilst fully embracing its British heritage, the films marketing campaign drew strong comparisons to For Your Eyes Only artwork. The film acknowledges all of those stupid spy clichés in a way which is both knowing and clever, and then it ditches them all. The best example of this I can give is in the opening sequence of the film, there is a glass of whisky, a lot of people die and there isn't a drop of said whiskey spilt, and at that moment Kingsman sticks two fingers up at the past and says "we're the future" and from that second onwards Kingsman is its own movie. The film successfully reinvents just about every stereotype imaginable in a spy film. The villain, who is always central in a spy movie, is Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Valentine is a megalomaniac who wants world domination, all standard stuff so far, he also has a lisp and is terrified of blood. That's the kind of thing Kingsman does really well, it sets us up with the standard and transforms it to be unique.The film is of course preposterous in the extreme, but I don't care. It was funny, clever, brilliant and unique. Kingsman has so many pro's to it that you can easily overlook the minor short comings, because in the end the film has a baddie who has blades for legs, I mean who doesn't love that?What I like most about Kingsman is that even with all its madness it still manages to have some kind of heart; the entire movie is kind of a think piece on class war and the importance of legacy. The movie has a brain and a soul and it has no problem expressing either, the finale to the parachute problem proves this most for me. I would be remised if I didn't mention something about the cast, let get over the whole "the obvious people are amazing thing" and look forward to the new comers Taron Egerton (playing "Eggsy") and Sophie Cookson (playing Roxy). These two talents have come from nowhere and broken through the glass ceiling, Cookson and Egerton are stars with one film to their names, and they deserve every single piece of praise that comes to them. Taron is such an unbelievably versatile young man, he can be funny, clever, cool, cocky, brash, physical, confident and insecure all without saying a word or moving a muscle. Also, I loved seeing Jack Davenport on screen again.Kingsman is the film this country needed; it's confident and fun, without being disrespectful or full of nasty. In short, Sic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: The Secret Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KINGSMAN is yet another comic book mess, this time about a South London petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming. It's amusing to see a film be disrespectful about Obama and AGW but the film is morally repulsive and stupid. It wants to be a silly but fun globe-trotting adventure like old James Bond films but those films had wit, exotic travel, high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude, stuffed with fake-looking CGI, charmless and has stupid jeopardy-free action scenes; I lost count of just how many times the bad guy's goons had the hero in their sights but missed him. The promised chav to gentleman transformation never occurs - apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman - with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit. What really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass. I could complain about the crudity of having a Swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyper-realistic violence. People are tortured and cut in half without a qualm. Worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a (hate) church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever. If you want to see Colin Firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to sit through, and terribly misleading. It's a shame that such content can be shown in our theaters, commemorating death, advocating women as sex symbols or damsels in distress, and portraying mass murder as a 'cool action scene'. The first third of the movie has great action scenes that one would expect from a spy film. Easy to compare to the Bond films, however, as the movie progressed, the entire validity of the characters' morals were flushed down the drain. I and my two other adult friends had to cover our eyes and grimace at many scenes and we left all agreeing that we did not sign up for that sort of film. The trailer did an awesome job at capturing my excitement, then the movie did an equally great job of shattering that excitement. I stress, please watch at your own discretion.</fullReview>

The way the creators put a different spin on the superhero genre in Kick-Ass, was very much how they put a spin on the Spy movie genre in Kingsman: The Secret Service.

		<shortDescription>Who said the traditional Bond formula is dead?!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to go to an advanced screening of Kingsman: The Secret Service. Watching the trailer a month ago made me interested to watch this movie since I'm a fan of spy movies especially the 007 movies. The movie is about a young teenager from London called "Eggsy" who is chosen by a professional agent from a super secret organisation who call themselves the "Kingsmen" to go through the deadliest "job interview" to be the next Kingsman spy.That said I must say I was not disappointed. The action is fast-paced and there's a lot of comedy.The movie is sort of like 007 meets Men in Black. The movie obviously parodies the old traditional 007 formula especially of the Roger Moore era but this is done in a good way. Kingsman; The Secret Service reminded me how great the old 007 formula was until it was changed until Daniel Craig's portrayal of the agent. After watching this movie Daniel Craig better take notes because there is a new agent on the block and that is "Eggsy'.That being said Kingsman: The Secret Service is the best movie of 2015 so far. Don't miss it!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started out funny like the previews showed with only a little graphic violence. I'll give it that. Then it started getting extremely graphic. Mass murders, heads exploding, our whole family of 5 adults were so disturbed we couldn't even talk all the way home. We all wish we could unsee it. I felt it was a terrible movie even with the few chuckles we got in the earlier parts. This movie taught me a lesson, I will not be seeing any more movies in the theater without reading every review I can get my hands on, this isn't the first time I have been blind sighted by gore, and disturbing content. If you see this movie, I beg you not to take your kids, even if they are adults. I wish I could go back and NOT have gone to this one. Frankly, I am disappointed that movie makers feel Americans have sunk so low as to find this entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie commits the unforgivable sin...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's outrageously stupid. I have read all of the bad reviews currently posted for the Kingsman, and none of them hit the right mark. The movie is violent, raunchy, campy, sexist, racist, and vulgar. And that's all OK! But does it have to be so incredibly stupid? Honestly, does it? And why is the CGI so incredibly terrible. Last time I checked this is 2015, not 1985. I usually don't care too much for special effects, but there is a given level of competence which I expect a film to achieve, before it just becomes distracting. Kingsman has CGI on the level of a cheep SyFy channel special feature.The acting on the part of the star, Taron Egerton, is terrible. Every time he is on the screen it makes you want to punch him in the face, especially every time he opens his mouth. Same is true about Samuel L. Jackson, who played Valentine. That entire performance felt like Samuel L. Jackson asked him self, "self, how would SNL pay this part, if they were trying to make fun of me?" Then he used his fertile imaginations, imagined it, and played it exactly like that. It's Samuel L. Jackson acting out a caricature of Samuel L. Jackson playing the role of Valentine. I think the man seriously is just screwing with us at this point.Truly a terrible movie, not unlike the The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, only with UK hoodlum playing the main role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand how so many people loved this movie. I was really looking forward to a funny, over the top action film, but Kingsman left a lot to be desired. For starters the women in this movie are all portrayed as being completely helpless. (Eggsy's useless mother, his friend in the Kingsman who can't seem to get anything done without reassurance from Eggsy and obviously the very dignified princess who happily offers Eggsy anal in exchange for him saving the world...fml). I was actually freaked out by the number of teenagers who thought the multiple scenes of mass murder of innocent people for absolutely no reason were hilarious. Of course the fact that those people's heads exploded into colorful fireworks probably helped. Lastly, what's a comedy without a little vomit humor and mocking individuals with speech impediments. I lost a lot of respect for Colin Firth for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting storyline that went from elegant to trashy to sickening to tasteful to distasteful. What kind of people think that exploding heads is a comedy act? Or for that matter, a mother trying to kill her little girl!? Finally, ends with the "requisite" piece of ass that serves absolutely no purpose in the story line and is done in such a trashy way. Very crass and off-putting. Vaughn and Goldman seem to have social issues with sick humor. The storyline is fun, clever, whimsical, unexpected, and very 'James Bond' as intended. It was a delightful--except for the "comic touches" that ruin it and are distasteful. The actors were very appealing -- and elegant. It was not Oscar/BAFTA-worthy, but was fun. Except for the parts that kick you in the gut. And if my review makes you feel like a yo-yo going upper, downer, upper, downer...that is the way the movie feels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunningly UNDERWHELMING Stinkeroo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really really wanted to like this movie. And, while it does have a few positive points, on the whole it was stunningly underwhelming. Don't waste your money on this stinkeroo.Parents note: This is NOT the movie you want to take your children to see. It is one of the most graphically violent movies I can ever remember seeing. "Comic decapitations" are still decapitations. There is also a scene where a mother tries to murder her innocent toddler with a large ax. One of the characters is literally cut in half from top to bottom, and then shown in graphic detail awkwardly stapled back together. A large part of these problems can be directly related to inept direction. Director Matthew Vaughn has no ability to reign in the more "Hammish" actors. Samuel L. Jackson pulls out all the stops - and basically ruins every scene he is in. Jackson's performance has to be the worst of his long career. It may well be one of the worst performances of the decade. His character was just stupid and incredibly offensive to so many people on so many different levels. He chose to speak with a cartoonish lisp which might suggest he is effeminate, or perhaps that he has a speech impediment - motivation is not an issue here - don't look for logic or rationality anywhere in this awkward movie.Fans of Colin Firth, Jack Davenport, Mark Hamill, and Michael Caine will be very very disturbed by how these characters are treated.On a positive note, Taron Egerton is a delight. He has enough skills to overcome the horrible direction and ham handed performances.</fullReview>

The storyline and direction were aimless and weak, the actors were made to show off their horribly cheap and duplicate quality James bond type weaponry, tricks, and style. The movie's plot and screening seems so stupid that the director would have been better off creating a spoof for a James Bond type movie instead. Anyway such movies always get made, but what I am most disappointed about is the fact that the IMDb reviews &amp; ratings were completely rigged. IMDb you need to watch out for such flaws in your feedback system 'cos that will bring down the rating of your service in process. My suggestion if you are really really still interested in watching this movie then wait for a couple of week and it should be on TV for a free time pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film doesn't know what it wants to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is like two films, really. It starts out the neoclassic, early-Bondesque, spy-thriller-meets-Hunger-Games mash-up the trailers make it out to be. The plot and characters are compelling enough that you want to hang in, suspend disbelief and see where this is going. But it hits a wall in the last 30 minutes or so; from the conclusion of the church scene on, it's Austin-Powers-meets-Jackass-meets-Spring-Breakers-Gone-Wild. Screenplay, direction, production values all tank; it's like Vaughn got pulled off to another project and left the sum-up to his high-school interns ... or the guys at his car wash. And the camp factor comes too late and too abruptly to pull this into "cult" territory. The Vaughn fanboys will disagree, of course, and there are plenty on these boards. This movie suits the adolescent boy-fantasy mindset; if your standards are at all higher, you'll be disappointed. Pity, really. If I'd walked out after the first hour, this could've been a good 7-8 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needless killing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is that it can't decide whether it's a spy movie, or a movie about violent killers, or a comedy. It tries to do some of all three. It partially succeeds as a spy movie, owing a lot to old James Bond films. (And did anyone catch the reference to "Get Smart?") And granted, there are a few funny moments. But the violence overwhelms everything else. There's plenty of gratuitous killing, and it's not the least bit subtle. If that's your cup of tea, prepare to have a great time. For me, I think the story would be have been better if 90% of the fight scenes had been left on the cutting room floor.Plot-wise, it's completely predictable. A few minutes into the movie, we can already guess which two characters would end up in a fight to the finish at the end.Very mild spoiler alert: The movie ends with the audience essentially being mooned. Thanks a lot, guys. I'd gladly return the favor if I knew you were watching.One last point: Some user reviews have complained that the F-word is used quite a bit. It is, but really, is that the most offensive thing here? The entire premise of the dastardly project, and the implication that almost every world leader mindlessly buys into it, is far worse. Not to mention the almost nonstop display of blood and guts. Some of the killings are presented in an almost comical way and needn't be taken seriously, but most of it is just grossly, and needlessly, excessive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you doubt that movies today are largely made for adolescent boys (or men who still think like them) then you haven't seen Kingsman: The Secret Service.And the fact that this film did well at the box office makes me think that the Samuel L. Jackson character, Richmond Valentine, is right about humanity's bleak prospects.I feel dumber for having seen Kingsman. In particular there is a lecherous- even predatory- interaction at the very end between the lead character "Eggsy" and a Scandinavian princess that is a gratuitous contrivance to denigrate and sexualize a relatively strong female character.The message in this movie is that the world can only be saved by wealthy white men who have avoided the estate tax and that the true evildoers are those who believe in climate change....oh, and Barack Obama's head explodes - all of which kind of torpedoes the notion of liberal Hollywood.The film has a promising start in the direction of James Bond for the 8-second attention-span world. Initially the action is so silly and over the top and the characters so absurdly two-dimensional that it's hard to take it as more than mindless popcorn fun.There's also some witty dialog between Colin Firth's Galahad and Sam Jackson's Valentine that menacingly send up traditional spy-movie tropes. A few bracingly cold-hearted twists occur during the new-agents' training that let you know the movie will not be trafficking in many feel-good clichés.But then Kingsman devolves into an unimaginative morass of dehumanization and schlock and eventually the film becomes little more than a first-person-shooter video game. Literally, there is a scene in the film's climax where the action briefly switches to Eggsy's perspective as he runs down a corridor shooting henchmen that is indistinguishable from a commercial for a combat shooter video game.Firth and Jackson are likable. Michael Caine is- well Michael Caine being an Englishman. As Eggsy, Taron Egerton is entirely interchangeable with any other young actor and equally as forgettable.I have often thought that Hollywood serves as a pretty good counter-argument to the notion of free markets naturally producing the highest quality to meet the public's demand. That Kingsman: Secret Service did well at the Box Office and will no doubt spawn bigger, louder, dumber, more violent and retrograde sequels only serves as a depressing reminder that crap sells and sells well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first two acts carried the movie brilliantly. I've never laughed harder at more one word dialog lines. The action was incredible and the acting...sublime. Some of Britain's best leading men are on display and their charm and wit are matched only by the twinkling glee that all this is delivered with tongue-firmly-in-cheek. And then they threw it all away in the third act. What a disaster. Witty banter replaced with canned-catchphrases. Charm replaced with scatological nonsense. Incredible stunts replaced with the same tired line work that grew old during the third Matrix movie. Many movies disappoint because they never rise. This movie disappoints by how close it came to being truly incredible.Want to know when to leave? Leave when Colin Firth is out of the picture. Up to that point, its a fun ride. But frankly, the whole picture hits an iceberg and sinks deep into the abyss after that. Smug, cocky, and second-rate, the picture becomes a model of the protagonist before making his journey. One is left hoping that the entire affair does not spawn a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman the secret service was a pretty standard action/spy movie that had way to much violence and gore. The plot was predictable and absurd to say the least and seemed to be mostly parodying other spy films, but with an excess of pointless violence, particularly the church scene, which emphasized how the violence was used to try and make up for the terrible plot. The use of excessive violence starts with the opening 10 minutes showing a man being sliced in half and not to mention the umpteen head shots shown in slow motion throughout the film. It all became really tiresome and made me want to stop watching to be honest. All in all a movie that will be remembered for pointless violence and nothing more. Hence, the reason it gets a 5 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first, I've read through quite a lot of the reviews for this and it's left me totally speechless.On one hand you've have loads lauding the film and the other half incensed by it for its violence. Both are wrong.Let me make it clear that I love both actions films and comedy films. This film can't decide which one it really wants to be. It's like a cheap Kill Bill mixed with Ali G InDaHouse.Have I seen over the top violence before? Yes. Have I heard the same jokes before? Yes. This film brought absolutely nothing new to the table.The volume of action was great but it was executed very poorly. It was a CGI fest throughout and it was unconvincing at best. The acting was subpar. SLJ was an embarrassment. It was the type of performance you would see in a not so serious commercial. Taron played the typical chav role pretty well. He looked the part at least.The whole thing was just too cheesy for me and very predictable. There were too many scenes where I actually found myself cringing. I recently watched John Wick and in comparison is light years beyond this film in regards to action. This film is for school kids that enjoy sniggering to a sexual reference, rubbish acting and all out action. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone because I'd be robbing them of their time. How this film is rated so high is totally beyond me. Worst film I've watched this year hands down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crass and ultra-violent assault on the senses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something deeply unsettling about sitting in a movie theater surrounded by people who are laughing as, on screen, heads are exploding, limbs are being hacked off and a princess rewards her rescuer with anal sex. The film starts out on a promising and engaging note as we follow the recruitment and training of the protagonist. But then, at about the midway point, things get terribly weird and weirdly terrible. This is not just movie violence but violence-porn, violence for laughs, violence that glories in being shocking and over the top. The movie itself, in terms of film-craft, is disposable and forgettable. But what sticks with me is a nagging feeling that what I've just watched--in the guise of a movie purportedly about a refined British spy agency--is a marker of the decline of Western civilization. Kingsman is the Roman circus for the 21st century, and every bit as brutal and pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clever slick and all Steed-shiny...but this film, poached from KILL BILL, THE SAINT, INCEPTION, THE AVENGERS, any 60s BOND etc...with added CLOCKWORK ORANGE violence simply shows that Matthew Vaughn is just another vile Tarantino wannabee handed a big budget and excessively indulgently produced a stupid film with set pieces of boring ugly violence. Some scenes, as in the church, are just disgusting, and from that point the interest level wanes. The scenes in the mountain lair are INCEPTION meets ON HER MAJESTYS SECRET SERVICE with absurd and endless killing which ultimately made me feel ill. 30 minutes too long and from a clown copycat director, this film is great initially, for 60 minutes and then irritating and vile for 70 minutes. Yes the damn thing runs 130 minutes. I really did feel sick and exhausted when it finished. I thought it all a shocking waste of production money time and the studio's trust. To show contempt for the audience with such cretinous perverse 'action' and result, the villain even spews on the audience. Then there is the 'hilarious' anal sex joke. The last 70 minutes of this chrome dildo of a movie are truly horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The director of 'X-Men: First Class' does not disappoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My boyfriend and I got invited to a pre-screening (first time ever!) and we had no idea what kind of film this was going to be. I knew the actor from The King's Speech and my bf told me this was by the same director who had done X- Men: First Class (which I think is the best). But because of the main actor, I thought this would be some British comedy. I was not prepared for this hilarious, crazy action film. It's really, really funny, and it's very violent. I don't know whether many women are going to like it (I do, but I prefer South Park over Sex and the City and I usually hate chick flicks). It is a comedy but not what you'd expect. And despite this being not at all like X-Men, I absolutely loved the film. And Samuel Jackson is in the film! If you like spy movies and if you're not offended by gory violence and very dirty language, go watch this film. The last 30 minutes or so are like the craziest I've ever seen in an action film and I have seen a lot of action films, believe me. The storyline is a bit like Men in Black without aliens, and the young actor who plays the rookie is perfect in this part. The film might not be very realistic, but I thought this was one of the best action comedies I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually go by IMDb for movie ratings when choosing a film and so far it's yet to let me down for the most part. I saw that this movie was given great reviews and were in the high 7's. Looked like a cool action packed film. What a disappointment. It was just silly and fake and I kept telling myself it would get better and it just did not. I guess I was expecting something of a hero movie and this was a joke. It seemed very childish with adult scenes. The graphics were cool but not in any way real. The wardrobe was great as well. This film had great potential and just went completely south. I would not recommend this to anyone. What a waste of money purchasing the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Life is Worse after Seeing this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this film was the time before I ever watched in when with a naive child-like faith I believed that there was still the possibility of an action film that didn't make me wish I could go back in time and slap myself in the face to avoid watching this truly horrible film. At first I thought I could attempt to overlook the totally idiotic and unnecessary profanity in hopes that the action scenes and over all plot would make it worth while. But after a while (and by "a while" I mean the first 10 minutes) it just seems like a bunch of prepubescent children were given permission to swear like the big kids, and for no apparent reason are running around screaming the f word.A man sliced cleanly in half in the first scene should have given me a fair warning. The violence wasn't laughable or gruesome or realistic. It was stupid. I've seen episodes of sponge bob square pants where poorly sketched characters slap each other that had more of a positive effect on me than this did.Even the overall plot was dull and predictable. I don't know what sort of blackmail was used on some of these great actors to get them to agree to this truly pathetic production. I feel certain it was created for idiots by idiots.If you want to watch a truly horrible movie in every way, this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Found this to be really awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, will receive lots of grief for this no doubt. As a huge Bond fan, I loved the concept of the movie. Colin Firth fantastic in this role, Michael Caine great as usual, loved Mark Strong's character but was really turned off by so much of this movie.The actor playing the kid I found to have no real charm in his role or acting ability, forgettable performance to me. I wish him the best but not sure he is really going anywhere.I found the scene of the agents being told to shoot their dog to be creepy. Yes I know it's a fantasy story but is was disturbing. Not to mention shooting a blank at close range would severely injure or kill the dog anyway which made the scene even more stupid to me.The scene where Galahad shoots, stabs and slaughters 79 people in the church was just over the top hyper violence and regardless that the church goers were supposed to be Westboro type fanatics, everyday people including women being relentlessly shot in the head for several minutes straight was a turn off. I have no problem for movie violence even when it's campy. In fact I like it when it's needed for the story. But this was in awful taste. I thought it was stupid that Galahad, the most interesting character in the movie is suddenly and unexpectedly shot in the head and killed. After that I knew the rest of the movie relied on the kid agent to carry the story. What started as mediocre took a real dive for me after that. I have little interest in a sequel without Colin Firth as Galahad. The scene where the mother's chip activates and she begins hacking the bathroom door apart in order to slaughter her two year old daughter sitting in a stroller to be disturbing, not funny or clever at all. When Jack Nicholson hacks a door apart with an axe, it made sense given the quality build up of character beforehand. This was poorly thought out implied violence on a child and that scene could easily have been left out with no impact on the rest of the movie. Leave that type of scene to cheesy low budget horror movies. The scene where hundreds of people's heads explode like fireworks to glorious symphonic soundtrack was not funny. Just stupid, gory and overly violent. And this coming from someone that enjoys movie violence as much as the next person when the story behind it has quality.I'm more than exhausted of Samuel L. Jackson taking any script handed to him and essentially being the same persona in every role he takes except this time we get to hear him use his typical profanity with a lisp. Personally I was annoyed every time he appeared on screen. The meaningless short bit about the Swedish princess in the cell offering buttsex in exchange for saving the world was really weird and trashy. Did a 14 year old boy write that part of the script? Because that's the kind of humor that was. And then the quick pan down shot of her rear end as she greets him in the cell patiently presenting her back field waiting to be plowed, seems to me it revealed a little more on camera than her butt cheeks. Was not expecting to actually catch a glimpse of was about to be pleasurably assaulted by the hero of the movie. This movie's R rating is well justified over what I thought was unnecessary gratuitous hyper violence and blatant sexual content that seemed designed only to cheaply shock the viewer and not really enhance the story. What was an interesting story I thought became really stupid and poorly executed to me. Some movies produce low performance and popularity even when they are very good movies. Often times because they are not dumbed down enough for average viewers being expected to think about the story. This movie however in my opinion deserved it's lack luster box office numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hard R -- biggest disappointment of the year - KILL BILL meets SCARFACE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the biggest disappointment I've had at the theater in a long time, even worse than NOAH. The idea was outstanding, with the flavor of 007 James Bond from LIVE AND LET DIE days with the cool gadgets and the cheeky humor. Everyone I know wanted to see this movie. Then, they put in more cussing than SCARFACE and more blood than KILL BILL and drowned it in a Hard R that left the audience stunned and confused. If this movie had been a PG-13 for the family, it would have been the beginning of a chain of profitable and enjoyable movies for these folks. Instead they made fun of rednecks and Republicans, used the F-word as a conjunction in every sentence in the movie. Had scenes that were so brutal and out-of-place in this funny little movie, that I looked at my wife and mother and they were covering their eyes. They drowned this guaranteed winner in obscenity and blood. If you are an 18 year old Marine or just out of jail, enjoy. If you are a parent or on a date or any other member of the target audience for movies, SKIP THIS sleazy piece of poop!!!!</fullReview>

This movie shows the exact same thing Valentine's device did. How it could use good music to make you laugh at the most horrible things, and think literally it is OK. In a way this movie places Valentine's device right in the theater. And shows us our true reactions to horror. Dished up in the right atmosphere, totally acceptable! I wonder how we would react (because we are aware of the moral wrongness) if this music was played, and well choreographed, in a Nazi concentration camp. Congratulations! if you liked the church scene, and the scene where the world leaders lost their heads, you just experienced the numbing effect the Nazi soldiers have felt as they led people to be incinerated.

		<shortDescription>Missed potential, gratuitous crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been great, but it squanders all it's potential. It relishes low-class ugliness. The film tries so hard to be a clever, deconstructive meta-tale, forever winking at the audience about its silly story, that it metas itself into insignificance. Mr. Vaughn has no interest in, or perhaps understanding of, violence as a cinematic tool. He doesn't use violence; he squanders it. Ultimately, there's little to care about. Kingsman is like a high-speed collision between a Jaguar and a jaywalking soccer hooligan. It's ridiculously out of balance, and when you're stuck in the middle, it doesn't seem so funny. If you like really bad pulp fiction, this movie is for you. Otherwise steer clear of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thumbs Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They had me going with the trailer. An urbane man in a suit beating down a room full of goons. I should have considered that this isn't the first time we've seen 'suit violence', but not in a comic vein, so the juxtaposition occurred to me as something fun and new. Too bad this was just marketing. The film doesn't deliver much on its premise. A super -secret society of gentlemen spies, led by Michael Caine, has lost one of its members, and each remaining Kingsman is supposed to propose a new candidate to train for their ranks. There is something like a coming-of-age story for the main character, 'Eggsy', a young hoodlum mentored by Harry Hart (Colin Firth), who was serving with Eggsy's father when he died. The film focuses on younger characters, so it feels like a movie for young people. The violence is comic-book, and while some people do get sliced in half, the film seems to earn its R rating with language and crudity. The Bond films have always used tongue-in-cheek characters in serious plots, but this film is too ridiculous to be taken seriously when it wants to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turn it off after the first hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: Watch it -- if you have the time and money to waste -- for amusement, and perhaps out of sympathy for the movie's investors. But don't let the children watch. A bizarre chapter in the otherwise distinguished careers of Colin Firth, Samuel Jackson, and Michael Caine.This felt like two movies -- the first 60 minutes or so coming off as a James Bond wannabee film, albeit not gaining much momentum. The balance of the film spins off wildly and embarrassingly to the far left (did another producer or editor take over?) with clear intentions of offending anyone with middle-of-the-road sensibilities.There's plenty of effrontery to go around: the grotesque mass-murder of Southern church-goers (who are caricaturishly bigoted) by the erstwhile protagonist (Colin Firth); the presumptive pseudo-science that "humans are the virus on Mother Earth"; a Scandinavian princess, when rescued by our hero, offers anal sex (now how is that politically correct?); and more. The depravity, combined with a weak Saturday matinée "save the world" plot line, extinguishes any positive trajectory the film barely achieves in the early minutes. Other cringe-worthy moments include Samuel Jackson's exaggerated and offensive speech impediment, and an amputee antagonist who uses her prosthetic razor-sharp extremities to slice ginsu-like through a cast of extras with stomach-turning graphic effect.All this may attract and intrigue a certain (and large) percentage of the movie-going public. As for me, I am now all the more anxious for the sophisticated, restrained and elegant story-telling we can expect in the next Daniel Craig - James Bond movie. Thankfully, I don't expect that we will see more than one more installment (i.e. last gasp) of the "Kingsman" franchise.</fullReview>

It seems to promote the idea that all difficulties or challenges require a good drink of a quality liquor. Not what we want to promote with our 14 year old. 3.

		<shortDescription>Excellent: Fast Moving And Well Written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:The highest praise that can be bestowed upon an action movie is its unpredictability. I dare anyone to tell me what is going to happen other than Valentine's eventual defeat. It is so rare, especially in today's cinema, to find a treasure, like this, that is so well written that its script is utterly fantastic. Firth, always an excellent actor, carries his role so well. The juxtaposition of his stern, conservative dress with his incredible violence and skills at wiping out rooms full of people like lightning, this gives the movie a lightness over the comic book violence that is always done as bloodlessly as possible. Even when Valentine's girlfriend / bodyguard slices and dices people it is not like 300, we do not endure buckets of blood going everywhere. The most graphic sequence, in the church, when Valentine turns the signal on that turns everybody into Dick Cheney; it is violent but the blood letting is very mild. The exploding head scene at the end, when he turns the chip on world wide is almost comic. One scene, not for kiddies, is the mother trying to Axe through the door to kill her baby. The pacing is very rare. Try finding a movie this long that moves like this. Even before Eggie is brought into the competition to be a Kingsman, there is plenty of action with some local jerks at the pub.The hardest part of an English movie for Americans is that their accent is often very difficult to follow. Yes, I know, supposedly we speak the same language. I recommend turning your volume up as loud as you can take it. The English use phrases and idioms that are lost on American argot. The action is non stop and the movie never stops to catch its breath. There is lots of wry humor, the violence is so comical that it hardly ever causes one to take it seriously. Michael Caine does very well in a small role, but Firth steals this movie. The contrast between his mild appearance and his great violence evokes Steed from the old classic TV series The Avengers. Even amidst all the mayhem, Firth insists upon manners and protocol: kind of a violent Henry Higgins. I took two stars off for the requisite Progressive ideology that must be in every modern movie. You will spot it right away; you know, anyone who believes in God or morality is a racist Nazi. I always laugh at their intolerant tolerance. Evidently, nobody has had a logic class.This flaw is found in almost every modern movie; try to ignore it and enjoy a rare action masterpiece worth owning. Eggie, while quite young, does an excellent job in the role. The action starts right at the beginning and does not stop until the end credits. A very surprisingly good movie. You may miss some of the English figures of speech but nothing that damages your understanding of the plot. It could be worse, with The Wind That Shakes The Barley, I had to turn the subtitles on. This is no way as bad as that or Layer Cake. An Excellent Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I have never reviewed a movie before so bear with me.This movie was fu***** awful. Let me be clear, the violence was not an issue for me. It did surprise me when they blew up Obama's head but that wasn't what made this movie detestable. This movie hits "bad" on so many levels such as: the lame plot, bad acting, terrible special effects and mind numbing dialog. It was so bad, I mean sooooooo bad I actually created an account on here to write this review. The Plot: Contrived, predictable and poorly executed. The Acting: Samuel L. Jackson's lisp made me cringe, the main character was exceedingly unlikable and the supporting cast were mostly forgettable. The only exception here would be Colin Firth but I'm pretty sure he only did this movie for the paycheck.The Special Effects: I mean...what the hell? Did they hire a 12 year old to do these? They were awful! Plus they did so much slow motion that it only highlighted how bad the effects really were! This should have been the movie's lone saving grace! The Dialogue: So bad, so campy. It reached it's pinnacle at the end when the main character finds the Swedish princess and she tells him that if he saves the world that they can "do it in the asshole"? Come on! It's such a lame thing to say and feels forced in there. (no pun intended)Bottom Line: Skip this movie. If you read this whole review, many thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman , follows an elite team of spies appointed in order to stop crisis around the world and the recruitment in to their ranks of Exjy ,who as all hero journey go becomes awesome and kicks ass. This time the villain that the agency has to stop is Samuel E, Jackshon ,who is a billionaire Eco-terrorist who has as goal to kill a respectable present of the world population, something like the Nick Fury turns bad and he is hilarious!As for the action, is extreme well choreograph, the stunts, the gore, the kills are so well make that is like the comic book ,tha this series is based came to life. What I loved was that all these agents, huntsmen (and women) are in love with spy movies and they brag about it. Everyone from Austin Power to Borne and the granddaddy of them all (possible that is true;)) James Bond are mentioned both as role model and poking fun to some of the plots holes that they have in their stories.The dialogues are also very well written (I suspect Tarantino has put his hands in to that) and the changing between the polite British tone and the ripped fire cursing made me laugh my ass off. The great result must be from the fact that everyone must had a blush working their and it was apparent to the way the characters were reacting to their environment (bonus fact to work their ,you could work beside Mark Hamil himself!).In the end is a enjoyable spy film ,with elements of spoof films of old and I recommended to all, just make sure that in the company you don't have a person with a wick stomach, did I mention the gore?

		<shortDescription>Great Followup to Kick-Ass.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson, Mark Strong: Matthew Vaughn's lighter followup to Kick-Ass. This one is less graphic yet similar in style and violence. It regards legacy and stars Colin Firth as agent Harry Hart who loses a fellow agent in the film's opening rescue attempt. Guilt ridden, Hart delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow and infant son. This kid grows up and ends up being recruited as a possible agent through an encounter with Hart. He and several other youths are trained and it comes down to two recruits. Central plot regards an Internet millionaire who implants a SIM card in various individuals that results in outburst of violence. One scene, which occurs inside a hate group church is amongst the best footage Vaughn has ever shot, in its slow motion chaos and theme music. Vaughn's other worthy credits include X-Men: First Class and Stardust. Firth plays it straight as Hart whose appearance in the thick glasses, suit and umbrella denies his true abilities. Samuel L. Jackson dressed in an orange jump suit and cap on backwards steals scenes as this profane outrageous villain with a female sidekick whose legs are blades. Taron Egerton plays the young lead whose struggles merge with surprise when he must take centre stage when chaos threatens. Sophie Cookson as agent Roxy is fetching but underwritten. Mark Strong is featured from Kick-Ass but doesn't elevate beyond the standard role. Theme is identity and taking the secret agent clichés to a harrowing climax that does this inventive visual comedy tremendous service. Score: 8 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern unconventional adult, bloody and funny, 007 style movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I was really surprised about this movie. Indeed, I expected the usual 007 agents spies or superhero alike movie with the usual stale recipe, and so I waited to rent it, with no hurry at all but, I was happily wrong. This movie takes the genre and put it in a more modern respectfulness but funny, uncensored and violent way.It twists and distorts the usual clichés in a timely and funny shape, it uses very funny villains, amazing fight bloody hilarious scenes and no stop action. Some people, as me, expected a usual family secret agents movie, but, this is not that and, instead, this is exactly why I liked it. Some viewer have been offended by the bloody scene inside the church, but I found it more fun just because irreverent, bloody funny and completely unexpected. It's a bit like what could be a Tarantino's secret agent film. Of course it is exaggerated in every aspect, a caricature, a cartoon. Of course it is an overly violent film, but, if you take it for what it is - an ADULT comic - and you understand this movie want to be deliberately contemptuous and unconventional, you cannot say it is not perfectly crafted. In spite of all the usual spy agent hero movies, its strong point is that it's outside the box and for this reason unexpected, surprising and entertaining.A flawless in its (new) kind, a modern bloody and funny 007 style movie.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I hoped, political bias was annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action wasn't as thrilling. Seriously, if action scenes don't contain elements of realism, the fabrication of the whole thing overshadows the entertaining value. The story line was good. Acting was good. Action scenes were lame.Clearly the writers have strong disdain for U.S. Republicans, Christians, and anyone who doesn't fall for the Al Gore-ish theory on global warming. Taking jabs at both sides of the political spectrum is always a good way to get laughs, but targeting only one side through use of unfounded exaggerations is more of an annoyance. Was waiting for MSNBC to appear in the writing credits.Looking forward to seeing what roles Sophie Cookson will play in the future. She's a pretty girls with a strong resemblance to Kiera Knightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must advocate for everyone, everyone, to watch this movie. I cannot, in 5000 words or less, convey to you how amazing it is and how many different aspect points from the spectrum of the genre it incorporates -- entirely to the benefit of the viewer. If you've seen the viral snippet with Colin Firth in the church, I can tell you that the entire scene is THE ultimate perfection in cinematic history. It is funny, violent, irreverent, violent in a Tarantino sort of way, punny, action wrought with gratuitous violence, oh so wrong, perfectly scripted, amazingly executed (save, I don't know why the lisp), and absolutely NOT what you would expect from a British film of this genre. It's not that kind of movie. I mean it has an unexpected Colin Firth, Commodore Norrington, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, an unexpected Samuel L. Jackson, and the Princess of Sweden. None of that makes any sense as far as casting, and it's PERFECT. I expect thanks.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman is just what you would hope for from a modern, British, secret agent flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's got a solid story with strong acting and a great cast. It has good humour, plenty of violence, bad language, stunning cinematography and perfect pacing. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie; I avoided it at the time of release as I dismissed it, under the opinion that I wouldn't enjoy it. However, it was impossible to avoid the glowing reviews, so I went into watching this movie intrigued if it would live up to its reputation. First off, the casting and character selection is very impressive, Colin Firth in particular shows us again his splendid acting abilities. He is the perfect choice for the role he played, in my opinion. The lead character, who the story focuses around - Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton), does a good job playing his character, although I personally found him very irritating. He plays a young chavvy youth, making the transition from street kid to secret agent. He brings the urban language, attitude and temperament to the service which is very out of place but necessary for the story. Samuel L Jackson plays the bad guy very well. The quirkiness and style portrayed is fun to see and fits the style of the movie well. Michael Caine, Mark Strong and all the other supporting cast don't feel out of place (if not a little stereotypical from some of them), they still do a notable job.It is refreshing to see a movie of this genre so well made with a strong cast, not hold back when it comes to violence. The violence in the movie is one of the most inspiring aspects, it isn't over the top and you never feel like it has gone 'too far' but it is certainly more graphic than your average mainstream movie of this genre. There is a church scene in particular which stands out for me, it has a perfectly choreographed, one camera shot, fluid moving scene which is simply perfect. It's violent, with some surprisingly fresh martial arts and a cool choice of music to go with it!Kingsman: The Secret Service is different to your usual run of the mill spy movie. It's hard to explain until you watch it, but it's got a certain spin on it, it's quirky, funny and makes many references to other spy movies and how this is a parody. Not in the sense of Austin Powers but it does make tongue in cheek references to James Bond, with some striking similarities. It has style, a fun and quirk edge and it is beautifully made with a plausible run time of just under 2 hours. Believe the hype and give this movie a watch. It's definitely worth your time!8/10P.S. The outrage that seems to have swept the internet over the very last scene (so much so, that some versions of this movie have the scene removed) is nothing short of ridiculous. It's political correctness gone mad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen anything by this director and will not seek out any of his other films. I had such high hopes for this movie but sadly we saw it all with the first actions by Colin Firths character. I loved seeing him in such an action scene, It was fun to watch, totally unexpected, and great fun. Sadly it was downhill from there. Samuel L Jacksons character was so horribly creepy, I felt he was wasted in such a ridiculous role. Maybe he had fun with it. I was surprised with all the positive reviews, based on them I watched and ignored the bad reviews, the trailer looked like fun. I do not recommend this at all, I have such a hard time picking out a movie that I like, that a director made his best possible film: thought about his actors not looking bad for being in his film.i think I'm putting ethics on the movie makers, I should stop doing that.</fullReview>

Doesn't work. Samuel Jackson is sooooo over exposed.

		<fullReview>True story. I saw the film in August 2015 just after catching President Obama's speech to the nation on the evils of Global Warming and his "plan" to save the planet. And although I usually try to avoid sinking into states of Deep Irony I could not help but notice how similar that speech was to Sam Jackson's in this film when he explains his own unique view on saving the planet... just saying...The film itself: Is what I have called in the past a "bumblebee" movie in that on paper it should not work, but wow in real life it does.The ultimate iteration of the 1960s pseudo spy thrillers (OUR MAN FLINT) with the perennially overexposed Sam Jackson doing yet another variation of his character in UNBREAKABLE and in fact he did a better job in the earlier film.Yet the production values are so sharp, so superb, so technically perfect that, with a tight script and great acting, the whole thing works a treat and may possibly be one of the most entertaining films of the decade</fullReview>

I personally was upset because I and the people who are watching were trying to avoid that and it didn't say anything about nudity at red box or on this site! I suggest that if you want to watch this movie, and you don't want a crude stupid British movie, then step away from the red box or your distributor and look for something else. The humor was super lame with a lot of weird dark twists. I'm not sure anyone outside of England would find this funny or laugh, unless it was a nervous laugh.Please I beg you stay away and you won't watch something you will regret. Phew! I'm done.

I don't understand how it can get a 7.9 rating on IMDb...unless the majority of people voting are in that age group. This doesn't come close to films like Blade Runner ( 8.2 ) or Easy Rider ( 7.4 ) which have featured in the top 100 films of all time for the last 30 years yet receive a similar score....I think there is something fundamentally wrong with the rating system. Kingsman will have disappeared without a trace within a couple of weeks and not even make the top 1000... ever...so I can only assume that the rating will decline over time as people grow wiser with age or more film enthusiasts start voting.</fullReview>

I don't mean to offend those that find this movie interesting, but I don't advise anyone else to watch this.

Colin Firths character Cares about the kid, has kept an eye on him his whole life, has the means to help him but never does.. oh but as long as he has a stupid necklace and remembers a stupid saying the help will always be there if he needs it.. seriously.. but I guess if he helped the kid and his family we wouldn't have the mom getting beat sub plot of the criminal background.. which they only hint at but you never really feel like he is a criminal other than stealing the car.. so I'm guessing because he never used the stupid necklace and saying before he was never really a criminal... or a pickpocket like the movie suggests he is.. otherwise he would have used the get out of jail necklace a long time ago... also like every movie the main character needs to make a huge change.. from thug to gentleman.. only he never got the training to act like a gentleman, but that doesn't stop him from acting like one out of nowhere.. did they cut that scene from the movie?? was it a little too Mrs congeniality for a R rated movie? all in all this movie was just terrible.. graphic violence while trying to make it seem playful and funny can be done.. but you weren't even close.. it seems like Matthew Vaughn has a huge Tarantino crush and he was trying to get his attention by butchering his style.. if you're not a nerd that loves ridiculous violence you won't like this film.. you'll especially hate it if you're a feminist.. or a woman in general.. unless you like women basically being portrayed as whores who's only purpose is to give anal sex after being rescued..</fullReview>

I'm shocked, I'm confused, I have no words to describe my negative emotions about the level of the modern audience. This movie is boring, dumb and even dumber, jokes are stupid. It's kind of parody, but it fails to be a parody like "naked gun". Again, because the jokes are old and not funny. I even fail to see who is the target audience for this movie, because some jokes should be rated. If the target audience is an American brainless kid of 12, I can understand, but then I question the age of the reviewers here. To sum up, if you don't want to be disappointed, just give a miss to this terrible piece of movie making. This is my sincere advice.

		<fullReview>What to say about Kingsman?, let me put it this way ... If offered a choice between watching Kingsman and bathing in sulphuric acid I would urge you to choose the acid bath - it will be a far less painful experience. How on earth did top drawer actors like Michael Caine, Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson get dragged into it? We're they drugged or blackmailed ? Those are the only explanations I can think of. The film just doesn't know what it wants to be - should it be a serious, edgy thriller? Should it be a rollicking adventure like Men in Black (which incidentally it shamelessly steals from)? Should it be a modern take on the bond theme. In the end it just turns out to be a steaming pile of ordure - note to the film's director and/or editor - if your movie is in trouble and you're not quite sure which direction to go with it don't, repeat don't, just fill it with expletives and exploding heads in the hope that you make it 'edgy'. It won't save your movie, it really won't. It will just show how bereft of ideas and talent you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT and WARNING They were lobbing f-bombs at you on par with the quantity in the Die Hard movies. They used the 'bait and switch' method of advertising in their trailer. The trailer would have you believe Colin Firth saved a kid from the streets as in Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker, Agent Kay and Agent Jay, Enders Game, etc. You see that trailer and that is what you are expecting. Then you get in there and a lot more cursing is going on than you expected. Then the last scene in the movie is graphic anal sex. Is this the best you can do after 100 years of cinematography? Crude for the sake of it. The man sitting next to me got up and left shortly before the end of the movie. I thought surely it can't be that much longer, he couldn't wait to go to the rest room. He never came back. I guess he'd been warned about the last scene being so vulgar. I wish I'd read the reviews before I went so I would have left when he did, or not gone at all. I'm so tired of CGI. Newsflash movie makers real people can't fly sideways for 20 feet. I will be finding out who made this movie, and I will be making sure not to try anything else of theirs until it is so old it has been reviewed to within an inch of its life, so I'll know of any vulgarities so I can decide for myself and not have it sprung on me with no warning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having really enjoyed/loved 'X Men: First Class' and 'Kick Ass' and being someone who likes a lot of the actors, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' did seem really intriguing.There was the intrepidation of whether it would balance the violence and humour well, whether the violence would feel too much or whether the humour would leave a bad taste in the mouth. Finally watching it, 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was surprisingly brilliant. It sends up the spy genre (primarily James Bond), very like 'Kick Ass did with comic books, and does so brilliantly.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is stylishly and audaciously made, with slick visual effects, very imaginative camera work and editing in the action scenes that gives the film an almost operatic grandeur (like in the fight scene in the church), very cool gadgets, richly coloured lighting and audacious production design. The soundtrack is very groovy and catchy, but is careful not to be overbearing, it is far from one-note too and fits with everything going on very well.Vaughn does a fine job directing here. Not just achieving the right balance of humour and violence (injecting much needed fun into a genre that has become increasingly serious over the years) and keeping the story absorbing and the characters interesting, but standing out in particular were how he properly allows the audience to properly take in what is happening in the action, without jumping around incoherently or being static, and the huge amount of work that he even puts into the little things like with the opening credits.The film's script is deliciously irreverent, sometimes raunchy, unrelentingly vulgar and very witty, with a plethora of laugh-out-loud funny to hilarious moments. While the action is grim and unflinching (some of it is not for the faintest of hearts) but nail-biting and surprisingly dynamic, the fight scene in the church especially standing out. The story is very clever and absorbing, with incredibly energetic pacing without being too hectic or rushed. The film does deal with the twist well, it could easily have been out-of-place, clichéd or overly silly but it's actually a lot of fun with a touch of humanity injected.'Kingsman: The Secret Service' contains some very memorable characters, including a hench-woman with legs that can kill. It's very well acted too, three of the standouts being Colin Firth, cast against type but doing a phenomenal job (also doing incredibly well in the action), Taron Egerton as an immensely likable main lead and Samuel L. Jackson (though his performance has divided reviewers it seems and understandably), who is clearly having the time of his life as lisping megalomaniac villain Valentine. That is not to dispute Michael Caine, who is more than dependable as a somewhat ambiguous sort of character, and Mark Strong who has a knack of making even weak material interesting, or Sophie Cookson, very fetching though in a slightly underwritten role, and Sofia Boutella who nobody wants to mess with.If there is something that lets 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' down it is the ending with the anal sex. This was the one part of the film that to me came over as really unnecessary and tasteless, also seeming very out of place compared to the rest of the material and it is introduced randomly. The infamous Princess line is pretty offensively perverse as well.All in all, though, a surprisingly brilliant send up that does nearly everything right. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

You won't want to get off.... It does get silly - make no mistake, Samuel L Jacksons character is just daft and it all ends up in silliness! But that doesn't matter!!!

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is totally awesome! As a kid who grew up watching action films or fantasy films like Star Wars, I feel like a kid again with all those jam-packed action scenes. It was beyond what I expected. Usually with a spy film, it is just your typical protagonist trying to save the world by being on an undercover mission or an underground organization. While some cliché formulas are seen in Kingsman: The Secret Service, how they are interpreted throughout the film is a huge refreshment for me. I always kinda like the idea that this movie is like a James Bond film but with a more violent and brutal yet hilarious tone and the movie didn't let me down. Visually, the movie is appealing! The colors used will give you really that rich secret agent feeling that is ready to kick some ass. The plot is basically predictable for your typical spy film but that same formula works in this film. Truly, this film is literally nerve-wracking and crazy which is pretty damn good.Matthew Vaughn once again that he knows what he is doing with his work. Looking back at his past films like Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011), we can surely admit that this movie is an addition to his epic portfolio. Without a doubt, Kingsman: The Secret Service is his most violent yet hilarious movie he has done throughout his career. Comics turned movies about superheroes is this industry's quick way to have a good fortune but sometimes the adaptation is just taken too seriously. But this movie has a perfect mixed of awesomeness, vulgar, and tragedy which is every superhero movie should like (especially if it is an R-rated movie). Colin Firth, the guy who usually takes dramatic roles, is a big surprise in this film because of being a total bad-ass. This film will make you realize how really good he is as an actor. Also, the biggest breakout star in 2015 is in this film, and his name is Taron Egerton portraying the role of Eggsy. He has so much charm and energetic vibe that it will not be a surprise if we will see him in some other major films to come. The fight scenes are remarkable and eye-pleasing. The way the scenes are over-the-top suites well in the whole movie and it is too awesome for anyone not to see. The scenes are really brutal for the fact that there are too many blood, parts cut off, and people that are literally cut into half. But Vaughn did the scenes like it's just a comic relief in the film.In the end, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a must watch! Just don't let the minors watch because it is a foul-mouthed, vulgar film. I am a little disappointed that it hasn't earned an Oscar nomination for Sound Mixing. But nevertheless, it doesn't need an Oscar Nomination for it to be acclaimed. This film is the best spy film for 2015!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEST FILM OF 2015!!I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this movie through work a month before it's release in Australia.This film was first brought to my attention at WonderCon when a rough first trailer was shown and I was instantly interested.The cast is absolutely brilliant with top-notch performances by newcomer Taron Egerton, Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong and Michael Caine.There are heaps of pop culture references throughout the film, the fight scenes are a cross between the 1960's TV show 'The Avengers' and Black Widow's fighting skills, hilariously funny and a lot more violent than I thought it was going to be (no complaints here!).I don't think I have one bad thing to say about this film and I could have easily turned back around and watched it again.I WILL be seeing this again when it's released in cinemas and it will 100% be a day one purchase, when it's released on Blu-ray!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fantastic 2 hours of entertainment! I'm not normally a fan of this genre of film but I found Kingsman impossible to dislike. It's the perfect mix of action and comedy with an interesting plot.Yes, it's silly, especially the ending, but it's not intended to be taken too seriously. In fact, it wouldn't be half the movie it is without the humour - it would just be another generic spy movie. The cast are terrific, Colin Firth in particular delivers an excellent performance as spy agent Harry Hart.Kingsman is a fun movie that fulfills its action comedy tag brilliantly. If you're looking for a serious spy movie though, this isn't it. Watch James Bond instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a comic book shooter with a great story. It runs a bit too long because of its over the top violent content. There's a good strain of political irony involved here too. In the name of saving the planet from global warming, the evil villain seeks to cull the herd by turning everyone into a homicidal maniac. But Samuel L. Jackson's aside to the camera says it all, "It isn't that kind of movie." Truly my I can say my head nearly exploded over the preceding scene, and stopped only because I realized it was indeed a comic book shooter. If you're going to enjoy a movie like this you have to give yourself up to the experience.Otherwise, I agree it's revolting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent satire of spy films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike many people, I was not surprised having enjoyed this movie as much as I did. I love Matthew Vaughn, the cast is great, the trailers excited me even more, and the film did not disappoint. The writing is extremely clever, the characters are all so likable, the action is entertaining to watch, great comedy is constantly thrown at you (both subtle and over the top), and the satirical element (of spy films, of course) is incredibly well done. It also works as a spy film, and a good one at that. Some scenes were amazing and hilarious to watch, in particular, the church scene (it's probably one of my favorite cinematic moments of 2015). Kingsman works as a popcorn film, but it's also very satirical and intelligent. It isn't flawless, though (even though I'm making it sound like it is). Some of the jokes fall flat and a few scenes are a bit out of place, but the good most definitely outweigh the bad, so I suggest you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For what it is, an action-comedy about spies, there is awesome action, genuinely funny moments and plenty of spy-like things going on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film deserves to call itself an action-comedy because the action in this action- comedy is awe-inspiring. It seems as if every other scene has some sort of dismemberment in it. Visually, Kingsman is stunning, especially in these action sequences. There is no limit to the blood that director Matthew Vaughn can bring to your face, with fingers being blown off at some points and large wooden spikes being shoved up a racist, homophobic reverend at others. Paired with this like fine wine, the soundtrack to these sequences feel like a coked up serial killers Thursday playlist, that is not a bad thing.Colin Firth wasn't exactly "born" to play Harry Hart, as it contrasts with virtually every other role he has played. It could seem as if Firth isn't really cut out to be an action star, and if you think that, Colin Firth will probably come to your house and kill you stylishly with your own household objects, probably involving some sort of laceration or dismemberment, because you would be wrong. As well as mastering the tried and true sophisticated act he's known for, Firth also brings an aura of sophistication when he burning people's faces and smashing glasses also into faces. Let's just say, if you are a bad guy in Kingsman, your face is not safe from something Colin Firth will dish out, take that in the most innocent way you can, please.Moreover, Taron Egerton also stands out as Eggsy. Where Firth brings the action, Egerton brings the comedy with his dumbfounded new view of all of the action that is suddenly happening around him. He remains true to his character throughout and has cheeky quips for every situation. Joining him in bringing the comedy, Samuel L. Jackson plays Richmond Valentine, the eccentric villain with a dastardly plan that I'm still not going to tell you about because I JUST cannot be assed, y'know? Please forgive me.I think that's it. Time for a summary.Kingsman is really good. I actually can't think of a bad word to say about it. For what it is, an action-comedy about spies, there is awesome action, genuinely funny moments and plenty of spy-like things going on. It is the perfect action-comedy.For more reviews like this one, go to: https://stuffandthatreviews.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fun romp this film was. Oh, sure, it's a typical action film and a lot is predictable and no new ground is broken. However, main character Eggsy is quite likable. Usually characters in this role initially seem unredeemable, but we know he's got what it takes from the start. I guess that's a refreshing change from the usual.It was also fun to see SL Jackson play a very different role than usual. I had to check the trivia section on IMDb to confirm, but I was pretty sure that his lisp in the movie was his own idea. It was.Overall the film manages to have the right balance of comedy and over- the-top action movie violence. It's a great film for an evening you just want to relax and let your mind check out for a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review and I have to say what a fun ride this film is!There are a lot of negative reviews stating that the violence is over the top and that the trailer is misleading....all I can say is who cares? Reading the review I don't care about how "graphic" the violence is, this is a good film and it is just that, a film. It is funny, yet also a great story, I have to admit that I was unsure if this was a film I would enjoy, how wrong I was! If you are looking for 2 hours to take you away from the reality of life and enjoy a good action movie and to see how glorious people's heads exploding can be this is the film for you, if you are looking for a good spy film go and watch a Bond or Bourne film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest spy movie I've ever watched !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a raid in the Middle East in 1997, a probationary secret agent sacrifices himself to save his team. Feeling guilt over the loss of his colleague, Harry Hart, code-named "Galahad", delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow, Michelle Unwin, and her young son, Gary "Eggsy", saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message.Seventeen years later Professor James Arnold is kidnapped by unknown assailants, led by Internet billionaire Richmond Valentine. One of Hart's fellow agents, "Lancelot", attempts to stage a rescue, but is killed by Gazelle, Valentine's henchwoman. Valentine, known for his philanthropy, continues to meet with various heads of state and VIPs, some of whom go missing afterwards. He also announces a giveaway of SIM Smart cards, granting a lifetime of free cellular and Internet access to anyone who wants it.In London, Eggsy is now an unemployed young adult living with his mother, infant half-sister, and abusive stepfather, Dean. Despite being intelligent and capable, he left training for the Royal Marines and lives the aimless life of a stereotypical chav.[6][7] After being arrested for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the number on the back of the medal. Hart arranges for his release and tells Eggsy about his father - both of them were agents of Kingsman; an "independent international intelligence agency" founded in 1919 by a group of British royals who lost their heirs in World War One.In the wake of Lancelot's death, the agency opens a vacancy for a new agent, and Eggsy agrees to apply as Hart's candidate. He joins a group of other candidates including a woman named Roxy, whom he befriends. Training is overseen by "Merlin", a senior Kingsman who acts as teacher, quartermaster, pilot and Ops co-ordinator. The candidates are eliminated one by one until only Eggsy and Roxy remain. Eggsy fails his final test - he is unable to shoot a dog he had raised from a puppy, though the gun was secretly loaded with blanks - and Roxy becomes the new Lancelot.During this time, Kingsman has been investigating Valentine in connection with the VIP disappearances and notes that Arnold is no longer missing. Hart tracks down Arnold and confronts him about his abduction. A chip implanted in Arnold's head explodes, killing him; Hart is injured during his escape from unknown assailants. Undeterred, Hart poses as a billionaire and dines with Valentine to try to discern his plans.Hart tracks Valentine to an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, where Valentine and Gazelle are conducting a test. They broadcast a signal, which triggers Valentine's SIM cards to broadcast a tone that causes everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent. A mass brawl breaks out, with Hart the sole survivor, while Eggsy, Merlin and "Arthur" ? Kingsman's leader ? watch via video link. Valentine approaches Hart and kills him after revealing his plan.Eggsy returns to the Kingsman headquarters, where he discovers that Arthur is one of Valentine's converts. Arthur explains Valentine's views: humanity is akin to a virus, and global warming is the Earth's equivalent of a fever. Valentine intends to kill the virus before it kills the host, broadcasting his signal worldwide to cause a massive culling of the human race. Only a select few that Valentine has deemed worthy of living ? those who have sided with him and thus received the protective microchips in their heads, and the VIPs he kidnapped ? will be spared.After avoiding Arthur's attempt to kill him ? killing Arthur as he does so ? Eggsy teams up with Merlin and Roxy, the new Lancelot. Lancelot pilots a high-altitude balloon vehicle into the stratosphere to disrupt Valentine's satellite network with a missile, while Eggsy and Merlin directly assault Valentine's mountain bunker. Lancelot knocks out the satellite, but Valentine arranges with a business contact to replace the destroyed satellite. Valentine activates the signal, causing global pandemonium.Eggsy and Merlin infiltrate the bunker. Eggsy obtains access to Valentine's computer network for Merlin, but is nearly captured by a disgraced Kingsman candidate who recognizes him. Eggsy is later surrounded by the guards, but Merlin activates a security protocol in Valentine's chip implants, explosively killing everyone except Valentine and Gazelle. Eggsy fights Gazelle and kills her with a poison-tipped blade concealed in his shoe. Eggsy then manages to kill Valentine by throwing one of Gazelle's prosthetic legs at him, ending the worldwide carnage.Ultimately Eggsy, now a Kingsman, reaches out to his mother, offering her a new home and a chance to get away from Dean. Dean and his subordinates move to attack, but Eggsy waylays Dean in exactly the same manner that Galahad had waylaid one of his henchmen earlier.Go watch the movie guy. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turns The Spy Movie Genre On Its Head, In My 2015 Top 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would love to say that I knew ahead of time that this movie would be so special. But I didn't, I thought the marketing looked good but it did seem like the average action/spy movie story line rebooted. My best friend who seems to have a sixth sense about knowing if a movie will be great insisted on going to see this. I was so taken aback with it I went and saw it the next night with another group of friends, that's how much I liked it. I'm so glad it turned out to be the massive hit it was and I'm excited to talk about it.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* In what is presumably the late 1990s, a compound in the Middle East is raided and several masked men are interrogating a suspect. The interrogation goes south when the hostage detonates an explosive device. But most of the interrogators are saved when a brave solo soldier shields the rest using his body to muffle the blast. Quickly we are introduced to 3 Kingsman agents: Harry Hart "Galahad" (Colin Firth), Merlin (Mark Strong), and Lancelot (Jack Davenport). Harry admits that it was his fault and he just missed that there was an explosive device. He travels back to England and tells the agent's widow Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack) about his demise. She is understandably distraught and while they can't celebrate his heroics Harry promises her a favour, one that has no limitations and that if she calls a specific number, whatever she needs will be done. We also meet young Eggsy (he's just a boy here, the older version of Eggsy is Taron Edgerton) who Harry tells to look after his mother.I could go into the plot further but I don't want to spoil the surprise. I'll go into what makes this movie unique next to so many other spy movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a rare breed of movie where it functions well within the genre (spy movies) by itself but it also pokes fun at the spy movie clichés. It could also be considered a comedy/parody. Kick-Ass (a previous Matthew Vaughn effort which I didn't like as much) is another such film from director Matthew Vaughn and seems to be a hallmark for him. It blends the old spy movie magic (outlandish gadgets, over-the-top villain, gentleman spy) with something new and it does so beautifully. It's so much fun and as the movie says, spy movies have gotten a little serious lately and it was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't afraid to tell some jokes while delivering on the action and the plot.Speaking of the action, this movie has some of the best filmed action I've ever seen. If you have seen the movie, regardless of how you feel morality wise about the church scene, it's astounding how its shot and how horrifyingly violent it is. It really kicked the movie into overdrive for me. Every action scene in this movie is unique and beautifully filmed, stylistically it's as much as you could have asked for.Talking about the acting next, Kingsman features some really outstanding performances. I can't believe Colin Firth is so good in this movie. He's always been a good actor but I never would have thought he had this in him. He's suave, funny and actually believable as an action hero. Taron Edgerton does a hell of a job considering he was an unknown before this. This is a breakout performance, I'm sure it will lead to many other starring roles. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as the villain, he has the right amount of theatricality yet he's really funny too. I'm a big Samuel fan already but his character and his performance were different from what you would expect and they add memorable aspect to this film. In smaller roles, Mark Hamill, Michael Caine and Sofia Boutella all shine and round out an excellent cast.Some people have found this movie to be offensive, I can see that but it more depends on what you want to get out of this movie. I think one of the reasons this movie is so popular is that it really isn't afraid to go there. There's so many violent kills, so much joking at the expense of the typical spy plot and there are some pretty filthy jokes (yes there is a taboo sexual joke at the end, I thought it was funny, I guess a lot of people didn't). Not every action feature has to be this unrelenting but I found it to be refreshing and I think judging by the amount of love this movie has gotten from the public, most people agree.I saw Kingsman: The Secret Service twice in theatres, I bought the Blu Ray and I've watched it many times since. This is a truly great spy movie which finds the right mix of action and comedy and the balance between the familiar and the new. It commits to the story yet is still outstanding to watch because of some bold stylistic choices. I'm stoked for the sequel and it can't get here soon enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action Film I've Seen Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is such a silly film, but it embraces that and, out of that, creates one of the most fun and entertaining action films yet.Part of the reason why I'm giving this film 10 stars is that it contains perhaps the greatest action sequence I've ever seen in any film. I'm still absolutely stunned by how the scene was executed, and I saw the film more than three months ago; I assure anyone that the action sequences are unlike anything they've ever seen before. The careful camera-work, the choreography, the high-octane music, EVERYTHING fits so well to create the ultimate violent action sequence. I mustn't spoil it.The other reasons I enjoyed the film follows: Colin Firth takes on the role as Harry Hart, a member of an international spy organization dedicated to protecting peace in the world. Firth takes on the role with enough seriousness and heart (Hart) to make the film engaging and fun. He steals every scene he is in, and his action sequences are the best ones in the film, but I'll get to that later.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays the new recruit Eggsy, a rebel with a lot of heart and dedication to his family and friends. Egerton makes him instantly likable as the lead and spawns the right emotions to help the audience almost instantly know his feelings and the tone of the film.The story overall is a typical formulaic spy plot, though Vaughn adds some more contemporary and ideological elements and twists (that have taken popularity with superhero films lately) into it to make the film more different and exciting from the stereotype James Bond films.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a roller coaster of a film, that seems to pick up and slow down at the perfect moments. The story is fun and dynamic, and the action is impeccable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delivers over-the-top fun, the way that Bond used to.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Miark Millar's comic, The Secret Service (with artist Dave Gibbons, of Watchmen fame), was being turned into a movie, I had a pretty good idea of what we wood get: a lot of vulgar language, over-the-top violence, and a decent plot. What surprised me was how much felt like a tribute to the glory years of James Bond, far more than anything from Eon and MGM. It revels in what made Bond great fun, while adding a modern spin. It also pokes fun at the often pompous, upper class world of Bond and espionage fiction (and reality) and doesn't take itself too seriously. It is vulgar and ridiculously violent, though the violence does tend to be more in service to the story than some of Millar's other work.Mathew Vaughn direct; unsurprising, after Kick-Ass; but, as he showed in the early segments of X-Men: First Class, he gets spy-fi and delivers it well. He's not too overboard with the jump cuts and does let you soak up some of the screen, before throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you. I do wish he would slow things down a bit, here and there; but, it's a modern film world.Colin Firth is the linchpin that holds the film together and presents us with a cross between James Bond and John Steed, either of whom he would have played wonderfully. In fact, I wish we had a time machine and take Vaughn and Firth back and redo The Avengers (the Ralph Finnes and Uma thurman one, not Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the rest). Michael Caine provides a nice tribute to the golden days, as Harry Palmer's glasses also seem to figure into the formula, while Caine gets to play the toff (though his accent slips in his last scene). Vaughn brings back Mark Strong to show why he is greatly under-appreciated in Hollywood (the man is a great actor and has been since at least Prime Suspect 3). Taron Egerton makes an excellent young Eggy, while Sophie Cookson is the capable, but self-doubting Roxy. On the bad guy's side we have Samuel L. Jackson, as a sort of Richard Branson crossed with Bill Gates and Russell Simmons, with a dash of megalomania. he is aided by his henchperson, Sophia Boutella, as Gazelle, the most memorable sidekick/assassin since Oddjob. All do a wonderful job.This has just about everything I felt had been missing from Bond, for years (even before Daniel Craig and the serious tone): a great villain, plenty of action and intrigue, a sense of humor, and a sense of danger. Modern Bond has the danger and intrigue, but has lost the sense of humor and the sheer fun of a super-agent. There hasn't been a memorable Bond villain in years, yet Samuel L Jackson delivered a great gonzo billionaire, where Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce struggled.I can quibble about a few things; some of the violence would be better left to the imagination and the language really doesn't add much; but, on the whole, those are minor criticisms. The characters are engaging, the plot is entrancing and the action is well staged and rarely gratuitous. This is pure cinematic fun, with a dose of brainpower. I can't wait for more.</fullReview>

An action comedy that pays homage to all the classic spy movies. One of the most entertaining movies of the year. Colin Firth is amazing in his role as Gallahad. Has one of the best "fight" scenes ever to be put on screen.Never knew Colin Firth would be a good action hero. The fight scene in the cabin at the beginning of the movie sets the tone for the entire movie. Heard there is sequel in the talks which I am skeptical about, hope they do not ruin the first movie with the second.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bargain Basement Bond For The Brain Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing a clip from Kingsman a year before the film came out. It was that great fight scene in the pub and it generated loads of excitement and anticipation in the crowd that viewed it at Wondercon. Who knew that scene was the highlight of the whole movie and it all went down the drain from there like a sludgy turd?It's simply amazing to me that a film that should have been such can't miss material managed to do almost everything wrong. Dumb, predictable, crude, sexist, unfunny to anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature and violent to the point of grotesque, Kingsman just devolves from scene to scene into a miasma of stupid.I generally have no problem with movie violence, but Kingsman simply disgusted me. When a film tries to sell itself as a quirky Bond send-up, suddenly dumping a metric ton of Evil Dead-esque hack and slashing (most of which is being committed by the film's ostensible hero) pretty much destroys the tone and makes clear that the filmmakers haven't a clue what they're doing. The pathetic stabs at unPC satire are, likewise, amateurish and eyeroll-inducing.Probably the single biggest dim-bulb move, however, is systematically killing off anyone in the cast remotely interesting, including the nominal star, Colin Firth, who is denied the dignity of even making it as far as the final half hour (though it's entirely possible he insisted on it after reading through the whole script).Since everything these days, no matter how vile and utterly devoid of merit it may be, is granted a sequel, we will apparently be getting a Kingsman 2. And how thrilling to know it will star the bland, charisma-free twenty-something leftovers from K1, whose names and faces I'm struggling to recall even though I watched the film less than an hour ago. Yes, nothing says a good time at the cinema like watching the human equivalent of vanilla pudding.In sum, if you really want to see a Bond-like film, go see a Bond film! Or watch the British Avengers series, or The Incredibles, or track down a copy of In Like Flint. Anything up to and including watching test patterns and infomercials for incontinence care would be time better spent than watching this thing.</fullReview>

It left me with regret that I lost the time to watch it. I still wonder does really any one enjoy all this bloody and long long fighting scenes. I just followed this movie because it appeared in IMDb as liked from people who liked The man from U.N.C.L.E. Well I can disagree 100% with such comparison. This movie is just another bad movie!

		<fullReview>There are times when you are interested in watching a spy movie and you end being disappointed. But Kingsmen: The Secret service not only took disappointment to another level but also made sure that people love this stupid story. The trailers says, from the maker of Xmen: The first class. The makers must be ashamed of the work they have done. It was like the director smoked up a pot and wrote the whole story. Not only that, the producers while listening to the script must have thought that we should not experiment with this, but then they too must have been swayed by the same idiotic pot. Besides cool action and some heroic type fighting, there's nothing in the movie. It's a total waste of time and money. I feel like burning the DVD or else I would try and bargain with the shopkeeper to give me a discount on some other DVD, but I guess he won't even give it because he knows people would watch it online instead of buying such believe-it-or-not bu*****t film. KUDOS to everyone!! Their efforts didn't go waste as many have rated the movie above 7. Seems like the pot is really dangerous and effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting something in the way of a James Bond spoof having only seen a 30 second trailer, how wrong can you be. Instead I got a crazy, mad, violent, nutty and over the top film. It has a definite Britishness to it, it's a very smart looking production, very well acted, with some jaw dropping fight scenes, the visuals and production values are extremely high. The fights involving Sofia Boutella were just insane, she's particularly good. Some big casting, Colin Firth as always makes the perfect gentleman. It's Samuel L Jackson I particularly enjoyed, he was just so funny. Lots of violence, which if it's not your thing you should avoid. Overall, slick and very funny. The world is saved by a chav!! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It should be on the list " the worst movies ever "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the dumbest movie I've seen in the last couple of years.Extremely violent just to be violent, totally cliché plot with some completely ridiculous scenes- blowing up the heads of all the "bad" politicians or the main character going to have sex with Swedish princes after his main "battle"... All that not only didn't add any value to my life, it actually made me angry that this kind of "toilet paper movies" are being produced and as I can see it in many comments, viewers still loved it (it seems like people will buy any bullshit story as long as it based on the comic book-which seems to me as bad as the movie itself).The cast must have been well paid to actually agree on playing in that crap.</fullReview>

Jane Goldman's brilliant writing in Kick Ass 1 &amp; 2 is definitely not echoed here in any way, shape or form...unbelievable! What were Colin Firth &amp; Michael Caine thinking of appearing in this epic fail???

		<fullReview>I don't understand how this movie got such high ratings, it's was pretty bad! I gave it two stars only because it had some good actors &amp; the main character was hot! It started with promise, &amp; then took a big dump! I didn't really mind the violence, but most of it was so unnecessary, dragged out and stupid! The graphics sucked, &amp; the story line just fell apart. Just so ridiculous &amp; unbelievable. The hero receives no training, but suddenly turns into an untouchable badass, WTF? Samuel L was just annoying, &amp; useless. The end scene with the princess came out of nowhere &amp; was just crude &amp; stupid. Someone should get slapped for leaving that scene in the movie! I just can't believe what a fraud this movie turned out to be. The trailer just made it seem like a completely different movie. I really wanted to like it, I did. I'm embarrassed for everyone involved in this movie, but hey I'm sure they got paid to make this painfully bad movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Brow Stuff. Entertaining? Hardly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A British Secret Service recruits teenagers to become Kingsman Super Agents. Code names are used by this Service ala King Arthur time. Harry aka Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) later known as Lancelot. Valentine (Samual L. Jackson) is a multi billionaire bent on reducing earth's population via a Culling but saving an elite few. And this is accomplished by a chip inserted into people causing them to fight to the death when the chip is activated. Ah, the promos did it again. They promised a good spy story mimicking Bond James Bond and other spy films. The first half was pretty good. The choreography during the fights was outstanding. We see the training of recruits vying for the new Kingsman Agent position. Then the second half degraded into mass murders in a Church and these murders went on for too long a time, fights breaking out all over the world, later we see exploding heads worldwide, and let's not forget a mother with knife in hand trying desperately to get through a bathroom door to kill her child within. This is entertainment? Hardly. The ending showed us the lure of anal sex as a reward for Eggsy for saving the planet. Again, this is entertainment? Hardly. Notables: Michael Caine as Arthur, the head of the Kingsman Secret Service; Mark Strong as Merlin, Arthur's henchman; and Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle is an amputee that now has knives for legs and her choreography is brilliant. Okay, so if there is another Kingsman Secret Service movie we will know what to expect and not pay any attention to the promos. (2/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, a female behind. Language: Yes and much of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sickening Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out feeling just like what I'd expect from a spy movie with Colin Firth and Michael Caine in the cast. The story line and characters in this comic-book film are interesting enough. All the spectacular special effects, high tech, and newfangled spy gadgets are great fun. Even the villain with the crazy knife feet is intriguing. The psychological thrills that play out as the next new Kingsman is chosen are also well done. But then the unspeakable gratuitous violence takes over. I usually very much enjoy spy films; I expected this one to be entertaining a la Men In Black, Mission: Impossible, or James Bond. Instead, it quickly becomes Pulp Fiction ~ for no reason whatsoever ~ a huge betrayal. Pornographic violence. Vapid female characters. An inappropriate sexual scene. All utterly unnecessary and truly disgusting. All attempts at humor or artistry fall flat. Shame on Colin Firth and Michael Caine for being in this movie, from whom I expect so much more. Should be rated X.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the misfortune to watch this movie on a plane.Seeing that it has a rating of 7.9, which is dangerously close to what movies in the top 250 of all time rate, I felt an urge to write a review and contribute to redress this score.Despite the prestigious cast, the movie is exceptionally low on everything. I don't mind violence when it's part of the drama (or the suspension of belief), so I don't think that violence takes anything away from the movie. The problem is that there is almost nothing to take away.The story is appalling, the characters are cringe-worthy, the only enjoyable thing is Colin Firth's suit (but the same suit fitting a youngster with half the class of Firth is looking actually quite poor), the humour is dadsjokesque, and the ending is, to be generous, atrocious. I also found a lot of crass ignorance and obtuse projection of its fictional world. As if we needed obtuse fictional worlds.What about the performances? Argh! I think Jack Davenport's is the best, but only because he does not get enough time on screen to spoil it. Michael Caine holds water, barely, better not to talk about the rest.If you put 007 on one side and Austin Powers on the other, this movie is located precisely in the trash bin, where it should stay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You will feel ashamed for watching this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read the reviews, you can quickly see there are two audiences out there.One audience unabashedly loves ultra-violent films, and to some extent, finds the violence itself entertaining. That audience loves this film.However, for everyone else, this film is a bit stomach-churning. For many reasons.As every reviewer has noted, this film is over-the-top violent. Clearly the film makers loved putting the explicit gore on the screen, to the extent that they didn't worry too much about plot or dialog or consistency. Most of what little plot exists was just an excuse to put more extreme violence on the screen.I was tempted to give this film a higher score, like 2 or 3 out of ten, because of Samuel Jackson's character. Oddly, as the villain, he was one of the few people on the screen you really empathize with. But I have to give this the lowest score possible to warn people who might otherwise mistake this for a watchable film.Don't see this film. If you have seen it and didn't like it, make sure you post a negative review.I saw this film mostly because of the high score on IMDb, which I now realize is because the ratings are jacked up by the few fans of the film, not the general audience. I will not make the mistake of paying attention to IMDb ratings again. The low metacritic score (58/100) is a slightly better indication, but still too high in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tasteless, overlong, unfunny - a complete waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers not do this movie justice. The trailers make it look like a funny, farcical send up of James Bond and action movies in general. Unfortunately, it's very poorly conceived and poorly executed. Even the special effects manage to disappoint. Suffers from a super heavy touch and a complete lack of irony. The few chuckles provided in the script are completely lost in a sea of bloody, hyper violence. It's also at least 40 minutes too long with at least two overlong subplots that added nothing to the story or the film experience. Mean spirited in the extreme. Total crap. If watching mothers try to kill their babies with big knives turns you on, you might like this one. Sad to see stars like Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson wasted in such a stinker, although I'm sure they're cashing big checks. This is clearly aimed at boys in the 16 to 20 year old age bracket. The big payoff joke involves anal sex. Really classy way close out the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pre pubescent boys with anger issues will love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can not understand why anyone would enjoy this movie. I actually got up and walked out halfway through. There was so much gratuitous violence that I couldn't stand it. Splattering blood everywhere. In order to explain myself there will be a few spoilers here but I will try and keep them to a minimum. So if you want to be 'surprised' don't read any further. But I wouldn't be surprised if I were you. We were and I am still angry about it. I will say that several of the cast members were very good. The premise of the movie is juvenile. 5 minutes into the movie someone got split in half. This 'gimmick" was repeated later in the movie. Samuel Jackson plays a black billionaire who dresses like Flava Flav and serves McDonald's to who he thinks is a billionaire donor. Seriously? Then there was the whole shoot the dog bit. Really, how original. But when everyone started killing each other in the church I was done. If you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues this movie is right up your alley. I went on line to read what happens at end of the movie and was glad I made the decision to leave the movie. How many times to you blow up a person's head and call it entertainment? It really bothers me that some people find this entertaining. This was one step above a snuff film masquerading as a parody/homage to James Bond. Also am I the only one who got the subliminal message with the Obama look alike who gets killed? Seriously? There are not enough words to describe how bad this movie is. if you enjoy blood and people getting killed rather graphically ad nausea then you will enjoy this movie. If you want to see anything remotely resembling a decent movie you will not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service - the triumph of bad taste. Poor script, poorly executed. The action fake, the play of many actors is weak. Colin Firth is good but Samuel Jackson is ridiculous. The music is just noise. Filthy language in every sentence. It left an impression that the people in this movie don't know any language to express their needs or emotions. Absence of sense of class, taste or style. The first 5 min was intriguing but the following was boring. Frustrated, my children decided to nap but the typhoon of the torturing noise didn't allow them to relax. When the film finally was over people left the room speechless and with relief. Production of such movies is a confusing message to the youth. A terrible disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most entertaining movie of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn's third attempt at a comic book series adaptation after Kick Ass and X-Men movie, and it triumphs over anything he has done previously. I watched this movie a year ago, but I haven't come around to review it yet until now.Granted this movie is not for the oversensitive chaps who go "Awful!" at the tiniest bit of dark comedy and violence. It's for the mature audience who enjoy comedy just for the sake of comedy mixed in with uncensored violence. This movie is what the product would be like if the Bond series had mated with Men in Black. It's offensively funny yet full of tight action that'll thrill you. It was one of those movies where I just went "Darn, this has no flaws". Many movies have tried to break the barrier between comedy and action before yet none has been as successful as this movie in the endeavor. There's specifically a scene halfway through the way which is incredibly offensive yet quintessentially hilarious.Now, on to the casting. Colin Firth? Most people know him because of the amount of romcom and drama he has done in his career. So it's hard to take someone like him in a movie like this seriously right? But he is surprisingly brilliant in this movie. His monotonous countenance is a surprising to say the least. Samuel L Jackson's role might nark off some people but his lisp and hilarious philosophy elevates the movie. Taron Egerton is also a surprising young talent who holds his ground against Academy award winners like Caine and Firth. Sofia Boutella's role is ridiculously thrilling and hilarious as well, as a handicapped woman who walks on bladed prosthetic legs, practices capoeira and cuts down men in two without sweating.As a caveat, I'll warn off people who don't like violence and offensive comedy (AKA black or gallows comedy), this movie is NOT for you. Rather this was tailored made for people who love movies with ridiculous humour and action sequences. One of the best movies of 2015, and undoubtedly the best spy-fi movie of the decade (go ahead Bond fans, lynch me).</fullReview>

The acting was good all around for the most part. There are short bursts of humour which do nice to break up the movie but more could have been focused on it.Bad: All the Kimgsman characters are unlikeable bar two (First Galahad and the Scottish one). I kind of rooted for the villains but that might just be Samuel Jackson's lisp. Some scenes also feel pointless and tacked on.Best Part: The fight scene inside the church was incredible and you can tell how much work was put into it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that appeals to the younger audiences as well as 'traditional' fans of spy flicks. The humour is delightfully surprising, the action plentiful and easy to watch (unlike effects laden blockbusters like 'Transformers') and seeing Samuel L. Jackson tackle a quirky character was just icing on the cake.I don't usually roll in these circles, so I only ended up watching 'Kingsman' because my Dad chucked it on -- and I'm so inexpressibly happy I was too lazy to get up and ended up watching one of the best films of the Summer (if not the year).By far, one of the best films I've watched in a long while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very original action film with great writing, direction, stunts, special effects and acting. It gives numerous homages to the great spy films of the 60's and 70's, especially the Bond films, while simultaneously turning some of their conventions on their heads.The opening scene set to "Money For Nothing" was excellent. I also enjoyed Galahad kicking the s**t out of the thugs in the pub. But the best scene by far was the very colorful exploding heads of the bad guys set to "Pomp and Circumstance"! It sort of reminded my of the Staja scene in "A Clockwork Orange", which was set to the same music. That one made me laugh out loud.But the best thing was that the villain was an Eco Terrorist who thinks more about the planet than human beings. As the late, great George Carlin once said "The planet's not going anywhere. We are." And he's impaled and dies at the end. Too bad Eggsy couldn't have taken out Al Gore at the same time!I'm definitely on board for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Extremely Enjoyable Spy-Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman may just be the most exciting and fun action movie of the year, just like last year's surprise hit, Guardians of the Galaxy. The brilliance of the movie rests in the hands of the writers and their tongue in cheek jokes poking fun at the James Bond franchise, as well as American culture, it's nothing short of amazing. They basically were saying that can do everything the Americans can do (action/over the top fighting), but also while maintaining a high level of sophistication while doing so. That being said, the action in the movie looked pretty great, lots of fluid/continuous action shots with some nice choreography. Surprisingly, almost all of the great action choreography comes from the Colin Firth's character! And of course like any spy movie out there, there need to be cool gadgets for our heroes, and Kingsman is no different. Everything in this movie is 'cool', from their clothing to their weapons (bulletproof suits, bulletproof umbrellas, grenade lighters), the Kingsman are basically the new James Bond.In the end, the movie knows exactly what is is trying to do, poke fun at classic spy thrillers while at the same time maintaining a new hip attitude, something today's younger generation would appreciate. And this is not your typical mind-numbing action thriller either, though not terribly original, Kingsman has a certain amount of style and flair to make it something special (that something special might be its political commentary). Kingsman is sure to be one of the best action movies of the year, no question about it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A secret with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie took a different approach on the usual secret service spy related movie, and it definitely paid off. Instead of seeing an experienced spy, it was a much younger group of new recruits who would go through training to become the one of the experienced elite ones. It was cool to see the beginning times for an agent in the secret service.Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is one of the young recruits for the Kingsman Secret Service. His father was a former spy for the Kingsman, but he was killed during a mission that went wrong. Eggsy was recruited by his father's partner Harry Hart, played by Colin Firth. Hart felt obligated to look after Eggsy because of his father's death.The training challenges were pretty intense and demanding. They were fast paced and rapidly built to high suspense. The fighting choreography was extremely innovative by mixing in parkour throughout the scenes.Overall, this movie surpassed any expectations I had for it based on what was shown in the previews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Enthrawling Action Movies of Recent Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is directed by Matthew Vaughn and stars Taron Egerton as young Eggsy, a teenage street kid that is recruited by a spy organization, and must compete with other recruits in his class in order to become the next Kingsman, a gentleman like spy. Upon being recruited, he befriends an older Kingsman named Galahad, played by Colin Firth, that teaches him the ways of being a Kingsman, and, more importantly, being a gentleman.I actually didn't want to see this movie. I've never been too hot on espionage films, and wasn't looking forward to Kingsman. However, this movie proved me wrong in so many ways. I had an absolute blast watching Kingsman, and so regret not seeing it the theaters. Near everything about this film entertained me, and I was on the edge of my seat through every single action sequence. Kingsman was one of the few movies of recent years in which I had white knuckles through every single action scene, and even most of the talking scenes. Kingsman was an amazing movie, and had great aspects about it.The best thing about Kingsman is the actors' portrayals of the characters. Prior to watching this movie, I doubted Colin Firth as an action hero, but he was fantastic as this gentleman spy. I read that he did 80% of his own stunts, and it really paid off. Taron Egerton was the highlight of this film. He displayed Eggsy's large character arc near perfectly, and delivered every single one of his lines believably. Samuel L. Jackson played a great villain, and was another great attribute that Kingsman had going for it. He pulled off the "evil plan" cliché, while also acknowledging that it was a cliché.The direction by Matthew Vaughn was amazing as well. The way he manipulated the camera to film at varying speeds while weaving in between characters, mid fight, during the action sequences was excellent. He brought every scene to life so vibrantly that Kingsman sucks the audience in after watching it for only 5 minutes. All of the direction was great, and brought the film to new levels of expertise very quickly.The score was the third thing that really pulled me into the scenes, particularly the suspenseful ones. Without going into too much detail, the parachute scene was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen in recent years, and the music had a great part in it. All of the music throughout the entirety of Kingsman was astounding, and sucked me into the film so easily that I felt like I was there, in the film, rather than watching it.The only problem I had with Kingsman was the ending. Not particularly how the film ended, but some subplots that weren't wrapped up like I had hoped they would've been. This is most likely due to the presence of a looming sequel (Kingsman: The Golden Circle coming in 2017), but I still would've preferred some closure with certain characters and stories that the film presented. Besides that, however, I loved Kingsman.Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service was a great movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys action, espionage, or just good movies all around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprise Hit and Perfect Start to 2015's Slate of Spy Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a major unapologetic fan of the James Bond franchise and, as much as I love the latest serious Daniel Craig run of the series, KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is apparently the 007 film I've been craving since Roger Moore finished his run in 1985. It takes all the most playful elements of Moore's 007 films, gives them modern sensibilities, and ramps up the stylized action under the direction of Matthew Vaughn. I've enjoyed Vaughn's work since LAYER CAKE and I'll admit I was worried about KINGSMAN. Leading up to its release, I'd seen little to no promotion for it and it was apparently based on a comic property with which I was unfamiliar. To top it off, it was scheduled for release in the month of February, a notorious cinematic dumping ground. But, man, I was wrong to doubt it. Turns out, KINGSMAN is one of my favorite movies of 2015, a year swamped with spy films. The Kingsman are a secret organization of wealthy gentlemen dating nearly a century and their mission is to keep the world safe from danger utilizing seemingly endless resources. Cool gadgets and impeccable style without the hindrance of answering to the government and MI6. Each agent is code- named for one of the knights in King Arthur's court, and they operate out of a tailor shop on Savile Row in London. As the movie begins, a threat emerges in the form of a world-famous tech billionaire whose plan for saving the world from environmental destruction means eliminating its over-population problem.It all begins with the kidnapping of a famed environmental scientist/university professor, played by none other than Mark Hamill. A botched rescue attempt leaves a Kingsman agent dead and we then jump into the process of finding a new Lancelot. Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits young Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton) and convinces him to go through the recruitment campaign where he will compete with nearly a dozen other candidates for the position. This proves to be a challenge for Eggsy, as he's a street thug (albeit one with above average intelligence and Olympic-level gymnastic skills) going up against Ivy Leaguers with stiff upper lips and wealthy backgrounds. Hart feels compelled to care for Eggsy because it was Eggsy's father that saved his life by giving his own on a mission years earlier in the Middle East. Hart becomes a sort of surrogate father to Eggsy, teaching him in the ways of acting a gentleman and giving the kid confidence to compete. Firth and Egerton are a solid team in the film, and Firth's performance leads me to believe he could've been a fantastic 007 if he'd been given the chance. With support from Mark Strong as the Kingsman's tech wizard Merlin and Michael Caine as the commanding officer of the organization (dubbed Arthur, naturally), this movie's got some serious acting chops in it. But a proper spy/action film is only as strong as its villain and, when that villain is Samuel L. Jackson, you know it's going to be fun.KINSGMAN has a perfect blend of action and humor. It's definitely a lot edgier in the comedy than 007 films have ever been, seeing as how KINGSMAN totally embraces its R-rating. At the end of a 007 film, we get a tender embrace under the sheets, a cheesy pun, and an "Oh, James?" from the leading lady. In KINGSMAN, the gorgeous woman prepares for mounting like a dog in heat because, well, he did save the world as promised. This movie is a jacked-up love letter to the fun 007 movies of the Connery and Moore eras, parodying elements with a knowing nod and taking everything a step further because they can. The violence certainly takes full advantage of the R-rating, with a church slaughter halfway through the film spilling loads of blood and establishing itself as the most fun scene of any movie in 2015 (fantastically set to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird"). The Kingsman may not appear to be much of a threat in their tailored suits with their proper manners, but these dudes can open a can of whoop a**. I would never expect much from Colin Firth but he's got a few scenes in this movie proving that Galahad is not a man to be trifled with. I could go on about KINGSMAN but I'll sum it up with this: the movie is just a crazy amount of fun and there is extra enjoyment to be had for fans of classic 007 who'll see a lot of the tropes toyed with here.One last note: I really, really hope KINGSMAN 2 brings in Roger Moore in a supporting role, either as the villain or the head of the Kingsman. It would just be perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Begins well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starts well. Attempts to b e homage to the old Bond movies, but goes on far too long and just becomes silly. I only stayed with it because I paid for it. However, it at least shows that Colin Firth is everything that Hugh Grant can never be. It also demonstrated that Samuel L. Jackson must not be rich enough to turn down such nonsense. This must also apply to Michael Caine, even though I do understand why he was cast. The disgusting crudity at the end I presume is the result of one of the creators being married to Jonathan Ross. How can a film include a sequence such as this? I imagine there will be sequels. I will not be watching them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to spend a couple of hours on a harmless, enjoyable, funny, and at times violent flick that is a combination of James Bond, Enter the Dragon, Matrix, and NCIS, this is the movie for you! (I am not sure why NCIS, but there it is!)Colin Firth and Mark Strong do great as Galahad and Merlin. Jonno Davies plays Lee, the unlikely hero and holds his own along the strong cast. But it is Samuel L. Jackson's nerdy villain with a lisp, Valentine, that makes me chuckle every single time.The action scenes are fun and easy to follow, although at times a bit to graphic for the lighthearted. The jokes are pretty good too. Listen to the dialogues carefully, you will find a whole bunch of tongue in cheek references and jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No middle way - you will love or hate this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I absolutely loved it.It is VERY violent. A scene in which dozens of people's heads explode to Land of Hope and Glory, with fireworks thrown in was both a high point and pretty typical of the humour involved. If you would find that distasteful then watch something else. Otherwise... its great.And actually its really not that gory. Yes, people explode, are shot, sliced in half etc. but there is actually very, very little blood - so it is actually fantasy. The violence is cartoon violence. Think Tom &amp; Jerry.But leave that aside - the story is brilliant. As others have said, this is how James Bond SHOULD be. Gadgets and gizmos, jokes and one- liners, twinkles in the eye, good guys and bad. But it also undermines the type in so many fun ways. All action, the near two hours flew by. I was left wanting more - but PLEASE let there be no sequel. No way a second film could be as good as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just an easy going movie to watch after the festive frenzy with a fantastic soundtrack as well gets my vote 10/10. Lots of stars in the film just can not say enough about it,i am not into these kind of movies really but happened to come across it on Sky Movies as a new added one and thought its worth a watch. Colin Firth is a darling in the film always the English gentleman he did not disappoint and Samuel L Jackson with his lisp was amusing to say the least! overall its not one for the kids but if your having friends round for a few beers its easy going with a few twists and surprises and a little James Bond taking the mickey out of. And the saying goes manners make-th the man is very true.There are some funny moments and some gripping but as i say an all round great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is a secret spy organization not connected to any government working in the shadows with no rewards and no fame. Arthur (Michael Caine) is the head of the organization. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is Galahad. He recruits Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who's father once saved his life. Super billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has vicious hench-woman Gazelle and a devastating plan.It's fun, ultra-violent and expertly made. Matthew Vaughn delivers a sharp product. This is more fun than most Bond movies. The action is better than many superhero movies. The church scene is a piece of art. Colin Firth really delivers the needed class. I like Jackson's villain with a speech impediment. It's a fun exciting compelling action adventure from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this movie and I was disappointed. The first 30 minutes were a bit slow but I was waiting for it to suck me in every minute, sadly it didn't.The movie is sometimes self-aware of it's ridiculous plot and clichés but that doesn't fix these things. I thought "ok, this is going to be one of those hilarious caroonish comedies that makes fun of bad spy movies" but no, it was serious and quite terrible. At first I thought the protagonist was a ripoff of something like Percy Jackson, but the villain was very unrealistic and very ridiculous just like his plot (which looks like an "evil master plan" from fart-humor type cartoon for kids). I really don't buy it. There are some comedy attempts in the action sequences that work sometimes, but other times they just look disturbingly disgusting. The style of the action fits this, i guess. Anyways it still looks like a cheap spy comedy that is extremely predictable and the fake tension it is sometimes trying to create just doesn't work.</fullReview>

I sensed no plot in the film after watching it, I may be stunned by the cinematography in the action part but SUPER disappointed by how the film story goes. It should have been an elegant movie if there's no dialogues with usage of "F***", "B***S***", "S***" and etc. I love how Eggsy's character development turns to be but felt boring because other characters doesn't have much to be talked about-like dummies. The sky diving act was really AWESOME, falling from the skies and land, the tense is real! I expected Galahad to appear longer than the film does but meh- he died (sorry for spoilers) In this case, the story was paced and become shorter and the plot started to vanished leaving scenes with non sense actions, I couldn't get what does this film tells about. Seems like that it was ruined even though it have a very good plot (not messy even though it was so cliché).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exquisite action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is directors that were inspired by the Bond films to make a parody out of it, such as "Austin Powers" (film series). Than there are movies like "Kingsman: The Secret Service" that does a good job taking the certain concepts of it like the gentlemen spy elements than adding there own touches to it. And this film really does succeed when it comes to the entertainment value of it all. I mean this is what the Alex Rider movie should have been. There has been movies about kids or teens becoming a secret agent and working for a agency. But I think this took the formula and polished it to the point where teens and adults can thoroughly enjoy it. It has a good build up, stand out characters and villains and well choreographed action sequences. Add good special effects with a story-line that is coherent and fits together well. Then you got yourself a action movie that is really worth seeing. It's a action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's really not campy either. Which makes this a balanced action movie when it comes to that department. Overall this is a exquisite film that I would recommend. It's quite fun.8.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We highly recommend watching Kingsman. The action is amazing. It's non-stop, appropriately paced, and quite violent. Sam L. Jackson is the opposition who has a half- baked plan to end global warming. He is protected by a prosthetic wearing hench-woman who is a stand out in the film. You will find yourself thinking, "I didn't expect her to do that!"Eggsy is instantly likable protagonist. At first glance he is a misguided teen; but extremely loyal to his friends, little sibling, and mum. It is the loyalty quality and another underdeveloped talent (gymnastics) that make Eggsy an excellent candidate for the Kingsmen. Thanks to the same Kingsmen (Colin Firth) who gave Eggsy's father a chance years earlier, Eggsy jumps at the opportunity to try to become one. The transformation from thug being raised by his 'emotionally lost' mum and her nasty boyfriend to a debonair secret agent is completed through humor, teamwork, trust building, high tech gadgets, and loads of violent choreographed action. A must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is enjoyable and avoids predictability by engaging in a lot of very clever social satire and genre references that set it apart from the pack. It was really great in a lot of ways.Unfortunately, it also makes a few very weak choices in terms of gags that distract from the flow of the movie. Specifically, (and here's your spoiler alert), the scene at the end with Hanna Alström could have been touching, or a least cute, but instead the director decided to go with an anal sex joke. What gives? It's as if the writers and director were in sync to make something new and different, and the Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen show up and exercise their executive vetoes to enforce crassness. After all, how can a Scandinavian royal asking to take it up the butt not be hilarious?!? Hardy har har har...Sorry if that spoiler ruins the joke for those who would find it funny (heck, maybe that's supposed to be the high point of the movie), but it ruined it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick-Ass meets Men in Black and 60s Avengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With movies like X-Men: First Class, Kick-Ass, Stardust and Layer Cake writer/director/producer Matthew Vaughn established himself as one of the most exciting movie makers around. Having turned down the offer to direct X-Men Days of Future Past we were very interested in what he was working on instead. Luckily Kingsman: The Secret Service - again based on a comic - doesn't disappoint. Afterwards we can be glad that he put all his efforts in this incredibly funny but also comic-book violent spy flick. With Bryan Singer again involved as director, the X-Men movie also turned out very fine anyway.The film is about Kingsman, an unknown but powerful British Secret Service. When one of his spies dies, all six remaining agents are asked to come up with a candidate that can replace him. After a dangerous selection only one will remain. Kingsman Harry Hart (Colin Firth) nominates Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton who's also being eyed for the role of Cyclops in X-Men Apocalypse). Eggsy is a small criminal who doesn't know he is the son of a killed Kingsman agent. In the meantime the organization investigates the dubious plans of billionaire and philanthropist Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), who says he wants to save our planet but doesn't tell the world at what costs he will do that.Three movies pop in mind when you see Kingsman. First of all: Kick- Ass. It has the same humor, violence and over the top characters. Valentine's bodyguard for instance is a girl with no legs but with killing blades. Her action scenes are quite spectacular. Samuel L. Jackson is a crazy disturbed villain. His madness suits the finale of the movie very well. Secondly: Men in Black. Young Eggsy must participate in a very nasty selection process in order to be the chosen Kingsman. The missions they must do are very dangerous. In the first one a candidate even dies (or it seems that way). The third ( and major) title Kingsman resembles is The Avengers. No, I'm not talking about the Marvel one. In the late sixties there was this British TV-series starring the ultimate gentleman John Steed (Patrick Macnee) and the first powergirl ever, Emma Peel (played by the legendary Diana Rigg from On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Game of Thrones fame). These two spies used a lot of (hidden) gadgets to solve crime. But whatever happened, like Colin Firth in Kingsman, John Steed always remained polite and stiff. The Avengers TV-series even got a very bad movie version in 1998 starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery. Kingsman starts of as an entertaining action movie with lots of violence and humor. Entertaining, but not exceptional. Turns out director Vaughn saved the best for last. In the incredible finale the movie really delivers. Absolute highlight is the way the baddies get defeated by the two remaining Kingsman. That scene is so over the top, I think only Matthew Vaughn could have pulled that of.Yes, Kingsman is great stuff and I can't wait to see it again. Especially actor Colin Firth deserves lots of praise. He not only gives us a very likable and funny performance, but his action scenes are also very convincing and must have cost him months of training. The shots in which he does the fighting are also very long with very few cut aways. We hope he didn't have to do that many takes. Newcomer Taron Egerton as Eggsy is also impressive. He's not only believable as a low life street thug, but as a James Bond-like spy as well. No doubt Kingsman will launch his career.In one of the first scenes of the movie we see actor Mark Hamill in the role of professor James Arnold. And that's a nice surprise given the fact that it's 2015 now, the year of Star Wars The Force Awakens and his great movie comeback. It at least gives us a hint of how he will look as the elderly Jedi Luke Skywalker. Kingsman: go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a year when comic book movies were many in number I think Kingsman: The Secret Service was forgotten for most of the year until It got released... And then everything EXPLODED! And for good bloody reason, Kingsman: The Secret Service is not only one of Mathew Vaughn's greatest hits, but also one of the most original comic book movies ever made. The star studded line up of Taron Edgerton, Colin Firth, Sophia Boutella, Samuel L Jackson, Michael Caine and Mark Strong do brilliantly on screen as an ensemble with fantastic cameos from legends such as Mark Hamill too. The plot is actually brilliantly transferred from the comic to the screen too, the characters are all in their ways likable ... but, the one thing I have to pick apart from Kingsman is I feel like some of the greater members of the cast like Mark Strong and Sam Jackson just didn't get enough screen time. But that aside Kingsman: The Secret Service was one of the strongest films of It's year and I can't wait for the sequel next year.</fullReview>

Hart initiates Eggsy into the Kingsman, a privately operated secret service and, in the course of his training, they both run afoul of evil billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who, of course, has a nefarious scheme that needs thwarting.The film has one subtitle too many, and it takes that approach to everything: excess in moderation. Its attention to detail is impressive without being overly meta: only Hart and Valentine acknowledge their debt to classic Bond films, and nobody feels the need to comment on the overkill of an evil lair that seems like it could have been airlifted straight from You Only Live Twice.</fullReview>

A fantastic cast, excellent action sequences (if very violent) and good pace. Totally unbelievable recruitment process for the newly vacant place of Lancelot. The only strong female character was Gazelle, and she was presented as just the brawn to Valentine's brains. It was even doubtful that the ultimate winner of Lancelot's place, Roxy, would have made it past the parachute jump (perhaps not even left the plane) if not for the encouragement of Eggsy. My son thought the princess was a strong female character for refusing to join the evil plan. Perhaps he forgot about the end where she was reduced to an objectified sex toy prize for the hero?

A lot of other people complain that the movie couldn't decide whether to be serious or comical, but I truly don't see why this is an issue. I think it's that mix that actually made the movie so fun.So if you're offended by a little ridiculous violence or strongly believe that movies strictly need to fall into binary of serious or comical, then perhaps it's not for you.

It's got suave heroes, unbelievable stunt-laden action, natty high-tech gadgets, a megalomaniacal villain with a cool mountain-top lair, a deadly henchwoman with an unusual pair of weapons, and oodles of extreme violence, all delivered at a cracking pace with stunning visual effects by Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. It also features the best use of Lynyrd Skynrd's Freebird in a movie since The Devil's Rejects (during an incredible fight sequence in a church). A well deserved 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original and unique spy comedy. Kingsman: The Secret Service Movie Review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service seemed rubbish American actioned comedy for the first time I decided to watch. Besides the beautiful unique ones I admire my general impressions of the Hollywood made action comedy spy movies triggered my prejudice as usual.Then I have decided to watch it.The same beginning of a spy movie occurred on the screen. An action scene, Special forces, and casualties then a peaceful beginning of a new story with more actions.The situation was simple and similar as usual. But after a while the process of the film plot has begun to show me pleasant surprises with its eclectic context.The British spy marks of the context may not seem to be the most unique to the audience at the beginning ever since we have experiences on watching dozens of Bond Movies and their pastiche comedy versions. However, the new things I discovered in the script's pastiche parts made me satisfy step by step and natural cause of watching new things, scenes or dialogues attached me to the movie. Of course we can't say that Kingsman is a unique comedy masterpiece but the pastiche and eclectic script writing seemed distinctive even it has mainstream look a like script. And so that I can say I had a good time watching it without any comedy masterpiece expectations. If I say nothing was peculiar I lie.With a clear conscience, I can say that the subject is a classic one but the eclectic scenes with original ideas make the difference."Warning These Paragraphs Contain Spoilers" The idea of depicting an orphan boy having sociological problems from a Slang lout loaded neighborhood, to become a legendary British gentleman spy, through his dead spy father's heritage.The instructor Galahad (Colin Fith) and the spy applicant boy Lee's (Jonno Davies) harmony reach the climax with the 3 rd supporting character Merlin (Mark Strong) who is the reasonable one in spite of the ignorant but genius boy Lee and the real Gentleman Galahad.And besides the harmony of the characters, Arthur's manipulated character and abandoning his agents for becoming one of the most important informant of the cyber organization displayed by a well-chosen actor, Micheal Cane.According to this slang, type storytelling blended with Royal aspects of the spy agencies, the unique scenes make a place in your mind.Such as the Galahad's bar fight involvement with the slang louts,Massacre in a church scene in the aspect of a gentleman's unconscious attitude,the Kill Bill alike fighting scene of Lee with a crippled woman in a bar Hall, The cyber terrorist image of Samuel L. Jackson that we have never seen him like a cyber villain and the sexual dialogue between a prisoner queen and Lee are the most significant unique components that I still remember.The result, dosage of the comedy is adjusted well, cheesy fun is less than any kind of its samples and if you look for a good action with a unique humour and if you like British groove I recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service to you to consume for a few times. We have to wait the movie for a while to become a cult but one day it can easily be with its originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond doesn't know crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman, on the other hand, does.Action comedies are hard to make right. Although "action comedy" doesn't do justice for this movie, nor does the equally vague "action adventure", but these kinds of movies rarely nail it. They can be easily failures: either they're unfunny or the action doesn't cut it, or they just simply have no heart in whatever they're trying to do. That is not the case here.Kingsman: The Secret Service is unexpectedly fresh for a movie that borrows from just about everything. It's outright ridiculous, and you still manage to care about what's happening. No punches are pulled. It's very violent, very funny in refreshing ways and manages to surprise and entertain you in ways that I thought couldn't be possible anymore. I watched some scenes with my mouth open. I couldn't believe what was happening.How would I describe this movie? Think about James Bond with a fresh sense of fun, silly amounts of amazingly-shot violence, the most ridiculous villain of all time who has a Kill Bill-esque henchwoman, and where you somehow manage to care about some of the characters. It never crosses the line where it becomes either a parody or a serious thriller, it just maximizes the entertainment factor in - it seems - every single scene.Matthew Vaughn is one of the best action movie directors around, because he finds many smart little ways to elevate his movies. Jane Goldman is the co-writer, as usual. These two seem to work amazingly well together. They nailed the tone perfectly and almost every moment seems fitting.Colin Firth is the absolute star of this film. He's every bit as elegant as Bond, even more so. He steals every scene he's in, and to my surprise he delivered the best action scenes of the whole movie too. Amazing job, Colin. Mark Strong and Michael Caine as veteran agents are fine and they elevate any movie they participate in. I can't say a bad thing about anyone else either. Some characters are best left unspoiled - especially Samuel L. Jackson's one. Samantha Womack was very good in a small role, I had to look her up immediately after the movie ended. Overall, the cast was good, and Colin Firth leads the movie like a pro.I can only imagine how much a PG-13 rating would have hindered this gem. Luckily nothing is watered down and we get the full experience.If you like action adventure movies, and especially if you think that action movies have become too formulaic, passionless and dull, I will highly recommend Kingsman for you. This movie seems to find fun and excitement in whatever it does. Get some friends to watch it with you, even. I did.Today, I know what it means to be a true gentleman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you said that 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was like a 'Bond film' then you'd only be partly right. Yes, it's a 'spy movie,' yes you have a 'super villain' trying to basically take over the world and, yes, you have a 'gentleman spy' ready and waiting to stop him. Yet, for all its 'Bond-like' traits, I just can't really liken Kingsman to a Bond movie. It's not better or worse, just a different beast altogether.It's different because ? unlike Bond ? it doesn't just concentrate on one area of the spy genre. Our gentleman spy in question is played expertly by Colin Firth and, if the film-makers had chosen to do so, they could have easily concentrated on his efforts to stop our (lisping!) super villain, Samuel L Jackson, from getting away with his dastardly plans. However, like I say, that's only part of the story. Mr Firth, Colin Firth, decides to take on a protégé in the form of a young lad from the rough end of London and train him up in the ways of the Force (in Star Wars terms, anyway). So, not only do we have a spy movie, but with a large helping of teenage coming-of-age thrown in there (oh, and the obligatory teenage romance to satisfy the 'Twilight generation'). Now, if you're already picking up on my distain for twinkling vampires and schoolgirls who don't seem able to smile or close their mouths, then you're probably right. I'm not a fan of teenage love stories and Kingsman could quite easily have fallen down here in my estimation. However, luckily, it's not the case and the 'teenage element' is actually done pretty well and hopefully won't alienate too many of the older generation (like me, for example).I won't go into too many details about the plot. If you've seen one Bond film (or any other spy movie worth its name) then you'll know. The plot isn't important, only that you know that it's done very well. And, I should mention a special nod to the 'action scenes.' I'm not entirely sure how they're done, but they're damn awesome and stylishly put together.If you like the slightly tongue-in-cheekness of old 'pre-Daniel Craig' Bond then you should enjoy Kingsman. It has decent performances, stylish action, over-the-top baddies (seriously... a woman with giant razor blades for legs has to be straight out of the Dr No era!) and even a touch of humanity and uplifting character development. A surprise package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not for or against this film. I don't get my knickers in a twist over a bit of GCI blood, violence, profanity or the endless clichés. I AM however against the injudicious amount of CGI used in every other shot, &amp; the fact that this film falls apart about half way through. Seriously, you have a bit of realism at the start &amp; it's fairly grounded. But as it goes on it becomes more &amp; more Disney. Until about half way through, right about when a certain character meets his demise, &amp; it just gets reduced to the Hollywood way - Everyone suddenly knows martial art, acrobatics, gymnastics; Slo-Mo to compensate for how slow western audiences are, TERRIBLE lighting, CGI backgrounds, intrusive generic epic music, &amp; the all time high "Girl power doing round house kicks" cliché. Colin Firth has such inimitable demeanour that he is the only one that sells the story. But the kid that takes over? My God he was a chore to watch. They also try to level the playing field where sex is concerned by having male &amp; female protagonists en-roll for The Secret Service. Another dumb idea seeing that in reality not 1 single woman has worked as a secret agent. This is no doubt taken as discrimination by those as stupid as post feminists, when in reality it is a simple fact that men are more physically dexterous. They soon push her to one side anyway &amp; have the boy get all the screen time. Samuel Jackson has his moments &amp; is fun to watch but he is non-threatening &amp; you feel sorry for the likable character he builds up. His henchman once again has to be a fit young slender brunette who dodges bullets, never gets scared, shows no emotion, jumps around like a flea on a griddle blah blah blah the usual male-written girl-power tripe. The "controversial" church scene is the best in the movie which is probably why it sticks out. It's brutal, impressively shot, bloody &amp; shows conviction. Which is FAR more than I can say for the rest of the film which goes soft &amp; shows a blatant hesitation of following through. All of a sudden blood is swapped for cheap puffs of coloured smoke copied &amp; pasted in perfect synchronisation in all harmless humour so as to not offend the next lot of screen test reprobates. What a joke. What a mess this film is. Avoid or watch drunk with the Mrs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Life is Worse after Seeing this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about this film was the time before I ever watched in when with a naive child-like faith I believed that there was still the possibility of an action film that didn't make me wish I could go back in time and slap myself in the face to avoid watching this truly horrible film. At first I thought I could attempt to overlook the totally idiotic and unnecessary profanity in hopes that the action scenes and over all plot would make it worth while. But after a while (and by "a while" I mean the first 10 minutes) it just seems like a bunch of prepubescent children were given permission to swear like the big kids, and for no apparent reason are running around screaming the f word.A man sliced cleanly in half in the first scene should have given me a fair warning. The violence wasn't laughable or gruesome or realistic. It was stupid. I've seen episodes of sponge bob square pants where poorly sketched characters slap each other that had more of a positive effect on me than this did.Even the overall plot was dull and predictable. I don't know what sort of blackmail was used on some of these great actors to get them to agree to this truly pathetic production. I feel certain it was created for idiots by idiots.If you want to watch a truly horrible movie in every way, this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got to talking with someone about this movie and he said it was a good movie.....show's what he knows. I think it's pretty sad they used a thug like baller as their supposed main character/special spy. First, this person is no role model in any way and is indeed a criminal. Second the accent is just a bit off putting.This film just seems like a disgrace to the spy film industry. Yea there were some good parts....but I feel like it just wasn't enough to watch this film a second time. Not at all.Samuel Jackson has played some pretty cool bad guy/good guy roles in the past but man he should have stayed away from this one, What did he have some sort of lisp going on?Also at the end the "Princess" supposedly offered some sexual gratification for this so called spy after he saved the world. It was an eye rolling scene. Princesses don't just go around sexing things up. Princesses are royalty.....not trash LMAO. Trashy women offer sex to strangers who save the world. Royalty offers medals.....or some other form of reward. Royalty DOES NOT whore themselves out. What a disgrace of a movie. I swear some films have got to be made by the devil himself.....so much deceit and misleading people. That spy though.....wow hey guys I'm a thug.....I can become a spy too!!!Very sad and classless movie, not really sure how that kid survived..... not even professional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Matthew Vaughn continues His Winning Streak with this Ultra-Violent Send-Up of the Slick Spy Movie. The Movie is so Sleek, Stylish, and Outrageous it is likely to Cause Spontaneous Orgasim among Teenagers and Hyper-Actives of all ages.All the Money spent on this Glorious, Gory, Goof is up there On the Screen. It Razzles and Dazzles in almost Every Scene. The Writing is Smart and Reverentially Reflective as the Tone Fluctuates between Irreverence and Irresponsibility.But a Good Time can be had by Those Willing to Allow for some Gut-Wrenching Displays of Murderous Mayhem and not so easy to take Comedy, like Our Hero's Reward for Saving the World that Ends this Exhausting Entertainment. That may be the One Time that the Director's usual Disregard for Good Taste got the better of His Trademark Avoidance of Sensibility.Some May Point to the Church Slaughter as another, but that is Not Meant to be so Personally Invasive, more like a Parody of Hyper-Hypocritical Comeuppance. Overall, the Movie cannot be denied its Fresh Fervor and Willingness to Step, No Leap, Over the Line of what has Come Before. The Cast is Excellent and the Director Shows No Signs of Losing His Edge.Recommended for Open Minded Art and Political Satire Lovers. as it Parodies he Real World of Politics, Religion, and Global Disarray Spiraling Out of Control.

		<fullReview>This movie was not very entertaining. I remember being swarmed by its trailer in 2014 and it looked very predictable back then. Young, brash British boy with a checkered past gets drafted into the secret service to become a secret agent, which felt like a very cliché way to start things off.We follow him through his training along with several other boring recruits and a girl (techniqally two girls but they only had enough personality for half a girl). Somewhere in the movie we learn that Mr. Bland is very good at sleight of hand but Mr. Ballpunt McButtkick isn't fooled. It's a setup for the scene in the movie that I like to refer to as "James Bond for the mentally challenged". Without trying to spoil the scene, it (along with the movie) feels like a movie for people with very low attention span, maybe catering to people with ADHD.The dialogue is somewhat clumsy written and tries to be smarter than it really is. It tries to take itself serious when it should not and it just makes a smelly mess of itself. The delivery is blander than Peter Weller before they made him into the most awesome looking, sounding and acting robot since Optimus Prime, not the stupid new Transformers thank you very much.Are there no redeeming qualities in this movie? No, but two things make it bearable: The villain and the church fight scene. The villain? It's Samuel L. Jackson and he does his job and he seemed the more interesting than any of the other boring people in the movie. Not only is he fantastic at promoting the fact that he wants everyone to be fat, he's also weird, odd and again, the most entertaining character in this sloth-bucket of clichés. The church scene is wonderful since so many horrible people are murdered by Glasses Killsalot and they would have deserved it even without Evil Von Fattylove's intervention.Before you ask yourself "wasn't Hanna Alström showing her Swedish bum" yes she was and if you think three seconds of bum on the scene really is a good reason to watch a movie you probably need help making the hard decision in life, such as "should I go outside without adult supervision today".On the subject of Hanna Alström, she was speaking Swedish along with with Scandinavian Prime Minister Bjon Floberg, which was entertaining.To save you time: don't.</fullReview>

However, all I got was a movie where any James Bond movie would appear more realistic. Until the first large killing scene, it only seemed like a bad movie. Apparently, that scene was the beginning of a complete insane line of thoughts filling the remainder of the movie with bad special effects - not even funny. Even the script became worse. All lines becoming pathetic one liners - that by no means were funny. Again, ignorant as I am, I thought that an English produced action comedy would at least level "Johnny English". That presenting elegant slapstick humor. I only recall myself laughing twice. Once, nervously watching the face of my wife - awaiting her reaction (as I suggested us to watch this movie) and second, watching a scene with miserable special effects.

		<shortDescription>Where were the children?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry... but the church massacre scene was ignorantly offensive as well as cowardly, and solely designed for anti-Christians, the evil wishful thinking, and mentally deranged. When there were obvious leftist and anti-conservative blurbs and concepts contrived throughout by libby Utopian writers Jane Goldman &amp; Matthew Vaugh (like the politician saying he doesn't care who dies because he is a "Republican," and the comment "I bet no one thanked you for that one," regarding the saving of Thatcher's life), maybe I should have saw it coming.That said, if you are going to massacre an all white "hate" CHURCH full of stereotypical caricatures, I have to ask? Where were the children? Even a church as bad as Westboro (who pickets the funerals of soldiers) have kids... so why were they omitted from the slaughter? Why? Because the writers thought it would be cool to massacre a bunch of white holy rollers, but didn't have the balls to take it all the way. Cowards. Because if they took it all the way, there would be less cheering for this politically charged bloodthirsty scene, and it would be suggested that the posters who say this was "the best part of the movie" should seek mental help. I suggest that regardless.I wonder if the writers for the sequel would have the courage to make a similar massacre scene in a black church, or a Mosque, which fundamentally agrees with white churches concerning homosexuality and abortion... I'd say not. The picture would never see the light of day. This scene was all about fulfilling a specific ignorant liberal fantasy.The 40k+ numb-skulls who rated this movie a 10 must have had their moral compass replaced by a SIM card from Twentieth Century Fox! With the fight scenes, FX, and cinematography, I would have gave this movie a 5... but since this was probably one of last films Dylann Roof saw before he started his own killing spree, I gave it a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The suit is the modern gentleman's armour. The Kingsmen are the new knights.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full court press with a British action thriller served up with a generous dollop of humor, this very successful film is based on the comic book 'The Secret Service' (writers Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons) and transformed into a screenplay by Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughan ? that guy responsible for 'Kick-Ass', X-Men: First Class', 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' 'Layer Cake', 'Stardust'. For those of us who are not comic book fans or have not heard of the comic book on which this fantastic movie is based, the following is an explanation by Colin Firth's character in the script:' 'Since 1849, Kingsman Tailors have clothed the world's most powerful individuals. In 1919, a great number of them had lost their heirs to World War I. That meant a lot of money going uninherited. And a lot of powerful men with the desire to preserve peace and protect life. Our founders realized that they could channel that wealth and influence for the greater good. And so began our adventure. An independent international intelligence agency operating at the highest level of discretion. Without the politics and bureaucracy that undermine the intelligence of government-run spy organisations. A suit is the modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights.'And that is only the explanation of the Kingsmen title. The film is blessed with a superb cast. The plot is all over the place and the action speaks louder than ideas of words. It tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Among the featured actors are Colin Firth as Galahad/Harry Hart, Michael Caine as Arthur, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, unrecognizable Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold, Sofia Boutella as the lower extremity enhance weapon Gazele who assists Samuel L. Jackson as super bad guy Valentine, Jonno Davies as Lee, and the very impressive new face hunk Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Cinematography is by George Richmond, and the musical score is by Henry Jackman, Matthew Margeson with a bow to Sir Edward Elgar. Great special effects and an ending to end all endings make this a full evening of pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a very fun ride, completely enjoyable from start to finish, jam packed with great action sequences, sincere hilarity and outstanding characters. The movie is very original, there truly is not, nor do I think there ever will be, a film quite like it. It's certainly a parody of the spy genre but in a very different way, it's not quite like Naked Gun or Austin Powers, it's more of a tribute to old fashioned spy films, like the Roger Moore Bonds. The cast is fantastic, and as this is a Matthew Vaughn (easily one of the most talented directors in Hollywood) film, there are many actors in unexpected roles. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson have never done anything like this before,. Firth is the slick, skillful super spy and Jackson is the main villain who also provides a lot of comic relief, you would not expect to see them in these roles, but they completely own them nonetheless. Matthew Vaughn also likes getting very small actors in the main role, and he made a great choice with Taron Egerton, a talented young actor who suited the role of Eggsy perfectly, and I hope to see more of him in the future. A hilarious, action packed breath of fresh air, Kingsman brought a smile to my face throughout and I am so happy a film this insane exists, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. A spy organisation recruits a young man with little skill but a lot of promise, meanwhile, an evil genius plots to take over the world with a new smart phone.

Harry invites Eggsy to be candidate to the vacancy of a new agent in the agency and he is trained by Agent Merlin (Mark Strong) and competes with other candidates. Meanwhile, the Kingsmen investigate the industrialist Valentine (Samuel L.

"Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a funny entertainment with a violent story of a secret service agency in London. The plot is a sort of parody to the James Bond movies in a Quentin Tarantino style. Colin Firth is hilarious but Samuel L. Jackson is annoying with the weird whisper in the way of speaking. There is a funny scene in the credits that shall not be missed.

		<fullReview>You know what I hate in comic book based movies? The fact that they don't have the balls to target it to more adult audience, castrating it from all violence (present in the comics!) and foul language in order to fit them in PG-13 category. That's why Dredd 3d felt so fresh and entertaining and that's why almost all Marvel and DC movies are meh.Kingsman is the perfect example of comic book movie done right. We have everything here - goofy villains, cool Bond-esk gadgets, interesting secret organization fighting crime, action, humour, plot going in some unexpected directions, violent nicely choreographed fights (or just chaotic, messy ones), light feeling movie which is actually pretty depressing study on human nature...To sum this short review up I'll bring one thing up - a sign of a great movie is that there are scenes that we will always remember. And there's plenty of that in Kingsman. All scenes including dogs (especially 'shoot the dog' scene), hilarious bar fight, bloodbath in the church, introduction of the villain, 'fancy' dinner at Valentine's apartment, etc) It's cheesy, it's violent, it's technically flawless and it's just a 100% pure joy to watch :)</fullReview>

Visual Effects, also, are superb.Performance-Wise: Colin Firth steals 'Kingsmen: The Secret Service'. He's Magnificent in here, enacting the tough spy agent to sheer perfection.

		<fullReview>Kingsman like Kick Ass is a action packed and comedic film from X-men first class director Matthew Vaughn. It is well made and filmed with confidence which is refreshing after a spade of disappointing action films like The Expendables 3, Taken 3 for example. Imagine if Matthew Vaughn was allowed to direct an Expendables. This is a violent film but it is filmed in a manor that is in-between soft core action of again something like Expendables 3 and Graphic action of say something like Robocop making it both accessible to both audiences. The film has been marketed in a way which well respected actors such as Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, and Michael Caine are all involved in a comedy / adventure film, which is true, however anyone that has seen Kick Ass will know what is going to happen. I applaud the three above for their involvement in something they would normally not take on, they all give good performances, as well as Matthew Vaughn regular Mark Strong. The two young leads also give good performances, however I think Samuel L Jackson steals the show with strong support from Colin Firth.The film is good fun and deserves all the success I am sure it will receive. 2015 is going to be one hell of a year</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie aims to be cool and slick. The Sherlock/Equalizer kind of fight sequences. The Kill-Bill-esque martial art fights with the diabolic moll. The unannounced bullet through the head. A do or die boot camp filled with dangerous assignments. Ridiculous choice of music when the sh*t hits the ceiling - "Freebird" by Lynnrd Skynnrd and "Baby give it up" by KC &amp; the sunshine band. (Really!?) But the script drawls on for over two hours making it neither slick nor entertaining. The horrendous casting doesn't help either. Samuel Jackson is atrocious as the lisping villain who serves burger and fries. The dude who plays the lead Eggsy can't act for nuts. There are other characters Roxy and Digby who are so plastic, you can't recollect their faces when you are done watching the movie. Michael Caine has never been this wasted in any other movie as he has been in this one. His role could have been played by any B-list actor or a random member from the audience. Mark Strong who has played great roles in the past is a lab attendant with a notepad in this movie. Colin Firth is believable as a secret service guy from the UK, because he is British, but really I am not emotionally prepared to watch Colin Firth land punches and kill a room of hundred people in it. Give him a Love Actually or a King's speech and get him to mumble in embarrassment through it. I am fine with that. Don't try to make me believe he is Jet Li and an X-man and James Bond all rolled in one. The movie caricatures itself and every genre it has borrowed from, without being entertaining at all. I was hoping I had a SIM card in my brain that exploded half way through the movie. I fail to see why this movie is so highly rated. It's probably because it is derived from a comic book and comic book geeks will lap up anything that lets them flaunt their comic book affiliations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some directors get it - Mathew Vaughn gets it. Cinema screens should be used to display entertainment, and not to upchuck stupid artsy-fartsy flicks on. Unlike recent Academy Award winners, I was not mislead - I got exactly what I paid for. No lies in advertisement, I was promised fun and this movie delivered. I did not want to leave the theater, nor did I wish for a quiet nap. I knew exactly what I was walking into. The previews looked fun; fast-paced and exciting...and that is what I got. Side note: Sometimes I wish I could see more American names out there, but when they do finally show up, often they produce disappointment. ('I am ending my side note now.') I do hope there is a sequel to this flick. The cast was great and fun. Mr. Samuel L. Jackson has to come back for Part II...gotta love his delivery and unique personality. I guess people were offended by the jail-cell royal proposition - meh. If want offensive, watch Melissa McCarthy in "Heat", now that's pretty f'n gross and f'n offensive. Or watch Robert Downey Jr. in "Tropic Thunder", 'blackface' - really? Funny? No...actually offensive as well. Or how about "South Park"? Now that is prime cut offensiveness in a big way. I am only naming a few, there are tons out there. Now I agree I did not see any need for the scene, but I find it funny that it generated such a response. There are many movies I would label as offensive - pretty much most of them to some point...and agreed...that is crap. You know what I think is really offensive? Paying 18 to 20 dollars, to sit through an hour of TV type commercials and end up watching a fish-turd of a movie. Ah well. I use the term 'offensive' more as a warning to friends in attempts to steer them clear of what I perceive to be bad cinema. I understand why some will not like this movie...just like every flick out there...'like' is subjective. Alas, I, for one, am not in that category. For me it was a very refreshing romp compared to the last cine-slop, doo-doo I suffered through. Outstanding job...and I have one friendly note to the director...screw Oscar and go for the box office. This was an excellent ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This another one of those action flicks....With one man army who has a few too many fight scenes, with groups of people, pulling off impossible tricks (eg bouncing a cue ball off the wall to hit someone in the back of the head), without ever breaking a sweat or missing a strike, and who doesn't get hurt.Of course, with it's stunts, violence, unbelievable scenarios, bizarre villains, and comic relief, the young people will rave about it. It reminded me a lot of Stormbreaker. It started out good but started to have to top itself from the previous over the top scene to maintain interest all the way to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiotic. Please do not waste your precious time (Spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't finish it. Simply put, I mark this movie as a disregard of human decency and a ruin of a good plot. Over the top and called comedy. I do not get it.Too much blood, decapitating, hands cut off, pretty much whatever a person could think off. I do think director (possibly writer) tried too much to get it right and finally ruined it. Scenes are appropriate for a fantasy movie suitable for 15 year old boys (if parents are sane enough to let them see it).British accent and loud music come to a great effect but the ending makes you realize that 2+ hours of your life were just wasted waiting for a good ending. Unfortunately you will be disappointed.I am sorry about all the cast taking part in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultra-violent spoof for the video game generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on some comic book (another one) this is the tale of the initiation of a teen (I suppose) into a British secret service organization.The reason why I went to see this thing in the cinema is because I loved "Kick-Ass", also from director Vaughn. That movie was also very violent but the crazy concept, a shy high school boy and a 11 -year old girl fighting crime, made it work.The next installment from Vaughn starts off well, largely thanks to Colin Firth as the mentor. Just until halfway into the movie when Firth character is offed, during the now infamous church scene (extremely violent even for this kind of movie), we're stuck with this 'new kid' for the rest of the movie. As this actor has basically zero charisma it's all downhill from that point. The whole thing simply turns into this violent video game style catastrophe with our 'hero' having to invade the bad guys fortress, in doing so killing dozens and dozens of his henchmen, not to mention exploding heads and a certain Swedish princess.This ultimately pretty sicko movie will be largely appreciated by a late teen/early twenty audience, not only due to the R-rating but as they simply are the target audience for this: brain dead geeks addicted to ultra-violent video games. If you do not fall into this category : do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to rain on the parade of all those who seemed to have loved this movie, but for some of us, it was a parade of violence and nonsense. Unless you enjoy exploding heads and slashing prosthetic legs. Of course, maybe all that was meant to be funny. Kingsman is a mixture of a James Bond parody and a video game -- a spoof, of sorts, that comes off more like an industry in-joke. Unfortunately, with the video game portions, you have no joysticks to control the action. And there was no joy. The best thing about the film was the cast of old and familiar faces, including Mark Hamill 37 years after Star Wars. I'm sure some of the actors did it just for the money -- but some of us in the audience paid the price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went into "Kingsmen", I had no idea what to think. I had not doe my research and went into the theater with moderate expectations, thinking I was going to see a mediocre cheesy movie about British spies, but I was so wrong. "Kingsmen" is about a ultra secretive spy agency that is trying to "save the world." Although a very common plot, this movie was made so that is was very unique despite a cliché plot. The longer I was watching the movie, I kept on realizing how much I loved the movie. It was filled with unique action, an unforeseen plot, and a great quirkiness that enhances the film so much. Along with all of these features, the movie was filled with a class A cast. It was a very well needed/well-rounded movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost like a (good) Tarentino take on the Bond series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reminds me of what Tarentino would have done with the Bond series similar to what he did with 70's era Kung Fu movies and action flicks but there's a twist: There are many who say that the theme to Kingsman is conservative. It's like Falling Down for James Bond. It's a similar experience to what I had with the Breaking Bad series which is leftist in feel and scope. In Breaking Bad, the implausible scenario is that a schoolteacher and DEA agent ultimately take drug money to help with their medical care because the government has lousy healthcare benefits. That's like saying Obama has to take the bus because the government doesn't provide him any transportation. It's laughable. But despite that leftist premise, I could enjoy that series.By the same token, I get the sense that the audience in the DC region theater were mostly leftist but enjoyed the film despite the tone of the film being one of the most conservative or right wing than I've seen in years. A savvy viewer will find a number of inconsistencies and plot holes but that goes for the Bond films as well. What "secret spy" is quick to tell everyone he's a secret spy and sleep around and draw attention to himself? These plot holes are meant to be savored. Working class folks and the upper crust are both portrayed as yobs with a modern twist: NOBODY smokes. Ever. It's refreshing. Remember in the Bond films how everyone puffed away continuously? I hope this becomes a trend that is repeated in later sequels (which there will surely be.) The film appears to have recruited every potential spy and cameo imaginable. Mark Hamill, Michael Caine, Samuel Jackson, Colin Firth among others both pay homage to the Bond style thriller while introducing new elements (Jackson's particular performance is hilarious.) Watching in the theater was surprisingly enjoyable because, not in spite of, the other audience members that made obvious comments during some action sequences but were stunningly silent in others. I could feel their shock and relished it. Vaughn takes violence that had been reduced to pornography in modern Hollywood and gives it a new artistic twist while also knowing when to tone things back a little and introduce suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why anyone is being overly critical of this film is truly beyond me.This is a representation of everything that is right with film making for the masses.It is funny, action packed, full of special effects, and while it doesn't sometimes follow the laws of physics, and lacks a little continuity, it packs an awesome punch.SOme people are never happy unless they get an art house film. This is not the new James Bond, this is not a Comedy, it is a rip roaring action film with lots to like.The simple fact is that if you weren't a fan of the humor in Kick Ass then you will likely not like this film.Stop poo pooing films that weren't meant to provide the things you were looking for, and start to enjoy them for what they are.There are some stand out one liners, and I have not seen action sequences like this since the Matrix opened my eyes nearly twenty years ago.Colin Firth is awesomeness personified and the woman with the sword legs is the best baddie to pop up in ages :-)Go and see it, you won't be disappointed unless you have a heart of stone, no sense of humour and set out not to like it in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>British Punk Still Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forenote: I always do my best to avoid spoilers. I marked this review as containing spoilers because of a comment about the cast of the film. Any potential spoilers have been marked but are very vague.For anyone who ever enjoyed the sounds and themes of groups like The Sex Pistols, The Clash, and the The Damned, this is your kind of movie. Matthew Vaughn has given the punk genre a new flame with his new film "Kingsman." While many will see this movie expecting a poorly done money grabber that's riding the coattails of YA movies and James Bond. What "Kingsman" delivers instead is an action packed, in-your-face, anti-typical, punk rock movie (just without all the drugs and the angst... oh, and the music).Vaughn does not care if you like his characters, he does not care if you support their causes, and he does not care about your political stance. Vaughn only wanted to make a movie that was anti-stereotype, and he succeeded. This is even referenced in the dialogue multiple times throughout the film. While the movie could do without several scenes that only serve to add extra time to the already long duration of the film, there are almost no points in the film where an audience member should be bored or confused. Also, (semi-spoilers) while I was disappointed to see certain cast members be killed off, I had no problems with any of the acting; EXCEPT for Samuel Jackson's ridiculous lisp that is almost impossible to listen to, albeit funny to hear at first. I gave this film a 7 out of 10 for its uniqueness and purpose. I would have scored higher had it maybe taken itself a bit more seriously, but not so much to lose the punk-feel to it. There are jokes and scenes that I feel took away from the movie quality rather than adding to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative take on the traditional spy movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's overall a very entertaining movie; especially the way it married traditional gentleman spy service to the rebellious young generation. It was fascinating to see how the young recruits were made up to scratch and the training was inspiring with the qualities it emphasized. I love the way the characters took their names after the Knights of the Round Table. What was both exciting and slightly intimidating was the Blade Girl - I am not averse to bloodshed but every time she made her appearance there was usually more than the usual amount of blood. The director must have been paying tribute to Tarantino with his almost cult-like killing and explosion shots. Except for the parts when he killed off one of my favorite characters and when he (in my opinion) slightly overdid the killing spree, I enjoyed every other moment of this movie.

		<shortDescription>A Fun Throwback Spy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn is now one of those directors that I can trust. This is my third movie I've seen by him and he still has not disappointed me. I remember when I first saw Kick Ass and was blown away with how great it is (probably in my top 25). This film is a big shout out (basically) to old spy films. It has everything: women, awesome fight scenes, gadgets, and even a ridiculous villain. Samuel L. Jackson plays the villain in this movie, and it's nice because we usually don't see him in that role. He also had a lisp in the entire movie so almost everything he said would make me chuckle. There's also a girl who has blades for feet, which is outrageous but because how Vaughn did an excellent job with choreographing fight scenes, her role worked really well into the film. It's the same for Jackson's character.The action scenes in general were fantastic. Like I said in the last paragraph, the choreography is very well done. This is also because of the smooth editing and shots Vaughn chose for all of the fight scenes. It's a very fun thing to see.There really aren't any huge gripes for this movie. The only small thing that I can think of is I wish there was a bit more of Cookson's character in the third act. Kingsman is a fun spy thriller movie that had me laughing many times and also had more than a few boundary-pushing moments. However it all worked because of the smooth editing and well-choreographed scenes along with great acting from the entire cast. If you are looking for a good popcorn movie to see, this is a movie you should see with your pals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most entertaining films you'll ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was so cool! It's not just a hilarious parody of the spy genre, James Bond in particular, but it's one of the consistently entertaining and thrilling films I've seen in years. With an absolutely enthralling story, that goes beyond just taking the mick out of spy movie clichés, brilliant performances, epic special effects, massively exciting action and absolutely stunning direction, this is a film that lets you be entertained to the max.I'll start with what I thought was the most amazing part of this whole movie: the action. As we've seen in Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, director Matthew Vaughn knows how to make a properly exciting action sequence, but I've never seen him do it to the extent seen here.Some of the battles in this film go on for up to 5-10 minutes, and whilst I expected that seeing all that violence for so long would be tiring and boring, I was absolutely exhilarated by absolutely every action sequence here, thanks to Vaughn's stunning direction, using the shaky cam to add to the grittiness but still making it clear as day as to what's happening, as well as some fantastic songs to accompany all the action kicking off.But it's not just the action that makes this film so good, the story is absolutely spellbinding too. You'd expect it just to be a send-up of Bond films, and while it does do that a lot (particularly towards the end of the story), there's so much more to be had from the plot here. The first half has very little to do with being a parody, and is on its own an interesting and of course hugely entertaining plot, introducing the wide variety of characters in a unique way and grabbing your attention right from the off.Of course, the whole movie is a comedy as well as an action-packed thrill-ride, and it doesn't disappoint on that front either. Whether it's something hugely sadistic, satirical, clever or just plain stupid, there's a high chance you'll be wetting yourself laughing at what's going on in this film, and although it doesn't impede the story from being as exciting as it is, there's so much laughing to be done for the whole two hours.Meanwhile, the characters and actors are all fantastic. Colin Firth is stunning as the veteran Kingsman agent, whilst Taron Egerton is a hell of a lot of fun as the young protégé. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson does a great job as the insane Bond villain, helped by a scary but still entertaining performance by Sofia Boutella as the Oddjob-ish evil sidekick.Overall, there's no escaping the fact that is one of the most entertaining and exhilarating films you'll see all year, filled with stunning action, direction, performances, plot and comedy, and that's why it gets a 9.2 out of 10 from me.www.themadmovieman.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kingsman" is loosely based on the comic book series "The Secret Service" but was adapted by Matthew Vaughn, the man who directed the film version of "Kick-Ass" . This production tweaks the Bond formula with some polished style, a lot dark humor and a bit of well-groomed action. As with "Kick-Ass," there's a strong underlying nastiness but also a wicked sense of fun. This can create some dissonance for some people finding it uneasy to laugh at violence at a point and then find out a character they like was killed in the next sequence. The violence is over the top for the most part, and rapidly cut with a lot of blood to keep it all at a safe distance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was a cheesy spy movie, which I think I speak on behalf of many when I say "that's right up my alley." By scrolling through the reviews you're going to see a lot of 10 star, and equally as many 1 star reviews. Here's why: 'The Church Scene' I would give the movie a solid 7 stars from start to finish with the exception of this scene. The scene lasts about 5 minutes, and it plain and simply consists of Colin Firth's character murdering nearly 50-75 people in the most brutal/graphic ways. If you can handle this scene (and the profanity throughout the movie) you'd probably think highly of it. If not, you'll be giving 3 star reviews like me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eccentric meshing of the X-Men and James Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in early 2015, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" stars Taron Egerton as "Eggsy," a recruit for super-secret spy organization headquartered in England run by characters played by Michael Caine, Colin Firth and Mark Strong. The semi-comical villain is played by Samuel L. Jackson who, with his assistant with lethal artificial legs (Sofia Boutella), seeks to save the earth by wiping out the majority of the population. Samantha Womack and Sophie Cookson are on hand as Eggsy's mother and fellow recruit respectively while Hanna Alström plays a Swedish princess.Based on the 2012 comic series The Secret Service, "Kingsman" basically meshes the X-Men with James Bond, adding its own creative, quirky approach. There's a lot of over-the-top and unbelievable action, but it is based on a comic, after all. The movie's eccentric and generally entertaining but marred by fluent F-bombs throughout and an unnecessarily vulgar scene, which tries to be funny (and almost is). (Keep in mind that I almost never comment on cussing in a movie unless it's so overdone it's distracting). If you like the X-Men or James Bond you'll want to check "Kingsman" out, but it's not as good IMHO. The cast is great though and it is amusing; I'm sure the sequels will improve upon the foundation.The film runs 129 minutes and was shot in England, Toronto and Sydney, Australia.GRADE: C+ (5.5/10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fanatical fan of Bond movies,yet I find most Bond movies are better than this Kingsman.Well,let me praise this movie first.The leading and major supporting actors(female and male) are very talented and very beautiful/handsome;and I like the sci-fi gadgets;and the fighting/action is exciting.But here are the things I don't like:Colin Firth is supposed to be a world level top agent,yet the only two times he wins in fights are with ordinary civilians,one with a few bullies,one with several dozen church-going hillbillies; what's worse is the movie makes a big deal of the fighting scenes.Don't get me wrong,the fighting itself is great and exciting,but when a top agent fights a bunch of civilians, he should win easily,the two fights aren't supposed to be long and exciting.All good guys kill puppies? When Michael Caine ordered them to shoot dogs,they didn't know the bullets were empty.In these would-be agents' minds,they thought they were going to kill their dogs.So if you have a sound judgment of morality, you are not qualified; if you blindly follow orders, you are a good agent? The mom's submission to her violent abusive new husband borders on masochism. The only female agent is also the only person who's scared of height; when she finally overcomes many difficulties and accomplishes her mission,its resulting effect in fighting the villain is proved to be next to none.The only capable woman (who's also the only disabled person) is the evil killer.What would Queen of the UK think about the movie? But I'm not a feminist.Many people are upset about the anal sex in the movie; but I think it is completely acceptable.I don't think there's anything wrong or degrading in two consenting adults doing whatever they do.(Come on, the guy just saved everyone's ass in the world.)</fullReview>

Harry has a conscience and a mistake made several years ago prompts the selection of a seemingly unlikely wannabe recruit to the Kingsman's ranks.The cast are all excellent, with young Taron Egerton seeming to be a star in the making. Only Mark Hamill is weak in his cameo.Production quality is excellent, the script is funny and there are some fantastic set pieces, with good pacing and a genuine sense of danger at the end.Films like Kingsman , The Man From UNCLE and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation merely serve to illustrate what a lazy uninspired cash grab Spectre was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just staggered through Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, I perhaps saw "Kingsman: The Secret Service" at the wrong time. My sisters especially are big fans of Colin Firth so I rented this.The story is about a teen from London (Taron Egerton) called "Eggsy" who is chosen to interview as a professional spy for a secret group called the Kingsmen. They eliminate applicants during the "interview" -- which is actually a series of treacherous attacks, etc. -- until there is one left standing. "Kingsman" is reminiscent of The Avengers on TV and 007. It has some very funny scenes, particularly toward the end, and clever dialogue throughout.The violence was very cartoon-like, but I still didn't like it and found it too much and too graphic. I admit I'm not a big fan of violence, but I'll put up with it for something like "The Godfather" - -- not for this. Lots of explosions and clever spy devices, with good performances by Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Egerton. Look for Mark Hamill -- see if you can find him without knowing which character he plays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not only the best spy film of 2015 but right now for me it may end up being the best film of 2015. No seriously it really might. I haven't had this much fun with any film since the first Avengers movie and this is defiantly a lot more adult than that one, and even with its adult themes and a being a 'R' rated film it holds so much back from us. I mean there are times when you forget that its 'R', and then you watch a fight scene in it and you remember the reason why. Still with all that being said it still a film I highly recommend. I have personally watched the film at least six times maybe more. Colin Firth does a great job in it to the point were he should be commended for what he managed to do in the role. He truly gave a lot of life to his performance playing the hardcore spy who was been doing this for a long time. He also was a great father figure and a lovable character overall. Taron Egerton is defiantly going somewhere in the future with his career, and I myself can't wait to see where he finds himself at. I absolutely loved him playing this kid from the ghetto who was trying to make a life for himself and be something to someone who wanted him to be. So overall this is a exceptional film that deserves a lot of notice and needs to be on everyone's top 10 list even if it isn't number one like it will probably end up being for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE GOOD:great video tricks.great martial arts.good story.capable actors.interesting SciFi gadgets. proper scene alignment. THE BAD: some characters are cartoonish. like the girl with artificial blade runner legs.and the secret agent she slices in two in the beginning of the movie.the music is loud and silly; similar to old cartoon like peter pan. THE UGLY: movie music has a volume MUCH higher than dialogue..So you must increase and decrease the volume all through the entire movie. This could be the most stupid mistake made by the director. one moment you find actors talk at low volume and suddenly your eardrums get ripped with some silly action music. My interpretation is the director himself is probably deaf, sniffs powder, or smokes weed so has no sense of the word loud noise since the noise already embedded into his moron skull. because of that, movie is not worth to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spy movie parody elements plus fireworks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not your average James Bond spoof, this espionage comedy features characters who acknowledge the Bond franchise and lament the serious turn taken by the series in recent years with less colourful villains and less imaginative plots. At the same time, 'Kingsman' also features a plot deliciously absurd on the level of 'Dr. No' and 'Goldfinger' with a villain set on destroying most of the human population from his glamorous lair in the side of a mountain. The gadgetry on offer also has a zaniness not seen in the Bond franchise since Desmond Llewelyn's heyday as Q. And yet, even with such absurdities in place, the villain's scheme is remarkably relevant to the world today with climate change issues and conservation in mind, and there is a memorable speech in which humankind is compared to a virus slowly destroying Earth. The film is not without its drawbacks; the tone is often uneven as the story constantly flips back and forth from serious to comedic. Samuel L. Jackson also tends to overplay the villain, lisping half the time for no particularly good reason. Colin Firth on the other hand is very, very good as the proper gentleman spy who trains our protagonist; the way he keeps calm and cool all the time offers some of the film's greatest laughs. The action sequences are also noticeably well coordinated and while the heavy carnage has understandably attracted complaints from some, the filmmakers are careful not use bloodshed for bloodshed's sake. Few films (if any) have used fireworks quite the same way as they are used here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminded Me of Hot Fuzz...Only Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie expecting just a fun spy-action comedy. I certainly got that, but it felt like a lot more than just that. Kingsman: The Secret Service has a very goofy plot. It's over-the- top, and it certainly knows it. However, the plot is still serious enough to keep you interested. Considering the handful of twists throughout the movie it easily keeps you engaged, and although you love laughing at how over-the-top it is, you still want to know the overall outcome. The characters are quite well done. Sure, some of them are a little cliché, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad. Plus most of the cliché-ness is drowned out by the greatness of the rest of the movie, so I hardly noticed it until after the end credits rolled. They still felt real enough to keep you engaged in who they were and how the plot drove them forward. The action scenes were fantastic. The camera work and constant speed of each duel was captivating, and oftentimes quite hilarious. Nevertheless, they're some of the most engaging fights I've ever seen, and some of the overall best. The choreography is fantastic, to an almost unreal level at how people are capable of moving as smoothly and quickly as they do (I wouldn't be surprised if there was some editing on the speed of each character though. Nonetheless, they were always beautiful to watch). Most of them appear to be done in one shot for the most part, which is even more fantastic. And considering the plot twists throughout, you were never sure who would actually win a fight, which really kept you on the edge of your seat. Overall Kingsman: The Secret Service is not at all what I expected, and in this case it turns out to be a good thing. The plot is silly, yet serious enough to keep you engaged, the characters are well- done, and the fights are stunning. This movie reminds me of Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz, with it's goofy plot and over-the-top action, only I thought this movie was better. If you did like Hot Fuzz, then you'll love this. In the end I would highly recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service. It surpassed my expectations on every level, and I'm sure it'll do the same for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the theme of random people becoming spies/agents over night is indeed very worn out, Kingsman does not disappoint. The humor, where there is some, is pretty good but I must say -the close combat scenes were at times poorly directed. The acting was not bad and the villain was very well explained -though some things, like Gazelle for example, I found very unrealistic and far fetched. Samuel L Jackson amazing and the role he played was just perfect for him. The ending was just comical and the plot twists were well thought out though not exactly original. The overuse of swears was a bit annoying but really helped to set the mood sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teenager whose is at a dead end turns his life around when he finds a secret spy network that his father worked for before he died.Director Matthew Vaughn delivers a perfect entertainment spy movie. It's cartoonish, graphically violent and captures the spirit of 007 while poking fun at it at times but to Vaughn's credit Kingsman has an identity all of its own. It's fast paced, stylish, even though it's packed with stereotypes there's plenty of emotion and twists and turns to match. There's some great action and fight setups which feel dangerous as you never know who will be killed off next. It's not Oscar material and it's not meant to be its pure fun with a stellar cast including a perfectly cast Michael Caine, an unstated Mark Strong, with Samuel L. Jackson who is hilarious to name a few. There's also a cameo by UK's Jack Davenport and Luke Skywalker himself Mark Hamill. Overall, with a great score and cast finely put together, they don't come much sharper than this. Recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman the Secret Service, directed by Matthew Vaughn, is a 2014 action thriller that pays homage to the classic British spy genre. It stars Taron Egerton in the lead role, with Colin Firth, Mark Strong and Sophie Cookson in supporting roles and Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. Many reviewers really liked this movie, but although there were a few good things about it, I did not like it so much. Let me explain why. The plot was clichéd and predictable. The main character Eggsy (played by Egerton) was a classic troubled teenager that is recruited by Harry Hart (played by Firth) an old friend of Eggsy's late father, to be part of the Kingsman Secret Service and capture bad guys that want to destroy the world. Eggsy goes on to learn the ways of the Kingsmen and eventually saves the world from an obnoxious megalomaniac (played by Jackson) that wants to destroy the world with his super weapon or something like that. That is basically the whole plot. Along the way, some people betray each other and some people get killed and there is a lot of explaining the plot that goes around in circles and there are some very cool fight scenes. I really felt that the plot lacked substance. There was really nothing special about a teenager perfecting his skill and saving the world from a bad guy. Even with a simplistic plot like this, interesting things can be done with it. The problem with this movie was that the stylistic choices including bright color schemes and out-of-place upbeat music and the dialogue, made it hard for me to take the movie seriously and really get involved in the fact that Sam Jackson's character wanted to kill everyone. The gore and tension throughout the movie was downplayed by the style. People were getting killed and there was upbeat disco music playing in the background. It felt as if they were going for a light-hearted family movie, and then there was intense murder scenes with lots and lots of gore that were still treated in the style of a light-hearted family film. It just didn't make sense. The characters didn't seem to take it seriously that people were dying a lot. I really didn't understand what Matthew Vaughn was going for in stylistic choices.One of the main problems I had with this film was Samuel Jackson's ridiculous performance as the villain Valentine, especially his annoying lisp. Jackson is a great actor and I admire many of his performances, but his character simply wasn't remotely believable. We were supposed to believe as audience members that Valentine was some kind of evil genius that created some kind of technology or something like that (I lost track of the convoluted explanations) that caused people to fight each other, when he acted like he was really dumb. He was visible clueless when Colin Firth's intellectual gentleman character explained his position on environmental problems, something that Valentine was supposedly an expert on. Throughout the movie, Valentine consistently wears a casual baseball cap and swears casually in professional discussions. He gives the impression that he is an uneducated thug and not even a good one at that, but in fact according to the movie, he is a technological genius and public figure that creates a super weapon. In addition, he relies on his bodyguard Gazelle (played by Sofia Boutella) to do all the fighting. Valentine captures many WORLD LEADERS and important people without even having an army. He has a few henchman that show up at the end and are easily disposed by Eggsy and his comrades. It just isn't believable. At all. His character also seems somewhat racist given that Jackson is the only black actor in the film. Of course the one black guy has to be the evil terrorist? WTF? In addition, Jackson and Sofia Boutella are the only non- English people in the film and they are the bad guys. It seems as if the filmmakers are trying to say that English people are smart and everyone else isn't. There are many other problems I have with this movie including the long boring pacing with many unnecessary dialogue scenes (or information dumps), the convoluted plot structure, clichéd character development and consistent lack of substance. The one thing that I did like about this movie were the elaborate and well-choreographed and well-filmed fight sequences. There were quite a few fight scenes throughout the film and they were filmed often as long shots that were sped up and slowed down with pans and not much shaky cam. It reminded me of the stylistic fight sequences in Green Street Hooligans (which was a very good movie by the way). Aside from how well the fights were put together a lot of them seemed unnecessary and featured gratuitous gore and violence that didn't belong. In particular, there was one scene where Firth's character starts killing people in a church that lasts for probably about 3 minutes. At the end it is casually explained by Jackson that he used his weapon to brainwash Firth into killing everyone, and Firth barely reacts to that before getting shot in the head. This is somewhat of a surprise in the movie, but honestly Firth's character isn't likable enough for me to care one way or the other. Besides the cool fight sequences, good cinematography and okay acting, this movie is a tediously long action thriller that lacks substance, original characters and plot elements, is predictable and has many plot elements that simply aren't believable or realistic. It has a family fun style but is way to gory to watch with young kids. Watch this movie if you are drinking beers with friends and don't mind cheesy movies or Samuel Jackson's obnoxious lisp. I give this movie a C- or a 6/10.</fullReview>

It shows a good sense and personality, one that belongs entirely to itself. The action is also quite shocking. I had no idea it would be rated-R, so when I saw the film I was pleasantly surprised by the type of violence shown and interconnected with some strong themes that the film is trying to play with. I think the lead actor is also very good, very charismatic and he is able to make the part work efficiently. The soundtrack for this is also quite fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hot mess of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I originally saw the ad for a new spy movie with Colin Firth, I was excited at the prospect of watching a new and witty franchise. How wrong I was.This is just one of those movies that was churned out for young audiences without any care for quality or consistency. It's like the creators of this film looked up what was popular on netflix and jammed in all their favorite parts without caring about the plot. Watching this movie was a jarring experience, because there is no solid theme running throughout the film. You see a little Tarantino here and there, a lot of James bond, some Spy kids (remember that one) and a little taste of FX's Archer to finish things off. And worse of all, it really drags in the middle and focuses too much on a poorly scripted teen drama. Considering that we are watching a spy in training, you would expect to see some really cool stunt work and fun gadgets along the way. NOPE! Just some teen angst and some competitive exercises.While I was disappointed to see that Colin Firth was just a supporting character, I was irritatingly bored with Taron Egerton's character Eggsy; just another bland and rebellious every-teen. He manages to crack a solid joke once in a while, but is never witty- although the movie tells us he is very witty.I think one of the more annoying aspects of this movie is how often they break that fourth wall to tell you how good this movie is. Considering how badly this movie is written, I found this these constant winks towards the audience very obnoxious. "Don't you miss all those fun and witty spy movies?" "Don't you miss the classic villains?" Yes I do, but this movie isn't even close to delivering on any of these. So shut up and finish this crap! I could on and one about everything wrong with this movie, but I think that would require more effort than was put into the movie's writing. While the marketing deceived me into watching a movie aimed at teens, I know that movie companies see bad products as a one night stand. However, this leads me to my last and biggest problem with the movie. It is profoundly sexist, but is aimed at a teenage audience. What the hell? To be clear, the movie is not being ironically sexist to get some laughs- because that I could live with. No, this is the bad kind of sexism that is deeply ingrained in the story's plot to make the main (but incredibly bland) lead more interesting. First, the mother is a weak mess that requires rescuing from an abusive alcoholic. While Eggsy's father was an incredible war hero, the mother decided to marry a sleaze shortly after his passing. The movie never explains how the same woman can go from marrying a hero to a pathetic criminal- we just assume that a woman without a good man falls to pieces. Second, Eggsy's main rival in the spy training program is a girl, which you would think is progress. Again, nope! She can only succeed when Eggsy boosts her confidence. She completely lacks any sense of confidence without his support. Making matters worse, she is completely written out of the final act, even though she proves herself to be the best spy in the program! They literally attach a balloon to her back and send her off to the sky, while Eggsy takes on the bad guys. Finally, there is the now infamous anal scene. Again this is a scene that just does not fit, as the movie was never this raunchy and the humor was completely different. Its like the writers of Archer wondered in to the writing room and wrapped things up for them. Don't get me wrong, I love Archer as much as the next guy, but this was just so random. What made it worse is that Princess Tilde was the only world leader in the movie to stand up for her people. So to honor her courage, the movie has her drop her pants for the "hero" and offer her anus. If that sounds graphic, that is because that is how the scene plays. Hopefully I am fully conveying the movie's attitude towards women. While I want to dismiss this as just another piece of crappy film making, I am disturbed on why the creators thought the denigration of women was important in a movie for teens. Why is every woman in this movie have to be so weak? Some may accuse me of being overly PC. As a former football player and fratboy, I know I am not. I like raunchy comedies, violent movies, and sexy thrillers. But I don't like it when movie producers underestimate its audiences and dismiss their intelligence. Slapping a few jokes and some nudity to a bad movie does not "fix it". I am also not shy about calling out a movie's creators for perpetuating bad behavior. Real men do not need to tear down women to make themselves feel better. Sexism isn't cool or fun, and neither is this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: Secret Service is a heartfelt parody of Spy Movies, but chiefly ends up a collection of ideas that do not mesh or work well. The cast delivers mixed performances. Colin Firth carries the movie well, and Taron Egerton is refreshing and charismatic in the lead role. However, Samuel L. Jackson is terribly miscast, awkward and misused.From a technical point of view, the movie suffers from overuse of erratic, frantic editing that gets old and meshes poorly with the script's tone. The movie is chock full of visual effects with standards that range from standard to shoe string budget, although the film had a decent budget of $80 million. The dialogue is often clunky, the movie has pacing problems, and the comedy is low brow yet lacks the energy of (for instance) an Austin Powers movie.On the positive side, the fight choreography and stunt work is top notch, there is some decent set design and style to the movie, and the story is mostly serviceable.All told, Kingsman is a movie with heart that unfortunately falls apart due to inept handling of many aspects.</fullReview>

After finishing it, I was confused by the disparity between my opinion of the movie and the reception it got. Sure, the movie is original, it does not use clichés and has really surprising moments, but the positives end there. The action scenes were way too graphic, to the point where I asked myself: what is the point of this? Some of the stunts pulled by the main character were downright unrealistic. From an acting standpoint, the movie did mostly fine, the actors were believable in their roles, even if sometimes hard to understand, but that's British accents for you.I would say, watch this movie if you are someone who lives for action movies. And don't be fooled by the "comedy" tag. This move is NOT a comedy, and does not contain funny moments. It passes more as an action thriller really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has its moments but gets way too cruel and vicious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary "Eggsy" (Taron Egerton) is a teenager who has no direction in life. His father was part of a secret agency called Kingsman who battle evil undercover. His father was killed when Eggsy was a baby. His fathers mentor Harry (Colin Firth) persuades Eggsy to try out for the Kingsman. Then there's evil Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a (pretty stupid) idea for world domination.This has been a hit with critics and audiences seem to like it. However this directors last film was "Kick-Ass" which was OK but got way too violent and vicious in the end. This is no exception. The beginning and middle are not bad. Full of action and energy and some excitement. The violence is restrained but really kicks in at the end. As a rule violence doesn't bother me. However this movie seems to take an unhealthy attitude to it. They seem to LOVE showing people being viciously killed or tortured. It's all speeded up so it's like a Looney Tunes on acid so it isn't too upsetting but after a while it wears you down. It got depressing and uncomfortable. Also the movie is far too long. This doesn't have to run over two hours. Worst of all is Jackson. He's TERRIBLE! His OTT performance wasn't funny or amusing--it was just incredibly annoying. And what was with that lisp? Pretty stupid plot too even for a spy spoof.On the positive side the rest of the acting was pretty good. Egerton is a likable main character; Firth is always good; Michael Caine is good also in his too few scenes; Mark Strong is fun as Merlin and Sofia Boutella is interesting as Gazelle. So it does have a lot of action, suspense and violence but it's too much and far too cruel.</fullReview>

The basic story/premise to stick to. Kingsman, OTOH, is just all over the place.One does understand that they wanted to be "shocking enough to warrant a film series", so they over-did it on purpose. Even so, they "over-did the over-doing", so to speak.

I went to the movies to watch a cool action film and they sure did not fail to deliver.

Unfortunately, I had to take at least 3 points out just for the final sequences.

		<shortDescription>The First Film in the "Kingsman" Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the comic book "The Secret Service," the blockbuster film "Kingsman" enjoyed tremendous popularity in its theatrical release. What is the appeal of this film that may lead to a "Kingsman" franchise motion picture with endless sequels? First, there is the humor that transcends the typical James Bond suave and supremely confident British snobbery. Second, there is Colin Firth, who was perfect in the role of Harry Hart (or Galahad), who is the linchpin in the non-political secret organization of Kingsmen. Third, there is the outstanding cinematography that included well-chosen location filming in the UK.The film was neither a rip-off nor a parody of a James Bond film. It sought to distill the theme of overpopulation and global warning into a profound social commentary. It was in this area that the film foundered, especially with the cardboard cutout villain character. Although well performed by Samuel L. Jackson, the role was conceived an an over-the-top and nearly farcical character.An inadvertent revelation from the film is the theme of the loss of basic human values in the twenty-first century. The villainous Valentine was using technology to turn humans against one another in endless slaughter to reduce global population. But a casual glance at our world indicates that it would not take sophisticated technology to create a civilization in this kind of decline. Although the film is a hodgepodge of styles, it nonetheless raises provocative values about our world. Some of the scenes, such as the carnage in the church, were shocking. But are they really much different from what exists in our top news stories?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good action scenes...and that's it.A young man is drawn into applying to be a secret agent with the highly secretive organisation, Kingsman. Meanwhile a multi- billionaire is plotting something massive and catastrophic for mankind, aided by his assistant, Oscar Pistorius in drag.I was hoping for something clever, character-based or with a good plot, or maybe even a James Bond parody. Alas, this is none of those. It is basically a fairly poor ripoff of a James Bond movie: less plot and less humour but more explosions and action scenes. The action does carry it though and there is hardly a dull moment.Overall, reasonably tense and (mindlessly) entertaining but certainly not a must-see.</fullReview>

But its, no offense, really like a satire of London's sense of humor. Pretty predictable as well. I just couldn't wait till the end. And normally i do. Deserve indeed some respect, but far from some admiration.I am appreciated and a little bit disappointed.

		<shortDescription>Kingsman - Funny with good action scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was great and funny. It had some violent parts so might not be for everyone. It was about a street kid getting an offer from a secret service agent to join there service. He goes through training and then get's sent on a mission. The other people joining the service all came from university backgrounds. It wasn't the best movie I have seen, hence only seven stars out of ten. But it had some good action scenes and a few funny moments. The plot was a bit predictable and I am sure it has been done before. Apart from that the movie was great. It stared some good actors including Samuel L Jackson and Michael Kane. It was worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' walks a very fine line between parody and homage, never straying too far to one side or the other. Its tongue is certainly in its cheek, but never sticking out toward the audience.Clearly director Matthew Vaughn was attempting to fashion a spy film that brings back a sense of fun reminiscent of the James Bond films of yore; even going meta on occasion to drive the point home. But even though it wears its absurdity on its sleeve, 'Kingsman' still manages to sneak in a genuine character arc and by the end we genuinely want our heroes to save the day. It's a heck of a balancing act Vaughn has done here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a young man who is selected to be in training to work for a private run secret agent service."Kingsman: The Secret Service" is really a lot of fun. The graphic violence is so over the top that it becomes funny. The fireworks scene makes me laugh out loud! I like the characters in the film, I think Colin Firth is very convincing as a gentleman and secret agent. His protégé is good as well, he transforms from a street kid to a gentleman with killer instincts. The numerous action scenes are very imaginative, they even have balloons going up into space, which is quite unexpected. I enjoyed watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The suit is the modern gentleman's armor. The Kingsmen are the new knights." Harry Hart (Firth) has just lost his partner and friend. When he goes to tell the wife he leaves a present for his son (Egerton). Years later they two meet up again, this time Harry is a recruiter. Together, along with the rest of the Kingsmen. they must stop the global threat Valentine (Jackson) has set up. Before I really looked at the rating for this I was expecting a teenage Cody Banks type movie. After seeing it was rated R I was confused. The movie is very much geared toward the teenage crowd, but the fact that there are over 100 uses of the f-word take it out of the teenage crowd acceptability. The fact that the movie is about a younger agent takes this out of the older crowd's desire to see this. Colin Firth is very good and this is a different part for him. The main problem is that the swearing and violence push it out watch-ability for the crowd it is intended for. Had the movie been the same without the swearing it would have found an audience. As it stands its in between those that can't see it and those that don't want to. Overall, adding the unnecessary swearing really hurt the movie badly. I give this a C+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not very promising in the beginning, as it feels like a stupid movie with too many coincidences. A kid with family problem, arrested by cop, have a direct access to contact a very secret service and contact them after years ( what happen with the time when he dealt with drugs, kicked out of the marines, etc??), and the secret service suddenly come in person to bail him out (a secret service is supposed to be busy isn't he? :) ), but OK, so I keep following the movie with lower expectation, but still hope it won't be another Austin Power.Then the Secret Service (name Kingsman) started to recruit a new guy to replace one agent who died in a mission, apart from the questionable way to find a candidate for the very sophisticated organization, the movie began to be interesting, with new ways of training methods. It shows off the technology, Bond's type of weapon, state of the art facility (underground!), ... and high fashion :). Not to mention peer pressure and friendship to give more dynamics of a military camp and some gentleman values.It gets more interesting since the villain is portrayed well by Samuel L. Jackson, a genius lunatic who wants to "save" the world from "viruses" but still save some along with him, with the reference of Noah and his ark. Clearly he is very genius and a strong and balance rival for the Kingsman that it makes the movie interesting, with lots of twists and surprises which will make us like to sit and watch more and more. The last fight between Eggsy (the main character beside Colin Firth) and Gazelle (the main villain beside Jackson) is also interesting and quite classy, not a prolong fight but it shows skill and versatility of both. At the end... Of course the world is saved :)Thus, this can be categorized as a complete movie, with action, blood, mutilation, comedy, friendship, gentleman, fashion, technology, etc. The story is not really perfect, but it can be forgiven with the aboves, along with the twist.A good movie to spend a weekend :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't gotten this giddy, this wide-eyed excited about an action movie since the 2009 Star Trek. Maybe 300 before that, and The Mummy when I was more of a kid. Kingsmen had me by the ladyballs literally from the first five seconds, as I imagine it might for many other Western World 80s and 90s kids. It might be my favorite movie opening to date. In fact, the whole film is visually spectacular, from the speed of the fight scenes to the thoughtful framing and color choices to the classy and unique way they integrated cg into their spy tech. It was actually pretty well-written, too, and I'm picky about that. For frame of reference, I think Avengers looks pretty cool but the dialogue is dreck. Kingsmen, though, asks you to suspend your disbelief as much as you would a comic book movie, but also provides answers to many logic holes that a viewer with half a brain would have. That said, much of its charm is also borne by its formulaic story. Like in the aforementioned Star Trek, our young troubled hero must prove he's worth his father's salt to an organization he's destined to join, and does so by helping to defeat a sociopathic supervillain. I'll trade originality of plot for sharp one-liners delivered by an intelligent cast in these rare cases.The film has its flaws of course. Sorry ladies, Kingsmen is a boys' club, save the occasional tropey man-eater female assassin or damsel busting at the seams. Oh well, you can't have everything. TL;DR: This movie is f'ing spectacular. If I were British I probably would have loved it to an unhealthy degree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has so many flaws it is hard to know where to start. Let's just jump in with all the ham fisted homages to other spy franchises. Naming the dog J.B. just so they could rattle off three agents with those initials. The failed attempt to channel John Steed with lectures on being a "gentleman." When Steed did that sort of thing, you actually liked him. He understood that a "gentleman" was never insufferable. The clumsy shoe phone reference. Setting the whole Kingsman front in what appeared to be a Savile Row version of Del Florio's.Despite the attempt to make the young lead a take on Luke Skywalker, he seemed more like a refugee from a boy band, perhaps more suited for "The Justin Bieber Story." The cheesy martini order. No explanation of how the widowed mother went from being the wife a Kingsman, to being the woman of some London low life.All in all, more of a first person shooter video game than a movie. The tediously interminable gratuitous killings in the church. Belatedly asking for landing clearance when you are wheels down on final. The bad guy guards in the tunnel complex who were dressed like 21st century imperial storm troopers. Bringing in surface to air missiles to take out a parked aircraft. The conveniently narrow tunnel where our alleged hero could make like Jackie Chan. The ridiculous acid trip like exploding heads. And the very last hidden in the credits bit where it looked like the same pub morons who were thrashed by Galahad appeared to be lining up for another dose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kingsman: The Secret Service": To describe this movie in one word, the word would undoubtedly have to be "cool". This movie drools cool from its characters to its violence to its style to its camera work, this was bloody and awesome! I've been a pretty big fan of this director since 2011 when I first saw a film of his, which was "X- Men: First Class". I dug the hell out of that flick, I thought that it was a real fun time in the theater and is still possibly my favorite X-Men flick to date. Then I finally got around to checking out his movie "Kick-Ass", which in my opinion is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, right next to Tim Burton's "Batman", Christopher Nolan's "The Dark Knight", and the Richard Donner "Superman" films. This movie deserves a place as one of the great spy films to go alongside something like the James Bond franchise. It shows a real love for those movies, particularly in the Roger Moore era, but does its own thing with the genre, plus being creative in how brutal and violent one single frame can get. It is amazing to watch every action sequence happen in the movie. Samuel L. Jackson had me laughing my ass off with him as the villain while simultaneously being fairly unique and intense in his character's own right. For a brief time in the movie I didn't quite understand what his motivation was for his ultimate plans, but once it got to the explanation I was right on board. Not that I ever got off board necessarily, it was just something that popped in my mind occasionally is all. All the characters in the film are a blast to watch in their own ways; Colin Firth commands every scene that he is in with his suave attitude and great talent for taking out an entire room of bad guys all on his own. The lead character "Eggsy", played by Taron Egerton, a young guy who seems to be pretty early in his career really does an outstanding job in his role here. He remains likable and completely believable in his action sequences, never once faltering where the character could easily fallen into being relatively annoying if played by a lesser actor. But he keeps the character feel real, someone I can route for and interesting to watch. I like the quirky touches that Matthew Vaughn brings to his films, they don't ever seem quite conventional yet they don't come across as too out of the realm of comprehension either. His films know how to have fun and can also hold a real sense of danger too. "First Class" had fun playing with its time and setting, but still dealt with themes of prejudice and nuclear war. "Kick Ass" had fun with its comic book style with bringing that over-the-top world into a somehow extremely grounded and extremely gritty reality. And now "Kingsman" with the mystery, highly stylized silly action and spy gadgets while also threats of mass genocide from the villain. One of the best spy and action films I've seen in a while; if you are a fan of the spy genre and action in general then this may be right up your ally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is an action spy comedy film based on the comic of the same name and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass, X-Men: First Class). I thought it was great fun. It was action packed and really funny in all the right places.Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a teenage delinquent, who lives with his mum and her abusive boyfriend in a small flat in London. One night, Eggsy steals the car of someone he doesn't like, crashes it into a police car and is sent to jail. A short time later he is bailed out by man named Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a veteran secret agent who informs Eggsy that his father was one of their top agents who died saving Harry's life 18 years ago. Harry takes Eggsy under his wing and leads him into the world of espionage to stop a dangerous super-villain Mr. Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) from taking over the world.There are plenty of allusions and references to other action spy films like the James Bond and Jason Bourne series and this movie satirises many of their most memorable moments really well. The film's action scenes were also very well choreographed and this is thanks to Matthew Vaughn's fast paced directing style. Colin Firth was great as the English gentleman style secret agent Harry Hart and newcomer Taron Egerton was also enjoyable as the protagonist Eggsy. There was rarely a dull moment.I rate it 8.5/10 and I recommend it to anyone who liked the first Kick Ass movie and Hot Fuzz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman was highly recommended to me by a friend that knows what I like in film and TV and I finally got a free movie weekend from my provider and saw it available to watch. It was not at all what I expected--it was extremely out there and not believable...yet I was still into it.Usually there are things that are outrageous and if there are an overwhelming amount of said outrageous things, the story loses believability for me and I have trouble suspending disbelief. For most of the film, I could not buy into the ridiculous scenarios, but I kept with it and kept trying. I enjoyed Taron Egerton's Eggsy so much so, and grew attached to the character. I wanted him to succeed and felt for him during his Kingsman training/testing. I think the real turning point was a major character's death, and then I totally was able to suspend disbelief and cheer on Eggsy and what remained of the Kingsman Service. Samuel L. Jackson is great, but his character was one of the ones that didn't make any logical sense. I could never take him seriously as a baddie because of the way he spoke. His sidekick with the lower leg blades, or whatever those were, were another outrageous element that made this movie utterly ridiculous. Overall, I rate this 8 out of 10 stars for the humour it provided and the discovery of Taron Egerton!</fullReview>

I left the theater having found one of my favorite movies. Kingsman has just about everything you could look for in an action film. Comedy, Action, Romance, Kingsman has it all. The way director Matthew Vaughn was able to pull all of these elements together to direct a hit like this is amazing.I've always enjoyed the classic James Bond spy films, but Kingsman was such a unique take on the spy movie genre that it is hard not to like. One thing that really pulled this movie together was the casting. Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L Jackson all play very important roles in the film and complement each other very well making the movie that much more enjoyable.I would recommend Kingman to just about anyone who enjoys a good action movie with some comedy and romance mixed in. Matthew Vaughn really directed himself a hit and I'll be looking into more of his films in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KINGSMAN the secret Service is the Spy genre done Right. Of course its a bit of a spoof at times and often its a sharp reminder of how fun movies use to be. Before they got dark and almost depressing. The American attempt is the XxX Franchise starring Vin Diesel and Ice cube. but this is the way it should be done. with style and class. The Story centers around Eggsey Unwin. His father was a secret agent code named Lancelot who died saving another Agent named Harry Hart. code named Galahad. Harry tells Lancelot's family and gives eggsy a medal with a phone number attached to it. and tells the family if you ever need a favor call this number and use this phrase Oxford not Brouges and I'll know its you. flash forward to 2014 and Eggsy is now a young man direction less a stint in the royal Marines has not given him what he wants . His stepfather abuses his mother and him. When Eggsy goes out with his friends a fight breaks out which results in Eggsy stealing a car and being chased by police.After being arrested he calls the number and is released from jail. Eggsy meets Harry Hart who offers him a new life that is if Eggsy has the courage to accept it. And With that Eggsy enters a boot camp for the Kingsmen. a secret Service more rugged then any armed branch. Then there is the major Villain Richmond Valentine played as always wonderfully by Samuel L. Jackson . valentine has a plan to save the world. Too bad its only the people he chooses to survive that will live. Eggsy's Training and the plot by Valentine run side by side and you know its going to be Eggsy saving the day if he survives his training.the movie is done tongue in cheek style and and as a tribute to all of those wonderful Bond movies with a twist.You want fun see this movie you want action see this movie you want a great date movie see this movie.Kingsmen is what all movies should be. fun with a sense of style and flair and not taking itself too serious.You love James Bond well then you'll like KINGSMEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People always talk about the good old days of movies. The 60's and 70's are prime targets. One of the biggest products of the 60's was the spy film. "Goldfinger", my favorite Bond film, was a huge hit, and a lot of people(including me) want to recapture the magic of said film. Even the filmmakers do. Why else would the DB5 make an appearance in 2012's spectacular "Skyfall?" The truth is, if Goldfinger were made today, people probably wouldn't like it. It's great because of the nostalgia, because we get to see what made a sexy hero, girl, and villain back in the day. Some bits would work, but the weird names and cheesy lines would not connect with an audience not warned that it's a movie from the 60's. Kingsman: The Secret Service is not an homage, or satire of 60's bond, as people say. It's a remake. Since I hate everything about remakes, one might expect I'd hate this film. However, the sheer fun factor, and the fact that the film masterfully disguises that it is a remake made me feel just the opposite. In the film, a young criminal named Eggsy(Taron Egerton) is recruited by Harry Hart(Colin Furth) to join the Kingsman, an organization of spies that, well, save the world. Eggsy begins his training, while Harry tracks down Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) an evil Russel Simmons selling SD Cards that release violent brainwaves. Each actor digs into their roles perfectly, and the standout is the DiCaprio like Egerton. However, this is a 60's Bond plot by all accounts.Ridiculous villain with mountain lair, check. Henchman with crazy physical disability, check(this time it's in the form of a razor-legged woman.) But the plot has been injected with the fuel of 2015's "meta" culture. James Bond, as well as other spy films are referenced almost constantly. The fact that these references work is astounding. Of course, there couldn't be a young recruit without his learning to work together with other young recruits. Some are rich and spoiled, some are nice and humbled. These parts work...but less well. They set up exciting set pieces, but ultimately feel too cliché for their own good. However, the third thing that makes Kingsman feel fresh is the thing it has most going for it. Director Matthew Vaughn's extremely modern brand of ultraviolence. A masterful, Tarantinian scene in a church comes to mind, but the finale is just as gleefully destructive. This adrenaline shot of modern techniques combined with the old-school sensibilities of "Goldfinger" and "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" elevate Kingsman. It's not just an action film, it's one of the best films of the year. It speaks to the film's list of great moments(or my overlong writing) that I don't have room to mention the AMAZING score, and gorgeous pop-art production design. If a 60's Bond film was made today, it might look something like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spy films nowadays are all taken seriously since the reboot of the famous 007: James Bond series back in 2006, and as well the introduction of the Bourne series in which helped to format what kind of spy flick could be in existence. Kingsman however is something that is both over-the-top and yet takes us back to the 90's generation of spy movies that are often looked back today and regarded as cheesy or bad. Not to say that Kingsman is already this year's worst film immediately nor too put it down, but it achieves the audiences in ways you could or couldn't expect it, and truth be told it won me over!Based on the acclaimed graphic novel of the same name by the writers of the cult hit Kick-Ass 1 and 2, Kingsman tells both an origin story and a thrilling adventure of epic proportions. If you have had read the book, you could expect pretty much what will happen but surprisingly Matthew Vaughn has given more detail to make it seem more epic. There are some minor changes to the original characters but the structure of whey they go pretty much follows the book but better in the results on screen.If the mixture of Bond, Kick-Ass and perhaps The Avengers were to be combined, this would be the film that would have came out of it! Kingsman: The Secret Service is a shot of pure fire of action, comedy and pure escapism that will indeed keep you awake and it certainly earns a spot of my favorite films for 2015 alongside Birdman.4.5/5 - Nick</fullReview>

Gazelle's is a stand out character with an unusual weapons at her disposal. Her "handicap" does not slow her down at all, rather she has turned her replacement limbs into lethal instruments and has the training to wipe out rooms full of armed men.

The story is about Eggsy (Egerton), a streetwise, smart kid, who gets recruited for the Kingsman service: an international, high-class secret service, by Galahad (Firth), an extremely well-dressed and skilled gentleman-spy. When they discover the evil plot of genius Valentine (Jackson) they have to do all that is in their power to stop his plan and save the world. Now this story sounds like every spy movie ever. However the execution is what makes this film different and ultimately perhaps better. First off, the performances are great, Colin Firth as the suave, stylish, well-mannered bad-ass would be improbable but is very believable and great. Sam Jackson as the villain is also great; he's quirky, funny and has his reasons to do what he does. He has a strange accent, which many people found annoying. I can understand why, but personally I think it just adds to the character. Another great thing is that he can't stand the sight of blood, which is ironic for a villain, but delivers funny moments. Michael Caine also does a fine job of being an asshole; however the young Egerton is the one who is really welcome. He's great in this movie; he goes from being a streetwise bad-ass, to being a civilized bad-ass. Once again the story is nothing revolutionary, it's pretty standard spy-stuff, however as I said it is the execution that makes the difference. This film is an homage to the old spy flicks, while giving it a very modern spin. The music goes from Dance to classical without it being weird. The traditional gadgets are modernized and the pace is a bit faster. The action is formidable. Extremely well-shot and super cool. One cannot write about this movie without mentioning the church scene. This scene is amazing, rivaling and maybe surpassing the Quicksilver scene form X-men: Days of Future Past. It is incredible action, masterfully shot in long takes establishing Matthew Vaughn as an amazing action director. This movie is also very funny, it has sophisticated humor and brutal anal jokes, but it fits with the tone of the characters and overall the movie. It also a lot of visual humor, one scene in particular (the second best) left me laughing out loud. This film is a modern take on the spy-genre, and it delivers very well. Dare I say it is better than most Bond films out there! This movie is funny, colorful, the action is amazing and it promises a lot for a future franchise. This was a breath of fresh air in the spy-genre, and I think it was well-needed. 8.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great violent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first thought it was just another spy movie but after just some minutes into it, it blew my mind. Overall the movie has some great violent action scenes with a lot of violence what i didn't think it would happen besides that,the camera angles and all the moves make it even better, the script is pretty good , Colin Firth was great and makes the movie even better i love it and it's a really fun movie who's really worth it. It's a very smart movie and makes you like the character's specially Colin's and Taron , all the recruiting and how they grow is very nice , it's awesome how it combines violence with comedy which come the most from Eggsy. It's an awesome fun movie and everyone should watch it .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has interesting and intense elements, but the tonal control is surprisingly weak and generally it is a messy affair throughout (MAJOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had only vaguely heard things about this film when I sat to watch it and, being honest, I was of the mind that it was more aimed at younger audiences. My basis for this was that it seemed like a spy spoof with gentle humor from the brief clip I had seen. Of course very early in the film the action and language let me know this is not the case at all. From this point on we have the standard structure of the new recruit providing the narrative and also acting as the viewer's eyes as he too is introduced to the world of the secret agency. This leads into a fight to stop a typically crazy plan for world domination, and as a plot I found it perfectly enjoyable.In the specifics though the film is oddly unbalanced in terms of its tone; there is an element of it trying to do that same balancing act that Kickass did, but here it does not come over so well. In some cases it is quite silly and plays to its comedic nature, but then in other ways it is very intense and dramatic with no laughs to be hand. Mostly it must be said, the film does manage to get the silliness and the violence to go together hand in hand, generally with comedic or stylistic flourishes that stop us taking it too seriously ? or by killing baddies so the viewer has no moral qualms about any of it. There are examples of the opposite though, and for me the most obvious is the church scene, where we have the mass murder of civilians during a church service. The film tries to make sure the audience is prepared to go with it, by making sure we see this church being a rather vile affair preaching hatred of minorities, however it is really not enough. The scene is delivered with slick style, and an upbeat soundtrack, and feels like it should be fun ? but the actual content (and my feeling on it) says that it should be horrific ? because it certainly is horrific to watch. It didn't help that the US had a massive shooting a few days before I watched this (although statistically, that is never not going to be the case), but the murder of civilians in a church felt horrible (regardless of the brief highlighting of their abhorrent politics), and to have it played out in an entertaining way just did not work ? it felt tone deaf, like the Kickass concept was imported but not testing to see if it fitted. This was followed by a scene of one specific violent act which was actually really well done in terms of the impact on Harry emotionally and physically ? it is a great twist and an impacting moment, but like the massacre, it just didn't feel like it belonged in this film. There are other examples of this messy design, and of course the most famous is the anal sex gag right at the end. The internet is full of opinion on that so I'll not add too much; I did understand it was going for a Roger Moore Bond-style sex joke, but it wasn't funny, was delivered in a tone- deaf manner, and again it just felt totally out of place. Otherwise I though excesses like fire- work head explosions actually did work, and married violence and humor well, but the film cannot do this consistently at all.The cast are good and mostly carry the film through trouble moments even if they too seem to be unsure what type of film they are making at any given moment. Firth is a great lead and plays his part well; even getting a person into the cliché. Egerton is pretty good, not least because he makes a likable character out of someone who is mostly either a chav, or a cocky arse ? with the remainder of his character covering for this. Jackson is a lot of fun in the villain role, and the supporting cast is well fleshed out with turns from Strong, Davenport, Caine, Boutella, and others.Generally the film does have enough going for it to make it enjoyable in a darkly violence way; it is well made and has a strong cast. The tone of the film is very uneven though, and there is some very difficult material in here (both violent and comedic) which needed a very good control to make it work ? this it doesn't have and as a result it really doesn't work, often really pushing the viewer out of the film by how tone-deaf the delivery of it is. It is worth a look for what it does well, but those weaknesses are much bigger and impacting that they should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is a movie about secret service, the people of this secret service help to keep balance in the entire world by keeping down the crime levels. Now what happens is a member of this elite service is killed, thus a training type mission is carried out for recruitment of a new member out of five individuals. As the story runs, it is found out that one of the organizations in charge, which deal with sim cards has actually prepared a method to convert every individual into psychopath by just listening to some kind of music. Only those with a circuit fitted into their bodies (neck) are immune, except for the choice that circuit can make ones head explode and result in their death. All of kings man die due to this except a few, just because their chief along with many chief's (of various organization's) come together with villain.This villain only does these because he thinks population as virus and he feels for pressure on nature. It's shown that he is some kind of spiritual entity. Pressure on nature is already handled by our nature via diseases like AIDS. Still taking a drastic step is questionable as by statistics population growth will slow down. It may be justified as people act only properly, if there is some kind of fear. Example is fear of Boss in office where people are employed. If that is happening a lot needs to change like a person employed for what he desires. The trained individual is not trained for any sort of combat, still manages well, a negative mark there. The movie is great; I still have certain amount of sympathy for villain. A must watch; I would add.Rating: 9.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like watching some maniac doing a rampage in a school, throwing in some stupid jokes from time to time, all accompanied by funny music. The problem about this movie, and what makes it such a disaster is the fact that it's not just a bad trash movie. If that was the case you'd not go in with much expectations and only come out disappointed and disgusted but you could probably forget about it pretty fast. Sadly the trailer woke some expectations, and also the cast suggest that this is a movie that could be worth watching. It isn't, at least not if you are a person who's not snowed by a few silly jokes and over the top action scenes. The first scene gives you a small taste of what a stupid and senseless cacophony of violence this movie is. But first a want to take a closer look at the plot. Some cliché London teenager, who's lost his father when he was still a child and has got issues with his stepfather, is chosen to join the "training program" of some private secret service, only because his father was also a member and died during a mission. Unlike the other contestants for becoming a super-spy of "kingsman" our protagonist has no particularly helpful skill except for free- running. The whole training is a ridiculous farce only serving to squeeze in a bad joke every now and again. The antagonist is some lisping Hip-Hopper, who wants to save the world from human-caused global warming by mass-murdering ninety-nine percent of worlds population, accompanied by an Asian chick, who can slice people in half with her transtibial prosthesis, which she shows off in the very first scene I mentioned earlier. Of course our glorious hero reveals the conspiracy inside the agency and then saves the world by killing about two hundred people (the bad guy and his chick included) getting rewarded with the princess of Sweden offering him anal sex. So much for the high-class gentleman spy- movie. But as this movie is intended to be sort of a comedy I might even have been willing to ignore the "weaknesses" in the plot. The thing is that it is not a very funny movie, definitely not funny enough to compensated for the bad story, which is even worsened by the fact that some of the scenes are actually trying to illustrates mass- murder in a funny manner. And this is where the most distasteful aspect of the movie comes in. Apart from celebrating violence in a most immature way this movie also transports a perverse message of immorality on a level that I have not seen before. Halfway through the movie you will witness a scene that should leave every half-civilized person with a bad feeling in their stomach. One of the deadly kingsman agents enters a church full of fundamentals. Then the bad guy triggers some chip that has been implanted into all of them and turns them into aggressive "zombies". You now watch the kingsman agent slaughter about a hundred people in an extremely brutal fashion while in the background they're killing each other. This scene goes on for a perceived eternity, all the while accompanied by some hilarious music... Later on you'll get to see the heads of countless other "bad" people explode in colorful fireworks, which is topped only by the final excess of crudity when the bad guy again triggers his weapon of mass destruction and you can see innumerable people around the world going at each other's throats (hilarious music in the background of course) and a scene where a mother tries to attack her infant child with a meat cleaver. The fact that there are obviously many people enjoying this movie and also it's rating gives me pause. I can only say, I don't recommend watching it, it's definitely not the kind of movie the trailer suggests and not the kind of movie you can enjoy, lacking some twisted morals and perverse sense of humor. If you're a fan of grotesque violence, mindless stories, flat characters and some more violence go and watch this movie, you will have a great time.</fullReview>

It is very light-hearted in feel and full of witty one-liners.They play on this lightness cleverly by interspersing the movie with scenes of horrific gore and violence.

		<shortDescription>Very fun secret agent movie although it had some silly parts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like old-fashioned James Bond style movies you probably like this one. It is a bit more outrageous and has a few more overly silly moments than the old Bond movies but on the whole this is a very fun and enjoyable secret agent movie.Gary is, via a few twists and turns at the beginning of the movie, recruited by a secret agent employed by a super secret private organisation with remarkable resources. Their agents looks and behaves like London upper class gentlemen but have remarkable fighting skills. The initial scenes when Gary is recruited are just great.Gary is then submitted to a rather gruesome training schedule and at the same time the main plot plays out in parallel. Of course the two threads merge towards the classical showdown with the megalomaniacal evil mastermind in the end where, naturally, Gary gets to save the world.The movie has all the "goodies" of a secret agent movie. British gentlemen agents, action, secret agent "stuff" like shops that are not what they look like, hidden entrances into secret bases, rooms that are actually elevators and of course gadgets, lots of gadget to help our heroes thwart the evil mastermind's nefarious plans. Of course said mastermind have a personal henchman a la Oddjob to do the more grisly parts of his evil biddings. I quite liked this rather unique henchman, or rather henchwoman, and her odd weapons. More so that the main villain which I found a bit bland at times.On the whole I enjoyed this movie a lot. However, there are some silly parts which drags it down a bit. I especially disliked the colorful exploding heads towards the end of the movie. That just felt like the producer/director was smoking some funny stuff when making those scenes. There were a few other scenes which I felt was going too much towards silly comedies as well. Without those I would probably have added a star.All things said this was well spent 130 minutes as far as I am concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE review by: Mike SmithBased upon the acclaimed comic book, this film tells the story of a spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program, just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.This movie is a fun action film; it has a classic 007 feel to it and it points out the stereotypical spy and action movie clichés and how they aren't going to do the same things; it gives the film charm.The cast of Kingsman: The Secret Service is an awesome group of actors. Colin Firth plays the ultimate gentleman spy that all men dream of being at one point or another. Once again Samuel L. Jackson gives us unforgettable character. After a while I couldn't put up with his lisp and he started to remind me of Mike Tyson but Samuel L. Jackson is always worth a watch. Michael Caine plays the leader of the Kingsman. He is rarely on screen but when he is he is intense and mysterious. I'm unformeler with Taron Egerton's work but he was the right choice for the roll. He keeps you interested in the film and he is a good actor. I hope we see him in some north American movies because I thing he'll do well over here. Last but not least I enjoyed seeing the legendary Mark Hamill but when he did his accent it reminded me of his joker voice, but that's not a bad thing.The film takes a bit to get warmed up but the action fight scenes are full throttle, fun and at times intense. Also, the Kingsmen has some light chuckles but what bugged me was the green screen, the CG looked cheap and this film really pushed that it was made for 3D, I'm not a big fan of that.Kingsman: The Secret Service is worth a watch for the awesome cast and fun action scenes but this movie is very forgettable and it takes a bit for it to get warmed up.

		<shortDescription>Agent Cody Banks for adults: a modern James Bond film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The secret Service is a wonderful new film in the spy- action genre. The film is directed by Matthew Vaughn, who has directed some interesting stuff in the past, including X-men: First Class, Stardust and Kick-Ass. The film stars Taron Egerton as Eggsy, and Colin Firth as Harry Hart. This film feels like an early James Bond flick, with all the wacky villains and plots one would expect from such a film. However, it really has modernized the message and approach, with extreme, if goofy, violence and lots of modern gadgets and goodies. There is a lot of charm in this film, and it makes me feel like a young boy again, watching flicks like Thunderbirds or Agent Cody Banks or Spy Kids. Even so, this is not a film for children. It just has that slight fantastical feel that many children's spy films are graced with.There is a ton to enjoy in this film. The spy genre is done well, with intrigue, gadgetry, and Bond-esque suave/cool. The actors are superb, with Samuel L. Jackson making an appearance as a particularity interesting character. There was also good, taught emotional drive throughout the film. I was superbly impressed with this film.On a minor note, the film did have some corny/kitschy elements which did not always work. There was one scene in particular near the beginning, in a log cabin, which I thought was a bit much. These scenes were relatively small in number, however, and did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film. This movie was great, and deserves to be cherished as an excellent new addition to the spy genre. I look forward to more from all the actors involved, and especially Mr. Vaughn. I would love to see this become a James Bond style series of films as well.This film is highly recommended. Just don't show it to your kids please. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may see reviews that are very critical of the violence.... But like duh?? Matthew Vaughn I mean come on? He did kick ass. People should really do their research before watching films. This film isn't necessarily needed to be taken seriously, although if you are a student of media/film studies there is a lot to be analyzed. kingsmen is extremely fun and if the sight of blood makes you feel ill and you enjoy good op violent action, perhaps you're a Tarantino fan? The film is fast paced not boring and easy to watch. A great set of characters (Taron Egerton's characters is slightly unbelievable as a street kid, but is otherwise captivating and comes across as very comfortable in the role despite his filmography being minimal in contrast to many of the a list cast but still holds his own. His forced cockney didn't annoy me, in fact I really liked his character and just went with it) the female antagonist is awesome and overall a really. Enjoyable, visually and technically impressive film with a great script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Kingsman' blends modern and classic spy styles into another lovable Vaughn film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The days of the classy '60s spy films seemed long lost. The world has gotten too complicated for simple stories of agents in tuxedos squaring off with megalomaniacs. Yet in walks "Kingsman: The Secret Service," based on a Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons offering that sleek look and those beloved spy genre conventions but with plenty of modern-day sensibilities.If Matthew Vaughn wasn't already a candidate to direct a future James Bond film, behold his audition tape. The "Kick-Ass" (also from Millar) and "X-Men: First Class" director makes yet another stylish and wickedly fun comic adaptation, raising his own bar for creative action sequences. More underrated, however, is his partnership with screenwriter Jane Goldman. This duo has yet to slip up, impeccably balancing the tropes and formulas of action flicks with just enough originality to keep their stories engaging from start to finish."Kingsman" stars newcomer Taron Egerton as Gary "Eggsy" Unwin, a street kid recruited by Kingsman agent Harry Hart, codename "Galahad" (Colin Firth) to join the top-secret organization after they lose an agent. Eggsy's father was a Kingsman, and Harry sees that same potential. As Eggsy undergoes a competition with other young men and women to fill the vacancy, Harry works to uncover a sinister plot being orchestrated by tech mogul billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson).The script does gloss over Eggsy's development from troubled thief to top-flight field agent, perhaps the film's biggest flaw, but Vaughn and Goldman maintain suspense is basic yet effective ways. Will Eggsy in fact win that spot with the Kingsmen? And what's Valentine up to anyway? They recognize their best cards and play them at the right time, and that's what a good blockbuster does. Some impressive twists toward the end of the second act also rejuvenate that intrigue when it starts to wane.Egerton is a solid young talent and he's surrounded by a cast who would do just as well in an Oscar-contending drama with Firth, Jackson, Mark Strong and Michael Caine. Some gravitas was definitely required to legitimize Kingsman in the eyes of the audience; without it the concept would feel too much like a cheap knock-off. These heavyweights help the film give off the vibe of an homage to the spy genre with contemporary twists. The character Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), Valentine's "muscle," a double leg amputee with those springy leg prosthetics used by runners but outfitted with piercing metal blades, is not dissimilar from the Bond character Jaws.With plenty of creative action sequences, many of which have surprises built into them, "Kingsman" entertains with a relative ease that so many similar action films and obscure adaptations seem to so rarely replicate. Not to mention Vaughn is becoming a bit more of an auteur, crafting fight scenes like dances but filming them with a visual roughness so as to get the best of both the practically slow-mo stylish action approach and the physical "Bourne"-style approach.Vaughn will likely abandon the "Kingsman" series (should it become a series) as he did with his previous efforts that received follow-ups, but where he goes next is worth tracking, especially if Goldman's in tow. And hopefully a serviceable blueprint remains in the hands of 20th Century Fox to try their luck with developing the next modern spy franchise.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>Action with Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action movies are a dime a dozen, but with so many of the same this film manages to be original and intriguing. The action has a sort of class about it, paying homage to the attitude of the James Bond movies. It's enticing in a way that so many action movies are not nowadays, and it successfully combines a relevant, modern story line with classic excitement and humor. I thoroughly enjoyed this film overall, though I do have two negative comments. First, while the comic relief was appreciated through the duration of the film, I found it became excessive in the final scenes. It matches the attitude that was established in the beginning, but the extent to which it was used can be off putting to some, making it seem almost cheesy, although there are some great laughs. Secondly, the main character develops skills that would take years to master in a matter of months. Certainly it helped to move the story along, but was unrealistic even in the face of the plot itself. These two mild disappointments are easy to accept, however, as the movie in its entirety was better than the standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw previews for "Kingsman: The Secret Service" in January, I wasn't very impressed. 'Just another average cliché action movie that's trying too hard to be cool'. I didn't much care for "Kickass" and I've never seen "X-Men: First Class", so I skipped it. I can't believe that I put off seeing it until it came out on home video, this movie has an engrossing story, fun characters and plenty of exciting, stylish action.Taron Egerton is Gary "Eggsy" Unwin, an London youth that's gone in with a bad crowd after his father, a government agent died. Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, veteran spy who takes Eggsy under his wing and trains him to be a "Kingsman".There's also a sinister plot involving internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) to do with global warming. That's the basic setup of the plot, but what really impressed me was the way every element came together beautifully, with the taut script filled to the brim with cleverly choreographed action scenes that are directed with such flowing grace and joy in the carnage on screen that I can't think of such stylish use of violence since Tarantino's "Kill Bill". The church fight scene is a particular standout.The movie wears its spy influences on its sleeve, taking cues from James Bond and the like, but with more irreverence than most modern action movies that are too swamped in seriousness for my taste, or are too juvenile to provide any real thrills. " Kingsman" provides a good balance to satiate my movie going needs.Performances are all excellent as well, with the cast also including Michael Cain, Mark Strong, Mark Hammill and Sofia Boutella as Gazelle, Valentine's amputee henchwoman with bladed prosthetic legs.I can't really think of any negatives, only that some versions of movie are censored, which I hate to see."Kingsman: The Secret Service" is one of the year's best. A blast from start to finish and definitely the most surprising film of the year (for me at least)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manners. Maketh. Man. So says the dapperly-dressed secret agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth), right before he bars all exits and proceeds to glass, stab and maim an assortment of goons in that most British of locales, the pub. Kingsman, the latest film from Layer Cake (2004) and X-Men: First Class (2011) director Matthew Vaughn, and his second collaboration with comic-book writer Mark Millar (after 2010's Kick-Ass), is both completely preposterous and ridiculously entertaining, simultaneously mocking and paying homage to the traditional idea of Britishness in an ever-changing society, and no doubt infuriating many a Daily Mail reader in the process.Harry Hart, a Harry Palmer-like gent, is a Kingsman; a highly secretive and unaligned ring of spies and agents who dress sharply and certainly know their manners. After an operation to rescue Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill) from a possible kidnapping plot sees one Kingsman agent disposed of in a particularly gruesome fashion, Harry is tasked with finding a replacement to fill the spot. The son of a former agent who saved Harry's life years previously, Eggsy (Taron Egerton), is now growing up in a council flat with his layabout mother and abusive stepfather. After a joyride lands him in the police station, Eggsy calls the number on the back of a Kingsman medal given to him by Harry when he was a child, and he is bailed.Harry enters Eggsy into the trials to become a Kingsman agent along with a bunch of upper-class toffs who refer to Eggsy as a 'pleb'. The group of youngsters must perform a series of tasks under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), involving escaping from a flooded room and shooting a dog in the head. Meanwhile, Harry investigates links from recent strange events to internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a flamboyant man with a lisp and a fondness for wearing caps indoors. whose upcoming deal to offer SIM cards with free calls and internet to everybody for free reeks of conspiracy and may be related to an incident involving an exploding head.When Harry and Valentine have their inevitable face-to-face sit-down moment, the two munch on Big Macs at Valentine's hideously decorated mansion while discussing the joys of the ludicrous Bond movies of old, when things weren't taken so seriously. Kingsman is an obvious Bond pastiche, with deadly gadgets, a henchman wielding an unconventional weapon (in this case - knives for feet), and an outrageous villain. It even comes as a surprise when Firth fails to raise an eyebrow while delivering a double entendre. It shows that these kinds of movies can still be fun without the shadow of uber- seriousness seen in the Daniel Craig Bond's and the recent Bourne movies lurking overhead, while telling the people who will be inevitably offended by the spurts of shocking violence to get a grip and remember that it's only a movie.However, it did little to prepare me for the movie's key set-piece, which involves a church in Kentucky inhabited by a group of bigoted, right-wing religious types - and Harry - indulge in what can only be described as a pub-brawl massacre. I have never witnessed a scene that would usually be portrayed as a tragedy executed with such glee, with Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird blaring out while men and women are stabbed, shot, bludgeoned, set on fire and, in one particularly grisly moment, get slammed into a wall so hard it snaps their spine in two. It seems to go on and on, but it's an absolutely thrilling moment stocked full of cartoon violence, and will no doubt making some viewers expecting a light and funny experience wholly uncomfortable in the process.It's sadly not all great. Eggsy's recruitment and training is formulaic and none of the tasks are particularly original or clever. This period of the film also keeps Eggsy and Harry apart for most of it, when their few scenes crackle with chemistry. But ultimately, Kingsman is an intriguing experience. bending to generic tropes while seemingly playing by its own rules. Firth displays a comedic willingness rarely seen and Egerton, who has popped up from nowhere, is a real find as the swaggering Eggsy, a baseball-cap wearing yoof who calls people 'bruv', who in most actors hands would have come across as extremely annoying. Kingsman dabbles in enough extreme violence to cause most viewers to question what they really enjoy seeing on screen, and it's a throwback with a modern twist, celebrating the days when movies could be fun, inexplicable and inconsequential, Just don't watch it with your nan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond + Kick- Ass = Kingsman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman is presented by the same people that brought us Kick-Ass, one of my favorite movies of all time. Therefore, Kingsman is one of the most anticipated films this year. I heard a lot about Kingsman when it first came out then I watched it in the theaters. I have to say that this has become one of my favorite movies by far. Matthew Vaughn has pleased me once again with his sense of humor and outstanding cinematography.There is one think that I like Kick- Ass so much is it's "out-of- expected" humor which the second installment, not directed by Vaughn, didn't accomplished. It gives you a feeling of "parody", but not exactly. In Kingsman, clever lines are presented to the audience without using fart or stupid jokes. It has its own unique style that stands on its own very well. It's very different from other spy or action movies, and has combined with the comedy genre real well. The filming is also speechless, though a bit of shaky cam, all of the action sequences are very satisfying. It gives you so much action that you can't feel even more satisfied. The slow motion, the clever collocation of the soundtrack, and the sense of humor among the fighting all made me associate to Kick-Ass, and I love it!The acting is also superb. I especially love Colin Firth in the movie; it is the best choice to be the supporting actor. He has the taste, he style, and the look to be a Kingsman. Samuel L. Jackson is great as being the villain with its weird accent. The main actor, Taron Egerton, did an excellent job being Eggsy, and he has got lots of potential in the future.Other than that, there are always unexpected surprises delivered throughout the movie that makes you sweat, laugh, or even mind-blown. Kingman: The Secret Service is definitely worst watching and keeping. I have watched the second time today and it still doesn't bore me. I hope to see more movies like this or even Kick-Ass in the future. Oxfords, not Brogues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This British spy-action-thriller cinema, is at the most least, delightful."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is like a classic 007 dancing on a rainbow. Despite being a fact that it is indeed an adaptation of the comic book 'The Secret Service', it borrows and toys with bits of references to 'James Bond' movies. However, Matthew Vaughn's triumph continues. Success first rained down with "Kick-Ass", then "X-Men: First Class" and now, the colourful and endurably fun "Kingsman". Matthew Vaughn is absolutely the cool and stylish artist of action pictures, although not winning on being one of the best filmmakers around.Kingsman is a secret intelligence organisation. It shares similarities with MI6, but more that it stays to be fiction, and adopts the possible highest level of secrecy. It was during an unseen 'invasion' in the middle-east, when a colleague of Harry Hart (Colin Firth), a kingsman agent, sacrifices himself. Through the simplest and obvious nature of human behaviour, uncalled guilt grows on Harry, and he feels like he has an obligation to repay him. It ranges to to the dead agent's family and conclusively, to his son, Eggsy (Taron Egerton). 17 years passes. The young-matured Eggsy is chosen to be a candidate for a replacement of a dead kingsman agent (not his father), and somewhere in the world, an unorthodox villain has an unsound plan of saving the world.Vaugh is wonderful in his handling of the characters. Harry Hart and Eggsy are great heroes ? neither pretentious, nor over the top, or acting idiots. But them carrying humane behaviours, and in them are good manners and unsupported arrogance. Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) teamed together to be a pair of shining villains. They are not dull, but fun and unique. Building up colourful characters is the film's sheer A game, and as tarantinoesque they are, they are still profusely underrated.Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson had with them the two best performances of the show. Firth was smooth, confident and charismatic, while Jackson was campy-funny. Overall, the two stars captured formidable screen presence, rather than heavily relied on great acting skills.The fact that made Valentine a fascinating character is that he drives his plan with good intentions, out from his villainous actions. He attempts to save the world from complete slaughter, but his methods are plain crazy and with devoid of understanding from him, evil. Unlike any other villains, he does not have a goal to achieve absolute power, but to save. Valentine is probably unwantedly insane, and unfavourably, na?ve. To me, Valentine is not the bad guy, the bad guys are the wealthy politicians and celebrities who dog the footsteps of his mind.The film's most solid moments rest on its staggering action-fighting sequences. Through its tight editing and engaging choreography, those near perfect fighting scenes are broken down into unique pieces, stitched together to boast entertaining cinematic experiences. Also, "Kingsman" goes extra mile with its smart, cunning and dynamic screenplay.Vaughn did a wonderful job in the architecture of this vividly colourful action film. Audiences, at their own leisure, go to cinema to be served with a blast, and 'fun' is what "Kingsman" delivers. This British spy-action-thriller cinema, is at the most least, delightful.(Score: 3/4) (Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) (https://www.facebook.com/alex.desmall) (Twitter: @Alex_DeSmall)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spy action film like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing about Kingsman is that this movie mixtures genres unlike any movie I've seen. With the Bond influence ever present and the crazy Tarantino-esque violence that was also present in Vaughn's previous movie Kick-Ass, this movie not only pays respect to the old spy films, but also comes into it's own to become a classic for the next years in my opinion.The movie begins with Firth's Harry Hart visiting the family of a fallen partner and he leaves the door open for any help to the son of said partner. Fast forward 17 years later and things aren't going too smoothly for young Eggsy. He is constantly in trouble and has to deal with his mother's boyfriend bad treatment. Luckily for him, he will be chosen as a recruit by his dad's old friend and therefore be a candidate for the secret organization known as the Kingsman. Yet an imminent threat will come to light, as billionaire Valentine will look to eradicate the human race. Will Eggsy be up to the task and manage to save the world?Unapologetic fun is what you're gonna get with Kingsman. Its R rating suggests a lot of violence and the movie delivers with some of the best action sequences of the year. Vaughn really shows off his talents as a director with the camera always moving but capturing every single important moment. Truly a great directorial effort yet again from the British man. The acting is also phenomenal as Firth pulls off an unlikely role, Egerton emerges as a rising star and Jackson makes for a fun villain. I gotta say though that Gazelle was my favorite character with a number of kick-ass moments.Thoroughly entertaining with a great artistic touch, Kingsman is a refreshing take on the spy genre as it plays with the changes that have occurred over time and with Spectre coming out later down the line, I don't see any reason why we can't have different variations of the genre succeeding. I for one welcome it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After some cool intro credits, some British agents raid a compound in Afghanistan. They grab some guy and tie him to a chair. Suddenly they realize he's got a bomb. One of them throws himself onto to guy as the bomb explodes saving his team mates. One of those on the team, Harry Hart, visits the widow and offers help. She rejects it so he gives the medal to the young son. On the reverse of the medal is a number. If called and given a code, help will be forthcoming.We are taken to Argentinian mountains years later where an environmental scientist has been captured. A suited Brit knocks on the door and wipes out all the bad guys. Someone knocks on the door and suddenly the Brit is cut in half by a girl amputee wearing blades for legs. Oh, no...it's Samuel Jackson at the door...Turns out all these Brits are "Kingsmen," a super secret agency of gentlemen. Now that that two of them have died it's time to recruit a new member. At this time, the young kid from the intro is older and in trouble. His mom's new guy is some bad guy who is abusive. One day the kid steal a car and goes for a joyride and ends up in jail. He calls the number on the back of the medal and gives the code. Next thing he knows he's meeting Hart who proposes that the kid get his act together so he sponsors him to join the Kingsmen.What follows is some training and ability tests for several kids to take the one available spot. In meantime, Jackson is up to no good. He's supposed to be a billionaire genius entrepreneur out to save the planet and humanity. He decides to give away free SIM cards for free internet and phone to everyone who wants one. But he's also kidnapping the important, rich, and famous and others he's implanting with a chip behind the ear. The chip allows him cause these people to go completely berserk or to to blow up their heads at the push of a button. He does a test run at a church. Then he announces he will save the planet by eliminating a large part of the population. Now the remaining Kingsmen and the young recruit will have to keep Jackson from following through with his plan.Kingsman is a fantastic action thriller that offers violence and intrigue. It captures the magic long lost by the James Bond movies and also some of the thrilling violence that the early Jason Bourne movies had. Finally we get one such movie that is R-rated. The character of Hart and the acting of Firth are very strong. This character alone has franchise potential. However, the young recruit and the actor playing him are rather weak. Things are perhaps a bit too formulaic--you get the villain in his giant high tech lair with his wicked side-kick and hundreds of soldiers willing to die for him. The movie is a bit too long and the orchestrated Bond-ripped off music is excessively loud and obnoxious. But nonetheless, Kingsmen is a blast of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Manners Maketh Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is the kind of movie that you watch when you just want to have a good time. With all the Super Hero movies coming out it is nice to see a movie that takes a bit of the super natural and brings it down to Earth. It takes the Spy genre and makes it something that the audience can relate to. The film tics all the boxes on bigger than life issues with the world at stake, a super villain who's hand hovers over the detonation of it, and a group that acts above the law, with the good of the world at mind, to stop it.However, what makes this film truly a gem in the genre of Action/Comedy is the relationship between Eggsy (Taron Egerton) and the rest of the cast. He goes through the character arch of a young man trying to find his place in the world. He uses his surroundings to explain his failures, but when given the chance to prove himself he strives to make his mark. The film does well to keep you entertained with a main character having a different perspective on an environment than the people he's with. The action is top notch with gadgets and fighting scenes. Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman (Kick Ass, Stardust) have scripted another outside of the box film that is clever and entertains. If you're looking for a film that above all else entertains; and, is well written, with a good plot and strong characters take a try on Kingsman and watch how "Manners Maketh Man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brits are famous for their spy(ing) films, and the even the financial and/or human participation of Americans has not generally spoiled them :) Kingsman: The Secret Service is another fine example of quality entertainment where introduction of new faces for younger generation (Taron Egerton, Sophie Cookson) has been giftedly combined of the participation of known and rewarded character actors: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson (the funniest and most distinctive), Mark Strong, Michael Caine, with Firth and Caine being Academy Award winners! As for the plot, it is rather witty, true, one has to know many previous similar films to make the most of certain lines, events and references, as the film in question is a real "child" of multiple films beginning with James Bond at least... But still, no more maze runners and divergents, please, but more quality cinema where humour and action are combined without factitious course of events and leaning on cute young faces only.</fullReview>

The storyline was typical of the genre but the other parts that make up the story keep your attention right till the end!

		<fullReview>It is my belief that a soundtrack makes or breaks a film. Honestly, where would Star Wars be without John Williams? In this case I think Kingsman would have benefited greatly with a classier soundtrack especially including the end credits. Trading Places was able to bring classical and modern together to make a great movie, so I believe it would have been possible.Beyond that, I did like the story. It was fun to see Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson in characters outside their normal options and to see how they stretched with these characters. In that sense, I considered this a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was one of the most amazing things I've seen this year, possibly this whole century. If you liked Kick-ass or any of Matthew Vaughn's other movies, you'll love it. I strongly recommend this film for any moviegoer. the fight scenes are incredible and make sense, unlike a Michael Bay film or some other spy movies. The story and dialogue are both funny and intelligent and complement the rest of the film well. There are a couple sciences - although I won't reveal any spoilers here - that were a little inappropriate/politcally incorrect that I personally found somewhat offensive that I felt took away from the film as a whole. But apart from these, the movie truly is amazing. Funny, clever, well acted, and really exciting. Also, just a quick note, I thought it was amazing on the big screen, but when I watched it at home on video, the action was a little harder to follow and seemed sloppier that it was in the theaters. All in all, a solid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A violent and awesome comedy. That is Kingsman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) Kingsman: The Secret Service is a new movie directed by Matthew Vaughn, based upon the successful comic book from which takes its name. The official synopsis states the following: "A spy organization recruits an unrefined, but promising, street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius." Reading this, one could say that the movie is about the development of a boy in the spy world and it really is, but does this in one of the funniest ways possible. Paying tribute to the old James Bond movies that is influenced by, Kingsman brings to our times some of the characteristics that made those movies into cinema classics. The everlasting charm and composure of an agent, but always keeping a bit of the old-fashioned swag; the megalomaniac, colorful and ever entertaining villain who plots the craziest and almost impracticable schemes; the variety of gadgets (what is a Bond movie without some of Q's gadgets?); fight- sequences, which, in this picture, are simply over-the-top even when compared with those like Terminator, Die Hard or Rambo. That being said, I need to praise the casting. Seeing Colin Firth, who plays Harry Hart/Gallahad, an actor that mainly played "the good guy" in movies like Bridget Jones, being an absolute bad-ass, even more than Bond ever was in any of his movies. Then the villain Valentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, who is one of most enjoyable characters to see. His lisp (the classic Bond villains always had an abnormality or physical dysfunction), his inability to see blood without vomiting or still his childish behavior (even being a genius) are "qualities" that will make you laugh a few times. The soundtrack is other department where the "Bond Tribute" was made. In spite of being in just some small moments, I could recognized some of the typical chords that John Barry made famous in the 007 Movies. This film is not for the faint of heart. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a comedy but a very violent kind of comedy. Slang is used often. Watch this if you enjoy films like In Bruges and you'll probably love it. As for me, I had a splendid time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fooling with etiquette</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not attracted to anything in particular here and insofar as it moves fast it passes by without much incident, unless you're the type of viewer who in a silly film such as this likes to take umbrage by things like a pretty girl rewarding the world-saving hero with her body.But that - a princess swooning over her savior knight and yet the scene promises quick sex on a couch and not romance - is part of the deliberate crudeness here, usually noted as irony and amounting to a simple fooling with some etiquette. Here the James Bond film but the supervillain is a lisping nerd, the suave spy maims and kills hundreds in a scene of frenzy etc.It's such a small difference that I find no subversion in it and indeed quite the opposite, simple convention. This is a British attempt at a superhero comic book using the American language of spectacle to push out British stereotyped traditions in narrative.So an opening scene of meddling in the Middle east only serves as generic stage to exalt British heroism. A super-secret society of gentlemen spies exists to steer the world into order, above MI6 - which as Brits know has merely been a junior partner of the CIA for decades, though we're not told in the film - and founded back in prewar days, that is in better days when Brits were still dominant. The established order is compromised and gentlemanly resourcefulness shines through it.I'm not saying this from the viewpoint that it's harmful politics, it's fluff we will leave behind in no time, and only noting what gives rise to the image. Injecting adolescence in the tour and leaving the places visited the same. A Brit saves the world much like in James Bond fantasies - only he's a kid.(There's an aerial scene here as the kids parachute from a plane, I collect aerial scenes of this sort because they reveal with some purity the aerodynamics of visual imagination in its flight, the gravity of a falling body in space, the currents of that space, the turbulence of camera paths. This one just pales by comparison to work being done on the American side; some exciting work can be seen in Jupiter Ascending).</fullReview>

I think i was mostly mislead by the name, expecting a thriller and ended up in a typical guns blazing action movie There are some scenes in the movie which is quite different, the murder of Colin Firth, the massacre by the agent and the way Samuel Jackson carries himself throughout the movie.That's about it, everything else from a derelict family of the Hero who's father was once a famous guy, villain destroying the world, Hero topping the class and cliché saying "Just like your father" yeah that's all very heart-warming but that's what the movie is put together.After all, what else would keep you engaged in the cinema hall, but this movie does all that with finesse rather than making a parody out of all that, which is much appreciated. You know from the start "All's well that ends well" so you don't have to worry even if the Hero falls from the sky without a parachute or faced with a truck load of armed men firing at him, he will emerge victorious.All in all, expect nothing extraordinary and you will walk home more than satisfied</fullReview>

The premise may have been more believable if the recruit was middle class rather than from the 'ghetto'. Samuel L Jackson is fantastic as the evil tycoon and Colin Firth is also great as the Bond like agent. Michael Caine does a good job as the 'M' character, its just the hero of the film who doesn't fit with the rest of the cast.There is a lot of product placement and it isn't difficult to see who sponsored the film.This film is OK, but it isn't great. 6 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with Spies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. In 2010, writer/director Matthew Vaughn turned the superhero genre on its ear with the hit Kick-Ass. With this most recent film, he has done the same thing to spy-thrillers. We get the well-tailored look made famous by Roger Moore's James Bond, the fanciful and lethal gadgets from early Bond films, the ever-present umbrella (put to new uses here) of The Avenger's John Steed, and the ultra-suave and debonair manners of Napoleon Solo from The Man from U.N.C.L.E. We get all of that in a surprisingly effective and fun action performance from Colin Firth.Fun is the operative word here. It's clear all parties involved are having a great time, especially Mr Firth going drastically against type. There are two action-packed and pretty humorous (in a demented way) fight scenes. One is early on inside a London pub, and has Firth flashing his particular set of skills against a group of thugs. The other (and even more raucous) fight occurs inside a church and is set to Lynryd Skynyrd's "Free Bird". The body count piled up as fast as the guitar licks.As spectacular as the fight scenes are, the real fun here is in the characters. The old guard of the Kingsmen includes Firth as Galahad, Mark Strong as Merlin, Jack Davenport as Lancelot, and Michael Caine as Arthur. This long-standing group is one part international spy, one part Knights of the Round Table ? and these gentlemen are extremely well trained and impeccably well dressed. When one of their agents dies on the job, the recruitment boot camp kicks into gear. Made up of a group of relative newcomers to the movie world, the two most interesting are Roxy (Sophie Cookson) and Eggsy (Taron Egerton). Adding to the intrigue, Eggsy is the son of a former Kingsmen, and has some skills that aren't initially apparent.Of course, what would a spy-tribute movie be without a colorful villain? Samuel L Jackson plays lispy megalomaniac Valentine, who has a quick gag reflex when it comes to violence. Fortunately his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is equipped with razor sharp leg prosthetics and some ultra-crazy fighting skills. We even see Mark Hamill as Professor Arnold ? fans of the Mark Miller/Dave Gibbons graphic novel will appreciate the irony. Firth and Egerton play off each other quite well in the mentor-pupil relationship, and Egerton is clearly set up for the franchise sequels ? as is his friend and fellow Kingsman, Ms. Cookson. For those who think the Daniel Craig Bond films are too dark and serious, this provides a flashback to lighter Bond fare (minus the misogyny). Many hot topics are touched on: class warfare, domestic abuse, racism, etc, but mostly this can be taken as a rollicking good time because "it's not that kind of movie". It does, however, remind us that "manners make the man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went into the cinema with sort of high hopes after watching trailer after trailer on television. I really hoped it would live up to the hype surrounding it. I really like the direct who also directed Kickass in Matthew Vaughn. I did come out of the theatre entertained so in some capacity the film achieved its goal but however there was unnecessary humour through the exploitation of teenage stereotypes which I did not find funny at all. This humour was just not for me, there was other people in the cinema which found stealing cars, saying "Bruv" hilarious so it did hit some level of the audience. The humour did take a good turn towards the end of the film which had good moments. The plot line and twists where actually really good some that audience would next expect. I really enjoyed the plot as It had a good story. The characters were semi-likable but not always that great in my opinion. Colin Furth was very good in the movie and so was the lead Taron Egerton but the Villain in Samuel Jackson just became really annoying by the end. But overall it was good cast and solid performances.I would really recommend this film to friends or family as it was entertaining, okay humour, good actions scenes, and good performances. However some of the humour may only be targeting certain people which could be a issue when the film releases to wider countries very soon. It was also one of the very few times that I have been to the cinema recently that it was near full so Kingsman is obviously doing something right.I would give the film a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been a while since I have seen an action movie like this, it is mainly action but it has some drama as well as light comedy. The action scenes are amazing, even though it's all fiction but it's special and you don't usually see them in other movies. Also a star dying in the middle of the movie is not something you see everywhere, all in all, one of the best I have seen lately. It could be a series, not only a movie and it would be even more interesting with more stories in it cause 130 minutes is not enough at all for the proposed enjoyment. I have two notes though, they could have given us more details in the movie about the governmental communications and how V reached them, and also it could have had some more tragical end, it could have been nicer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the start, I though the movie is just an ordinary teenager movie where the hero is a school student that is a spy and his mission is to find some Latino drug dealers and put them to the jail.But when I watched it, I was like: "Damn, that is a hot sexy movie". The spy girl that went out to the moon is hot as hell too. His mom played nice role. What I hated about the movie is that the music background didn't fit most of the themes. You should have choose better EDM songs. But anyway the movie isn't about music or soundtracks. Great job all the way to be honest guys.The second thing that I hated is the Arthur (the head of the kingsman), is always playing the good roles not the bad guys side. The scenario is outstanding alongside the actors and their acting abilities. Perfect movie all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is completely awesome and probably the most fun you'll have with a film this early on in the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can officially say that the first AWESOME, s movie of 2015 is finally here, which is 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. Based on Mark Millar's comic book, director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Snatch) has once again delivered the goods and high entertainment value with an homage to spy films, particularly the 'James Bond' franchise. So what's that mean? It means the guy who made 'Kick-Ass' and produced 'Snatch', made his own version of 'James Bond', and it's as violent and gory and funny as his other films I mentioned.What works so well with 'Kingsman: The Secret Service', besides the fun acting, incredible fight choreography, stunning camera work, and over-the-top characters, is that it's self-aware of exactly the type of movie it is and wants to be. It even goes so far as to mention the 007 agent a few times and talk about the usual spy genre movie tropes and how this is completely different, which of course it is. I only wish I could go back and watch this for the first time all over again.There isn't anything really new here as far as story goes, but how it's executed and delivered is as fresh as the morning snow. In London, there is a super secret service, made up of highly trained and intelligent people called the 'Kingsman', which on the outside is a storefront for very fashionable clothing, but is rather a spy agency that comes with all the fancy weapons and gadgets. This elite group is headed up by Arthur King (Michael Caine), and we center on one of the agents named Harry (Colin Firth). As this group tours the world, stopping bad guys, it's bound to happen that some super agents will bite the dust, hence a need for new recruits.This is where a young man named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) steps in as a new recruit and has a forgotten relationship with Harry. A good chunk of the film is spent in a dangerous and highly entertaining training camp sequence where Eggsy along with other possible recruits try to attain the role of Kingsman. These training sequences put Navy SEALS boot camp to shame. Meanwhile, a billionaire guy named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a hilarious lisp) has invented a microchip to make the internet and phone calls free for everyone. In fact, the microchip is free itself and available to the everyone, everywhere. But Valentine has a secret diabolical plan in play with these microchips that just might kill everyone on Earth.So now the Kingsman must step up to the plate and prevent this from happening, and needless to say, things hits the fan in the most gruesome and fun way imaginable. Some of you might think Colin Firth is not the right man for a character who can kick anyone's butt in two seconds or chop a dozen heads off in one swing, but I'm here to tell you that you're completely wrong. Firth is a maniac, period. He owns this role with strong charisma, wit, and elegance. It's like if his older roles from some period romance project he did, finally grew a pair of giant balls and found an underground arsenal of giant guns and was programmed to kill anything and anyone in matter of seconds.That's how Firth plays this role, and I couldn't get enough of him. Taron Egerton does a great job here too as the punk kid with a bad home life with a heart of gold, who changes his tune and becomes the person he was supposed to be. And boy, is he rewarded at the end of the film too for his accomplishments. Unfortunately, there are not any snakes or sharks here for Samuel L. Jackson to be afraid of, but lucky for us, this is a highly energetic and flamboyant role for Jackson, unlike anything we've ever seen him in. His lisp is golden and hilarious, his fear of blood, vomit, and violence causes huge belly laughs, and his love for McDonald's hamburgers and fries hit all the right notes. It's the classic over-the-top James Bond villain here, and Jackson played him perfectly.And if you're a fan of the fight scenes from 'Kick-Ass', meaning the no-cut, one-shot camera movement to capture all the decapitations, blood, kicks, and punches, then you'll greatly enjoy the fight choreography here. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is completely awesome and probably the most fun you'll have with a film this early on in the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Action/Adventure/Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this movie. It was quite refreshing to go into this movie not quite knowing what to expect and being astounded at the great acting and directing. Brilliant action sequences mixed with great humor set this spy movie apart from any other spy movie I've ever seen. While most spy movies are all about the action and drama, and most spoof spy movies are all about the comedy of poking fun at the spy genre, this movie has a breathtaking balance of action that will keep you on the edge of your seat, as well as some great comedy that will be having you grab your gut with laughter and joy. It is surprisingly violent especially in some scenes (especially involving churches) which is a welcome surprise with the way the action is shot. Definitely a surprise, but a very very welcome one. 10 outta 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see Kingsman in cinemas. I was at a store, saw it on sale and picked it up. I didn't expect to much, yeah it had Colin Firth and Samuel L Jackson on the cover but i still thought it would be a boring 007 knockoff. Boy was i wrong. This film is awesome! It had a cool plot, great action and an awesome cast. Seriously, i don't think that there was a weak cast member. All the performances were solid especially Taron Egerton as Eggsy. I went into the film expecting a film aimed at teen audiences but this film easily earns its R rating. There is one particular scene which depicted some extremely graphic violence. It caused controversy but it sort of acts as a statement that this film is not for kids. They handled the scene in a comedic way which at least makes it enjoyable to watch. Its scenes like this however, that make the film so memorable. I say definitely check it out. Its my movie of the year so far. Great entertainment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unexpectedly entertaining movie - honestly, I assumed this will be just another run-of-the- mill action boom-bang-a-bang but it turned out it was compulsive watching with lots of humor that affectionately pokes fun at James Bond. It has all the ingredients of usual clichés (elegant mentor leading young unknown and green talent trough procedures that would create another super-hero) and it works wonderfully as everybody obviously had lots of fun while making this, specially Colin Firth who for once steps out of the box where directors so often forced him to be just another romantic lover in historical costumes - you can clearly see his joy of being allowed to do something different and here, for a change he is a bad ass who fights, breaks bones left and right and all of this without ever losing his suave posture. His young protégé is Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who metamorphoses from poor London boy in sneakers into another elegant secret agent and has just the right charisma to carry on the rest of the movie. There are also obligatory celebrities (Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine) but honestly the movie would work with anybody in these roles. There is no point in taking this movie seriously and trying to find any deep meaning - critics are collectively praising it for being entertaining, funny, full of action and lots of car crashes so it is really a good, old fashioned cinematic action extravaganza that screams for sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman combines the old games of espionage and megalomaniac villains, with modern technology and the social and environmental problems of today. A task that may seem complicated, but it is not for Mathew Vaughn, who takes us on a subversive journey with style but above all, full of comedy and action.We are introduced to Kingsman, a secret organization with the task of protecting the world from the threats looming over. Valentine Richmond is the main antagonist, he uses his resources to achieve a machiavellian plan, with a goal that actually makes sense!Taron Egerton as "Eggsy" represents very well the role, with comedy, action and sure of himself. Colin Firth as Galahad is here a fantastic performance as veteran agent of Kingsman, Eggsy mentor and Valentine's rival.All the other actors and actresses carry very well, but who steals all the attention are: Taron Egert, Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson who plays Valentine with a very funny voice.In short, this movie is very well done, with bright and fun dialogue and a spectacular action scenes. Those who like action-adventure films, will surely enjoy from film.6/7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well it's not a 10/10 but a 9/10 fits it as well as the suits that are worn by the Kingsman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>5 years ago Matthew Vaughn directed kick-ass which to this day stands in my top 10 favorite action films of all time. I was just blown away by the awesome gun play in the film and it become a personal favorite from there on. So when I saw Matthew Vaughn to direct Kingsman with Samuel L In on it I knew I had to see it. Well, I wasn't disappointed.This film doesn't come close to kick-ass for me but anyone out there take note that this film is worth a watch for it's one balls to the wall amazing action scene that takes place within the confines of a church. Now as for the rest of the film.The acting is good from all involved, highlights include newcomer Taron Egerton and Samuel L Jackson sporting a lisp. The filmmaker clearly shows a great respect for the spy genre and if you are a fan of the Roger Moore bond films than this film is up your alley.My only complaint is that the films best scene (church scene)was earlier on in the film and so the last portion of the film didn't exceed that part, so basically your climax was right then and there (at least for me). I know I haven't said much about the story but I believe that your already aware of the story to an extent.In conclusion I think this film is a film to see if you want to watch a far fetched, funny, action packed, spy film. I wish I could cover more in my review to make it more useful but I'm sure one of the other 500 user reviews can attend to your needs. I hope you find this useful and that you enjoy this film.

		<shortDescription>A violent, funny and exciting action thriller for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: Secret Service is fantastic, it just delivers a lot of thrills and violence that it is nearly unbelievable, this film is one of the best of 2015. I saw this the first time when i was on a plane, i saw the airline version.The plot is about how a promising street kid whose mom is poor with an abusive father and a baby, joins the Kingsman to stop a Tech genius from using a Sim-card, which allows free-internet to cause people to go insane and go on a murderous rampage, it's up to Eggsy, the street kid to stop him and his assistant from releasing the Sim-card to the public.The film is very good, so good in fact, it's much better than any other Matthew Vaughn Movie before that. The script in this Movie is both funny and well written, while the performances are top notch, the film just falls flat when compared to it's likable characters, most of the characters are good, but some can be forgotten.The violence is good, but there's just too much of it, it's like Kick-Ass just not as realistic. The shout-out for the film is of course Colin Firth, he is fantastic, he delivers the lines perfectly. The film is also funny, some scenes made me laugh like the part where Galahad said he was a Catholic whore and where the dinner at the Meeting with the villain was McDonalds Food.The Church scene is if not the most violent scene i've seen in a action-comedy, this seen includes every single ways to die as possible, impalement, shooting, getting fire in the hair, Axe and stabbing.When i saw the trailer for this Movie, i didn't expect it to be that violent, literally. When i saw the trailer, i thought it was a PG-13 Movie, but i was wrong, it's violent, rude and has sexual References.Kingsman: Secret Service is a fantastic film, the Music, action scenes, script, acting, characters and plot is great, despite the violence being a bit much innit (pun intended) and a few character Development issues, otherwise great Movie, recommended for the People who are sensitive.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son reckoned I wouldn't like this movie, but I did and would have watched it a second time but fell asleep. Action plus, great cast, special effects and as the director mentioned, one has to have a nasty villain that made the 007 movies so great.I don't know if they can follow it up with a second sequel but they will have to follow it up with a great cast someone to replace Arthur (Michael Caine) and Colin Firth (Gallahad).I thought the script and editing were brilliant, it brought smiles too my face, especially the ending. "Good manners maketh the man". It does, even though he might be a dangerous person inwardly if one crossed him badly. In other words, he or she, doesn't wear their heart on their sleeve and only attacks the unworthy.I loved the approach and theme, and hope they dare to make a sequel that would also get a 10 out of 10. To coin a phrase, it will be a hard act to follow, but well done. About time the great spy movies got some humour in them, as they are what we would like reality to be, but unfortunately it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly entertaining but taken down by pervasive filthy language.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it with the British, at least the way they are mostly characterized in these kinds of movies? Is there an edict that all the characters have to use the F-word several times in any conversation? Now I understand the concept of using language that will help make dialog seem realistic, but just like too much pepper will ruin a steak, too much pervasive peppery language can ruin a script. It makes the movie less interesting and less entertaining.The movie is adapted from the comic book. Young actor Taron Egerton is in the role of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin who is smart and talented but seemingly wasting his life with petty misbehaviors of various kinds. He is given a chance for redemption when he is among 9 young men and young women to train for a select secret organization. When he is successful he is expected to save the world. Nothing in this movie is plausible, it is all over-the-top stuff. Samuel Jackson plays an evil guy who is hatching a plot to thin out the world's population. If it had been less "dirty" it would have been a much better movie. It also has lots of violence.DVD from my public library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely entertaining and loads of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is one of those movies that grabs you by the stones and doesn't let go until the credits roll. I haven't seen any of the spy films that it pays homage to, but if they're anything like this I'll get right on it. The basic story is about a young man, Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who joins a super-secret spy organization, helps save the world, and becomes a better person in the process. The entire cast did an incredible job playing their characters. You have seasoned veterans like Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. And then there is newcomer Taron Egerton, who is a revelation. He has a suave, cool attitude to him that really sold the character he played. Not only were the performances excellent all-round, the actors looked like they were having a great time, which spills over onto the audience as a result. The action sequences, an important part of a film like this, were also really good. Matthew Vaughn has a way with kinetic action (see: LAYER CAKE, KICK-ASS) and he delivers that here. Although the editing and camera-work pushes the boundaries of comprehensibility, the geography of each scene was never in question. The crown jewel of these is a scene in a church set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Free Bird. If you aren't on-board with the film at this point, maybe it isn't for you. If there's anything that be said negatively about the film, the characterization of the villain might not sit well with some people. There also was quite a lot of CGI enhancement. And, there's one sexual joke/scene towards the end that could come off as crass, but I thought it was consistent with the type of film this was trying to be. Generally speaking, all of the complaints that could be made of the film have (to me, at least) a valid explanation. It's a highly entertaining film with a good story, excellent action, and a great sense of humor. Just sit back and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful movie, full of surprises and nice quirks. Witty, charming, classy and humorous. There is so much to enjoy in this movie, including a very talented cast. The nod to the James Bond franchise is unmistakable and elevates the homage genre in the finest way. I feel like I am gushing in this review, but this really is a must-see movie for anyone that enjoys action packed thrillers with just the right touch of humor.There is violence to be sure, but it is done in such a way, that is entirely unobjectionable and even farcical - but in the most enjoyable manner. Colin Firth is the perfect choice for Galahad and Samuel L. Jackson makes for the perfect "Bond" type villain, not to mention the metamorphosis of Taron Egerton into the perfect gentlemanly Kingsman.I was fortunate enough to see this on the 4th of July, so the fireworks scene made me laugh in delight and cheer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything that's missing in a Bond movie ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am offering you the opportunity to become a Kingsman. A tailor? A Kingsman agent. Like a spy? Of sorts. Interested? You think I've got anything to lose?I'm not a big fan of Bond films. Too clean, too boring and too stiff. And there was always Q who came up with some new inventions and coincidentally they came in handy in that movie. I would love to own his crystal ball. Also, every movie was stuffed with action, but you'd never see a speck of blood (Before all Bond fans react furiously: I admit that I haven't seen all Bond-movies. So I could be wrong on that part). And in every film a bunch of gorgeous ladies paraded around, but I've never seen a millimeter of offensive nudity. "Kingsman : The Secret Service" feels like a James Bond flick, but then provided with all these last-mentioned facts and an excessive dose of humor.Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a member of "The Kingsmen", an espionage organization, which is even more secret than the secret service itself, that gets all the dirty jobs from MI6. Hart is a genuine Englishman and looks more like a distinguished businessman or banker than a master spy. During an operation in the Middle East, the father of Gary "Eggsy" (Taron Egerton) got killed, after which Hart gives this toddler a medal that could be useful in the future. 17 years later, during the kidnapping of a professor by the multi millionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), another secret agent is killed during the rescue operation. Hart recommends Eggsy (grown up, unemployed and no prospects) as a candidate to join "The Kingsmen ".The whole film has the atmosphere of an old spy movie like James Bond or "The Avengers", a popular series from the 70's with John Steed as a secret agent who faithfully wore a bowler and was equipped with an ordinary umbrella with all sorts of ingenious gadgetry. Compared with the civilized manners in those days, "Kingsman" is rather brutal and radical. Don't get me wrong. Hart is an example of courtesy and attempts to be as reserved and correct as possible, regardless of the situation he finds himself in, as befits a true Brit. But it's mainly the dissolute tone and graphic violence that makes the difference. The film sometimes tends to take on Tarantino-like proportions. The fragment in the local church is such an example. 3 Minutes of rage swirling across your screen with Hart acting as a purebred John Wick. Or the scene in the local pub where he demonstrates equivalent fighting techniques as "The Equalizer". Colin Firth doesn't look particularly like a well-oiled fighting machine and some movements look rigid, but all in all this 55-year was convincing enough. He proves that besides serious roles full of drama as in "Devil's Knot" and "The Railway Man", he's capable to handle lighthearted, action-packed roles as well.When Eggsy begins the grueling training, with annoying rich kids as opponents, I was afraid it would lead to a kind of "Ender's Game" or "Divergent" story. Fortunately, this wasn't the case. The whole training proceeded under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong). The only thing that was a bit unbelievable for me, was the fact that an inexperienced teenager as Eggsy, whose most exciting life experience so far was peeing against an electric cattle fence, can grow out into an experienced parachutist in such short period. However I tolerated this since this action comedy doesn't take itself seriously in the first place. And also lets mention Michael Caine, as the Godfather of all Kingsmen, who perfectly took upon himself the role of ancien.In a real spy movie, a bad guy shouldn't be missing obviously. This part was played with visible pleasure by Samuel L. Jackson as the lisping multimillionaire Richmond Valentine who worries about the future of the earth. In particular, the global warming, concerns him. For this, however, he has devised a diabolical plan. Only the implementation of this plan is inadequate. Jackson is peerless in this role (About time after a few feeble performances) as the eccentric Valentine who can't stand seeing a drop of blood and tends to lose consciousness in that case. To avoid this, he has a graceful assistant called Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). A true fury and fighting machine with razor-sharp legs with the necessary amputated limbs as a result. Finally, also a honorable mention for Hanna Alström as the Swedish princess. She didn't need much acting talent, but her graceful butt was prominently displayed in the end."Kingsman: The secret service" is a must see movie. Do you enjoy a touch of dry English humor, overly bloody action moments and all of this with a wink to the great spy movies of yesteryear ? Surely this film is made for you. Brace yourself for this espionage which contains brute force as well as humor. And it doesn't avoid well known clichés, but still brings them in a different way so that you actually won't notice it really. Magistrale movie !More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest I don't really understand how come that the rating of this movie stars with a 7. In my opinion it IS a ten but at least (if you are very strict and judgmental) it deserves an 8. Why?Because it's visuals are spectacular, the characters and the actors are great and lovable and fight scenes are just beyond imagination. I think they managed to come up with an entirely new way of shooting a fight scene which involves having many long takes that are rather rare in fight scenes. And who would have ever thought that "Darcy" becomes the new action hero in a movie that beats the "Mission Impossible" series.The story itself is good as well, good-written. I also appreciated a lot that the protagonist's love for animals were unbreakable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went in without any expectations or rather, expected it to be like those Hollywood teenage spy movies. What i got was truly unexpected. The combat scenes have a level of hardcore and speed that i normally only see in korean films (eg Man from nowhere). With a lot of Hollywood action films, fights are slow and cumbersome, while a fight in this film is at high speed signalling well practised choreography.The script is fine, with the various scenes that encourage rooting for the "blue collar makes good" are easy to spot but all the actors play their parts well, at the very least. Samuel L Jackson puts in a non standard performance while Colin Firth plays the cultured agent shtick with pizazz. Sofia Boutella makes an impression though sheer audacity and physicality, though at the end of the show i did not even remember her character's name (if it was given). Comedy is doled out in small doses and work well with the overall script.Not truly a 10/10 film but the show's fight scenes deserve the recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few months ago, I went to go see this movie, not having too big expectations. I thought it would be an okay action flick, but instead I got a stylized, slick, action-comedy. This movie is not for everyone; some find it to be too violent, and it is, although it's not realistic violence. The movie takes a plot like one of those 70's Bond flicks, except with great jokes and graphic violence. The movie is a lot of fun, with the villain a lisp-talking Samuel L. Jackson as the tech CEO mastermind. I recommend renting this movie, and you'll probably have a lot of fun. Age recommendation: 13 and up.</fullReview>

Seen in continuous fight scenes, with sensational Cinematography, we meet the James Bond side of Firth with non-stop skills. Kingsman is definitely a 10/10, and must see film of 2015. Although the film contains constant bloody and graphic content throughout, I believe that Kingsman is film for the whole age appropriate family.This film is strongly recommended by this viewer so, grab your ticket and enjoy 2 hours of action packed thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond Dies Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having spent around 2 years of my life watching movies, I've never finished an entire James Bond film. They've never appealed to me, I just fail to feel the magic of the old ones, myself being born in 1983, while the lack of originality in the newer ones plain put me off. Be that as it may though, this movie I felt. Not having seen a trailer it took me by complete surprise, like a long awaited answer to a primal yearning would, filling a hole in my conscious desires with heaps of guilty pleasure.My attempts at resisting the charm of the script's self awareness proved futile, not just in respect to the explicit meta references, but also in Deus Ex Machina appearing as a projection of the viewer's voyeuristic appetites, an ever-present companion who is dying to cheer with us and proudly admits the simplicity of it's nature, the very same way the protagonist proclaims awareness of the euphemism behind his desire to drink a glass of plain old Gin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler- This was a great spy in training movie, and could have reached a much broader audience, except for the F- word used at least once every 6 minutes in the film. I was so sorry to hear that perhaps after writing the script the writers found it was too short. They found the easiest word they could fit in as a Noun , Verb or Adjective. So if they could zap those words out you would have a superb movie, and it would not even mess with the dialog. I believe that the action could be too much for some or the violence, but one is able to get up to get a drink or visit the bathroom during those events and still not miss the whole scene. So for those who might remember the TV Guardian product, the would only be a few lines you actually heard during the film, the rest you would be read. This film has a lot of WOW, if you know what i mean ;) I love Colin Firth</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Incredible Film ! Absolutely NOTHING wrong with it whatsoever.... When 2 hours goes by in what feels like 45 minutes you know a film is good ! This has everything you need, the action, the gore, the emotions, the comedy (making fun of other generic spy movies, and yet performing EXACTLY that is a very cleverly done and successful irony), the secret agency, the gadgets, the crazed villain, the music. You name it, it's got it ! From start to finish, it's gripping and leaves you asking where it is going to go next. I don't want to say too much as I feel it just needs to be watched not knowing too much about it. What I DO want to say is that it makes you WANT the villain to succeed that little bit longer just to see how things pan out ! And Samuel L. Jackson does an amazing job of that ! It is DAMNRIGHT FANTASTIC !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally Entertaining.. Kill Bill meets James Bond meets Wrong Turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was based from the Comic Book, "The Secret Service". I have not read the comic book so I do not know anything about this movie. I was expecting somewhat a Spy Kids type of movie. What with the lead character being on his teen (or at least he still looks like his on his teen). You wouldn't expect something "BONDish", BOURNEish" or "MIsh".But lo and behold.....this movie is not for kids.. definitely. Limbs are flying everywhere, a human torso was cut into pieces, heads blown off....it's just like James Bond meets Wrong Turn out there. Though you can't actually say the premise as being too dark, I can safely say that it juggles between being serious and being comedic..The movie is about a young man's (fondly called "Eggy" by his peers) journey on being a Secret Service agent for the secret group only known by their name, Kingsman where the agents names were taken from Camelot's Knights of the round table. He is to follow on the footstep of his deceased father who died heroically in one mission.Unlike most movies where the main hero passes the test, this one chooses a different path. Eggsy (played by Taron Egerton) was made an agent not because he qualified but because he needs to be qualified given the predicament. By the way, I didn't find much significance between the agents training and their soon to be missions. The training and tests are just there I think as training and tests. That's all. I also find the training on caring for a dog and then as a final test, you'll need to kill that dog truly odd. Though there were blank bullets, I'd say, this test is stupid. The teens are being trained as agents and not as assassins. This portion of the movie reminds me of Azumi part 1 and Naked Weapon where part of the assassin's final training is to kill their partners. The final test in those movies is just appropriate given the fact that the protagonists are being groomed to kill without mercy. The agent's training in this movie is supposed to be on becoming a hero and to protect others. Why the hell would they be tested to kill a dog and then fail if they couldn't? It didn't make sense at all.I will not go on into so much details. The movie is fun. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end. The action sequence are spectacular. The fight scenes are wonderfully choreographed especially those from Valentine's (name of the main villain played by Samuel Jackson) female assassin, Gazelle. Not to be outdone with were those coming from Eggsy as well as action sequences from Collin Firth who plays the role of Galahad, Eggsy's mentor. You may compare them with Kill Bill's but more fast pace.It's a fun fun fun movie, the music is great, you'll love it. But if you're not into movies of the violent kind, stay away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin but Electrifying, It's Best Enjoyed with a Healthy Appreciation for Old Bond Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roaring, overly indulgent fun amidst the rubble of the classic spy films and programs that dominated the 1960s. It's a more deadpan, action-focused take than Austin Powers, of course, but I'd hardly venture to call it serious. The tone is decidedly carefree, which should be no surprise given the creative team's track record. Director Matthew Vaughan and comic book author Mark Millar, who teamed to bring Kick-Ass to the screen a few years ago, are also the guilty parties in this case, and it's right in the same ballpark. Tons of effective punchlines, a few really great cornerstone action sets, and a wide spectrum of colors to cover for a very simple, shallow, recycled plot. And it works, honestly, both as a standalone mind-number and as a winking, grinning, elbowing satire of Bond and company. For my money it lingers too long in the training room, but once the cast graduates it's basically balls-to-the-wall the rest of the way home. Gratifying if not nourishing, like the big McDonald's spread enjoyed by a certain nameless character in a key scene, I had a great time but felt a little guilty about it later. The chapel brawl and the series of colorful explosions at the film's climax are two spots I'll have a hard time forgetting, though, and I feel like I'm richer for having experienced them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is entertaining. But I wonder how the rating of the movie is 8(out of 10)!!! Because too many dumb people rated this movie higher. It should get at most 6.5. A simple observation that, the "main problem" of the storyline is a usual one. That's "Saving the mankind from a devil-minded genius". That is too much old and assumable. There are also some lacking of logic in keeping secrets of a secret service agency. So I thing the rating of the movie is for Business purpose or too many people under aged people saw it and rated it. BTW "romance with the princess" reminds me "007". Also the fighting in church made me a little ferocious</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does To James Bond What Kickass Did To Superheroes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of Kickass &amp; X-Men: First Class comes a new comic book adaptation that effortlessly blends the over-the-top action of the former with the secret world of the latter, which is then smoothly intermixed with elements of spy-thrillers &amp; is ultimately raised to a high level of bizarro. And the result is an incredibly stylish, downright hilarious &amp; endlessly fun cinema called Kingsman: The Secret Service.Based on the acclaimed comic book, Kingsman: The Secret Service refers to a secret spy organisation that's looking to recruit a potential agent as a replacement for the position left vacated by a former Kingsman who dies during one of their operations. The story follows a veteran Kingsman agent who takes an aimless young adult under his wing &amp; grooms him for the job while a twisted billionaire unleashes a global threat.Co-written, co-produced &amp; directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose kinetic direction here brims with creative energy as his latest is his love letter to earlier James Bond classics. However, it also toys with the conventions of its genre &amp; makes fun of the same simultaneously, and with its clever use of violence, outlandish humour &amp; a few cartoonish renderings, makes this film a roller-coaster ride of emotions.Coming to the technical aspects, Production Design team does an excellent job as all the set pieces are meticulously refined. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera that seamlessly switches from a firmly controlled sequence to an out-of-control carnage without ever losing focus. Editing briskly paces the whole narrative. Plus, the energetic soundtrack by Henry Jackman &amp; Matthew Margeson works in the film's favour.As far as performances go, Kingsman: The Secret Service features a well-rounded cast in Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton &amp; others. Now Firth may not be anyone's first choice for an action role yet it's the exact reason why his character works so well. Jackson is funny &amp; freaky at the same time. Strong is reliable as always. Egerton is the newcomer here who exhibits great potential &amp; his master-disciple relationship with Firth is a highlight of this feature.On an overall scale, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an early oddball of the year that does to James Bond what Kickass did to superheroes. Its unexpected shift in tones, crazy action sequences &amp; eccentric use of humour may not go well with everyone but even its detractors can't deny the awesomeness of the church scene. While certainly a no match to Vaughn's previous effort, this British spy action comedy is nevertheless an enjoyable, entertaining &amp; amusing ride that comes gleefully recommended.</fullReview>

In my opinion, those who think the movie is stupid or has a weak plot, did not get past the thin veil that looks stupid. Digging a little you get to realize the real issues that the movie wishes to highlight.The movie has some humorous and light-hearted moments but too much violence and action to be classed as a comedy, I can compare this to DR Strangelove by Stanley Kubrick. This is not a stupid movie or a waste of time as claimed by some, I recommend you to watch it and be the judge; however,if you like to watch uncomplicated,easy to understand movies and traditional plot styles...THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF MOVIE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Manners Maketh Man." This is one of those movies that completely takes you by surprise. I enjoyed it immensely. James Bond type-ish British spy film, but with way WAY more wack and awesomeness. Matthew Vaughn is a great director. I've watched all of his films (except Layer Cake) and the guy just has a knack of delivering really enjoyable/entertaining movies (Stardust, Xmen - First class, Kick ass). The cast delivered great performances all round. Colin Firth simply KICKED ASS. Loved his character and how classy yet deadly he was. Taron Egerton, the protagonist, was some nobody to me before I saw this movie. Now, he is a star in the making. Samuel L.Jackson, while didn't stole the show or anything, was a pretty good villain with a funny lisp condition.The plot actually felt somewhat fresh and wasn't your typical 'Take over the world' type scenarios that you see in this genre. Although I have see the main mechanism elsewhere, the reasons for doing, the justification and all that was something that I could standby with. Also, the movie had some messages about over reliance on smartphones, privacy hacks etc which I really liked.Coming to the action, let me just say that it was just awesome. The pacing was so well done that many scenes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart thumping like crazy. The hand to hand scenes were also well executed. Full of gore, long takes, class and no excessive shaky cam and fast cuts bullshit. Add dark humor layer to it all and it was just a wonder to watch it all. The Church scene in particular really WOWED me. Sound effects and OSTs were also perfectly edited in scenes, enhancing the experience, adding more adrenaline, class, humor etc as required. The only complaint I had was that the movie tried to develop some romance and while I'm REALLY glad it didn't linger on it, it did kinda felt out of place and just tacked on. Overall, it's the best movie of this year so far for me. I just hate myself for not seeing it in the cinema. 8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From chav to gentleman in two hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's actually a rare occasion that you see a movie based on a comic book about British people. Until i managed to recall V for Vendetta, i thought it's my first rendezvous with a material of such sort. Especially since it revolves around a figure of an English gentleman, and who can be a more unlikely comic book hero than a tea-drinking suit-wearing umbrella-cane-carrying snob?Well, this is where it gets interesting. Because, although our main gentleman figure is played by Colin Firth, a seasoned veteran of Regency era courtships and chivalry, it's not gonna be a Pride and Prejudice of any sort. What we have here is a modern day dandy spy squad. But it's not just James Bond dressed for Royal Ascot. It's more like Captain America dressed (and mannered) for the same sort of thing. Fancy, ain't it?But, as with a recipe for a proper Martini, all the ingredients, including the last one, are equally important. And, as a cherry (or should i say an olive) on top, we have here a little social confrontation, because our modern time knight with impeccable looks and manners chooses as his apprentice a young chav'ish guy, who's equally talented and troublesome.At this point, i believe that anyone who's at least mildly interested in the action/adventure movie genre will be intrigued to the limit. And they should be, because Kingsman: The Secret Service delivers a today's interpretation of the ages old fairy tale about a commoner who rose up and got into the highest ranks thanks only to his courage, wits and honor. And this time, instead of bows and swords, we have shotguns and super spy gadgets.Surely, as any fairy tale, Kingsman is hardly a sci-fi. So don't expect much plausibility here, since what's believable is not always fun. Instead, enjoy how marvelously graphic this movie is, how brilliantly the fighting scenes are filmed and how insanely surreal (or surreally insane) the main villain is. It takes a courage and some wild imagination to actually transform the current collective subconscious into a figure of flesh and blood and make this figure really evil, but only evil enough to still take it seriously. Because, as we know from the old Bond movies, the over-the-top baddies cause more laugh than fright, and we don't want the audience to laugh before the punch line, do we?But no matter how gentleman material you are, it's hard not to get your suit wrinkled and specked a bit when it's raining punches and bullets. So, while Kingsman is light-hearted and jolly enough to be on par with Kick-Ass, it certainly lacks some depth and character development. Surely, we see how Eggsy, the ballsy (no pun intended) Galahad's protégé, goes from that council housing punk to well-esteemed gentleman with fighting skills straight from The Matrix. What we don't see is some real, not fairy tale sort of, challenge he has to overcome to become what he becomes. Just a bit of brawling with some higher-born competitors and one skydiving trick - that's all. He doesn't even seem to break a sweat, which falls in line with the fairy tale style, but lacks realism so much that it undermines the value of the achievement somewhat. And yes, there's product placement. So explicit and blatant that they even make Colin Firth endorse McDonald's as a part of a dialogue. I try not to be a snob, but that was a bit too much.So, while Kingsman is hardly a movie that would hold you enthralled on a re-watch, it's still entertaining enough for your first date to be pleasant. It's fresh enough, funny enough, and who would skip an opportunity to see Colin Firth kicking major ass for three minutes straight? Not me for sure. And neither should you, because for that alone watching Kingsman can be a lifetime experience ;).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's what trend I am noticing with these reviews. With rare exceptions, it's getting either a 1/10 or a 10/10, which means for this movie to have a stellar 8/10 IMDb score, for every one person that gives it a bad review, four people have to give it a perfect review. This is a rough calculation obviously, but it's actually important to my review. Instead of looking at this as, 4/5 people liked this movie, I look at this as everyone who likes this genre of movie, liked this movie. Now, why do I make such a claim? Read the negative reviews. Every review is about how there is too much violence or the plot being over the top. What did you expect walking into this. Look at the rating and the reasons for the rating. Watch the trailer. Read one review for the movie. Watch the other movies by this director. Take your pick. These are all indicative of what the movie was actually like. These reviews are basically akin to "I didn't like the Avengers because there was too many superheroes." I'm not implying you should know every little thing about every movie you see, but shouldn't you at least know the general idea of what you're getting into? Ranting aside for how people don't educate themselves before spending their money, if you like these types of movies, you'll adore this one. I'm beating a dead horse, but it's a British Kick A**. Plain and simple. It's unique, quirky, humorous, enjoyable, and fun. They do a great job of mixing action with comedy, much like the aforementioned title. Honestly, I laughed more during this than any comedy movie I've seen in years. I'd prefer to keep this review entirely spoiler free, so I won't be giving any examples of witty lines or particularly memorable action sequences, but believe me, they exist.There were so many unexpected bright points from the movie as well. Samuel L. Jackson's character was beyond amazing. I certainty didn't see that coming. The plot, although indeed over the top, was extremely clever at certain points in the movie. There's some predictable twists, but a lot of the interview test scenes were handled very cleverly. The whole British twist on the movie added something fresh as well. As someone who generally doesn't personally like British movies or even the culture (no offense intended, just not my cup of tea...pun intended), I found it to be a welcome theme for this particular movie.There were a few tiny grievances I had, however. They probably didn't need to swear as much as they did, but that's just a personal preference and not anything actually wrong with the movie. I also thought the music wasn't that great. Maybe I'm spoiled from Kick-A**'s, well...kick-a** soundtrack, especially during fight scenes, but I wasn't feeling it for this movie. The universal complaint I seem to see in these reviews that I'll agree with too is the gratuitous last three seconds of the movie. It was kind of demeaning and added nothing to the movie. But(t...another pun? :) ), we all know why it was there. Sex sells. There's not much you can do about that at this point.All in all, if you liked Kick-A**, you WILL like this movie. If you like stylized action, you'll like this movie. If you like James Bond, you'll probably like this movie. If you like unique movies, you'll like this movie. If you're easily offended by excessive violence, you will not like this movie. It's, for the most part, not even that gory; just violent. It's as simple as that.</fullReview>

Samuel Jackson is that very rare breed of (almost) lovable villain. The villain's assistant is beautiful danger incarnate. Good guys become bad guys. There is something for everyone in this movie. Ultimately, this is a movie about character; what makes someone a good and decent human being. It's also about how sometimes failing a test reveals a much more worthwhile side to a person. There are no holes in this script. The only reason it gets a 9 instead of a 10 is that I really didn't like the closing credits soundtrack.</fullReview>

Samuel.L Jackson is genius in this film! He plays the comical lisping villain, and is the cherry on top of the cake. Then there's Collin Firth who's equally as good, playing a secret service agent. It's quite odd to see him come from things like the Kings Speech to being an all action agent but refreshing! Finally, the young Taron Egerton gives an amazing performance! He is able to bring out all your emotions in one film, leaving you breathless.The filming is completely original and refreshing too! The way people's heads blow off into fireworks is just funny and exhilarating! The massacre scene in the church, while being horrific is also comical to watch and can't be taken seriously! Over all, this film is just amazing; great actors mixed with a great storyline and fantastic filming makes what is in my opinion a perfect film. However, if you're expecting a deep bond like spy film, well; "This ain't that kind of movie bruv'"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: the secret service, one thing I can say about this movie, they have done every little thing just right!! It definitely falls into the Bond genre (I think it's about time to give the Bond movies their own genre). This movie is different in many ways yet it embraces its genre completely, yes, it is a British spy action comedy but it's like they wait for you to expect something and then they do the opposite. Directing: Matthew Vaughn is usually great with these kind of movies, Kingsman gives the same vibe as Kick-ass, the perfect balance between action and dark humor. The film was violent yet not gory, he avoided the gore and the messiness that comes with it. One of the best fight scenes I have seen in a very long time. In most of the fight scenes there were some awesome long takes, which is very hard to accomplish, as opposed to short quick confusing and totally unimpressive scenes. Vaughn usually adapts stories with comic book backgrounds and makes the characters and story come to life on screen with all their cartoonish and comical nature, unlike Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan who take a comic book story, strip it from all its comical charm and turn it into a typical action movie that does not really need a superhero or a supervillain to be special. The story: surprisingly original and the attention they paid to detail is impressive, it's a solid well-rounded 'major plot holes' free. The casting: this was pure brilliance, let's talk Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson, both have been thrown out of their comfort zones, especially Colin Firth, but both did it brilliantly!!! Colin Firth proved that he can be a bad ass and do the genre that he has been accused of lacking the capabilities to do. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Valentine, is very interesting, he's like a genius Bond villain with a soft heart, low tolerance to violence, a very evil yet smart plan and a lisp. Mark Strong acting wasn't as great as the aforementioned actors but I blame whoever wrote the character because they didn't give him a lot to work with, the character was flat and typical. But Mark Strong is always great. And I still think he's one of the most underrated great actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(I don't expect anyone is reading this, since this is the ...426th review posted, but here goes!) This is an over-the-top action movie build on the British style of Roger Moore's 007 and the "The Avengers" (TV Series 1961?1969).I can think a couple of actors who might be suitable for the main role but the finesse and elegance of Colin Firth is beyond any criticism and the main reason to see this movie. You might never believed that Firth could pose as an action hero but in the league of 55-65 spy-type assassins gives ...Liam Neeson a run for his money.The direction is stylish too and its main purpose to please the audience. Lots of slo-mo effects, one-vs-100 fighting sequences, sky diving, many many explosions etc. Not the boring type. This movie has good action choreography that becomes even more fun when you see Colin Firth delivering it! The script is overall clever although the premise is common. The wealthy evil mastermind vs. "a" British secret service (not MI6), but even that idea has held some sarcasm for itself.With the exception of a couple scenes near the end that are crossing the line to the ridiculous this movie has some emotions too.Overall: Recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know this movie existed before I went into the theater to watch it. I hadn't read reviews, I hadn't seen trailers and I didn't even know it was based on a comic book (which I haven't read either). I just happened to stumble upon it in my weekly trip to the cinema and, since there wasn't anything else worth watching (that I hadn't seen) at the moment, I decided to try my luck...... Glorious, if I'm going to use one word to describe this film, it is that one. After having watched, in theaters, a string of depressive dramas and offbeat comedies (mostly last year's Oscar nominees and some art-house movies) in the past few months; this movie reminded me why I love the seventh art so much: it's just shameless, stylized, escapist and balls- to-the-wall fun.The first thing I want to comment on is the acting and I'm not going to focus on the veterans (it's pretty much a given to expect amazing performances from Firth, Jackson, Caine and Strong; even if, in the case of Firth and Jackson, their roles are quite outside their comfort zones) but on our protagonist. Egerton plays the role with panache, comfort and emotional depth unusual for someone who is pretty much doing their first big role and in an action/comedy flick no less. There's no moment in the movie in which I could say he isn't Eggsy. He clearly threw himself to it and had a blast, there's enough conflict, audacity and (to use Merlin's words) "cheek" to spare. And he also did most of his stunts to boot.That leads me to another fantastic asset of the movie: the stunt work. The action setpieces are just things of beauty and although everyone mentions, and with good reason, the church scene; my favorite moment occurs at the end and it involves a lot of parkour. It's mesmerizing.The comedy is also spot on and perfectly timed, Galahad's line in the church is flawless in every sense, and that's just one moment.The soundtrack, both the compositions for the movie and the pre-existing songs, fits like a glove and sets the mood of each scene seamlessly. Of particular note is one of the most inspired uses of "Free Bird" I've heard.In the director's seat, Vaughn does a great work of letting us see all this in the smoothest way possible, he has an eye for genial moments that he puts to great use.Here's hoping it gets enough money to warrant a sequel and this one isn't messed up like certain other of director Vaughn.All in all Kingsman gets a 10/10 from me (and it's the sixth movie I've ever watched to get that rating). I'm not claiming it is a landmark masterpiece of cinema but, as far as escapism go, this movie does achieve perfection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very good. The action sequences are very entertaining, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The plot was a little too drawn out, yet had some very good twists, such as Harry's death. The idea of a SIM card that can control people is very good. The one major area where this film failed for me was the CGI. The explosions looked horrendous. It was obvious when things were CGI'd. Even still the fight sequences had tremendous visuals. The script was very well written to show the the Kingsman's class, "Manners Maketh Man" is one of the best lines in the film. The characters were very well developed, apart from "Roxy" who was really just there. Firth played his character to perfection, Caine was alright and I believe that Taron Egerton has a very promising future in action. The standout character has to be Valentine, the lisp he has makes his lines absolutely brilliant.Overall this movie gets a solid 8, superb fights and dialogue, just lacking in CGI. Really a more funny James Bond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you liked "Kick Ass", you'll like "Kingsman: The Secret Service".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kingsman: The Secret Service" isn't quite what you'd expect having seen how the film has been advertised. But for those who might have read the well-acclaimed 2012 comic that the film is based on and from there may have noticed that the film is bringing back the same duo that bought us "Kick Ass" (Matthew Vaughn and Mark Millar), "Kingsman: The Secret Service" may perhaps prove to be less of a shock. The film is most of all a fun one, well-executed by the man whose influence is prominent in it, Matthew Vaughn, the film's director. But Vaughn's style, as seen in the several action sequences that come to define the film are not all that "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is and the rest of it is relatively generic, poor and boring and definitely stands out in contrast to what I remember "Kingsman: The Secret Service" for.The film's action sequences are each brilliant with one in particular perhaps being the best I have ever seen, where Colin Firth (playing Harry Hart) cuts and shoots his way through the throats and heads of a group of fire and brimstone American, bigot church-goers. The film's ending is also brilliantly shot, unfolding in front of you like a painting. Some have called this style obnoxious, which I understand, but it fits into what "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is, a film with James Bond archetypes that have been cranked up to about level 100, and that are the complete opposite of the James Bond films we are currently used to.And this is the same for the film's main villain, tech billionaire Richard Valentine (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson) who obviously has a phobia of sorts for blood and a lisp. He dresses in a way that is a relief in contrast to the suits I've seen almost every single James Bond villain play in recent times, instead wearing orange, blue or purple baseball caps with matching outfits of course. When I first saw Jackson on screen I couldn't help but burst out laughing.What lets the film down is in what happens when Colin Firth isn't killing everybody in the room. Boring archetypal stuff that is a product of what happens when this James Bond parody is trying to be serious for a moment. Moments like when the film's protagonist, Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (played by newcomer Taron Egerton) is running down corridors with soldiers chasing after him and miraculously seemingly forgetting how to shoot their guns (I mean this scene is painfully poorly shot). It's these moments I suppose that emphasise how Vaughn is not much a director of actors, but more of action and that is where he succeeds here, as he did in "Kick Ass". Ultimately "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a good film, and the average member of the audience my age will come out agreeing with me because of how similar it is to what we saw in "Kick Ass", but for the critic that I am slowly becoming several things stood out to me which proved detrimental towards the film's style. However, if you want to see a film that is full of blood and gore with a great soundtrack to keep the pace up, a film that in many ways I found took inspiration from my favourite film of 2014, "Guardians of the Galaxy", then look no further. You don't need to think and you can just be whisked away by Matthew Vaughn along the corridors of Richard Valentin's base, even though there may be the occasional moment when you find the soldiers aren't shooting at, nor running after you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was action packed. I had a hard time understanding other reviewers that said the kid wasn't in training when clearly time was changing drastically. One minute the dog is a tiny puppy the next it's full grown adult dog. Then they go to his mothers home and the infant is now a toddler... looks like 2 or 3 years has passed. They just didn't show you the training as you have to understand that's the boring part. The saving the world was the storyline and what was important.People just need to pay more attention to understand that time passed. The tests they showed were to prove they were worth continuing on in their training.Anyway, this film started strong and went through the entire show strong. The humor is subtle and again, you have to actually pay attention and it all makes sense. At the end my husband was like, I can't wait for a sequel! I had to agree.I love the twists and turns and it kept us wondering what the evil guys game plan was. What did his invention do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was amazed by the many low scoring reviews this film received. This is the director of Kick-ass, one of the most seminal, "ultra- violent" films of recent years. I loved Kick-ass and I loved this film for the same reasons - It doesn't take itself too seriously! For instance:1) Samuel L. Jackson's character is a wonderful foil to Bill Gates efforts to save the world. He actually hits the nail on the head - there's just too many people in the world - and sets about rectifying it in hilarious fashion.2) His bodyguard is a double amputee with weapons for her feet. A great steal from Oscar Pistorious and Kill Bill.3) The use of a radical Christian church as a test case. Most reviewers missed the irony of this one but for me it worked on many levels.4) The opening scene features a suave James Bond character who knows not only the type but also the year of a Whisky with just one sniff - he dies in a spectacular way. Later the Colin Firth character is treated with the same contempt.5) All the corrupt heads-of-state who colluded with this arch villain at the expense of the masses get their just desert6) The masses themselves queue up for free SIM cards for their smart phones without ever asking "what's the catch?". We are so used to expecting everything for free we seem to forget that people don't actually do -anything- for free.I could go on as there is loads of subtlety in the film, the mother's fall from grace, the dog shooting incident, the bullet- proof brolly etc. Most of this seems to have been missed by the other reviewers who were just interested in judging the ultra violence. Personally I laughed through most of it as it was plain silly, just as it was in Kill Bill and Kick-ass and completely the opposite of John Wick (which really is violent).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Undeniably, there is something irresistible about the English. Overdone, some would say, but that which discernibly distinguishes them. Colin Firth, perhaps one of the last active remnants of the aristocratic legacy of the Queen's culture and coterie at least on the silver screen , stars in this delightfully violent and overwhelmingly recreational movie. A deliberate digression from self-importance colours up the whole situational setting . We have out of the box action sequences. Seriously worded quips and one liners laced with characteristic dry humour of the Isles. An undercurrent of persistent comic reliefs both cultural and as well instinctive. The movie is not shrouded in any contradictory , psychologically complex cryptic conceits . The tale is fairly direct and lucidly directed. One can argue that the movie a tad too long but the intensity of the scenes is such, that one does not deem prudent to as much as utter a pretentious sigh of fatigue. Those who do not relish violence may find the movie a little distasteful and gross . The kinship to Kick-Ass can be clearly identified in the thematic treatment of the movie. However, the anterior is visually quite different. The most interesting and attractive part of the movie is that despite turning into a serious "The Spy Saves the Day" type of flick in various sequences, it doesn't in the least bore you. Samuel L. Jackson animates the cast . Mark Strong does a fine job with an interesting character sketch. Taron Egerton also exhibits fine acting skills .On the whole a very entertaining movie . They should produce more such movies. Reduction in violence can qualify it to be a strong candidate for classic summer blockbusters of the 90's. I found the movie quite good .</fullReview>

The cast was very good including actors like Colin Firth, Samuel L Jackson, Michael Caine and Mark Strong. It was like Bond meets Tarantino. It was quite bloody but the action was 100%. It was also funny with a lot of action mixed in. Taran Edgerston has a great future ahead of himself. This movie was very smart and the last fight was legit. I loved the way the stunts were performed especially when she went really high into the sky. But I really think that they could have kept Harry Hart alive as he was brilliant.

		<fullReview>At least some of the viewers. Comedy is always something that will divide people. Because what's funny to someone, others find boring or annoying. I'll just say colorful sprinkle, you'll know what I mean, when you see it towards the end of the movie. I thought it was awesome, but I heard people complain about this "getting out of hand", being unrealistic/over the top.But that's it, because while it seems to have both feet firmly on the ground, it's always on some other level "flying" around and giving kudos to old spy movies by acknowledging their existence and tweaking, sometimes twisting our expectations. Something that is done very nicely. But the movie is not meant for those easily offended. It has some crude humor and one of the last scenes, will have a couple of people (especially in America) cringe .. more so, than if some violence was involved.If you can deal with that and don't mind this being "British" to a point, but very on the point when it comes to jokes, while not forgetting that there are consequences, you'll enjoy this. After an initial resentment against the young lead here, I grew to really like him. A very good achievement. Also hearing Samuel L. Jackson lisp - just amazing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got to keep this short or else I'll find myself writing a book about why this movie is an utter piece of trash that is more of a waste of time than trying to teach an ADHD toddler the science behind plate tectonics.McDONALD'S ADVERTISEMENTThe story is about a secret spy organization that needs to save the world from an evil threat. Wow - so original. In recent years, there have been a handful of cinematic legends who have said that they are basically retiring from making movies because of the current state of cinema. Much of their reasoning consists of the fact that movies nowadays could care less about their quality and only their income. "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a quintessential example of this and it reminds me why I rarely go to the theater anymore.This is a loud and overbearing film full of superfluous and too obviously choreographed action scenes in which the viewer has no interest in because the protagonists here are seemingly untouchable and it leaves you caring less and less by the second. This is basically the R-rated British equivalent of "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."In short, this is a film that is so bad that it actually relies on incorporating classic rock songs in its action scenes in order to excite its audience. Pathetic.</fullReview>

Fox would be stupid to not have kingsmen 2 on the books right now... For those who need something more, the trailer gives you just a taste of what the movie is about in its entirety. You're taken on an adventure of a classic villain who wants to clean up the world, however the methods of both the heroes and villains are quite modern and will actually not turn out as quite as you would imagine.

It contains nice and lovable characters with some development (you can't expect too much here of course), a great villain and a good share of funny entertainment and some surprises one would not have necessarily pre-anticipated. If you like something like "Red" or as mentioned above the old James Bond style to first have some drink after waking up from being anaesthetised that is one to go for.

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a thrill ride from start to finish that had me emotionally invested and left me with a huge smile on my face at the closing credits!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service- R, 2015, Rotten Tomatoes: 75% &#x27a1;&#xfe0f;Kingsman: The Secret Service is the definition of a bloody good time at the cinemas and I was giddy with excitement when exiting the theater because I knew that I would watch this film on repeat for the rest of my life! This film comes from Matthew Vaughn who is an auteur in my opinion and is a bold, energetic filmmaker who should be recognized for the true talent that he is. Kingsman is about a group of gentleman spies who are tasked with protecting the world from malevolent evils that would seek to destroy it. The story specifically centers on young Eggsy, a two-bit criminal, and his Kingsman Mentor Harry Hart (Colin Firth in one of his best roles ever) who must stop the sadistic Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson doing his best impression of a Bond villain) from destroying the world. Where do I begin with this film. the action is stellar, well-shot, and violently brutal. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline straight to heart during these scenes. There is an action scene about halfway through, in a church, that ranks as one of my favorite actions scenes of all time. The script is witty and self- aware by making fun of Spy-film tropes while also using them in a new and interesting way. There are some genuinely shocking scenes that I did not see coming which made me respect Vaughn and the film even more. Kingsman earns everything from the audience and doesn't take short-cuts in character development or plot. this is a raucously entertaining time at the theater which demonstrates that going to the movies doesn't always need to be a serious affair. While I adore Kingsman, I can't overlook it's problems. The CGI can be spotty, the pacing can be uneven, and some character arcs end without any resolution. These are the only problems I could muster from this excellent Matthew Vaughn film. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a thrill ride from start to finish that had me emotionally invested and left me with a huge smile on my face at the closing credits! I give Kingsman an #9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: What a disservice.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a little concerned. To say the least, I am concerned.Kingsman delights in portraying itself as an over the top parody of James Bond movies. Well, that's the cop-out answer anyway, because it keeps telling us it's different. "It's not that kind of movie." Well, is it supposed to be a better kind of action movie then? Let's take a look at the irony: It's not okay to kill dogs, but people who you deem as ignorant and evil? Totally okay. Dogs are after all innocent, fluffy creatures. People are clearly not. That's why the famous church scene plays out like a music video to a rock song. Heck yes to mass murder as long as those people don't agree with you or your vision of what is right and wrong. Sound familiar? Crack open any history book and figure it out if it's not evident yet.Repeated twists and turns. Classic "waiting until the last second for things to work out" that is typical of each action movie. Talk about hilariously ironic, but wait. It gets worse.A gentleman has manners, Colin Firth? You don't say! Dressing a wolf in sheep's clothes doesn't change who he is. By he, I mean Eggsy. Cursing every other sentence and only thinking about collecting his "reward" at the end is apparently what new generations of gentlemen do.So, what was his award you might ask? Ever played Super Mario Brothers? What's the point of playing to the end of the dungeons? The princess, of course! Women are a complete mess in this film: from the mother who gets abused to the Swedish princess who refuses to go along with the villain offering herself on a platter to the hero to the only woman Kingsman on screen who is instrumental to the hero's success (ahem: correction, GIRL, because men can be referred to as gentlemen repeatedly, but what does she get called? "Good girl!" And I know you know the term lady because you mention it earlier, Eggsy. Don't play daft.). Oh, but lighten up! It was only a comedy! I'm sorry if I want women to not play silly damsels in distress. I'm sorry if I want consistent character development for women. I'm sorry if I want anything BETTER for my gender. I should know by now I shouldn't expect anything better from Hollywood, but I sure as hell don't have to take it standing down.At the end of the movie, I feel like Valentine had proved his point about human beings. If that isn't scary, I don't know what is.Parody? Satire? Hardly. It's the same old Hollywood wolf dressed up in sheep's clothes. For shame. For shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My subject heading is a little bit sexist. Women could easily enjoy this film too of course. I love action films but my heart lies in those unique, adult oriented, non-stop thrill rides that you rarely see anymore. I thought Kingsman looked interesting and I kept putting off seeing it because it wasn't at the top of my list but I kept hearing about how good it was so I finally got in to see it! Thee best movie I have seen in MONTHS maybe in a year or more. It is easily the best movie of the year thus far and I guarantee will land on my best of 2015 list. If you love action, spy, comedy, British humour and literally the most brilliant satire I have seen in years then here it is. Kingsman is brutally violent, stunningly action packed and full of the most bizarre humour and campy scenes that you simply don't expect. I have no doubt there are a lot of people that simply won't get the satire or spoof qualities because we are so used to the brain numbing spoof films like Scary Movie etc. Kingsman features one of the greatest scenes in action film history (the Church scene with Colin Firth) and while it channels something like Kill Bill, it stands alone on its own merits and I hope and pray we see more from this as a franchise.Colin Firth is an A-List actor but for me he's always been sort of just there. He was terrific in The King's Speech and he's been good in other things but he's never floored me by any means...until now. He is absolutely riveting as superspy Harry Hart. He kicks some serious a$$ and literally proved he has serious chops in the action genre. Taron Egerton is fairly new to the big screen but he really nails this part. I wouldn't even necessarily say he leads the cast because he is almost second to Firth but you can see him rising up and taking the lead in this series. Egerton still plays the role very well as a street smart, trouble maker with exception skills. This kid is definitely going to be one to watch in Hollywood. Samuel L Jackson is our villain Valentine. Now I am sort of to the point now where I am almost tired of seeing Jackson show up in literally everything. He is a terrific actor with a lot of charisma but he is really pushing the too much of a good thing envelope. So I sighed a little when I realized he was the villain. Guess what? I was wrong. He is absolutely perfect. Not only does he spoof every great Bond villain with style and look and that ridiculous lisp but he has some incredible one liners and is a great adversary for our heroes. Another terrific thing about the film is the supporting cast. Michael Caine is amazing, Mark Strong (I could watch a whole film on his character alone!), Jonno Davies, Mark Hamill, Velibor Topic, and Sofia Boutella (in a ridiculous and yet amazing henchman role.) There are also some underused characters that I hope they bring back in future sequels.For the most part director Matthew Vaughan has really impressed as a director. There is only one film of his I haven't seen and I think he has terrific vision when it comes to mainstream action flicks. He makes everything seem extravagant and over the top and just fun to watch. I feel like he really showcases his talent here for story telling and cinematography and just imagination to the utmost. Kingsman is insanely fun and actually very intelligent to boot. This is the action film I've been waiting to see for ages and I will absolutely add it to my collection and look forward to seeing it again! Kingsman is a blast!! Bravo to all involved 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is a nod to the old spy thrillers, with its crazy gadgets, beautiful women, crazy bad guys... but turning it on its head in the best way possible. I simply could not take my eyes off the screen. First we get some back story, a brief introduction to the Kingsman and how they kick-ass while wearing a suit (totally useless in real life fights, with all ties that can be pulled and pants that prevent any high kicking, but extremely awesome in movie fights). Than we meet Eggsy, a down on his luck kid that shows a hidden potential, and how he wants to turn his life around. He gets chosen and bam! Training. I just love training scenes. From Jackie Chan doing sit-ups upside down or Luke carrying Yoda (Mark Hamill is on this movie), give a few good training scenes and I know the master is a bad-ass and the student will become a bad-ass.This film wouldn't work if we didn't connect with Eggsy, but Taron Egerton does a fine job. Not only him, but Colin Firth is great as the "Mr. Miyagi". I've never seen him as an action hero, but he takes part in the best fight scenes in recent memory. Part of the credit though goes to Matthew Vaughn and his great directing. The way he plays with the camera, not using all that "shaky cam" that is all the rage these days, but actually immersing the audience and showing the important parts makes the punches all the more enjoyable. Also, Kudos for Samuel L. Jackson for the role of the megalomaniac villain, and all the supporting cast like Mark Strong.And last, but not least, the story is amazing. The script is simple in the beginning, with the underdog story we all know and love. There is nothing wrong with going for the known archetypes, you just have to do it well. And this movie nails it, while also creating something new. The ending of this movie is just delightfully surprising. A great way of twisting the spy genre. All in all, a great movie experience. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for pure entertainment, action, laughs and Colin Firth obliterating bad guys then this is the film for you! Before I saw this film I was expecting a mickey take of Bond and other films of that genre. Kingsman is so much more. The Secret Service is surprisingly funny as it is brutal. Director Matthew Vaughn has achieved a masterpiece here and perfectly weaves thrills and spills with a bundle of laughs that will leave you craving more. The action sequences are superb and puts Bond to shame. Moving at a hurtling speed to rival Bolt, boredom is not possible. The acting is of a top notch standard. Colin Firth and Mark Strong as usual do not disappoint and newcomer Taron Egerton will no doubt follow in the footsteps of Taylor-Johnson, from Kickass, to stardom. Samuel L. Jackson is simply hilarious as the McDonald's loving, lisp afflicted billionaire madman who perfectly fills the shoes of the 'bad guy'.Classy will certainly be the new cool as youngsters abandon their snapback's and sweatpants and head straight for Saville Row. No more 'swag'. The bespoke suit is back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sporadically entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Mark Millar's body of work. I loved The Ultimates 1 &amp; 2, Civil War, Wanted, Kick-Ass, and Nemesis. I never really read of Kingsman, nor did I hear about it until I saw the first trailer.With that being said this film was okay, decent fun. I didn't particularly find the beginning interesting, despite some stylish opening credits. I found that the film really took its time to get started and it took too long to get everything set up. But there are a lot of moments that really kept me involved. In particular Samuel L. Jackson as Richmond Valentine and Colin Firth as Harry Hart/Galahad. Firth kept me emotionally involved in the film as his character bonds with Taron Egerton's Gary "Eggsy" Unwin. Not to mention he is a complete badass. As for Jackson, he surprised me the most. When I first heard about the casting of Samuel L. Jackson, I thought putting him within this cast felt a little force, and I thought this was going to be another "typical Samuel L. Jackson performance." But to my surprise he was very intriguing to watch. He was a clam, sensitive, and for a lack of a better word, a soft villain, but with an ultimate goal. His character also had a lisp and a swagger to him that was a charm to watch on screen. Taron Egerton is pretty good here too. He's got chops to hold his own against Firth, Jackson, Strong, and even Michael Cain, who has a small role. His comedic timing is very spot on and has some humorous dialog. He was very good in the role, but he doesn't shine until the last act of the film. Here is where he shows that he's a very capable action star, something director Matthew Vaughn is very capable of showcasing, i.e. Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass). He also shares a nice, but kinda useless friendship/romance banter with Roxy portrayed by Sophie Cookson. Mark Strong as Merlin is also great here too. This film also shows off that Matthew Vaughn flare. The action sequences are fantastic and well shot. There is one particular scene in the church that may turn some people off, but one can't deny that it was pulled off with style. At times the film can be hard to follow. I finally understood Valentine's motive and plan in-between the middle and final act, and some bland and boring spots here in there. But Kingsman is very self-aware of other spy movie clichés, filled with stylish action, solid performances and a decent amount of laughs that will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag of Tricks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's just a British rehash of XXX (or any other 007 ripoff / parody). On the other hand, there are a few scenes in it that truly tread the waters of cult classic (the fantastic church massacre being one of them). Too bad these scenes are floating around in an overly long, sometimes dull spy caper with an identity crisis. It doesn't know if it wants to be serious or if it wants to be funny, and the result is that it ends up being neither. Samuel L. Jackson gives the worst performance of his career as the villain, doing a horrible Flava Flav (with a lisp) impersonation, with an implausible evil plot to destroy the human population that world leaders are going along with for no logical reason whatsoever. And his side-kick with the knives for legs; well, if you've seen the previews you've already seen that so it's no great surprise and there isn't any more Robert Rodriguez shtick other than that in case you were wondering. It's like they took Divergent or any number of teeny bopper films and put it in an R-rated bag full of James Bond and tossed in a few Tarantino spices and shook it up and tossed it out hoping what came out was a great film. What came out was not a bad film. I watched it from beginning to end and forgave it for the cheesy special effects. But it's something you'll probably want to wait to watch on your home entertainment system, because I didn't feel it was worth the $12.50 I paid to see it. And, no, it's not ultra violent at all. The violence is very cartoonish and the blood is computer generated so, eh, I wasn't really impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent attempt at updating classic Bond tropes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into Kingsman without any knowledge of this movie other than having seen the trailer once and knowing it was leaning towards the corny and cheesy character of the classic Bond movies. A concept that has been tried many times before, but even when done bad still results in pretty fun to watch movies.Kingsman does many things better than Bond spoofs like Austin Powers or the abysmal Johnny English and a large part of that is due to the actors used in this movie. Jackson and Firth play their roles like they should with Jackson being quite hilarious. The main 'teen' actors aren't annoying as well, which was a big relief. Storywise this movie makes as little sense as the more out-there Bond movies. To be honest: I already forgot its plot mostly. Not that it matters: its simply a vehicle for a few pretty big action scenes. One of which, in a church, is quite spectacular. When it comes down to it however, Kingsman doesn't quite offer the thrill of a Bond movie. Worse is the fact that at one point it becomes too reliant (and too self aware) of it's Bond inspiration. To the point of a cringe-worthy joke that involves Bond, Bourne and Bauer being mentioned explicitly. This over abundance of Bond related themes and jokes isn't Kingsman's biggest flaw though. As spectacular and brutal as some action scenes are, they are sometimes nauseating to watch do to annoying camera work and some of the worst CGI I've seen in a major cinema movie in a long time. We rightfully criticize The Hobbit for this, but Kingsman is an even worse offender of bad CGI usage. This more than often gives the brutal action a bit too much of a cartoony, very 'Kick-Ass' feel. It could've been cartoony-Expendable-esque action, instead its Tom and Jerry with blood and bad effects. That's not saying there are no fun moments in this movie. There are quite a few. Taken as a whole however, this movie just didn't deliver. Nor does it proof the classic-Bond formula still works. It's Kick-Ass influences and over the top humor make it a thing of its own; gadgets and women or not. It's simply a high paced, bit too self aware and slapstick-humor variation of some classic spie movie tropes.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brash, inventive and highly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After successfully dipping his toe in mainstream-friendly fare with X-Men: First Class, exuberant filmmaker Matthew Vaughn returns to non-PC mode with a subversive and sardonic flick that does for the spy genre what Kick-Ass did for the superhero genre. Attempting to deliver a genuinely great espionage flick whilst simultaneously parodying the genre it belongs to, the key to victory for Kingsman is its impeccable balancing of tones. Although Vaughn's arrogant gusto ? displayed from the opening shot as we zoom up to an exploding Middle Eastern mansion ? is a major contributor to the high level of entertainment on offer, the praise must be shared with regular screen writing collaborator Jane Goldman. The pair not only dish up witty, foul-mouthed banter and regular, cheeky movie references, but they also unleash gleefully irreverent commentary on subjects ranging from Westboro Church-style religious extremism to the ridiculous behaviour of the one-percenters. Even the action is hilarious. Vaughn designs his set pieces with equal parts flair and brutality; the violence is cartoonish yet graphic, the choreography is over-the-top yet exhilarating and a church-set rampage is one of the most downright awesome action sequences of recent times. The contrasts don't stop there either. Colin Firth is calm, cool and collected as gentleman spy Harry Hart and Mark Strong is unflappably controlled as fellow agent Merlin, whilst at the other end of the spectrum British youngster Taron Egerton is brash and self-assured as Firth's apprentice Eggsy and Samuel L. Jackson is in colourful lampooning form as megalomaniac Valentine. There are a few flaws that will irk those who don't appreciate Vaughn's cocksure direction, but with such inventive ultra-violent action, a rip-roaring soundtrack and adult humour aplenty, Kingsman is a big-screen delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Fun, A Reinvention Of The Spy Film Game For A Modern Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the comic, I will say this, Kingsman actually manages to trump it's source material in many ways. Taking what we know about Spy films: the gadgets, the villain, the prestige, even the action, Kingsman gives us street level flair here by essentially reinventing the Bond formula and kicking it in the teeth. It's an exciting, action packed, and fun film that conforms to Matthew Vaughn's stylish take on the comic book film. Eggsy is a smart, talented young man living with his mom and her boyfriend in London with a penchant for trouble. With his dad having died when he was a child, Eggsy has lived a rough life dodging the law and local thugs. But when an old associate of his father's enters his life, he's given the opportunity to put his talents to good use and become part of an elite group of spies. What a blast. From beginning to end, this movie is entertaining. And this is mostly thanks to the actors rounded up here. Colin Firth brings his usual wonderful skills as an actor, but it's his combat skills that make him so entertaining. Essentially the old fashioned James Bond of the film, Firth is as suave as ever, but he also commits violence that goes unparalleled in the film. This is most demonstrated in one of the film's biggest set pieces, taking place at a southern church which was briefly shown in the trailer. He steals the show, but the surrounding performances are just as great. Taron Egerton, a stranger to the States, is excellent as Eggsy. While this could have been a character who came off as thuggish and criminal, Eggsy is actually quite sympathetic from early in the film. He's clearly smart and a guy who wants to protect his mom and see her have a better life. However, like so many these days, he feels burdened by his lot in life and it has turned him into a less than stellar citizen. His transformation from a troubled kid to a master spy is incredibly entertaining and combines the charm and sophistication of the typical spy film with the rough edge of a street level action film. Sam Jackson brings the ham as an unusual villain, Mark Strong plays one of the most entertaining characters in the film as the youngsters spy trainer, and Michael Caine appears as the head of Kingsman, bringing his usual mix of seasoned professionalism and sense of fun.As for the film itself, Matthew Vaughn does as good a job here as his previous comic book adaptations. He continues to demonstrate how to make a film fun, exciting, and hip without it being overly cheesy or appear to be trying too hard. He seems almost a perfect match up for Mark Millar's work, as he is able to almost perfectly convey Millar's mixture of rough edge, sense of fun, and intriguing bend of known tropes. In terms of breaking down a genre, this is similar to Kick Ass in that sense. The action is as superb as you would expect and we're always allowed to see it, with a lack of dizzying close ups and shaky cam, which is thankful. The climax is especially rousing and exciting, with plenty of varied action bits, from gun fights to a dual between Sofia Boutella's deadly, prosthetic leg wearing assassin and Eggsy. It's something of a surprise to find this film playing in a month usually reserved for films studios have little faith in. This is summer blockbuster material and fantastic entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, not too over the top but a bit jumpy and slightly predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down in the cinema and the opening credits ran I thought that this could probably be the best film that I have seen in a while because it has a plot twist, both the grenade scene and the initial meeting of Valentine. This made me think that the producers had finally made a film that I couldn't predict every twist and turn of the plot. My initial view of Valentine was that he was a very funny character with his list and accent being a complete contrast from other character that Samuel plays. I also thought the transition of spies and killing to the story of 'Eggsy'. I also enjoyed the back story of Eggsy and how he grew up to be a funny character that I would defiantly enjoy being. However, I thought the way that Eggsy got in touch with the Kingsman was very predictable but the fight scene with Colin Firth was probable the best fight scene I had scene I a long time.I also thought that the scenes where it jumps from Valentine to Eggsy's training was too short for each scene. The middle of the film was good when I showed how all the characters where either training to become agents or fighting back against Valentines evil plan. In my opinion the McDonald's happy meal meal was funny as it was a good contrast from rich and posh to 'normal' life. Moving on, I thought the fight scene before Colin Firths death was very well planed ad extremely well executed as it flowed from killing person to person. I was very impressed when the producers killed off Galahad without a long dragged out death scene. I enjoyed the constant references to spy books. I thought the way that all the characters reacted the Colin's death was very believable and emotion full.I thought the was that way people fought after the satellites had been linked along with the cheesy music was a very good combination. It was easily predictable that Eggsy would fight Gazelle but the outcome was very exciting and good to watch. I liked the way that Eggsy killed Valentine was very constructive and showed that your own partner can 'back stab' you at any time. I thought the final scene with princess was a god twist as I personally thought that Eggsy would become a couple with Roxy. Overall I thought that the producers thought very carefully with how each scene flowed together and the fight scenes were very well choreographed. Even though some scenes were quite predictable I thought that the combination of the producers trying not to hard to be funny but still being funny and the fluidity was good. I would rate it 9 out of 10 because of its type of comedy and laugh out loud effect but the predictability let it down slightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The catchphrase of this movie was "it's not that kind of a movie" (like James Bond or any other type of spy movies).Well, folks, this is just that kind of movie. An every day regular spy movie, with poor plot and mere script. Villain that want's to change the world and some kid, who didn't go any training referring to hand to hand combat, nor shooting, but goes all Neo in the end.One thing that I liked was fight scenes, well staged, paced and executed fight scenes. But there's like 3 of those. In 2 hour movie, there's only 10 minutes of entertaining and something worth watching.If you like spy movies like Mission Impossible and you're 10 yr old - you arrived to the right place, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers!Although the setup of the movie was promising as a gentleman spy theme, the execution is a sub-par movie experience. There is nothing in this movie that hasn't already been seen elsewhere, time and time again.No surprises nor innovation what so ever. Only clichés. Nothing in this production feels fresh and/or interesting unfortunately.A stale, old-fashioned, testosterone infused, sexist, juvenile glorification of violence. Yaaaawn! Pretty cringe-worthy.Although 13 year old pubescent boys are probably the aimed target for this, so I won't be surprised if this film will work just fine at the cinemas. Plot line: Kid with poor background excels against all odds (and posh breed competition) in training to be a secret agent. When sh*t hits the fan, obviously everyone else fails or dies and the guy gets to be the hero and save the world from a rich, evil "madman".</fullReview>

But, while even the reason for the secret service by super well dressed guys is not formed profoundly, the basic story of this movie is another boring repeated one. For marketing, movie producers do and have to do many things. However, advertising the movie with Savil Row scenes is too cheap. I feel rather sorry for Firth's action showing a persona of 'Single Man' + very light version of James Bond that may hurt his quality greatly displayed in 'The King's Speech'.</fullReview>

Funny, clever and harmless not too serious. It is not a perfect movie. Some of the scenes are too extravagant to take seriously and I hope that if there will be sequels script writers remember this. It is a eventful and funny but not very original. Harmless entertainment that works surprisingly well if you don't care too much some of the clichés.

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin(Taron Egerton). Eggsy is an unrefined but gifted street kid with a lot of potential. However, Eggsy uses his intelligence &amp; talents to get himself into sticky situations. A spy named Harry Hart/Galahad(Colin Firth) who is part of a secret spy organization, sees Eggsy's potential &amp; recruits him into the organization's cutthroat training program to become the next Kingsman. Meanwhile, a tech genius named Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson), has twisted plans that could put the whole world in serious danger. Kingsman: The Secret Service is an outstanding &amp; flawless film. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie, in quite some time. This movie is full of action, witty one-liners &amp; is also thrilling &amp; suspenseful. Kingsman also has numerous memorable quotes like, "This is not that kind of movie, bruv". Basically, this movie is a complete package. The action sequences are intense, realistic, slick &amp; stylish. This movie has tons of violence &amp; gore &amp; is not meant for the faint of heart &amp; people who get squeamish at the sight of blood. There is one set piece in the movie that is out of this world! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Matthew Vaughn has outdone himself. Kingsman: The Secret Service is better than Kick-Ass &amp; is on par with X-Men: First Class. A note on the performances. Colin Firth is spectacular as Harry Hart/Galahad. Firth shines in his first major action role. Taron Egerton is brilliant as Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin. Egerton is extremely likable as the unorthodox lead of the film. Samuel L. Jackson is hysterical as Valentine. Jackson's antagonist is one of a kind &amp; beats several Bond villains. Mark Strong is brilliant as Merlin. Michael Caine is great as Arthur. Sophie Cookson is good as Roxy. Sofia Boutella is impressive as Gazelle. The supporting characters are amazing too. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a must watch, especially for action-comedy &amp; spy movie buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I went in expecting a James Bond ripoff, I left wanting a sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to create an action movie based on big guns, big men screaming, and big name actors. Not this movie. This movie had a style all of its own. It was fresh, fun, and exhilarating. Something that this movie does differently than other action films is actually use the camera in its advantage. Instead of having the camera be something to put on a tripod while waiting for the special effects to happen, the camera is used to portray fluid motion. You can see every punch, gunshot, and stab easily; and the camera compliments them perfectly. If I were to complain about something, it would be the characters. I feel that the characters weren't anything special, and they all seemed to be the same person played by a different actor. However, that doesn't necessarily matter, for what they lack in characters, they succeed in a surprisingly interesting story. The antagonist wasn't the run-of-the-mill mad man who wants to take over the world: the antagonist had solid reasons for what he's doing, and the film explains it fairly well.Essentially, this was a very fun movie, and I highly suggest it if you're in the mood for a brand new type of action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Do you like thpy movieth?" lisps Samuel L Jackson's megalomaniac Valentine, to Colin Firths suited and booted (Oxfords, preferably) Harry Hart. "I find them all a little dramatic for my liking" he croons in the most perfect British accent, "give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day". This one sentence explains everything you need to know about Kingsman; a gloriously over the top tribute, that takes huge risks due to its audacious attitude, and thankfully the risks pay off. From the director who made an 13 year old girl say THAT word in Kick Ass, it's not surprising that Kingsman is just as foul-mouthed and ultra-violent. With Vaughn's signature style of a comic book look and feel, he cranks up the coolness factor and puts you right in the middle of the action from start to finish. Vaughn directs with such enthusiasm and skill, it's hard not to love anything he does. Colin Firth is superb as the well groomed but deadly Harry Hart. He sheds his stiff, British exterior and embraces his new role, clearly having the time of his life. Firth's chemistry with Egerton is that of a father/son relationship and is truly lovely to watch. Taron Egerton is absolutely brilliant as the teen hooligan Eggsy. With his cheeky accent and potty mouth, he's perfectly cast and cements himself as a promising newcomer of 2015. Kingsman not only looks good, but is hugely entertaining, stylishly written, obscenely filthy, extremely funny and brilliantly British.Please vote for me (Jordan Thornell) in Vue Cinema's film critic comp on their website!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i have seen the full movie i felt a slight childish motive behind it. You know kid spy movie and all. Then i looked at the cast and thought what can go wrong. Nothing went wrong. First of all this movie kinda proves you can do action scenes/movies without exploding everything and anything. Second of all plot of the movie is extremely tasty. It is not like your original bad guy is trying to do evil with evil means. Samuel Jackson's bad guy gives you mixed feelings. It is like you love to hate him or hate to love him kinda situation. Movie shows extremely diplomatic action on hand like dinner table conversations and convincing people are worth more than removing them from the game. My other compliment is for Mark Strong fans. We all seen him as convincing voiced bad guy but Mark Strong keeps rising from that streotype to charming mentor/voice of guiandince all the time. As for action scenes, man i haven't had fun since my early childhood Jackie Chan movie this much. Well coordinated little absurd also you gotta love the songs running on the background. All actors executed their roles superbly even though in some scenes you can feel they are not really into it.This movie in not a generic spy movie. Yes we get that fancy futuristic toys/tech impossible moves and all but this movie is simply showing us hope. Hope that movie industry can evolve and hope that someday our kids gonna have a tasteful movies to watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Matthew Vaughn directs yet another action comic book movie (following 'KICK-ASS' and 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'), which is again adapted from material written by Mark Millar (the creator of the 'Kick-Ass' comics; as well as other popular titles like 'Wanted', 'Civil War' and 'The Ultimates'). It was written by Vaughn and his usual writing partner Jane Goldman. It stars Colin Firth as a highly skilled secret agent who recruits a street-smart young man into an elite secret agency force. They must do battle with a brilliant billionaire eco-terrorist, played by Samuel L. Jackson. The movie also costars Taron Egerton, Mark Strong, Sophie Cookson, Sofia Boutella, Mark Hamill, Jack Davenport and Michael Caine. Fans of Vaughn and Miller won't be disappointed.The Kingsmen are a special spy organization, in London, that recently lost one of their best agents. They begin a very tough, and highly competitive, recruitment process; to find his replacement. Agent Galahad (Firth) decides to give a young street-smart criminal a chance, named Eggsy (Egerton). Eggsy is the son of an old Kingsmen agent, who was killed on an assignment, with Galahad, in the Middle East; 17 years earlier. Galahad made a promise to help out the deceased agent's family. The agency is also preparing for a dangerous mission; to do battle with a rich tech genius, named Valentine (Jackson), who's threatening to kill millions in an insane population control plan.The movie is everything I expected it to be; it's full of witty characters, spouting off clever dialogue, in cool and very stylistic action scenes. It's also got a lot of excessive, and very over-the- top, violence and it's even more gory than Vaughn's, and Miller's, own ultra-violent 'KICK-ASS' films (I'd say). Firth is great in the movie and it's also a pretty funny British spy spoof too. The only real flaw (I can see), in the film, is that the main young hero isn't that likable; sure he's relatable, and a believable British punk, but he doesn't have a heck of a lot of character or charm. Firth make's up for what Egerton's character is lacking though and it's still a pretty awesome action flick; as a whole. I'm sure it'll become another beloved cult classic, for Matthew Vaughn and Mark Miller lovers!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/yW1G90SYF_o</fullReview>

		<fullReview>warning ("spoiler alert" which actually isn't a spoiler but i am just doing this so I wont get black listed!!!!!)now to start off, What I love about this movie is that it skewers conventional thinking in almost every aspect of the film, and does not just skewer it, but it unleashes an entire swath of "that could be possible" type stuff into the films very amazing plot.(warning!!! warning!!! not so much a spoiler alert ahead!)while most people usually find it offensive to kill a head of state, I find it refreshing to see directors who aren't afraid to (go there) sort of speak, but trust me... it goes there pretty well! wink" wink"the movie itself is filled with an elaborate (but easy to follow) story-line, with uncanny plot twists, and unexpected you kinda understand but kinda hate him bad guys. kinsmen will remain in my heart one of the best (and most unapologetic) spy films I have ever seen. (just a heads up!) if you are in any ways biased towards politics of conservative, liberal, progressive, green, republican, or any kind of "ends justify the means" Marxist kinda politics, this movie isn't for you. so my word of advice is to pretend for about 2 hours that your not associated with any politics what so ever and enjoy the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Comic Book Movie We Didn't Know We Needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the age of Madmen fandom, James Bond and Dos Equis, Kingsman is the comic book movie we didn't know we were waiting for. This movie breeds grins start to finish. It's exciting, funny, clever, witty and fun as shite. It's a James Bond satire with comic book flair and an overwhelming amount of British hooliganism that made us love flicks like "Attack the Block." This movie is near perfect and I can't stress enough how much you'll love a mashing of spy movie, comic book movie, camp movie, Tarantinoishness, zombie movie (hello, church scene) and flat out action. I wish this came out 10 years ago... not bc I've waited to long, but so my crush on Eggsy would be more appropriate...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manners maketh a man. Gentlemen are always in demand in society, the same way gentlemen spy are in demand for action movie lovers. Inspired by 007, this group of people have set an impeccable standard and taste for foiling plots, saving the world and of course, the state-of-the-art......................suits. (You thought I was gonna say gadgets, didn't you. Ya that too.)First off, let me start with a statutory warning. This genre is not Oscar material nor it is to satisfy everyone's taste bud. If this movie's trailer made you feel weird, it's best if you stay with the Oscar-worthy movies (No offense).Kingsman:The Secret Service ,as the name goes, is a secret organization (not related to any governments) that does what it does best. When a top agent's guilt makes him recruit a hot-head youngster, things get interesting. Meanwhile evil draws a projectile which brings Kingsman into the play.The cast has brought a lot of variety into the movie. Colin Firth (yes, the King from King's Speech) pumps the screen with adrenaline, which is actually unlike him, but enjoyable none-the-less. Michael Caine does what he always does. Samuel Jackson is the icing on cake, with his short-tongued English and allergy to the sight of blood (yes, a villain who can't stand blood) is a fun to watch, right till the end.Michael Caine's lack of character usage is felt , not while watching, but while post-morteming it. Mark Strong is another strong presence.When a middle-eastern-fort starts blowing, the bricks fall down and forms the words of "20th-century-fox", it's clear that the movie is all about fun, despite the guns and bloods. The beauty of the movie is that it doesn't try to be something else. It sticks with the fun till the end. An Ex. Sam Jackson shoots a man and starts walking away because he can't stand blood. He, then asks his assistant. Jackson: Is he dead? Assistant: That's what happens when you shoot someone in the head. Feels good, doesn't it. Jackson : No it's feels f**king awful.Sarcastic humors is sprinkled all over. A dog with the name J.B (which Michael Caine abbreviates as James Bond, Jason Bourne), an almost direct reference to Obama, sarcasm on Newspapers too (Look out for the paper cutting on the wall with headlines "Brad Pitt ate my sandwich").Bullets, guns, blood dominate the screen which gets gory at times. So, fair warning. This isn't a "Wanted" style action movie nor is it Jackie Chan styled. It's somewhere in the middle but makes a mark of its own.You are bound to enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The recipe for movie success; Take 1 part Ipcress File, 1 part Austin Powers, a dollop of Bond -- the Pierce Brosnan Bond, and a smidgeon of Charade; then blend, fold, and spindle in equal parts of The Manchurian Candidate and Arabesque. Cook over high heat for 2 1/2 hours, and watch your audiences come back for a second viewing. Make the villain a science fiction, black computer nerd billionaire -- a grown-up Urkel/Blankman if you will -- for the icing on the cake. Kingsman pushes all the right buttons for aficionados of 60s action/spy thrillers with all the up- to-date hilarity of Austin Powers. There's never a dull moment here.This amazing film moves with the pacing of a Bond flick, and not without good reason. Political correctness spells doom for the Bond franchise as we know it, so this will be a series that can be milked for at least 20 sequels, and I will be sure to watch all of them. Even the product placements were funny. It's OK to laugh out loud at Kingsman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spy action movie for a new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>29 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Kingsman: The Secret Service. This film looked good right from the very first trailer. Very much a James Bond parody but up to date and obviously much younger, the character of Eggsy portrayed in this film is recruited, by a senior Kingsman Agent (Colin Firth) to take the place of a recently deceased colleague. Along with a whole group of other trainee agent Eggsy must battle to prove his worth and become the newest agent. With Samuel L Jackson playing the maniacal baddie, we see a standard good guy, bad guy action movie with quite a few laughs thrown in for good measure. There are some excellent fight scenes and a splendid musical spectacular which completely stole the show. It's refreshing to see a good well written plot combining new gags, up to date technology, reference to established genres and not forgetting Colin Firth in a most splendid British stiff upper lip action role. I hope this is the first of a series of these films. Highly recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not disappoint. Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, I mean seriously,how could you not have a good time in the cinemas watching this! The plot,although it had it's flaws,kept you entertained. Also,Taron Egerton delivered a great performance.The movie is based upon a comic book series,and although it is a comic book based filmed,the action may seem over the top at points. Especially the church scene. Sometimes this "over the top action" movies are entertaining to watch,but this movie,in my opinion went to over the top. For instance,as I mentioned before,the church scene. It was not a necessary scene. Sure it was fun to see Colin Firth kick butt,but it didn't need to be as detailed and graphic as it was. But,this scene did not ruin the movie. Samuel L. Jackson played his role perfectly. I promise you,they could not have found a more perfect actor to play this role. He was funny and delivered a great performance. Colin Firth,as always,was great. Taron Egerton always had a great performance. It's always good to see some young good actors with potential. All in all,this film was a great movie,great action,and great acting. I highly recommend this film to fans of Matthew Vaughen's past films. It definitely is a fun movie movie to watch at the cinemas with a box of popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why are people calling this VIOLENT ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The "violence" is only the same type of sterilised faux violence that you find in Bond movies but just more of it. It,s very well done and I, personally find gratuitous violence in films so unnecessary, there are so many ways that film-makers can portray violence without actually showing it in graphic detail. A great film, it out bonded Bond by a long way. I don't want to go into the usual over the top orgasmic reviews, some of you should certainly get out more. I cant find much to criticise, the plot of course, is as usual for the genre, totally implausible with more holes than a colander full of colanders, but ..............that is par for the course. Plausible plots in spy films haven't risen their heads since Harry Palmer and too much reality in films is hardly ever good for the box office.</fullReview>

There is violence but it is comic not Quentin gross. The good thing is the sense of humor that stays throughout the movie. The gadgets are inventive. There is a variety of settings and scenarios that keeps it interesting.Taron Egerton in the lead role is likable and his cockney accent is understandable. Unlike some of recent British comic action movies in the past like the Guy Ritchie movies, all the accents are quite easy to make out thank goodness. Good supporting actors with Mark Strong, Michael Caine and as well cast Colin Firth as a mentor. He is best in these kind of supporting roles. Samuel L Jackson plays the villain with a lisp.Definitely worth a watch - especially for those who aren't watching 50 Shades this President's Day weekend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devastating Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn is someone who clearly enjoys his work and you can see that in every inch of Kingsman: The Secret Service. This is a movie where you can see that entertainment and fun was always put ahead of everything else and as one would assume, this resulted in a film that is both entertaining and fun in a way that many action films don't seem to want to be anymore.One thing that is quite refreshing is how this film never tries to be anything deeper than an action film. Earlier last year I saw The Raid 2 and although that film is far superior to this one it was somewhat irritating when it tried to be a much deeper tale that it was, an element which Kingsman doesn't suffer from. And a predominant chunk of the film's quality comes from how electrifying and ridiculous the film's action sequences are. The camera has incredible pace and Vaughn had the intelligence to maintain single, long, violently energetic shots during the most engrossing action scenes. And it can't be said enough how cool it is to see the cultured and clean Colin Firth beat the sh*t out of people.What makes the tone of the film so memorable is the constant knowledge that the film really doesn't give a crap about what makes sense or what is reasonable and how much it clearly wants you to know that. Every character in this film it basically a exaggerated caricature and they are all the more hilarious for it. The film embodies how cliché it is and in a way it transcends cliché all together because the audience has the constant knowledge that when something dumb happens, the film is laughing at itself just as much as the audience is.I have to say I was somewhat irritated when I heard people calling this movie 'original' as I feel that that is not only an insult to actually original films but insulting to this film itself. Because the true genius of the film is how much perspective it gives us on the action genre. Modern action movies seem to be trying far to hard to be edgy and what this film recognises is that it is far more important to be entertaining than different. It builds itself on the best clichés that classic action has given us and cranked up the levels of ridiculousness to the point where you can't help but just smile your way through the film. It is so wonderfully giving and un-self- indulgent to it's audience which is why it is such a joy.It is a film that is quite hard to criticise seeing as it already seems to be a sort of semi-parody of itself. I did have some problems with some of the characters specifically the female supporting character. When we are first introduced to her they display her as incredibly composed however in later scenes they make her into an incompetent damsel in distress just so that the male lead could act all heroic and comforting (something that seemed out of character for him as well.)Over all this movie achieves basically everything it set out to do. It's fun and thoroughly worth your time. I would never give it higher than an 8 though because it has no real depth to it at all (which is kind of the point of the movie I guess). Go see it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a spy movie with great action sequences, fair bit of violence, lots of amazing gadgets, a far fetched villain plot and "men in suits" with impeccable manners - In the divine rule book of spy movies, this movie hits all the right chords. And it has a few more things to add as well - such as great humour, parkour and some divergence from general clichés.Honestly, I believe before they release the next bond film, they should sit together and watch this film and learn from it. The recent bond films have all been about action and no gadgets, but they have lost all the fun elements. Kingsman is the new bond and I do hope they bring out a sequel which is as good if not better.Now the bad..... well... I dunno. True its not one of the great films of all time. But it really is fun to watch. So much fun in fact that you will fail to notice any flaws.So go ahead and watch it... NOW!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightfully fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't help but deliver a positive review for this movie. After all, anyone with a sense of humor and an appreciation for R-rated comical violence would enjoy this. Director Matthew Vaughn - although he has few films to his name - shows his creative side with Kingsman. The story walks a fine, fragile line between controversial levels of violence and dark humor. Although Kingsman reaches its hands into both of these cookie jars, it manages to maintain that balance while preserving the story.The screenplay is smartly written, and just creative enough to avoid the mundane features of the action genre. By establishing solid character development in several scenes, the audience is kept in the loop, never being conflicted as to whether or not a scene is meant to shock, humor, or please. Perhaps it is the talented casting of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Mark Strong, and Samuel L. Jackson that makes the "serious" scenes serious. There is enough meaningful dialogue between Eggsy and Colin Firth's character that we find a comfortable area with the progression of the story, and are not at the mercy of mindless violence to hold our attention. Nonetheless, Kingsman offers abundant violence that, had creative and fast cinematography not been utilized, would have been nearly unbearable to watch. Crowd-pleasing, comical violence, and an intriguing premise make this movie a type of cross between any 007 film and Kill Bill. As such, any Quentin Tarantino fan will enjoy this movie for its stylistic scenes of excessive violence. It's not difficult at all to take this movie seriously; it doesn't rely on gore or sex. It's a refreshingly original type of fun, which is something that the action/comedy genre could use more of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many years ago as the James Bond series got more and more imaginative, it began to look more like a comic book. Here some writers took a comic book and very successfully turned it into a screenplay and movie. Heck yes, this should have been done long ago. Heck yes the special effects are enough to make ones head explode. Heck yes, they put a great cast in place to bring it off. Heck yes, it is a kick ass comedy of a spy genre movie.There is too much good stuff to detail here, but the cast is a mix of great older actors and younger ones. It has maybe more stunts than any spy film made prior. It has more jokes than any spy film made prior. More of everything and a heck of a good time. Put your brain into over drive and try to keep up with a movie whose pace starts in over drive and then goes into warp drive. Can it be sequel-ed and made better? Now that would be a challenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie, but a bit over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman is the first of many spy movies coming out this year (Mission Impossible, James Bond etc.) and it is pretty awesome. We have Colin Firth playing a smooth gentleman spy/killer and we've got Samuel L. Jackson playing a hilarious, weird villain. I mean, this is enough reason to go see this right?The story is loosely based on a graphic novel so it's not entirely original, but it is definitely not any Marvel superhero movie. The story and plot are a little different than most movies, but it is still straightforward and fairly easy to understand. It is a really cool concept to; extremely proper, dressed up gentlemen spies/killers going out to stop this maniac of a villain from destroying the world. Speaking of the villain, this guy doesn't always seem like an obvious villain because sometimes you see his point. And he's very funny too; for example how he can't stand the sight of any violence. Kingsman is not only a gory action movie though, it also has plenty of good humor. So basically, the story is very humorous, genius and well paced, while the plot is different but still easy to understand. In the acting category, this movie strives. Colin Firth is awesome and fits his role perfectly. Samuel L. Jackson is also perfect for his role as the villain; he really brings his character across as a hilarious dude, but also an evil maniac. And the main character is played by newcomer, Taron Egerton. Man is he great. He was funny, but also did some great action stunts. Literally, the casting guys on this movie nailed it. I loved the music on this movie as well. It had this really great theme, but in between, it also had some great pop music that really fit well with the action scenes. Now this isn't you're usual pop music that comes on the radio 1,000 times per day. No this is just fun lyric-less pop jams that help give the movie a humorous tone. CGI is another category that was present in this movie. Though a lot was done practically there were some visual effects in here as well. And most of it wasn't bad. But some of it was quite bad. A few of the shots were just so apparent that they were CGI, that it was almost cringe worthy. Other than that, the CGI wasn't bad, but it was far from perfect. Action was a big part of this movie so I will touch on that a little bit. First of all, it was very fun to watch. It was very stylized, with shaky camera movement and slow-mo. There were also a few shots that vaguely resembled some Matrix camera moves, which I loved. I was very pleased with the action and the way it was shot. That being said, this movie was extremely over the top especially the action. Some of it was unrealistically unrealistic. If that makes sense. But I love over the top action so it was great.In the end, Kingsman was a fun spy action/comedy with great acting and a cool story. While some of it was not so great, it still delivered what it was supposed to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-executed, over-the-top action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This easily blends the fast-paced and unbelievable action of a comic book film with the absurd, dry British wit of excellent veteran actor Colin Firth. He is Harry Hart code named Galahad, a member of a secret international espionage and intelligence organization called The Kingsman. He recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young 20 something petty criminal who's the son of a friend that died saving Galahad years before. Eggsy is competing with other young recruits, most of them young people from British aristocratic families, for the spot to become the new Lancelot. At the same time, tech billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson with a strange lisp and Yankees hat) is plotting a dastardly world takeover with comic villain aplomb by kidnapping or recruiting wealthy aristocrats, politicians, and other people with spreading around money and influence to further his plot. A large part of that plot is the global distribution of free WiFi-enabled sim cards.The Kingsman have the unique guise of posing as tailors to Britain and the world's wealthiest and influential people. They operate out of an enormous underground complex based out of an above ground tailor shop. They're independent of normal government oversight and restriction, having operated since the early 20th century shortly after WWI ended. "We are the new knights," is how Galahad explains their mission to Eggsy shortly after his recruitment. Matthew Vaughan and comic book Mark Millar who previously worked together to bring Kick-Ass and Wanted to the big screen, once again collaborate with even better results than these previous films. This is easily Matthew Vaughan's best film since his British gangster film days. What really makes this film work so seamlessly though is the performance of Colin Firth, he's the perfect gentleman spy and he gives a perfect credibility to the all the gadgets, martial arts and intense action scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a surprising, fun, fast-paced and rollicking movie that introduces us to a hitherto unknown spy agency called the Kingsmen. This film embodies -- no, cherishes -- the over-the-top aspects of the 1970s Bond films, i.e. the handsome lady-killer spy, the British gentleman ethos, the deadly gadgets, the nifty lairs, the colourful villains out to destroy the world with grand plots, and so on. The movie doesn't honour this legacy subtly or logically. It does so overtly, camply and with relish. Let's not forget the mind-blowing violence, which -- although extreme -- is implied cartoonish movie violence and not difficult to watch at all. Sizzling Taron Egerton is perfect, as is Colin Firth. Even overexposed Samuel Jackson is watchable here. I'd rate the movie 8.5. Prepare to have a great time! As Valentine says at the end "perfect"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To say Matthew Vaughn has had a rather entertaining film career would be a slight understatement. Shooting to the attention of many after producing Guy Ritchie's, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels in 1998, Vaughn has had a directed a wonderful array of films so far, with Layer Cake, Kick-Ass, and X-Men: First Class, all being particularly brilliant. Now we have Kingsman: The Secret Service, a film so unavoidable, particularly in my local Vue cinema, where trailers have been hyping it extensively for the past month or so, which in my own experience, is a risky business, with this level of hype more than often leading to a rather high expectation level from cinema goers such as myself. So as I walked into an empty, late- night, EXTREME screening of Kingsman, the bar was set reasonably high, probably more so than any other film so far this year. Mission commence...First off, the plot is basically Kick-Ass meets the Bond franchise, with a helping of Johnny English. which on paper, sounds pretty damn fun. To sum Kingsman up in one word however, you do not to need to stray far from the film's choice of music; it's completely bonkers, with it's ultra-violent tendencies, including a wonderful Scanners- esque death scene, and ludicrous plot, albeit stealing riffs from 28 Days Later, Stephen King's Cell, and even Channel 4's wonderful Utopia, making it a highly entertaining couple of hours,.Furthermore, it's clear to see the amount of fun everyone involved in the film were having, particularly Colin Firth who makes the most out of playing the suave, smooth and exquisitely dressed Kingsman agent Harry Hart, perhaps making up for his lost opportunity at playing 007 himself*.Amidst all the fun however, the film does have it's weaknesses. Firstly, it's not as good, or as funny as, Kick-Ass, where comparisons to such are inevitable. In fact, I laughed a lot less than I thought I might, which only results in seeing the flaws within the film much easier, especially in certain scenes when the film is attempting to get a chuckle out of the audience and falls flat on its' face. Secondly, the film is all over the place, and is shot at 100mph, which in an action flick is generally acceptable, yet for some reason, in Kingsman I found it rather annoying, much like I did every Samuel L. Jackson talked (seriously, what was with that strange lisp?). These weaknesses however, are outweighed by the positives, where if for some reason you are looking for a stupid, semi-funny, action spy romp, Kingsman is definitely the film for you. Part Johnny English, part Kick-Ass, Kingsman is pretty much what it says on the tin. Funny? Sort of. Action-packed? Most definitely. Violent? Unbelievably. Until the next time Mr. Vaughn...Overall Score: 7/10* http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/colin- firth-kingsman-the-secret-service-star-on-netflix-bridget-jones-3- and-why-the-james-bond-ship-has-sailed-9991024.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An honest action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is an excellent piece of modern film work. This movie uses the typical mentor/apprentice formula but puts a modern English twist on it. Although very different from Kick-ass (story wise) Matthew Vaughn does use his personalized style of stylized violence and epic explosive scenes. From watching the film it was very clear that this movie was made by the director of Kick ass. Similarly to Kick ass this movie takes a realistic look at an idea and puts it in a comical action movie which works extremely well.In general this film is another look on the gentleman spy concept. The film plays with the idea of two people from different backgrounds united to defeat a common foe. Although I was not a fan of the loss of a main character I can see why this was done however I have no idea if this was included in the original comic that this film was based off.I would rate this film as an eight out of ten because it displays fantastic acting and film work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not know where to begin. This movie was absolutely sh**, scratching out my eyes sh**. It started almost promising with some cool effects and fight scenes, then it introduced the main character this young bad***/cute/hardcore/hip/gangster/hipster boy or man? I don't know what he exactly was suppose to be, but it was confusing as hell. The main villain: Samuel L Jackson was weird, there is not another word for it. He was a mix between mark Zuckerberg and Mike Tyson. He had some catchy one liners which made this movie rise from a 1 to a 2 together with some cool effects but that was about it. The Story, the plot and most of the acting was just horrible. The movie can be described as a mix between recent Teen Adventure/heroes movies such as Hunger Games(which i like) and James Bond directed by a 14 year old boy.That this movie still has a 8.1 Rating is an outrage and an insult to the movies which has the same rating: Kill Bill, Platoon, Hotel Rwanda, Fargo, Sin City etc. I suspect some funky business! Someone has paid 50.000 Indian to rate this 10?</fullReview>

It's exactly what movie hack work is: following some sickening structure, without any real attempt to have the finished product reflect anything original. I was done with this movie when it's attempt to be topical and humorous led to the idea of "negging" peddled by skinny armed limp wrist-ed nerds.They even threw in a dig at James bond as well... as if this should be more innovative or of a higher quality. Everyone involved in whatever this is, even the janitors, should be dragged out of their houses by an angry mob, beaten to death and sentence to be slowly murdered by a firing squad. They should not even be allowed to wear blindfolds.. so they can face their murderers with their legs shaking and urine in their skinny jeans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could have been an engaging cross between James Bond and Marvel comics is marred by misplaced vulgarity, over-the-top gore, and the ineptitude of Samuel L. Jackson. The premise of twenty-somethings vying for a spot in a secret society of British super agents is promising, but the storyline moves disjointedly between comedy/adventure and Pulp Fiction-like violence. Colin Firth shines as the veteran Kingsman, and Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson are fine as Kingsman candidates, but Jackson is a lame villain who doesn't have the charm or acting chops to fill his role. A movie like this needs a Hans Gruber, and Jackson is no Alan Rickman. "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a good idea; with the right script and a compelling villain it could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times when Kingsman is almost a sophisticated The Saint-style thriller. Other times, it's a Bond-style tongue-in-cheek action film. Other times again, it's a Hot Fuzz-style comedy gore fest. And then there are bits when it's more like a comic book action film. By trying to be all of those things (often not very well), it's none of them, and the film fails to create its own distinctive "world" in the way that good films do. The result is a disjointed and strangely unsatisfying film that, to its credit, also has a few quite enjoyable bits along the way.Matthew Vaughn said he wanted to inject a sense of humour back into spy films. If that's the case, he has the sense of humour of an adolescent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most typical Mark Millar/Matthew Vaughn movie you'll ever get. It has the author's same gratuitous violent content, shallowly depicted intriguing themes and outrageous ideas towards various genres, as well as the director's stylized action scenes and trademark visual quirks. It tackles the same personality and ambition from the Kick-Ass movies; it speaks the language of the well- known genre while also mocking the worst of it, yet goes hypocritical about its own opinion. And as always, it still offers their classic pleasure by just being pure silly and violent, but then it doesn't gain anything more than that.Just like what they did to superheroes, The Secret Service both pokes fun and shows its affections to the classic elements of the themed genre. Though, the criticism doesn't go any farther than pointing out its clichés and trend by dialogue. It never really tries to transcend anything or prove to be better than what spy movies have done, the film just feels like expressing those opinions. In spite of that, the plot is outright ridiculous, but for the film, it just loves being dumb at those conceits. The movie is clearly contented at throwing away a bunch of fascinating ideas within this world, even at the training scenes where most of their work don't necessarily applied in their actual mission. While it's fun, it never really outcomes anything more than a zany imagination.However, the pacing feels kind of slower than it deserves. This is the type of film that needs a little more momentum to actually live up to its silliness. Maybe at the action scenes, it did, but most of the film has to settle with many things that don't need much of a heavy breathing. It's still entertaining, the characters are easy enough to root for out of their charm, that a simpler pacing would have make things easier to watch.And there's a huge benefit with its style. Matthew Vaughn only has a single aim in his action scenes and that is to be "Awesome." Even for a sequence that is meant to look terrible and morally ambiguous, the style still manages to gloss it over with cool camera shots and velocity, which strangely happens to be the best action sequence of the bunch. It's kind of difficult to think if this is appropriate, but then this is a property that should never be taken seriously. There is a lot to like in the cast. It's easy to picture Colin Firth as a classy spy, and he does it perfectly, while adding up a sense of gravity in other parts. Eggsy appears as a generic young protagonist, but it's Taron Egerton's charisma is what made this hero shine. Samuel L. Jackson makes for a fun and mostly amusing villain. And there's always a likable presence in Mark Strong.Kingsman: The Secret Service is self-indulgently fun; so self-indulgent, it tends to sacrifice many of its mundane senses. This is one weird, nerdy fantasy that is easy enough to pleasure comicbook or simply dumb action movie fans. It has style, twisted humor and of course, exciting action. There is nothing else beyond that, though. We just encountered an origin story that has the potential for a new big franchise. We can't fault a film for having an utter joy with itself, it just feels sort of empty. It could have been a little more thoughtful once in a while.And even slightly quicker. But as a total guilty pleasure, this is alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Kingsman....is astounding.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is anything but an average action film or average spy film, it's much more. The film genuinely blew my mind because of its take on modern day action spy films. The comedy tint was absolutely brilliant - if there weren't as many funny scenes, it still would have been good, but just not AS good as it was. I loved it. Taron Egerton is great in the film as the main protagonist - 'Eggsy'. The film revolves around the young man who trains to become the next Kingsman. Colin Firth was the most stand-out character alongside Taron Egerton. Colin Firth was incredible in this film - sheer fantastic acting. Also, it's good knowing that we had so many great costars in the film; the likes of: Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Mark Hamill, and Michael Caine. Woah! What a fantastic cast! I enjoyed everyone's role, but my favourite in particular was probably Colin Firth as 'Galahad'. Samuel L. Jackson was funny in the movie, and played a rather unusual yet interesting and good villain, 'Valentine.' I seemingly enjoyed every single thing about the movie - the opening, the soundtrack, the acting, the visuals, the comedy, the action, the little scenes of romance - the whole film was outstanding and so unique. I say unique as in its take is so completely different from other generic action films or the simple spy film you get now and again.... and YES, I liked this movie better than any James Bond film....with maybe the exception of Moonraker and a few others. Nonetheless, Kingsman is an unexpected comedy joyride that explores inner levels of action, adventure, comedy and more. I hope you go and see the movie - I hope you enjoy it. Simply, inexplicably good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, love. Gotta save the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're not going to hear our politicians talk about population, because we have an economic system dependent upon perpetual growth. When you have such a system, you need an ever growing population to sustain it. But no one will admit to this. I've asked politicians, why don't you admit to the truth, that we can't always have growth? And the main answer I get is, well, you can't say that. Any politician who doubts that we can have exponential growth forever is put down or attacked." - Dick Smith "In the event that I am reincarnated I would like to return as a deadly virus, in order to contribute something to overpopulation." - Prince Philip Matthew Vaughn's "Kingsman: The Secret Service" opens in a generic Middle Eastern country. Here generic white secret agents known as Kingsmen battle generic brown bad guys. These secret agents are led in the field by Galahad (Colin Firth), a generic spy-hero modelled on Ian Fleming's James Bond and Len Deighton's Harry Palmer."Kingsman" quickly introduces us to Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a generic super-villain who has infinite resources, henchmen, secret lairs and technology which exists only to propel the film's generic plot. Thankfully the Kingsmen have similar generic technology, which similarly allows them to magically explain plot points, propel the film's generic plot and eavesdrop on various generic characters. Why write a good script when everyone in your film has access to a computer which tells everyone what happened, what to do, where to go and who is who?Midway in "Kingsman", we learn Richmond Valentine's nefarious plans. A deranged environmentalist, Valentine hopes to cull Earth's human population, killing billions so that man's negative effects on the planet can be reversed. Spared from Valentine's slaughters are earth's wealthiest inhabitants. The poor die so that the rich can live.But the Kingsmen also ooze wealth. Dressed in the finest clothes and surrounded by dazzling cars and posh mansions, they are seen as something to aspire to. Case in point Eggsy Unwin (Taron Egerton), an unemployed, lower class Londoner. Like he's stepped out of a Ken Loach film, Eggsy lives in a generic simulation of 1950s "kitchen sink drama", abused mom and all. He escapes this hellhole thanks to Galahad, who explains to Eggsy that social class distinctions make no man better or worse than another, and that anyone can be upwardly mobile, if only they inject a little hard work and perseverance. In other words, being posh is nothing to aspire to, but it is, and everyone can be posh, but really only those who deserve to be. The film's scrambled ideology isn't surprising considering that Matthew Vaughn's a fervent conservative, made videos for the Tory party and is related to King George VI."Kingsman's" second act finds Eggsy and several other generic young men and women being trained by Galahad to become Kingsmen. Thanks to generic training montages, they quickly develop into resourceful murderers. Of course Eggsy, a wisecracking non-conformist, becomes the film's best Kingsman; nothing facilitates conformity more than the illusion of dissidence.Now with his own private army of super-kids, Galahad launches a little war on Valentine. Cue much hyper-stylised violence, so immaculately choreographed as to be devoid of any thrill, danger or spontaneity. People get stabbed, head-shots are delivered and corpses "humerously" accumulate. Because everyone in Vaughn's film is a random amalgamation of cartoonish traits, nothing in "Kingsman" has any dramatic weight. People fight, we don't care. The film ends with our heroes defeating Valentine, seemingly oblivious to the fact that, as per Vaughn's own rules, environmental collapse is coming anyway. Final scene? Eggsy saving the day, rescuing a princess and then being offered anal sex, a "darkly comedic" take on the "flirtatious" scenes which end virtually all James Bond movies. Like many contemporary superhero films ("Kickass", "Chronicle", "Defendor", "Super" etc), "Kingsman" attempts to be "irreverent". Swearing, casual brutality and randomness are presented as being "cool", and postmodern cut-and-pasting is presented as being "daring". Elsewhere the film's aesthetic plays like a cross between Zack Snyder, Guy Ritchie and a coked out Miley Cyrus, albeit with conservative shout-outs to Reagan, Thatcher and Rupert Murdoch. Inept and witless as an action comedy, "Kingsman" is nevertheless somewhat politically interesting. A bit like Chris Nolan's "The Dark Knight Rises", with its "evil environmentalists" and its hero who thinks "humans aren't ready for clean energy", "Kingsman" presents environmentalists as wealthy bad guys who work with governments and rich dudes to screw the unsuspecting masses. The film doesn't treat the findings of environmental scientists as being wrong, but it nevertheless presents environmentalism as being pushed by those with ulterior motives; environmentalism as an elite project to foster global depopulation. In the real world, of course, the truth is precisely the opposite. Capitalism, orthodox political policy and short-sighted zillionaires are the chief opponents of environmental scientists. The latter believe "sustainable capitalism" to be an oxymoron, the former pay lip-service to "green business policies" in order to keep doing business as usual. "Kingsman's" Malthusian obsession with birth rates is itself a red-herring long favoured by elites. To accept the premise that environmental problems are driven by population, and not the built-in growth imperatives that characterise capitalism's system of commodity production, is to miss the point environmental scientists have been making for decades. Economists like John Foster state this clearly: "Population growth cannot be examined apart from the economic system in which it is embedded. Negative or zero population growth poses serious problems for a capitalist society which always requires new markets, and always requires a continual expansion of both the labour force and the relative surplus population of the unemployed, all in order to meet the needs of production and profits." Of course nobody going to "Kingsman" cares about any of this. Who cares about logarithmic scales when you can sodomize a princess?5/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine James Bond, Jack Bauer, Jason Bourne and Johnny English in one movie, that's KINGSMAN: Secret Service.On the surface, Kingsman is a lively, and vividly illustrated bloodfest. If you're into movies where blades fly and heads and arms get impaled and detached, this one's for you. It teems with gore and violence, its brutality weirdly presented in ludicrously colorful and hilarious ways. KINGSMAN will both entertain and keep you on the edge of your seat. It starts with a deadly mission, one that would send one of the KINGSMAN secret agents to his death.This death forces kingsman agent, Harry Hart (code name: Galahad), to personally deliver a bravery medal to his colleague's family, which the widow refuses to accept. The only son, receives it, instead. Now several years' passed, that medal, with a phone number encrypted on its back, leads the boy to KINGSMAN. And suddenly, he's brought into the dangerous world of espionage.The film's charm comes chiefly from two key characters, Harry Hart (Collin Firth) and our young unassuming hero, "Eggsy" (Taron Egerton). Collin Firth's portrayal is truly remarkable, delivered with breathtakingly deadly elegance and aplomb, it's the one you would only expect from James Bond, and here, he might have done even more. Standing on totally opposite ground, is Eggsy, a young, playful teenager, who often gets into fights. He possesses an equally irresistible charm, only subtled beneath his choice of clothes, that is too unbecoming of a debonair secret agent. Together, these two, an ensemble of strong supports, Matt Vaughn's impeccable direction, and breathtaking visuals, result to this totally awe-inspiring film.But beneath that facade of bloodbath and elaborately executed violence, what makes this movie deeply moving, is its reasonating message about what truly makes a man noble. In the end, Kingsman is a motion picture with an irresistibly overwhelming appeal, extravagantly delivered with stunning cinematography and jawdropping, some of which, comedy-imbued action sequences. I give this film 8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great first half but then the pudding is over-egged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn, who's previous films in the director's chair number just four ? "Layer Cake", "Stardust", "Kick Ass" and "X-Men: First Class" ? does not do subtle. But he certainly does do stylish and entertaining. Of his past works Kingsman resembles most closely Kick Ass with its anarchic tone and comic-book violence. This is not surprising given the film is based, as was Kick-Ass, on a new comic book series by Mark Millar (this time with Dave Gibbons).Colin Firth plays Harry Hart (aka Galahad) a member of a secret spy network called Kingsman. Firth is quite outstanding playing a gentleman spy: a role he was born for. When one of their own gets terminated on a mission Harry proposes Eggsy (Taron Egerton), the son of an ex-colleague, to go forward to a lethal form of training to become the replacement Kingsman.While all this is going on, a dastardly plan (that will result in global mayhem) is being plotted by the billionaire Valentine (a completely over-the-top and lisping Samuel L Jackson), ably protected by his female bodyguard (and literally a Blade Runner) Gazelle, played by the strikingly beautiful Algerian actress Sofia Boutella. Will the Kingsmen defeat the dastardly plot in time before the countdown runs out? (You can probably guess, but you'll have fun finding out).Whereas Bond has Universal Exports, Kingsman's "cover" organisation is a Saville Row tailor's called Kingsman, giving all of the spies an excuse to wear outrageously fashionable suits.The "M" in this network has the codename of Arthur, played with enormous style by Michael Caine, especially in one notable scene where he suddenly slips from his posh Etonian accent into pure East End gangster. The "Q" equivalent is played by Vaughn-favourite Mark Strong, for once playing a good guy and playing it very well indeed.It's also great to see, before his Star Wars return, Mark (Luke Skywalker) Hamill playing a global warming expert, who has more that one reason to get a bit hot under the collar.During the heyday of the early Bond films in the 60's a number of spoof films arose: the gratingly erratic Casino Royale (with David Niven) being one, with James Coburn's "Flint" movies being a better example. Kingsman is a worthy example of this genre: a film that has its tongue firmly in its cheek, and with a range of nice Bond-references, particularly in regard to the cliché about the villain telling the hero the details of his plot before putting him to an intricate and readily escapable death.I really liked this film from the off. It oozes style from the opening titles onwards and when we move into the extended agent training section Vaughn turns the action knob to 10, showing off the style of newcomer Egerton, who has great charisma and carries the role well particularly when matched with the charming and likable Roxy (a film debut for Sophie Cookson).Unfortunately, in my view, Vaughan and co-screenwriter Jane Goldman can't quite help themselves and turns the action knob to 11 for the second half of the film. A scene of carnage in a church will be too extreme for older or more sensitive viewers, and a gruesome scene to the stirring notes of "Land of Hope and Glory", whilst hysterically funny and done purely for laughs, doesn't quite fit with the mood of the film: it channels more "Mars Attacks!" than the Bond-spoof that has gone to date. Similarly a good gag with a Swedish princess is pushed a step too far in a final scene. A case of "less is more" in this reviewer's book.In summary, well worth watching for a fun Saturday-night cinema trip. My one request to Vaughn is that if there is a Kingsman 2 (which you could certainly see happening) then he maintains enough interest to direct it: I'm not sure I could stand the disappointment of another Kick Ass 2.(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version together with more reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to subscribe.

		<shortDescription>Ludicrous in Every Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn has proved himself to be a talented and versatile director, touching upon the crime, fantasy and superhero genres with mostly positive results. With Kingsman his focus turned to creating the most extravagant spy spoof imaginable. In its simplest terms, Kingsman is to the James Bond film series what Kick-Ass is to the average superhero film. Every aspect is pushed to its limits in an attempt to create a wild mix of shock and awe. It's brash, crude, ultra- violent, highly stylised and full of exaggerated characters. Where Kick-Ass worked because of its wit and overblown set-pieces, I feel that Kingsman is just too straight-forward and juvenile in its humour to truly succeed despite some impressive features.The plot is pretty basic as we see down on his luck chav Eggsy join a secret spy service named Kingsman which his father had once belonged to, undertaking training and attempting to stop an internet mastermind from taking over the world. The issues with the plot are mainly to do with its simplicity in that we've seen this type of story so many times. Once you know the beats everything else goes out the window, we know Eggsy will use his skills to be a part of Kingsman and that makes the entire training section (which is a good third) obsolete. You certainly have to admire the film for just how big the plot is and how excessive it is willing to go in attempts to spoof Bond, but a lot of it is tired and predictable.In terms of its comedy and spoof attempts the film is very mixed. The more straight British humour is always welcomed and Jackson provides plenty of amusement with his over-the-top villain. Plus anything references the Bond series usually stands out too. With that said, there are a lot of puns that just don't work and some of the jokes end up feeling completely out of place. Crude humour can be very effective if used correctly, but I think that the crude jokes are mistimed here and that the film does suffer from becoming too reliant on them at many points. The final joke really does end things on a bum note (pun intended there).It's hard to fault the cast however. Taron Egerton does a fine job in his big screen debut, handling the comedy with finesse and convincing as a spy in training. Eggsy could easily have been an annoying or unlikeable character so he did well to provide him with such charisma. Colin Firth is excellent as Eggsy's mentor figure Galahad, possessing a smooth charm absent in many of his roles and being surprisingly convincing in the action scenes. Samuel L. Jackson is in top form here with a brilliantly extravagant performance. With a goofy lisp, it's a fun call to the classic early Bond villains with Jackson being engaging and frequently hilarious whenever he's on screen. Mark Strong is good fun as the Scottish technological savvy Merlin. Michael Caine shows up as Kingsman head Arthur though he gets little to do and Sophie Cookson is just okay as Eggsy's sweet teammate.The film is appropriately stylised and slick looking, reminiscent of Vaughn's X-Men film. It fits the film given its homages to the classic Bond films and other grand spy flicks, though I think the villain's lair could have been more creative. Sadly the score by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson is very forgettable, as instead of doing a take on the scores of the Bond or Bourne films it just turns into a generic action soundtrack with little to remember. Despite the films spoof nature there aren't as many references as there could have been and I think the film would have been more fun had it made these clearer. The action sequences are arguably the highlights of the film. They are filmed excellently and with a real sense of flair, with the church scene in particular being delightfully chaotic.Kingsman is undeniably fun at times and does have some understanding of how to poke fun at its subject matter. The problems I have with it are mostly down to its simplistic plot line and over-reliance on crude humour. It's a story we've seen too many times and it really missed a trick not taking apart the typical spy formula more. Whilst the jokes can work, I feel that there is a lack of wit to much of the comedy and it appears to backtrack to crudeness whenever it's unsure of what to do next. With that said I do find the acting enjoyable with Jackson really standing out, the action is outstanding and the film does have an unquestionable style. I think the potential for a great film was here, but we'll have to make do with enjoying the fun pieces placed throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is about a spy agency and guns and killing but it's also about class divides. It demands that you look past the superficial and into what really makes a person: as the mentor Harry Hart or Galahad would say, it's not what you wear that makes you a gentlemen. He also quotes Hemingway whilst urging Eggsy to improve and change. But does Vaughn really add much more to that discussion? The young rascal Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is low class from head to toe; the jeans, the shoes, the cap. And his accent and actions speak further too: one sequence has him steal a car and go for a joyride while Dizzee Rascal's "Bonkers" blares at us. Another has a long take where he parkours through the government housing to get away from his stepfather's goons. It's impressive to be sure. Would we look at it differently had he be dressed in a suit, and be chased by similarly suited goons? I'm not so sure. Eggsy is swept up into the world of Kingsman after yet another misdemeanour. He's clearly a fish out of water, judging by his colleague's mockery when prompted over which private school he attends. Yet he excels against all odds as our protagonist should. The world of Kingsman is sleek and stylish; first started in the mid 20th century, it's been clearly modernised to take on ever evolving threats and we are just as impressed as Eggsy upon first viewing that vehicle hanger. Yet the bigger plot is the more engaging one, a peculiar villain occupied by Samuel L Jackson who speaks with a lisp, wears a purple snapback and is, despite his nefarious intentions, appalled by bloodshed. I am not sure what Vaughn is going for here. In one dreadful scene, he shows up for no particular or logical reason in the Kingsman's own secret front store, and we are supposed to marvel at the tension beneath the pleasantries, but it's a very frivolous and artificial attempt at upping the stakes. Moviegoers have praised this sort of subversion of the villain role, and yet we marvel at the action scenes that are delivered with clear technical prowess. The most talked about scene is of course the one in the Westboro clone church, where Free Bird ushers in a frenzied take-down of 100 or so civilians by Harry. The choreography and shooting style is precise and excellent, constantly roving and tracking to visualise every brutal take-down from the Kingsman agent. And yet, in the midst of it, Valentine looks away with disgust. Vaughn attempts to have his cake and eat it too, portraying the civilians as the scum of the earth and cheering on Harry and laughing at Valentine only for his intentions to be revealed after all the bloodshed. Only then are we in two minds about the whole affair. Are we poking fun and relishing the parody of the spy genre (as seen with the raunchy jokes, the meta- references to "that kinda movie" and the intentionally corny opening titles) or is it an uneven as it is violent? Mark Millar's ultra-violence was portrayed well in "Kick Ass" and was appropriate, whereas here it's rather odd. When Colin Firth brutally attacks the goons in the pub, it's starkly contrasted with his gentlemen motivations, but at least we cheer for the good guy. When Taron Egerton initiates the exact same fight at the end of the film, it's rather tiresome even with his noble intentions. There are some good performances (Firth first and foremost, and Cookson is also impressive), some jokes which merit a chuckle (McDonalds, Eggsy's pug, the James Bond martini reference) and some stunning action sequences (I really love the use of Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches, but then again it begs the question, why is this stylised and a an axe to the neck not? Are we going for comic or ultra-graphic?) but overall I'm not sure what Kingsman is trying to achieve. But at least it's entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst ever film villain!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better........ Yes the action sequences are really good, and there are some very fun moments in the film. That being said, any action movie is only as good as the villain. The villain drives the story, makes us hate him, fear him, so we will want our heroes to kick his butt and be vested in their story. So when Samuel L. Jackson shows up afraid of blood or he will puke (they only put this in so they can show him puking later), never having killed or even hurt anyone in his life. So far a really weak villain. It gets worse, add to this his tweedy bird meets some famous boxer Lisp, silly silk baseball hat and awful, over-acting and he is now the worst super villain ever. Change this to a straight comedy and it might fly but as an action film? Total fail. I was enjoying the movie pretty much till he would show up again and remind me it's a movie. The Kingsmen themselves are really amazing. The first scene where a Kingsman takes out a houseful of baddies to save Mark Hamill is completely awesome. These Kingsman look invincible, till....... Somehow an invisible (must be) blade runner girl cuts him in half without making a single sound (off camera, don't feel bad, he didn't see it either). Man she is incredible to take out one of these guys, I mean the training they go through to become a Kingsmen is insane. In fact, most of the movie as they recruit a replacement for this amazing agent (who was killed like a lamb at slaughter) we are made to understand the rigors and real extent of a Kingsmen's training and we are saying "okay, I get it. These guys are the best, trained for anything and anyone." We believe! And if we didn't, just wait...... to further prove how invincible (almost) a Kingsmen is we are shown a scene where one single Kingsmen takes out 100 people, single handed, at once! Man he must have the senses of a cat, reflexes like lightning! No one can touch him in all this mayhem, because he is a Kingsmen! Next......this very same Kingsmen for some reason just stands there while Tweedy-Villain just pulls a gun and shoots him in the head. No dodging, no slapping the gun away, no ducking, no grabbing our scary Tweedy-Villain as a hostage. He just stands there and eats a bullet. Huh? What happened? Suspended disbelief is shattered! How can a wimpy, untrained weenie who never hurt a fly in person for fear of projectile vomiting be able to get the drop on Super-Bond? I mean this Kingsmen guy was locked in a church with 100 crazy people and he killed all of them! I literally yelled at the TV.Did that jet do vertical lift with only rear engines? Maybe I'll run that part back ;-)Of course our trainee is better and faster than any other Kingsmen. He can defeat the slick blade runner girl by letting her tire out from all that brake dancing, and then nicking her with poison while she is busy doing a perfect Bruce Lee flying kick (watch close in that scene, she is looking straight ahead while he cuts her, she is frozen in a Bruce Lee pose). Maybe is she turned her head she might have dodged that one. Wait a minute, those blades that pop out of her feet, where are they the rest of the time when she is just walking? Stuck in her knees? Ouch!We knew he would win, he had a promise of anal sex with a princess, duh!OK, if none of that stuff matters; If you can live with that kind of broken storytelling , just sit back and watch some really cool action scenes that are really well choreographed and some crazy, really obvious special effects on a Saturday with some popcorn and a beer. It could be worse, It wasn't World War Z</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Blockbuster Sometimes Marred By Its Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard not to miss the early days of James Bond, when the adventures were colorful, 007 was spryly unserious, and the villains were ready to rupture with their European shaded, cackling madmen personas. Such wondrous cool exploded in the early Bond franchise that it isn't unrealistic to watch "Goldfinger" over and over again. Cheekiness goes a long way. But now we have the "modern" Bond (introduced in 2006's "Casino Royale"), who is as sophisticated as ever but is hardly the Technicolor nympho he was in the pre-Brosnan days. He's become a spy grizzled and cynical, more quick to grimace as he goes through the motions, a smirk completely unheard of. I like "Casino Royale" and its sequels ("Quantum of Solace", "Skyfall"), but I miss the days when British spies weren't always well-oiled machines of slickness ? agile, action-packed ridiculousness is much more satisfactory in the long run.I suppose I wasn't sitting around and waiting for a movie like "Kingsman: The Secret Service" to come around and sweep me off my feet, but it's the kind of blockbuster needed to invigorate the incessant rut of superhero franchises/gritty action movies. Here is a movie so cartoonishly brash in its thrills I couldn't help but reflect back on "The Avengers" and "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.". Cheesy yet impressively tactical, both were 1960s spy shows fully aware they were telling comically insane stories most of the time ? but through a competent use of gaudy violence and disco ball flashy characters, silliness became sly while everyones tongue remained firmly in cheek. "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a parody of sorts, self-aware in its cocktail infused kookiness but ready to pay homage when it comes time to hearken back to the days when Roger Moore was kicking every bad guy's ass as he held an unrealistically sexy woman at close quarters. This film's biggest issue is its violence ? while oft comical, there are several gratuitous scenes of bloodshed that hardly match the snickering tone of everything else ? but when "Kingsman" succeeds it manages to soar; it's a puff of crisp air following the pollution of its staling super-suited counterparts.With a lively wicked performance from Jackson, "Kingsman", like one of its characters suggests, is as good as its villain: exaggerated, bombastic, agreeably oily, though a little too violent. Indeed, the majority of "Kingsman" is an amusing take on what the Bond franchise could have been, had 007 been seventeen and let loose in a maze of rated-R obstacles ? but sometimes, the film goes too far, a shame when so much of it sits a cut above other modern blockbusters. My most prominent issue lies in the constant profanity and the sometimes disturbing violence. Though I don't liken myself to the most prudish of people, tonal issues arise through "Kingsman"'s inability to figure out if it's joking or if it's a bit sick in the head. The fight scenes are astonishingly well-choreographed, haphazardly exciting in their fast-motion dexterity ? but somewhere during the halfway mark, the film sours once it sets a mass slaughter in a church. The scene, finding its setting in Kentucky, serves as an introduction to Valentine's new technology, which causes even the most peaceful of people to become violent with just the click of a button, thanks to their Valentine designed cell phones. Unfortunately, Harry Hart is visiting, ending with him killing every single person in the building. Vaughn, who directs most of the film charismatically, decides that such an act is excusable as long as the people are despicable (think the Westboro Baptist Church) ? but the murders are less cutely "Kill Bill" and more gory horror movie violent, the acts mostly shocking and not thrilling. The scene ends with a man getting a stake stabbed harshly from the bottom of his face to the top: are we supposed to laugh? Irritating is how much more focus is put into these scenes of gratuitous terror being placed upon innocents while the post-credits sequence leaves Eggsy's beating of his stepfather off-camera. Personally, I would rather my screen violence be justified rather than simply there to be cool. But that's just me.If my review sounds negative, don't pay any attention: the previous two paragraphs exist as one giant complaint. Fact is, I liked "Kingsman: The Secret Service." Taron Egerton, reminiscent of a snarky young Guy Pearce, has serious potential to become a movie star. You certainly won't look at the normally smooth Colin Firth the same way again. And Vaughn ("Kick Ass", "X-Men: First Class"), for the most part, gives us a strictly fun action movie, full of terrific lines and thrillingly choreographed brawls. I just wish the film had an understanding that violence has to match tone, and for a movie so ready to charm us, we shouldn't have to buckle up and grab our barf bags right after we gleam during a witty exchange. I wouldn't want to have my martini stirred instead of shaken, now would I?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Rating: &#x2606;&#x2606; ? out of 4)This film is mildly recommended.In brief: A spy film that is shaky, not stirring.GRADE: B-Kingsman: The Secret Service is an homage to the British spy film genre with its sophisticated agents, wry humor, and gadgetry. It sends up the Ian Fleming spy films but with a harsher edginess and tons of violence. Matthew Vaughn directs the film with ample flair and style, but his screenplay (co-written by Jane Goldman) lacks the right degree of mindless fun and wit. The plot follows the formula of a megalomaniac wanting to control the world and a secret agency that is hellbent on stopping him.The film is very well cast, with the exception of its villain, who acts more buffoonish than menacing. Samuel L. Jackson plays him, but the actor never conveys the wickedness very convincingly. Fortunately, the other actors contribute greatly to the film's enjoyment. Foremost are its two leads, Colin Firth who handles the action hero bravado very well and newcomer Taron Egerton as his willing protégé. Mark Strong, Michael Caine, and Sofia Boutella as the female Oddjob round out the ensemble.Kingsman: The Secret Service entertains, but its high level of non-stop violence is disturbing, especially in a church scene where the body count reaches absurd heights and skews the film's lighter tone which effectively is found in films of this genre. Also, the CGI is amateurish and cheap looking. Kingsman: The Secret Service is based on a comic book, but comic is not the correct term in describing this movie. Serviceable is.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eggsy is summoned by Harry to become a kingsman like his father. Something like James Bond, with much more graphic violence and a villain that makes no sense. The story is the classical one, with a boy, having lost his father and getting into trouble over and over till he meets his mentor who shows him the path of virtue. Apparently Eggsy had the potentials, otherwise it would have been even more silly to have him achieve all those tasks without even proper training. The violence scenes were really graphic, like the ones in Kick Ash, with too much unnecessary blood and too disgusting blood scenes. The story line is good, and the main idea is good enough, even the performances were okay, but the movie lacked of originality. And so I give kingsman a 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something of a high-wire act, but one pulled off with aplomb. Catch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen some good films - some very good films - mediocre films and downright bad films, but I know very little about film-making because I've never 'made a film' or been involved in making a film and the chances of me doing so are rather less than celebrating my next birthday on the Moon. But of one thing I'm certain: in many ways film-making is something of a high-wire act: with all the talent in the world at our beck and call it can, and often does, go horribly wrong. There again it can, against rather steep odds, also come off admirably, and with Kingsman: The Secret Service writer/director Mathew Vaughn (and I suspect his long-term co-screenwriter Jane Goldman also deserves a mention) has most certainly pulled off, with apparent ease, a daunting task.First, during the height of the Cold War, we had the straight-faced James Bond films (and others were made at the same time presenting the same sentiments) with those nasty Rusky communists as the 'baddies' and the West and apple pie as the 'goodies, although the Bond franchise began to play if more for laughs, perhaps realising just how ludicrous it all often seemed. Similar ventures, though, most recently the Bourne franchise, carried on playing it straight, but shifted the emphasis away from politics to out-and-out action.Bourne and the rest blatantly catered to the armchair thug in all of us who likes to imagine himself - very rarely herself, I should think - up there with all the smart moves and seemingly inexhaustible energy. Others - Rowan Atkinson, Mike Myers, and just a few months ago Paul Feig with Spy - ditched any pretense of serious intent and simply went for laughs.Vaughn and Goldman - I do think it is best to see them as a team because an excellent script (I am told) is the sine qua non of great film-making - have tried something far more ambitious in the number of angles the cover. Not only do they give us a Bond character battling it out with an evil villain intent on world domination (or, here, world destruction), but at the same time they choose to send it up but without pulling the rug from under their own feet. They also provide all the quite impossible gadgetry we expect a 'Bond' character to have at his disposal - at one point Colin Firth as the central figure takes his protégé (a very capable Taron Egerton) from Savile Row in central London to deepest Hampshire (I should think) in an underground mini bullet train on a journey of at least 30 miles - now how would that have been secretly built at a cost of billions of pounds? And to cap it all, the film flirts with self-reference, a practice that almost always ends in tears but here doesn't.Firth, our 'Bond', and a very watchable Samuel L. Jackson as the evil and mad villain, complete with a ludicrous Mike Tyson lisp, even discuss 'the kind of spy film they watched as kids'. But then Vaughn and Goldman ride a coach and four through many of those films' conventions - when he finally meets Firth, baddie Jackson explains he won't spend several minutes outlining why he is doing what he is doing and he shan't, as was the convention, set up the 'Bond' character to die a lingering death from which our Bond would be bound to escape, he simply . . . well watch the film.But there is even more to Vaughn and Goldman's action-packed spoof than that: they even manage to introduce an additional hero, a very likable lad from the wrong side of the track (Taron Egerton, referred to above) who is set against a gaggle of upper-class toffs and manages to hold his own with aplomb. Portraying the British class system in films and some chipper 'working-class' lad who gets one over the toffs is a high-wire act of its own, but Vaughn and Goldman manage it.Some reviewers here lambast Kingsman for its violence, and I can't deny that there is a great deal of it - to put it bluntly, an awful lot of people die. But, for this viewer at least, the violence isn't in the slightest bit nasty and gratuitous and isn't sadistically lingered upon as is the habit of some grubby film-makers.This film, which is based on a graphic novel, gets away with showing it because it is so utterly unreal and. And one scene in which - spoiler alert - the heads of several hundred of the worlds great and good gathered in villain Jackson's lair all explode like some expensive firework display, played to Edward Elgar's Pomp And Circumstance, had me laughing out aloud: it was all far too ludicrous to cause offence and very funny indeed.Vaughn and Goldman - I still think that although Vaughn directed, both should get equal credit for what we are shown on screen - most certainly pulled off a high-wire act and then some.Undoubtedly luck was involved (as were several hundred other collaborators - I've just looked at the credit list and yet again reflected on just how their essential contributions are never acknowledged), but luck follows talent - you'll never get anywhere on pure luck.Catch this if you can, because you are in for a treat. Yes, it is all quite ludicrous, but in the best possible sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fun action movie in the 'Bond on speed' style. Acting is good, story is OK for the genre and the fight scenes are top shelf. But we aren't even 30 seconds in before the first thug pulls out a gun from his pants, with the resulting zoom on a Levi's pocket for a good 3 seconds. The bar is set for the rest of the movie, where the main characters make sure to announce they are enjoying their Guinness at the pub and have front pages from The Sun plastered all over their office (despite playing an intellectual liberal who likely doesn't share a single perspective on anything with that newspaper). Product placement is fine when it is suble, but The Kingsman it is a constant barrage of in-your-face product references. It feels like its one giant viral video campaign since there is a reference to a product every minute or so. It got so distracting after 30 minutes that it ruined an otherwise enjoyable movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is a spy movie light. It is a small tribute to James Bonds' movies and those like it; meaning the dapper spy with all of the latest gadgets. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously (which is good) and that was supported by the fact that Samuel L. Jackson's character, Valentine, had a laughable lisp.The Kingsmen are a group of elite English spies. They are extremely secretive and unknown yet they are probably the most effective group of spies and killers on the planet. As members leave or die off they are replaced by qualified spies and gentlemen. This movie is about an unlikely person for the role of gentleman spy getting a shot to prove himself while the Kingsmen try to stop a plot to cleanse the world of people.There is a lot of unbelievable action, jaw-dropping fight scenes with surprisingly little eye candy. Being that it is a British spy movie I expected the token beauty whom the super spy seduces. That's not to say that they didn't throw in any gratuitous nudity, they just waited until the very end to do it.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, this movie was scrapped with bad humor and taste that would only appeal to creeps.If only they left out the lack of respect for human life (slaughtering innocent people in a church and our world leaders heads exploding into rainbow powder), the lame American political references and the absolute sexism (having the strongest female role stoop to offer anal sex to a teenager) this movie may have had a future.This movie will NOT be a household title, it will NOT be passed from generation to generation and it WILL be forgotten with a long list of other movie titles that were promising but just didn't make the cut.Hopefully this movie flop will remind directors that substance matters.

It was essentially a string of clichés held together by crude 'action' scenes and the pure will power of Colin Firth desire to star in some thing that doesn't require him to strip off and walk slowly towards a painfully awkward middle class woman. The cinematography was uniformly awful to the point I started playing spot the green screen to keep myself amused. The action was either poorly executed or over the top and gory. It was as if the director had one seen the toxic avenger and robocop but had never git the irony'. There are no original ideas, no interesting shots and the whole thing feels like it took place in a shoebox. It also does the flavour of the day, ironically break the forth wall and admit it''s rubbish, then does more ribbish like it''s allowed now. No you are not allowed to be rubbish if you know you're rubbish, It's not ironic, it's pure laziness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service details the adventures of a young English man, improbably nicknamed Eggsy (Taron Egerton), whose brush with the law ends up with him recruited by secret agent extraordinaire Harry Hart (Colin Firth) to vie for an open slot in the British Secret Service. Meanwhile, villainous billionaire Samuel L. Jackson launches a scheme to decimate the world's population leaving only the greedy elite left standing.Kingsman is a spoofy take on the old James Bond/British spy thrillers of yore with questionable attempts at being topical and edgy thrown into the mix. Most of the film contrasts Eggsy's adventures in his various tests, while Harry investigates Jackson. There is much that works well here thanks to director Matthew Vaughn knowing his way around an action scene. Unfortunately, the jarring shifts in tone and a streak of unwelcome nastiness running down its center prevent the film from reaching its full potential.It is fascinating to see typical villain Mark Strong cast in a good guy role and the usually avuncular Michael Caine cast as a nasty snob. Jack Davenport is a handsome and charming actor, so it is a bit annoying to see him constantly wasted in thankless franchise roles. Sophie Cookson's rather generic heroine is nicely balanced by Sofia Boutella as Jackson's vicious henchwoman with lethal blades for legs. It is great to see Jackson eschew the tired tough guy persona as a blood-averse, lisping psychopath. In the central role, a star is born in Egerton, who demonstrates the charm, comic timing and appeal required, and has the hard-bodied physique to make the physical scenes half-credible. The film's biggest strength is Firth in a cheeky salute to prior spy legends ? who has a fetish with tailored clothes and manners ? always manners! Looking at the preview of Kingsman, it would appear to be a frothy, light-hearted romp through spy clichés. The end result is unexpectedly different and not necessarily in a good way. There are fun segments, but they are often side-lined by psychotically over-the-top brutal violence with people being skewered, slashed, hacked apart or having their heads explode. Similarly, the dialog is littered with near non-stop foul language. All of this serves little purpose given the slightness of the screenplay except a laughably misguided attempt to make the whole endeavor seem hard-edged. It has rather the opposite effect, often taking one out the action and giving them time to realize the preposterousness of what we see.Attempts to make what we see topical or gritty often border on the offensive. The film adopts a rather cavalier view of the serious problem of global warming. A later scene set in a church obviously modeled on the notorious Phelps Church of Kansas devolves into an orgy of off-the-scale violence and brutality, barely made palatable given the odiousness of the victims. The final test for the Kingsman candidates hangs on their willingness to murder the puppies they were given at the start of training. The film also has the US president going along with Jackson's plot and we get a stand-in who is obviously supposed to be current President Obama ? which culminates later with the First Family's heads literally exploding on screen ? something which no doubt plays well in conservative circles. These attempts at edginess often seem more crass than clever.Further missteps abound. As likable as Egerton is, the film only really kicks into high gear whenever Firth is on screen. An accident leaves his character sidelined for too much of the film and then he is almost immediately written out soon after ? leaving a gaping hole. For being so smart, the Kingsman make an awful lot of dumb mistakes. When Harry realizes immediately that his cover has been compromised, he still partakes of a dinner with Jackson and ends up swallowing a tracker which leads the villain to Kingsman headquarters. Furthermore, does anyone believe that most of the world's leaders would agree to having a device in their heads that could cause them to explode? The concluding action at the villain's not-so-secret lair is increasingly silly. The heroes' initial plan on how to foil Jackson by taking down one of his satellites seems foolish since even the audience can foresee he will have a back-up and it takes our heroes forever to see a solution staring everyone else right in the face.Despite some strong action sequences, amusing moments and a great cast, what is one to think when the scenes fresh in one's mind when exiting is that one character just leaned into the camera and barfed straight into the lens (one could say on the viewers) and that Eggsy's final act as an agent trained in good manners is to have anal sex with a kidnapped Swedish princess? Manners, indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Spectre should have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very pleasant surprise watching this movie, that I hadn't heard much about beforehand, but this is the best spy/action movie I've seen in a long while. This movie is everything the new Bond should have been and wasn't . Top marks all round, action scenes, the well-acted characters are easy to engage with, storyline although far-fetched has an old style bond kind of narrative to it, as does the tongue in cheek comedy. The baddies are bad and the hero's to be cheered for. It's never going to tax the mind or engage on deeper levels or even end up being a classic, but it's one I'll buy on DVD and watch again. What can I say, watch and enjoy. A second one of these couldn't come soon enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure you have seen some good and bad reviews of this movie on here. The ones that love it give it 10/10 and the haters are the total opposite and not many in between. I can't fathom those that hate, as surely they would have known what sort of movie they are going to see, so why bother if you don't like this sort of thing? It's like me going to see some teary chick flick (which I hate), then coming on here and bagging it to the hilt. Not sure what these haters expect from a movie with an R rating. I shake my head in disbelief. Movies are meant to be entertaining and engaging and by god, Kingsman is all that and more. It has loads of violence, action special effects and comedy. What more could you want? Do yourself a favour and see it if you want to be entertained. Don't see it if you don't like these types of movies. Pretty simple really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman rips your soul from your body with terrifying ease</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what made Roger Ebert a great critic? He enjoyed movies more than he enjoyed being enjoyed for enjoying movies. His writing made it obvious, little emotional flourishes and gorgeous analogies that set him in another league, miles away from many other critics. To him, films were not technical achievements; rather, they were human experiences, emotional experiences, philosophical experiences, or even intellectual experiences. He was one of the few critics that wanted films to affect him, rather than reveling in his power to affect a film's ratings. To put it bluntly, Ebert's taste emerged from his existence not as a film critic, but as a human.Ebert took Vaughn's Kick Ass (2010), and justly gave it one star, asking his readers "Will I seem hopelessly square if I find Kick-Ass morally reprehensible"? Well, I certainly thought so. I loved Kick-Ass, and although I have felt slight ethical twinges during recent viewings, my reasoning went as follows "The bad guys get wasted, and they're bad guys, so I don't really give a damn if they get blown up." Kingsman: The Secret Service makes Kick-Ass look like an episode of the Teletubbies. The bad guys get wasted, the not so bad guys get wasted, the good guys get wasted, about fifty or so bigots get wasted, the whole world wastes itself, and finally, a cheeky little princess gets wasted (but not in the same way as everyone else), each getting wasted in the most obscene and bloody way imaginable.Kingsman is a surprisingly unfunny and disturbing little film, packaged with irresistible stylishness and beguiling obscenity. Perhaps I should specify: the film in itself isn't very disturbing, but the way it goes about masking its amorality, and the fact that so many people are blind to it definitely is. Most of it is rather bland, but when it isn't, it is mind-blowingly insane. But my question to you, not as a critic (although I suppose that designation isn't deserved, owing to the widespread abhorrence of my IMDb reviews) asking a reader, but as a human to another human, is "At what cost?" Kingsman has a solid structure: a talented yet extremely crude young man (Taron Egerton) whose life is drifting towards the dark world of drugs and crime is given the opportunity to join a secret spy agency, an opportunity which he readily accepts. But things aren't as easy as they seem, as he is one of several candidates who must compete in a series of death-defying trials to eventually earn a place in the agency. The other candidates are wonderfully cocky, posh British boys whom you can't help but hate, and a girl, Roxy, is also thrown in there simply to shake things up. Meanwhile, billionaire genius Richmond Valentine is plotting to end global warming through unknown, but obviously sinister means.The training scenes are the best parts of the film, at times hilarious, at other times spectacularly intense, but at all times fun as hell. But then the film sees fit to dissolve itself in a moral cesspool with the most stylish and well-done massacre that I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm sorry, but as well-done as it is, I have to say that it was an awful experience. Sure, the people who get killed are bigots (I congratulate Vaughn on his meticulous manipulation of my sensibilities), but the sheer body count, and the simple glorification of indiscriminate death is too much (or too little?) for me to bear. Since when did entertainment have to be all about pointless and startlingly gruesome death? Then began my struggle. Do I buy into this? Or do I reject it? Each subsequent scene brought even more fun than the last, pulling me back into the film, assuring me that I wasn't a monster for enjoying (?) the film. It is made with such seductive glee and that it is hard to remember how awful the film's ideas and intentions actually are. But finally, Kingsman reaffirms my abhorrence by killing literally everyone.What terrifies me about the film is that my friends love it. What terrifies me even more is the fact that this film has received critical acclaim. And what terrifies me the most is that I almost enjoyed it as well.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a lurid film made for those without moral scruples. It is stylish and fun, (even though its humour comes across as rather bland) at the expense of hundreds, maybe even thousands of lives. The fact that this counts for entertainment (and good entertainment at that) in our world is rather a poor reflection on us as a species. I urge you, all of you, to attempt to engage your moral compass when watching films, because if we can look at this film and deem it acceptable, then there is something very wrong with us indeed. Remember Ebert, and remember what made him the greatest film critic the world has ever known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Birth of a Great Spy Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service , I thought of it as a Young Adult Spy Kids or James Bond. Don't get me wrong, I had every intention of seeing this movie because A) I like Spy Kids and James Bond, and B) I like Young Adult movies. But after it came out, I realized that this movie is actually rated 'R' which takes it decidedly out of the Young Adult genre. Regardless, it still landed on my "want to see" list because of the trailers and the marvelous tech they showed in it.Right off the bat, the movie is violent. Over the top violent. Like, Kick-Ass and Wanted violent. In fact, it turns out that the screenplay for both Kick-Ass and The Kingsman was written by the same man that directed them, the very talented Matthew Vaughn. And the film itself is based of a comic book series written by Mark Millar, who also wrote both the Kick-Ass and Wanted comic books. (See a trend here?) The film has two different story lines as Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is attempting to stop the evil villain, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) while Eggsy (Taron Egerton) is training to become a Kingsman. Throw in a bad ass female with blades for feet (Boutella), Michael Caine doing his thing, and more spy gadgets than you could shake a Q at, and you have a recipe for success. The movie is a fun and fast paced run through the spy world, filled with evil villains, spies, and of course spy gadgets. In other words, go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Good Movie with a Bad Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>English is not my mother tongue, please excuse any errors on my part.I really like the concept of a gentleman spy. The idea that there exists a secret spy society that saves the world from villains while still maintaining the image of a perfect gentleman leaves us infinite imagination space. I hope there will be a sequel to this movie because much more stories can be told about this secret organization.Another great feature of this movie is the decent actions. Certain aspects of the action scenes were done well and some of the bullet time actions was good. My favorite action scene is the massacre in the church though a lot of people claim that it is revoltingly violent and disturbingly bloody. But I prefer to call it "the aesthetics of violence". No where in the world has the issue of media violence been such debated as in our society. From my point of view, there is no necessary correlation between media violence and "real" violence. On the contrary, I expect movies to be an outlet for pressure and stress.The best performance came from Colin Firth. He took his role seriously and played it to the hilt. The personality of the role "Harry Hart" is one of several highlights in this movie. Colin's wonderful performance and wholehearted dedication perfectly interpreted the meaning of a gentleman spy.This movie has many advantages, but its disadvantages are equally notable. The worst of all is the bad script. I expected this new movie might be a innovation, but is still a stereotype. As a throwback to the old spy flick, it fails in many aspects. the concept of a kid taking over for his dad and quasi predecessor is a cliché. The idea of a Swedish princess offering anal sex to the hero is just absurd. moreover, it tells a story about a dotcom genius with an aversion to blood who wants to destroy the world, does this sound familiar? These film clichés are overused in cinemas and it astonished me to see them in this movie.As the movie progresses, the entire of validity of the character's morals were flushed down the drain.Beyond that, the English jokes always bounce me out of the movie. Granted I am used to American jokes and I get that English humor is a bit different, but I still don't think nuclear head explosion or McDonalds being served on a sliver plate is that much funny anymore.Once again, I apologize for any mistake in my English.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it really a comedy if it doesn't makes you laugh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if this film was meant to be a comedy or a drama, but the one thing that's for certain is it doesn't work as both. It could have been a great drama if it weren't for a few scenes that were unrealistic, over-the-top and sometimes downright vulgar. I found the implication that President Obama condoned mass genocide offensive. And I felt like the anal s*x scene at the end was out of place and inappropriate for the situation. Also the man being split in half and the technicolor exploding heads made me feel like I was watching a cartoon. Sam Jackson's character was ridiculous. Between his lisp and crooked ball cap I felt like I was watching a middle aged man pretending to be a 10 year old boy. Also I can tell you that McDonald's was a sponsor thanks to the blatant product plug. Except for these things, this was an excellent film. The story itself was great. The main character was both sypmpathetic and heroic - basically everything you want a main character to be. The fight scenes were out-of-this-world amazing. The acting was outstanding, especially from newcomer Taron Egerton. I think that's why I feel so disappointed. Because for all the things that made this film so fantastic, it was ruined by just a few things that brought it down to the level of just another average film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because i saw the making of one of the best fighting scenes in the past 22 years. And that is because i haven't lived any longer. Imagine my surprise when i was greeted by some mediocre looking CGI explosions, titles and landscapes in the first few opening minutes. Since mediocre CGI has taken over modern movies i was afraid it would be another one of these blockbuster blow-out movies which will be forgotten in about three weeks (which did turn out to happen, but more on that later) that have come out the past decade. It had a lot of action movie clichés, some toe curling one-liners and a standard action movie plot. "But why did i give it a 8/10?" i hear you ask. Well, let me explain.This movie is just plain awesome. Remember the old days, when an action hero fights one villain and explosions ensue? Where the villain gets too close to the protagonist and battle commences a couple of minutes later? Where there is a villain that genuinely believes in his own purpose and is charming and persuasive, instead of that modern day whiny and sad? Yes, i am talking about the 80's, where some appalling summer blockbusters came from, but where the actual birth of true action heroes was. I wasn't yet born back then, but i genuinely believe that that was wad made a awesome movie. I adore this movie as i did a film like "demolition man" when i first saw it.But back to this movie. It breathes every action hero ever in existence, every villain in existence and every bond-ripoff ever in existence. Of course I had to pull the old JB in here (even the movie mentioned JB) but as i see it, anyone that is used to the sludge that was draining from Hollywoods sewers the past decade only sees that because it is a spy movie with a couple of British leading characters. It shows a rather poor sense of movies if you hold it against this movie.The only thing that generally annoyed me was that Samuel L. Jackson spoke the entire movie with a severe lisp. I do not know if that's Jacksons real-life problem, or if it a character trait of the main villain Valentine, but it was exceptionally annoying. If it is some kind of physical problem, i am deeply sorry, and i will not say "what" one more time. Best villain performance ever, though.This films has some problems. But it is the old-school bad-*** action that brings it in my "top 10 of the past decade" list as a nice second. It has only five spots taken now. And the first is still empty. So i hope this new flow of 80's style action movies keeps coming and gives me my number one. Nice try for the Kingsmen now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superspy movies are among the most commonly spoofed, but that doesn't weaken "Kingsman: The Secret Service". Colin Firth once again gets to play a gentleman, while Samuel L. Jackson's megalomaniac businessman is the neatest character in the movie (and yes, he does use the word that Jackson uses in a number of his movies). And then there's a certain actor known as a certain Jedi. It's clear that they knew exactly what kind of a movie they were making, so they just let it be as outlandish as possible. Not a masterpiece, but funny enough to enjoy.PS: The song played at the beginning of the movie is Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing", which "Weird Al" Yankovic spoofed as "The Beverly Hillbillies" for "UHF".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) has gone off the rails since the untimely demise of his father who was working for Kingspan at the time. After getting in trouble with the police, Gary remembers an important number that he can ring at any time he needs it and after ringing this number he is released from prison and becomes friends with Harry Hart (Colin Firth) who is one of the heads of the Kingspan organisation. Harry gives Gary the opportunity to make something of himself and make his father proud of him by joining this secret organisation. but has Gary got what it takes to make him succeed?Yeah I'm prepared to except that this was a little clichéd at the start; a young man has gone off the rails and needs a bit of direction in life, but the way that this aspect of the plot is developed is very well executed. You just can't beat a true gentleman actor like Colin Firth beating up a load of chavs and then returning to his unfinished pint of Guinness. It's wonderfully pompous, but also very insightful at the same time which is a very hard trick to pull off. We then witness a marine core training regime which again in the wrong hands could have come across as boring or dull, but again there is a requisite amount of fun injected in to proceedings, but then we're reminded of the seriousness of the requirements of the Kingspan Service. It works well because it shows the serious nature of the training, but also manages to make light of it at the appropriate moments. The performances across the board are roundly good; Firth does a pompous uppity toff like no other, Caine is Caine and basically phones it in (although Caine phoning it in is still better than watching most other actors trying). Egerton is the star of this show who is an interesting actor - he can play the cockney chav well, but is also surprisingly effective outside of this cliché - he kind of reminded me of Jack O'Connell. Again Geoff Bell is Geoff Bell and is a very much one note actor, but he plays that note very well and is excellent here.Kingsman isn't an obvious and goofy spoof in the way that Johnny English, or Get Smart is (the eventual agents aren't bumbling or inept, but with Kingsman it has more subtle nods and winks to the genre and it was these subtle nods and winks that really had me laughing - the war room scene from Dr Strangelove and the obvious parody of The Spy Who Loved Me towards the end). This is where the film was at its strongest.The only weak aspect of this film lay with Samuel L Jackson as a villain and the entire sub-plot; for starters as much as I like Samuel L Jackson as an actor I could not take to him as a villain here - he wasn't intimidating or funny and that stupid lisp started to get on my nerves after a while. Although his involvement in the story makes sense towards the end, it was a little bit dull for the majority of the running time leaving it up to the rest of the principal cast to keep things moving which thankfully they manage to do with relative ease.Thankfully, more of this works than doesn't and it has enough set-pieces and action sequences to make this an enjoyable picture. Yes it's not entirely successful over its full 120 minutes running time, but it kept me laughing consistently and also had enough heart to it to make you care about the characters all round. Jolly good show!!</fullReview>

KINGSMAN is yet another comic book mess, this time about a South London petty criminal who is given the chance to join a private intelligence agency only to find himself fighting against both class prejudice and a mad dot com genius with an aversion to blood who wants to murder most of the population to save the world from global warming. It's amusing to see a film be disrespectful about Obama and AGW but the film is morally repulsive and stupid. It wants to be a silly but fun globe-trotting adventure like old James Bond films but those films had wit, exotic travel, high living and great stunts whilst this film is crude, stuffed with fake-looking CGI, charmless and has stupid jeopardy-free action scenes; I lost count of just how many times the bad guy's goons had the hero in their sights but missed him. The promised Chad to gentleman transformation never occurs - apparently being comfortable with who you are is what makes a gentleman - with the hero starting as a lout and ending up as a lout in a bespoke suit. What really sinks the film though is its lack of a moral compass. I could complain about the crudity of having a Swedish princess offer anal sex to the hero but the real culprit is the way the film mixes comic book sensibilities with hyper-realistic violence. People are tortured and cut in half without a qualm. Worst of all is a sequence in the middle where a (hate) church full of people are driven mad and kill each other in an orgy of improvised and graphic violence which is shot like an action scene as if it is entertainment and goes on forever. If you want to see Colin Firth brutally and repeatedly stabbing a woman in the stomach then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After surprising with his debut "Layer Cake" which may have been the incentive for outside Craig Bond, he continued with a wonderful story called "Stardust" rescuing a type of adventure that was lost. Then he assumed a revelation in "Kick-Ass", successfully breaking the topics of gender and making us laugh so witty, funny and original, and it was in 2011 when Vaughn created his more commercial work and known to the general public, with the best of the "X-Men" until today.Four years later and after loose films as "Days of Future Past," and "Kick-Ass 2" finally turned a parodic manner by mixing the best of "Kick-Ass" with spy film, breaking stereotypes, laughing at all such situations, much black humor and above all well shot action, see the scene of the church with little cuts. Colin Firth made his first role of bizarre and radical action as a Gentleman with serious style does not get provoked laughter in "Bridget Jones's Diary." Vaughn makes good characters with cool tone that manages to be solvent by overlapping action and humor, with a more serious tone that is becoming more fun with the passage of minutes and then the new young talent Taron Egerton simulating charisma appears Firth. Samuel L. Jackson in an accent more to the " Django Unchained " manages to be a memorable and funny villain with Sofia Boutella. Thanks see veterans like Michael Caine and Mark Hamill in production, and that surprises and really brave and unexpected twists that not all films of this genre manage to do. Henry Jackman also get a scented soundtrack soundtrack by Alan Silvestri for "The Avengers". In conclusion, "Kingsman" is a powerful, powerful film and really rowdy at times to laugh in his macabre and crazy final act, action is intense and funny in humor, an unthinkable mix,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first third of the film I was thinking that this was going to be a poorly constructed &amp; written Bond ripoff with lots of formula action &amp; stereotyping of characters. Supporting that thought was the eye candy and famous name selection of actors, who seemed to fulfill the above formula/stereotyping school-of-acting technique admirably. But then the comic book character spoofing began to emerge and first came with force with a church scene, so outrageous, that I had to cringingly watch again, just to confirm what I was seeing. Eggsy was responsible for about 60 departed poor souls (well they were haters supreme) within the house-of-the-lord no less, and another 40 or so dispatched by fellow church going haters. Add another 100 or so elsewhere and Eggsy surpasses "John Wick" for one person personally sending baddies off to another (better?) life. There was another film, a few years back, of someone cleaning up a semi-abandoned "Projects" development of druggies, but I can't remember the title. That one had similar outrageous numbers. Finally, the coup de grâce, was the July 4 fireworks, with appropriate musical overtures, of the security exploding heads. Disgustingly outrageous. Rivals "Kick Ass" for over-the-top imaginative, albeit fantastical, action scenes. There was one positive message - humans, watch out, Gaia is going to extinguish you if you don't clean up your act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years I have seen many spy-thrillers. The more obvious being the James Bond films based upon the Ian Fleming novels. Each James Bond film has a unique maniacal villain with world domination as his main agenda.This film is no different. Here we have internet billionaire Richmond Valentine(Samuel L. Jackson) who leads a paranoid and selfish existence. He believes the world is doomed by global warming - and the only solution is a worldwide cull. And so, he sets about his plans in gusto.Then we have hero of the film, young Gary "Eggsy" Unwin(Taron Egerton) who leads a sad existence in the ghetto. The death of his father gives him an opportunity to join Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency that fights against terrorist threats.In the film we have the typical gadgets or gizmo's that your average agent needs. We also have the kill sequences similar to the Bond movies, however with updated C.G.I. effects in all their glory. The main factor that makes the film work is that the script is well polished, the action and acting is thoroughly controlled, the cinematography and sound-effects are superb. Some actors shine more than others, here we have Samuel Jackson and Colin Firth as one of the best. Mark Hamill has a small cameo as Professor James Arnold. I hardly recognized him at all. Just by looking at the end credits did I realize that he was in the film. Taron David Egerton makes a good leap from TV into mainstream Hollywood. Matthew Vaughan has made some good films in the past like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000) and directing the films Layer Cake (2004), Stardust (2007), Kick-Ass (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011). He has some similarity in style with other directors like Chris Nolan and Paul W.S. Anderson.Verdict: definitely a good way to pass one and a half hours. But I wouldn't watch the film again. Typical toilet paper film. You may also like: The 39 Steps 1959, North By NorthWest 1959, Torn Curtain 1966, The Ipcress File 1965, The Odessa File 1974, Firefox (1982), The Fourth Protocol 1987, The Bourne Identity 1988, The Russia House (1990), If Looks Could Kill (released in the UK as Teen Agent) 1991, Mission Impossible 1996. Thank you for reading this review. Live long and prosper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mostly watched this movie because I saw so much about it on Tumblr and other places. It was only afterwards I realised Kingsman was directed by Matthew Vaughn, but I shouldn't have been surprised, his style was all over this. And that's definitely a good thing, Vaughn is amazing at action-comedies.Many of the characters were really interesting, really unique. Especially the villain was great. You both can and can't take him seriously. Even the idea of Samuel L. Jackson being cast as a villain who feels sick when he sees even a drop of blood, that is hilarious.The action scenes were amazing. They were little hard to keep a track on, but the little details showed kind of made up for that. The soundtrack is amazing: it's modern electronic action soundtrack meets classic spy movies meets Kick-Ass.The feeling I got afterwards is: I want more. I want more movies like this. Kingsman was fun, exciting and it had a certain charm. Amazing movie, everyone who loved Kick-Ass needs to see Kingsman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By seeing the name of the movie, one expects Bond-Like action.Because, "SPY". Kingsman is a mixture of Bond and other spy movies. This is a surprise movie. Unexpected Fun this is. Kingsman is a worthy watch.There's something that binds you to this movie. The actors, the story-line, gadgets and everything. Whole Heartedly British and amazingly amazing. Colin Firth stand out.The soundtrack, especially at the starting, with "Money For Nothing"playing, was a wise choice to intrigue the viewer's interest. All in all, a good movie, can be watched along with the family. Don't miss this.Thank You.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen the trailer and read a couple of reviews for Kingsman: The Secret Service i wasn't expecting too much from this film but i actually thought it was a lot of fun. Sure , it has quite a few faults ( which film doesn't ? ) and it's extremely silly but the action is very good and at no stage was i bored. It's a cross between Spy Kids , James Bond and Austin Powers and it's strange to see Colin Firth involved in something so left of field but he does a pretty good job. The language is pretty raw through out so it's not something the kids or granny should watch , which is a shame because apart from that and the violence it's a very childish film.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret ServiceThe hardest part of being British secret service is not getting swept up in the royal baby excitement.Thankfully, there's a genocidal maniac in this action movie to keep operatives occupied.Recruited by Galahad (Colin Firth) to test for the Lancelot position on an Arthurian inspired spy ring, street-thug Eggsy (Taron Egerton) quickly proves he's not the ideal candidate.But when a dotcom genius (Samuel L. Jackson) divides the agency and unleashes a device that drives users into a homicidal rage, Eggsy and the remaining agents are the only ones left who can stop him.A stylish send-up of the well-worn British spy-genre ? including the stereotypical gadgets and idiosyncratic villain - this good-humored adaption of the graphic novel may deviate from its source material, but its eye-popping action and sly script more than compensate. Strangely, I always assumed British secret service just took assassin bullets intended for the Queen's corgis. Green Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the hundreds of clichés and no-surprises, this mimic to WANTED was actually ten times more enjoyable than that Angelina Jolie flick. The action is fun, the plot is numb and Sam Jackson's lisp is dumb. But, if you can safely leave your brain at the door, the movie works. Namely because of action Colin Firth and assassin Sofia Boutella. The "lead," Taron Egerton is a ton cute, but his character ? basically a third-tier Captain Kirk from 2009's STAR TREK, was so unbelievable from the get-go, it was too-hard of a sell. Overall, it's a fun action piece that works only because on how silly it is and how much Colin Firth gave Liam Neeson a run for his retirement money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A private club of assassins locks horns with an effete billionaire bent on world depopulation, so the club turns to an underdog recruit to see off the beastly chap.Good acting and pace. Humour is a bit patchy - there's a flash of porn ass at the very end, so clearly Carry On humour just ... carries on. But the final third is a complete riot, from the scene in the church onward - I guess thanks to the director's worship of Hong Kong action films. Colin Firth did his own stunts. LOL. The fights are a bit repetitive in style, although amazing to behold, and it goes full 007 parody in the end. Overall, though, it lacks the satire of the equally ambitious Iron Sky.The problem I have is with the politics. This is a real London film - loads of money to deliver a stylish, full-on neoliberal message that Big Men Rule, democracy and liberty are sideshows. The members of the club might as well be sitting round the cabinet table in Downing Street.At one point the hero says saving Thatcher from assassination was a pity, but Thatcherism runs right through this story. All that east-end stuff? It's a fantasy - a great chunk of London's population has been deported from The Great Wen tax haven in the last 10 years because of neoliberal policies. At least there are clubbable heroes to save us from ... the corporate club.Samantha Janus is still a babe. And did I spot Paloma Faith?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half of this movie felt funny, satirical and action-packed. After Harry died though, the movie took itself too seriously, while also losing the last bit of believability it had. The movie has been compared to Kick-Ass, but I think Kick-Ass was more consistent with it's plot. In this movie everything that this movie began with was abandoned and it took a big turn that was just a little too much. The first half was pretty great though. The performances, sets and general feeling of this movie are really cool though. A Kick-Ass in spy-style indeed, but too big of a change halfway through.</fullReview>

I liked the performance of the actors, but now how the villain was presented. I mean it should be more serious not a childish villain with the stupid idea of exploding heads. Everything about the villain was so awkward, in a bad way... The death of Harry was too sudden.

		<fullReview>From the title alone you know it has something to do with secret agents so before watching better expect some clichés. Everything in the movie is good, except Harry's/Galahad's death in front of the church. In my opinion, his abrupt death is too difficult for me to swallow the fact. I was convinced that he just faked his death (a usual twist in movies) until the closing credits rolls up I realized he's really dead. Besides that, the ending is also not that satisfying. Too clean. World is saved. That's it. The antagonist, Valentine, is a joke almost comical. In fact, nearly every scenes in this movie are satirical. Albeit his ruthless disregard to human life, his solution to global warming nevertheless is practical and creative (I mean in this movie, not applicable to real life). Depopulate human via sim card, thus enable to save the earth from being destroyed by the atrocious and ungrateful species living in it. Almost all presidents and royals agreed to deal with him. I say Valentine is not that bad at all, he's just trying his best to save the world, in a different way.Overall, this movie is just another case of saving world from bad guy by the unsung secret agents. It's nice but am not STRONGLY recommending you this movie. Perhaps you could download it online.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, this is my first review, but this movie deserves it. We have grown up looking up to the stuffy "007" type spy, we can't really relate to. But this movie, oh this movie had it all. A villain who had a righteous cause, a mentor who wished to risk it on the new boy, the music to bring worlds down, and the protagonist. A protagonist who was just a punk till he decided to be awesome instead. Great action sequences, an even better OST and a story that while being plausible, was absolutely bonkers at the same time. There ere some clichéd characters such as the archetypal rich, spoiled kid, but its easy to overlook these.Watch it if you want to save the world while wearing suits, being cooler than Bond, but still kicking ass.</fullReview>

We decided to check out the trailer a few times over to see if it was something that we'd be interested in, of course we finally said "Okay... Let's watch it". I have to say that going to see this movie was fully worth the cost. Kingsman: The Secret Service is quite possibly the best spy comedy that I've saw in a very long time. This movie is filled with spots that will have you laughing out of your chair. The cast for Kingsman: The Secret Service couldn't have been picked any better, these guys gave their all in this movie; I wouldn't have been able to not laugh if I was in their shoes. This movie is funny, and it's packed with action till the very end, great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven, but certainly not dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sitting down to watch "Kingsman: The Secret Service", I had no prior knowledge of the movie except that it was a modern film take on the idea of the British secret service. I don't know what I was expecting, but I didn't expect what I saw. I am not saying that this is a terrible movie. The production values are slick, there are some exhilarating action sequences, and the movie thankfully does not take things completely seriously. However, the comedy and the action really does not mix. The comedy is really goofy at times, while the action is really hard core at times, and the two extremes don't really mix. And at over two hours in length, the movie goes on too long. (I should add that even at that length, there are a few minor plot gaps that suggest some linking footage was cut out or not filmed at all.) But as I said in my summary line, I was not bored. This movie is a matter of taste; I can see why some people would not like it. Who would like it? I think those who are fans of the sometimes over the top action/comedy cinema coming out of Hong Kong would best appreciate this film. You've been warned (or given a recommendation.)</fullReview>

The wife was on Facebook within the hour, and I ended up watching it in another room as she found the violence too gratuitous.However, I loved it! By all accounts, I should hate Colin Firth with his overly upper-class British accent. But he really holds this film together. I do wonder what it would have been like without him.I knock a star off because I did get annoyed with some of the accents (the cockney barrow-boy levels were turned up to 11). Eggsy's trainee compatriots were far too predictably nasty as well.The villains concept worked for me, although you do have to "go with it" a fair bit. I don't believe the film takes itself too seriously, so neither should the viewer.I think a good acid test of a film is if you'd want to watch it again... And I have. There's one scene in particular worth a second watch. Those that have seen it will know which one I mean! Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The gentleman-image returns to spy-movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday evening I had the opportunity to finally sit down and watch this movie, which I had already heard many positive things about. Firstly, if you are looking for a serious and realistic spy-movie filled with heightened moral points, I suggest you go see something else. However, if you are ready to accept some breaks of realism and some hard language, this movie is a gem in its genre. The humor is cheeky without being ridiculous (which for me is in fine keeping with these Kingsmen being gentlemen). The main character's development throughout the story was, for me, also believable and Colin Firth's performance as secret agent was spot-on. In its entirety, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" has many of those clichés involving the anti-hero becoming super-hero, but the thing that makes this movie stand out, is its "return to the roots while reinventing them"-ability. In its hay-day, James Bond was a perfect portrayal of this gentleman-spy who always knew what to say and who was always a step smarter than the next guy. However, in recent years (for me) James Bond has become more "rough", in the sense that he rarely wears suits anymore and has become more of a soldier than a gentleman-spy. Not saying the movies aren't still good, but many of those elegant gentleman-moments has gone away. Therefore, it is lovely to be reminded that the gentleman-approach to the spy-genre is still achievable and possible. It is lovely to watch a movie again, which is packed with superior one-liners and gadgets disguised as everyday-items. The movie gets 9 stars from me, because I was entertained throughout it all, entranced by the action, stunned by the cinematography and because it returns to many of the origins, from which spy-movies came, while also throwing some modernity into the mix along with a clever eye for use of clichés - and also knowing when to break them. So - before you go see the new "Spectre" and agree with yourself that this is how spy-movies should be, give this one a try :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Enjoyable! 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: For some unknown reason, my expectations for this movie really wasn't that high and I wasn't that impressed with the footage that I had seen on the trailers but now that I've watched it, I am quite impressed. The action scenes were great, especially when Firth was kicking butt in the church and the storyline really wasn't that bad. The transformation of the rude boy to a suit wearing secret agent was also brilliant and I definitely want some of those gadgets. Anyway, the film is about an undercover agency (Kingsman), who are on the hunt for a new spy to join there exclusive intelligence organisation so the individual agents take on an apprentice to train them up. Colin Firth takes on his fellow agents son, who sadly died whilst saving his squad so Firth feels obliged to give his son a chance to join there elite group. Whilst going through training, a billionaire tech genius (Jackson) threatens to take over the world by installing chips into mobile phones and giving them to people for free, so time is not on the agents side. By the time that the training is coming to a close and there are only 2 candidates left, the tech genius starts to cause violence around the world so the agency has no choice but to step in and save the world. I know that it sounds weird, but it's actually quite clever. It has a type of Bond/Mission Impossible flavour which has enough drama and action to keep you entertained from the beginning to the end. I'm usually impressed with Jacksons performances but he didn't seem to fit in this movie. His weird lisp and gangsta clothing was out of place but the other characters were great, especially Colin Firth who had total faith in his apprentice. I also liked Mark Strong, who helped the agents along the way and Michael Caine was a great touch as the head of the elite group. Anyway, I really enjoyed this film and the epic ending was brilliantly put together. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although this movie cost a hell of a lot of money to make, you can really see were every penny went and it truly deserved the money it made at the box office. Its the first major role from the 25 year old Taron Egerton, who also starred in Testament Of Youth and has a major role in the upcoming Eddie the Eagle movie. Its directed by Matthew Vaughn who brought you Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, Stardust and Layer Cake and you can definitely see traits of Kick-Ass in this movie. The attention to detail is brilliant, especially during the action scenes and he covered many aspects with the cleverly written storyline. I just hope that they can get a cast as good as this, if they come out with a sequel! Anyway, it amazing to think that Samuel L. Jacksons movies have nearly grossed over $4.5 Billion dollars, with the Avengers being his highest earner at $625million. At 66 years old and with Nick Fury, Black Phantom and Tarzan in the pipeline, he truly is the hardest working man in Hollywood.Budget: $81million Worldwide Gross: $405millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedy movies about a secret agency who recruits a street kid to save the world from a billionaire, tech expert. 7/10</fullReview>

You can feel the density of Britishness in this film. Spy toys are much more convincing than Bond's but the film based on a comic book so there are some computer graphics that made it a bit more cartoon like. Fight scenes, which I loved most, combined with creative camera angles and right soundtracks made it very interesting to watch again and again. Sure, you can guess the plot as it's Bond style film but who cares, it's supposed to be easy to watch anyway. And man!, Colin Firth can FIGHT WITH STYLE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is the movie adaptation of Mark Millar's comic of the same name. I've never even heard of it for some reason (I am something of a "comic aficionado" and me not hearing about a comic notable and popular enough to be adapted is practically unprecedented), but I'll definitely be on the lookout for it.This is a fun movie through and through, taking the spy genre and absolutely flipping it on its head. It basically does what it wants in the name of style.It has a fantastic musical score, the best of the year, thus far. The special effects are a mixed bag; some are fugly and others look nice.There's plenty of comedy to be had and even the action sequences reflect that. Dialogue is well-crafted and snappy.Acting is well-done and it has an all-star cast, including Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. Characters all seem pretty different and we'll brought together.Action sequences would be very good if it weren't for CGI and too much slow-motion, but this problem is fixed for the most part towards the end of the film.Kingsman is a fun movie that wears its uniqueness on its sleeve. This movie is definitely worth a 9/10, at least for me. It's fun and has no major pacing problems, but I feel action sequences are a bit weak for a movie that should rely on it. Best movie I've seen this year, so far.&#xfeff;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A 'Our Man Flint' or 'In like Flint' for the modern age. This movie has been compared to 'Kickass' and I totally get that, I loved the 'Kickass' movies, but this is SOoooo way over the top that when it got to the bit where the agent is split (with no blood to be seen), I was reaching for the turn off button. What is this rubbish? But....I kept watching, and was glad I did, the cartoon violence is relentless, and the scene in the church both entertaining and hilarious. The clichés come thick and fast and reference 'Pulp Fiction' 'Bladerunner' 'The Matrix' 'James Bond' and a thousand others. Some of the actors have long outstayed their welcome and it seems that they will do anything for a fast buck, Samuel L. Jackson is just irritating, and does Michael Caine really need the money? However the main complaint is the constant foul language(Hollywood scriptwriters should really be told to lay off the constant 'M*****F****R', and 'F**K YOU' and 'A**F****R', as it is becoming impossible to watch any film without having to endure a barrage of the 'F' word), and the final 'Up the A**' scene was just too much, why did they have to put that in at the end to spoil it? But i was entertained and the girl villain 'Gazelle' played by Sofia Boutella was a great creation and really well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? Excellent job, mister Vaughn!This hits the right balance between good humor, nice brutal action, some depth and length. As this movie is more than two hours, this could have been a yawner towards the end, but it keeps delivering and going. The cast is great, mr. egerton does a good job as the kid, mr. firth in his typical British style does a great spy. You really get attached to these guys. I have to say I had to get used to the bad guy as played by mr. jackson. Especially the lisp, bit too much. But the crazy, self-righteous nerd with cap is a great deviation from the typical spy bad guy.Everything is in a way classical, but he takes it to a new level, style-wise. As also seen in his other movies. I can't wait for the next one!I doff my hat to you, sir Vaughn!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Kingsman: The Secret Service" (2014) is superbly crafted action comedy with some spoof elements. Acting was solid, action scenes weer superb in it's silliness and craziness. The plot is good for this kind of picture, and special effects were really good. The first training scene with water was the best one - great sequence. Maybe the ending felt kinda simple and generic, but maybe that was the point.Overall, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is very entertaining picture. Don't take it to seriously and you will definitely enjoy this movie. It's not as a great as "Kick-Ass" (first movie), but it's a very solid entertainment.</fullReview>

That's just ridiculous.So many factors start to bring down this film after about 30 minutes, it has a Jackie Chan meets The Avengers kinda twist to it. It's just unwatchable from the middle towards the end. Couldn't finish the movie without yawning a couple of times.The only serious and good idea in the film was the Camelot lineup, but they did everything they could to completely destroy it.The category of this film is just a bit above Spy Kids.What a waste of Colin Firth's awesome talent.Could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Judge a Movie by Its Trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Matthew Vaughn as a director, I absolutely loved Kick-Ass, but the trailer for this film didn't seem that enticing to me. It didn't show much of the great action within the film, but rather focused on the ONE scene in which Colin Firth fights with an umbrella, which I thought was extremely lame. Within fifteen minutes of the start of the film, I was really engaged in the movie, jaw dropping when a guy was literally cut in half.I immediately thought it would be ridiculously fun just like Kick- Ass, and it was! The second act is a typical spy movie training session with a few good twists and turns. The people at Kingsman put the young candidates through hell in order to test their limits and loyalty, which provide some of the best moments of the film.Samuel L Jackson makes for a good villain, but with a really annoying lisp that didn't seem necessary for the film. The only reason I can think of for that lisp is to make for a somewhat ridiculous villain who is simultaneously ruthless.One of the most exciting scenes of the film is one in which a massive brawl occurs in a church, and the fight is done in a few long takes, choreographed to the beat of Free Bird in the background. It is one of the best executed action sequences I have seen in years. Also, the third act is just really ridiculous and fun that you just have to see it for yourself.I wanted to see this movie eventually because of Matthew Vaughn, but I was so wrong to expect less of this movie due to the trailer. The very last moment of the movie is said to be controversial, but I thought it was a great way to wrap up such a ridiculous film. It made sense when it was said in an interview the ending was paying an homage to sexual jokes at the end of James Bond flicks or North by Northwest.</fullReview>

Great storyline, great humor, and the action scenes are top notch. I am a fan of spy movies and it was nice to see this one take it up a notch. Highly recommended. Colin Firth delivers a great performance in both the action scenes and in his delivery of humor. this was the first time I've got to see Taron Egerton in anything. I see a great future ahead of this young man. He delivered the humor, action and storyline like he was built for this part. I would love to see him in a sequel of this movie. Sam Jackson is... well Sam Jackson. He always delivers a great performance in both action and comedy. He was a very fitting villain for this movie. All in all, I highly recommend this movie for anyone that likes spy/action movies .</fullReview>

After having watched Kingsman, I am happy to change the for myself wrt ranking imo. A total eye-candy, and a complete blockbuster. The direction is worth applauding.

		<shortDescription>A Mess But A Matthew Vaughn Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing LAYER CAKE all these years ago I was instantly struck that a new and important director called Matthew Vaughn had arrived on the British film making scene and Vaughn was a name to keep an eye out for , same as Danny Boyle was from a decade earlier. Since then Vaughn hasn't made enough films and the ones he has made are entertaining enough mixing black comedy and violent but live up to the cliché of close but no cigar and KINGSMAN continues the Vaughn resume in the Vaughn style So what's KINGSMAN about you ask ? How about "Bond deconstructionist comic book adventure done in a British tongue in cheek style" ? Maybe not an entirely accurate description but KINGSMAN is a very difficult film to pigeon hole . In feel it's similar in some ways to KICK-ASS but in many ways it isn't similar and I wonder if I mentioned KICK-ASS down to the same production team being responsible for that film ? The story itself revolves a lower working class nobody called Eggsy who lives on a dead end London estate and is recruited by an offshoot of the British secret service to foil the plans of an international villain called Valentine . It's not all that original and the tone of the film isn't entirely successful or consistent but like LAYER CAKE the story itself is a bit of a mess . This is hardly surprising for a film that often veers from meta-fictional Bond or Bourne far fetched globe trotting adventure to a British grief porn kitchen sink drama . What stops it all falling apart is the sense of fun and kinetic energy Vaughn injects in to the film in general and the cast in particular . Any movie that has Firth , Caine and Jackson as the leading lights is worth watching for that reason alone and that trio don't disappoint though Mark Strong's annoying unconvincing Scottish accent is a distraction .We occasionally hear rumours about a big budget silver screen version of DOCTOR WHO and I wonder if Matthew Vaughn would be the natural choice to direct that quirky , unique and uniquely British show ? And some of the plot turns are so far fetched they wouldn't be out of place in DOCTOR WHO . Colin Firth as The Doctor versus Samuel L Jackson as The Master ! Sign me up for a ticket now , though please no swearing and get Russell T Davies to do the screenplay instead of Jane Goldman Regardless of what Vaughn does in the future he's still a name to keep an eye on and here's hoping he's making films for years to come</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gary "Eggsy" Unwin, whose late father secretly worked for a spy organisation, lives in a South London housing estate and seems headed for a life of crime, and ultimately, prison. However, dapper agent Harry Hart recognises potential in the youth and recruits him to be a trainee in the secret service. Meanwhile, villainous Richmond Valentine launches a plan to solve the problem of climate change via a worldwide killing spree.......The plot could come from any Bond Movie, or even Austin Powers, megalomaniac designs a free SIM card that when activated, causes homicidal tendencies, thus bringing down the worlds population. But when you read it in black and white, it's just too bizarre for Bond, and too dark for Powers, even though when watching this,you cannot help but compare spys.Vaughn proved with his first movie, he is a competent film maker, and with this, he proves again that he hasn't put a step wrong.It's a visceral experience, mixing working class with upper class, but once we get into the training, Goldman goes down the predictability route with the writing, so their are no surprises with this aspect of the narrative. The posh boys and Eggsy have the obligatory confrontation, the leader of the posh boys gets his comeuppance, and as expected,MIT isn't plain sailing for our hero.But that's just a minor quibble in what otherwise is a highly original spy movie, with some awe inspiring set pieces (the church scene is up there with John Wicks Club scene as one of the cinematic highlights of the year), and the characters are brilliantly portrayed.Firth is brilliant as a bad-ass version of himself, Jackson is hilarious as the pseudo Steve Jobs, and even Mark Strong excels as what only can be described as the films Yoda to Firths Obi Wan.The controversy of the final 'joke' is justified, and although it's supposed to be a parody of all those innuendo laden Bond final scenes, it falls flat and leaves you with a bitter taste, slightly detracting you from what otherwise is a truly brilliant movie.So it's well worth seeing, it's so good to see such a daring, original blockbuster do so well, among the ever increasing pond of autonomous blockbusters that swarm the cinemas nowadays....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comic book James Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that the film entertained me quite a lot. All actors were very good and the direction was almost flawless. If you are looking for the cellphone version of James Bond, this is the film for you. In Kingsman you find the origin story for a young adult secret service spy that then gets taken completely over the top with funky suits, weird gadgets that are used only once, the occasional dry pun and lots and lots of violence.I think Colin Firth was the right man for the job, as was Samuel L. Jackson as the villain. Probably Jackson just stopped one day and said "I am just going to have a lot of fun for the rest of my life". Young Taron Egerton was the main character and he performed well for his relatively short career, but let's admit it: Firth and Jackson made this movie.The problem with this comic book based film is that it feels just like a comic book. You get the archetypal Harry Potter that discovers that he is the son of special people and he is taken to the magical school for secret spies, destined to fight and defeat the evil man that should not be named, but we know is Sam Jackson. It is a children story, no matter how you take it.Bottom line: entertaining, but mindless fun. It made me wish for a deep and dark origin story for the likes of Jason Bourne: their recruitment, their training, the real alienation and mind programming, the kills and the failures and their consequences. Alas, it was just a funky JB. Best quote: "I'll have a Martini. With gin, not vodka, obviously. Stirred for ten seconds while staring at a bottle of unopened vermouth."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely not for everyone. You might see it as a fun, over-the-top cross between Quentin Tarantino and James Bond, with the best damn ending you've ever seen; or you might see it as a crude, fake-looking mess that has one of the worst endings you've ever seen. People seem pretty split about it. As for me: I'm in the former category. I freaking loved this movie! I can really enjoy a self-aware campy gore-fest like this. But, if you don't like it, that's fine. I can see why some people would be disappointed. Though, this movie is not at all worthy of 1s and 2s. You aren't going to sound contradictory if you give a 6/10 and say you still didn't like it. I can admit that Big Hero Six was a good movie, but I still didn't like it as much, and that's perfectly fine. So, if you enjoy seeing Colin Firth kicking unfathomable amounts of ass, it's definitely worth seeing. But, if you aren't a fan of over-the-top action and gore, then go ahead and give it a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had some expectations when I read some reviews but unfortunately I am not completely satisfied. I expected a much more clever story and it delivered two brutal sequences. I don't know why so much blood must flow here. Perhaps you know what I mean. Or am I wrong because I have to understand the British humor? Is this really British humor? Okay, there were some funny jokes but the special effects I didn't like. I prefer rather the Johnny English series with Mister Bean even if there isn't so much woman sex appeal. I will not see the second part if there will ever be a sequel. I find the votes too overrated here. My colleague found it also not so top. For all these reasons I don't give more than 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocrity Disguised in a Shining Suit of Action and some Irony.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A crazy, implausible, over-the-top storyline that is neither original nor particularly intriguing, except for some genre-typical twists, clad in a superb, tailored action-suit with the license to be self-ironic.Kingsman works as a rather violent "Kick-Ass" version of a James Bond spoof having a slight touch of Austin Powers.Colin Firth handles his first engagement as action hero surprisingly well since his gallant stiffness matches the character he portrays in the movie, so that all in all he did not need to change much for this role in relation to the previous roles he played; in fact his character only gets really interesting in the moments when he briefly forgets about his good manners and starts wreaking havoc.His juvenile protégé and spy-in-training "Eggsy" (T. Egorton) is certainly the most (or rather the sole) psychologically complex character in the movie because he is the only one undergoing an inner development from a Hooligan nobody to a Gentleman hero.However, they both are somewhat overshadowed by the lisping Samuel L. Jackson and this certainly just because of his funny lisping which makes him one of the most bizarre movie villains since "Jaws" in James Bond."Gazelle" (Sofia Boutella), the razor-harp woman and bodyguard on his side, entertains as a dangerous mixture of "Cherry Darling" from "Planet Terror" and "Gogo Yubari" from "Kill Bill".Politically incorrect killing sprees and fast-paced close-combat fighting scenes together with caricatural characters and one or two laughs constitute the fun factor of this movie which might not be enough for a more demanding viewer who has seen tons of movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally took my gf to the theater after hearing positive reviews about it for weeks, and was somewhat disappointed.To start with the movie plot didn't quite connect, at some point it moved too fast and at some point it jumped to conclusions leaving out a lot of details and loose ends untied. Wait, I thought this was supposed to be a comedic action movie? I probably loosed a chuckle in the first 30 minutes of the movie and that was it. Action wise, granted, there were a few nicely made scenes with new perspectives and camera angles, but they did not save me from talking in my head "is the movie almost over so I can go to the bathroom?". In addition, you may heard from some that there was a lot of bloody gore, but I didn't like it even though I sit through the two 300 movies perfectly fine, bottom word, unnecessary. Lastly, I don't think I can take another movie with Samuel Jackson in it 24/7.I usually regard any movie with an 8 or above to be a must-watch, 7.5 for some categories, but there were some really disappointing movies out there lately (The Imitation Game, for example). These movies aren't total disasters, but they weren't cream of the crop either. Overall I think this movie deserves a 6 rather than an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Panders too much, subverts too little.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is the type of film that wants to be special, but it's anything but. This isn't another Austin Powers level parody of a beloved sub-genre, for better or for worse. While Bond has added the grit as of late, Kingsman tries its best to emulate it in the action and as a result, it's a film that panders too much and subverts too little. Its idea of what you least expect is a lisping Samuel L. Jackson who serves McDonald's for dinner. Nevertheless, it is enjoyable entertainment if your brain is firmly switched off. It has a nasty habit of plummeting characters into situations that are only really interesting in hindsight of their twists and as a result, they're unsatisfying until the reveal, including the now infamous church sequence. Matthew Vaughn is good at bringing a little bit of Hollywood back home so it is often cinematic though hit-and-miss with its sense of style. The film does do one thing intelligently and that's the illustration of class conflict. But the controversial joke near its end shows the standards its reaching for. Ultimately, Kingsman tries to be a franchise starter without starting with enough of worth. Beats a normal comic book adaptation I guess.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British spies are so cool. They always dress sharp. They act like perfect gentlemen. Every little thing on their persons is some kind of hidden weapon or device. They always defeat the henchmen, save the world from megalomaniac supervillains, and get the girl in the end. With Kingsman, Matthew Vaughn uses the standard British spy movie schtick to distill all the best elements of his previous films: a little bit of the training scenes from X-Men: First Class, a large portion of the ultraviolence and attitude from Kick-Ass, maybe a drop of the hard-hitting drama from Layer Cake, and voila, we have a martini that's far more shaken than stirred.Even though the film may seem derivative, it's still a total blast from beginning to end. The action is very stylish and incredible; the fight scenes are expertly-choreographed and filmed in a way that shoves it all in your face (in a manner that reminded me much of the way The Raid 2 was staged). As the film progresses, less and less is held back, and the film paints a colorfully brutal picture of the fantasy of being a British spy. A few scenes - the pub fight, the church scene, the fight with the main henchman, and a certain scene involving microchip implants - are incredible on their own and make the movie a must-see for anybody who can handle them.I thought the story was good and well-told. It wastes little time in establishing a great cast of characters we can relate to and enjoy, going so far as weaving inspiring themes of what being a gentleman really means. The story strikes an excellent pace and it shows exactly everything it needs to for the plot to unfold and reach its incredible climax. It is a very dense and fulfilling tale.The subtext, unfortunately, is where certain wires are crossed and it can leave some viewers feeling confused. This is a movie that often mocks the conventions of other spy movies (including the original James Bond series), but the film plays out in all the same conventions, making it feel rather hypocritical. Same goes for the violence; the film's shock value should make it appalling, but most of it could be seen as a glorification. Kick-Ass had these same issues as well, but the contrast between tone and content made it more successful at being darkly comedic. With Kingsman, the contrast is not as strong, and it's hard to tell what stance it's supposed to take on these issues.The film looks sharp, with decent photography and very punchy editing. A few of the action scenes are pretty fast-cut and have some shaky cam, but this is a rare case where I felt the frenetic nature of the scenes worked to the film's advantage. Acting is swell; the whole cast is colorful and enjoyable to watch. There is a ton of unnecessary swearing, but otherwise the script is great. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are sometimes good, sometimes so-so. The soundtrack is great too.Kingsman is more outlandish than James Bond, gutsier than Jason Bourne, meaner than Jack Bauer. It's also colorful and nutty, a bit like 1998's Avengers, but far more successful at it. What makes it work is that it still has loads of style and action, but still tells a decent story. If you can handle the film's extremities, it's well worth the time.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody good fun . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may someday come to pass that when I get around to making a list of the best action movies I've ever seen, The Kingsman: The Secret Service may find itself right there in the midst of other greats like Die Hard, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Speed, Aliens and The Terminator. After the blight of a worthless movie like Taken 3, here is the kind of action picture I've been hungry for, a whip-smart, clever movie that goes where the James Bond pictures won't dare and turns out the kind of cheeky British humor that the ill-fated Avengers adaptation a decade ago aspired to be.What is contained here is based on a comic book that, I'll admit, has completely escaped me. Maybe that's a good thing, I'm of the opinion that the best way to experience this film is to go in (as I did) completely cold. From here I must get into the plot, so if you want to stop here and pick it up once you've seen it, I'll understand. At any rate, The Kingsman are an underground espionage agency modeled after King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table ? even going so far as to use Lancelot and Galahad as code names ? their leader is, of course, Arthur (Michael Caine). Housed in an ordinary-looking Savile Row tailor shop, the group operates outside the will of the Queen or the government. So, much like the Men in Black, they remain invisible.The rule of The Kingsman is that when one of their agents is killed in action, the process of recruiting a replacement is set in motion. That comes courtesy of an opening scene in which one of their agent is killed in the line of duty while trying to rescue a kidnapped scientist (Mark Hamill) setting off the hunt for a replacement which falls into the hands of agent Harry Hart (Colin Firth) whose code name is Galahad. He puts the offer to a street punk named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who lives at home with his mom and abusive stepdad and is in desperate need of a direction in life. He's also the son of a fallen Kingsman agent, so Harry figures he's got the blood for it. During training, the other more well-to-do young recruits snicker at this kid from the slums until he shows that he's adept after several training sequences like the one in which their barracks is flooded at night, and later they are forced to skydive only to be informed that one of them is packing fatally light.Of course, this wouldn't be a spy movie without a diabolical plot. That comes courtesy of a goofball American megalomaniac named Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, sporting a lisp) who offers up the technology of tomorrow with the fervor of Steve Jobs. He was formerly dedicated to saving the environment, but discovered that human beings were the problem and is set on offering a cell phone app that will remove that threat all-together by triggering the rage center of our brains. Harry discovers this while attending a redneck church in which the congregation goes completely berserk leading to the film's best scene ? an absolutely brilliant ten minutes of pure balletic slaughter as Harry destroys the entire congregation with whatever is handy. It's beautifully put-together scene that deserves comparison with some of the best action scenes in movie history.The Kingsman: The Secret Service is the kind of movie that a breath of fresh air after all the carbon copies, dead serious retreads and half-baked crime movies. Here's is a movie that references other action movies without winking to the camera and one-ups all the basic clichés of a James Bond picture, up to and including the scene in which Harry has dinner with the villain, and the two trade on their desire to live the life they've seen in all the spy movies, James Bond and otherwise. Valentine even comes equipped with a Bond-like henchman, a gorgeous but deadly Algerian assassin named Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) whose weapon of choice are a pair of razor sharp prosthetic blades.It is hard to really put this movie into words. It's something that must be experienced ? and I can only hope that in the midst of the fury over the dull-as-dirt Fifty Shades of Grey that audiences will discover this little gem. It's the kind of movie that's just plain fun. It's very funny and also amazingly adept at action scenes that you can't say you've seen before. There is no run-of-the-mill here. It is at once a comedy, and then it's a perfect action movie, set to the tune of the kind of very British tone that we Americans have been in love with since "Monty Python's Flying Circus" was imported in the 70s. It is directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose pen has been responsible for some of the better X-Men pictures. He and his writing partner Jane Goldman obviously had a ball putting this movie together. They've created a fun movie, a great comedy, a great action movie that gets rolling, keeps it's eye on the road, and doesn't stop for anything.</fullReview>

How?The winning recruit was afraid of parachuting/heights. For this reason she would not have passed selection.Chester King's scar would have been noticed by the other Kingsmen.Valentine's mansion was too low key.The Kingsmen fitting room would not be available to the public. Doing so would compromise security.Some of the strongest aspects of the film were Colin Firth and Michael Kane, but they were killed off.'Killing the dog' exercise was counter productive if they didn't want automaton.During the head exploding scenes (which were monotonous) most victims remained standing...and there was no blood (certificate 18).The scenes with Eggsy shooting arctic camouflaged soldiers in the tunnels, was monotonous and looked low budget (like we were seeing the same small set cut to look large).Mark Strong's accent was not identifiable.The finale was not spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hello fellow movie goers.I too very much enjoyed this flic. I felt the same way as when I saw the first 007 for the first time some, uh, 50 years ago.All business alternating with dry sardonic wit. Technology. Comic book ambiance. Absurd though it all is it came together very well.The action scenes were well done even if just a little long (very little). The good guys were as good as the bad guys were bad. I loved it.Sure, some people will rip it; there always haters and naysayers but I'm not telling you what YOU will experience but what I experienced.I may pay another $5US to see this on the big screen again.As always, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the previews of this film, i wasn't sure if i would like it. ( i thought all the good bits were in the previews)But what a great film, it just keeps you entertained all the way too the end. Colin Firth pulled off a blinder as a Kingsman, as did Taron Egeton (from The Smoke) as his young protégé. The story moves along at a good pace without to many slow bits, and with some very good funny bits thrown in for good luck as well.After what has been coming out of America this year, this was a welcome change. I hope we get too see more British movies coming out as a result of this.Best movie i have seen so far this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is a fantastic film, fast paced, funny, and serious in the same instance. Colin Firth as the "mentor" to the main character was awesome, far different from the usual type of character he plays; sophisticated and cool.Taron Egerton (who plays the lead - "eggsy") Filled the role perfectly, his character being a "chav" with an high IQ and natural athleticism, has fallen 'off the rails' and finds himself in trouble with the law (before he knew about Kingsman, that is).Every other character was played well, with a list of great actors including Samuel L Jackson (as the super villain), and Michael Cane.Overall a very good film, exceeded already high expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME X AWESOME = Kingsman the Secret Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best spy movie you will ever see. it is like all bond movies had sex and produced this.During a raid in the Middle East in 1997, a probationary secret agent sacrifices himself to save his team. Feeling guilt over the loss of his comrade, Harry Hart, code-named "Galahad," personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow, Michelle Unwin, and his young son, Gary "Eggsy", saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message.Seventeen years later, Professor James Arnold is kidnapped by unknown assailants, led by Internet billionaire Richmond Valentine and his henchwoman Gazelle. One of Hart's compatriots, "Lancelot," attempts to stage a rescue, but fails. Valentine, known for his philanthropy, continues to meet with various heads of state and VIPs; some of whom go missing afterwards. He also announces a giveaway of SIM cards, granting free cellular and Internet access.In London, Eggsy is now an unemployed young adult living with his mother, infant half-sister, and abusive stepfather Dean. Despite being intelligent and capable, he left training for the Royal Marines and lives an aimless life. After being arrested for stealing a car and taking it for a joyride, Eggsy calls the number on the back of the medal. Hart arranges for his release and tells Eggsy about the existence of Kingsman, a secret intelligence agency for which both he and Eggsy's late father worked. In the wake of Lancelot's death, the agency opens a vacancy for a new agent, and Eggsy agrees to apply. He joins a group of other candidates, including a woman named Roxy. Training is overseen by "Merlin," a senior Kingsman that acts as teacher, quartermaster, pilot and Ops coordinator. The candidates are eliminated one by one until Eggsy and Roxy emerge as the final two. However, Eggsy fails his final test, and Roxy becomes the new Lancelot.During this time, Kingsman have been investigating Valentine in connection with the VIP disappearances and notes that Arnold is no longer missing. Hart tracks down Arnold and confronts him about his abduction. A chip implanted in Arnold's head explodes, killing him; Hart is injured during his escape from unknown assailants. Undeterred, Hart poses as a billionaire and dines with Valentine to try to discern his plans.Hart tracks Valentine to an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, where Valentine and Gazelle are conducting a test. They broadcast a signal to his SIM cards, causing everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent. A mass brawl breaks out, with Hart the sole survivor, while Eggsy, Merlin and Arthur?the Kingsman's leader?watch via video link. Valentine approaches Hart and kills him without revealing his plan.Eggsy returns to the Kingsman headquarters, where he discovers that Arthur is one of Valentine's converts. Arthur explains Valentine's views: humanity is akin to a virus, and global warming is the Earth's equivalent of a fever. Valentine intends to kill the virus before it kills the host, broadcasting his signal worldwide to cause a massive culling of the human race. Only a select few that Valentine has deemed worthy of living ? those who have sided with him and thus received the protective microchips in their heads, and the VIPs he kidnapped ? will be spared.After avoiding Arthur's attempt to kill him ? killing the group leader as he does so ? Eggsy teams up with Roxy and Merlin. Roxy pilots a high-altitude balloon vehicle into the stratosphere to disrupt Valentine's satellite network with a missile, while Eggsy and Merlin directly assault Valentine's mountain bunker. Roxy knocks out the satellite and Eggsy fights his way through Valentine's security forces, while Merlin detonates the security chips, killing all who were part of Valentine's plan. Eggsy then fights and defeats Gazelle before killing Valentine and saving the world.In a mid-credits scene, Eggsy, now a full Kingsman, reaches out to his mother, offering her a nicer house and a chance to get away from Dean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It may sound "out there", but I think this is in contention for the best spy movie of all time. While the original James Bond films certainly take that title, the modern ones have become a disappointment to the sub-genre, and this humorous film took me back to seeing the originals. It had everything that made them classics, and more. Along with hilarious side-splitting comedy, it added a neat plot twist, some fantastic action sequences and remarkable special effects. Samuel L. Jackson was the perfect villain, and I would commend the younger actors for a performance that will hopefully put them into the limelight for some larger appearances. Perhaps my only criticism is the lack of development in the romantic interests that were clearly evident in the film. The movie teases and taunts, hinting at a relationship which never comes to fruition. But I take no shame in saying that I left the cinema with tears in my eyes, giggling at the perfection of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was something that had me at a lost for words. I say that because normally out of country movies or shows bore me to death. But this movie with the action, violence and comedy all in one, definitely changed my perspective and gave me more of an open mind for British movies and shows. I am really glad I watched this movie, Samuel Jackson literally had me laughing the whole time especially with his lisps. This movie also had me entertained with the fight scene when the one man fought about 40 people in the church and had to overcome the battle. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and the plot twists. It definitely took me by shock when certain characters were killed. I loved it definitely a thumbs up from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely FUN! A Marriage of James Bond &amp; Pulp Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a movie of this quality, it is quite easy to set aside technical- physical impossibles and just settle in for the ride. It was so over the top funny that the technical goofs only made it more hilarious than not. The music was powerfully fun, the acting and Brit street lingo was great, and quite simply, I had to watch it several times because I kept recommending it to friends and family. It only slowed down--for me--during the last "phase" of 20% or so. The scene at the backward church in Kentucky was epic!Set in the UK's London, the street lingo the Brits (apparently) use was entertaining all by itself and I learned a few more expressions from our British friends. The two-finger'd "flick-off" the Brits use was also accurate--allegedly originating from the British Longbow shooters of the middle-ages who were so hated by their enemies, having their bow fingers cut off was just the beginning of their punishment if captured. I watched the film in the USA and in Italy, though the Italian audiences seemed more muted in their response, perhaps because the type of humor (guns, bombs, etc.) doesn't get them as much?</fullReview>

I've seen virtually all of Vaughn's previous films ("STARDUST", "KICK-A**", and "X-MEN: FIRST CLASS), but this one assures his place among one of Hollywood's best filmmakers. This high-tech espionage action-comedy-thriller has great acting, a highly involving story, and (best of all) over-the-top action and violence. I actually gave this film a standing ovation, and I don't give that to a lot of films I go see. I highly recommend "KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE". It delivers more than it promises, and it is one of the most entertaining films of this or any other year.</fullReview>

In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. = a perfect 10 "This movie will be to Bond what Kick-Ass 2010 is to superhero movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was way better than I thought. I thought it was going to be some goofy film only a child or someone with no taste in the art of cinema would enjoy. It was action packed, what I really like, and a bit funny at times. As for the hero, villain, gadgetry, and plot goes this film is kind of James Bondish but it has its many twists which makes it different from James Bond films. The characters in this film were great. Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) made for a pretty good villain, but Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) wasn't really the hero that I expected. To me he was a little punk because he failed the last test in what would have made him a Kingsman. It wasn't because he didn't have the ability or didn't know how to complete the test it was simply because he let his feelings get in the way of becoming something way greater than what he was. Harry Hart / Galahad (Colin Firth) was the real hero of the film. He was wiser and played everything cool without being brash and flashy. In the opening scene I was excited to see Professor Arnold (Mark Hamill), being that I'm a preDisney Star Wars Fan. It was a big surprise for me to see Luke Skywalker appearing in another huge film like this one. My favorite character would have to be Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). She was literally a cut above the rest as far as villains go! I mean she was bad! Overall this is a great film. As I said before, it is kind of James Bondish. British secret service men who has their headquarters in a fake tailor shop who are fighting against a villain who is trying to take down the population in order to preserve the earth and at the same time detonating a chip in some of the world's leaders and elite's heads killing them. Now, their heads exploding was a nice touch in the film, but I didn't really care how everyone's heads exploded in sync with Edward Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance". That was a bit far-fetched. Oh yeah, those of you who will enjoy or enjoyed seeing Barack Obama's head exploding, that's the only time you will see something like that ever happening to him, is in a highly fictional, highly fantasized two hours and nine minutes Adidas commercial.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic fun spy film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my fears about this movie. It was delayed to February from last October and the trailers made it look fun, but having the risk of being too over the top and dumb to fully work. Man, was I mistaken because this was a lot of fun and possibly the best Roger Moore Bond movie without Moore ever made.Good: I loved how the movie balanced being a satire and being a genuinely good spy film. It makes lots of references to those campy spy films of the 60's and makes fun of them while giving it the proper respect to pull it off individually and delivering a fun movie doing it. The whole cast was game and it work with Colin Firth having one of his best roles ever as Galahad, one of the best spies ever. The young newcomers Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson have likability and charisma to spare to guarantee them stardom. Mark Strong is great as the Kingsman's version of M and it is great to see Michael Caine. Samuel Jackson finally delivers a performance where he is actually invested in by delivering a very eccentric villain character that is just fun to watch hatch his plans. His sidekick Gazelle (portrayed with zesty attitude by Sofia Boutella) was fantastic. The movie also had plenty of stones with its cursing and violence which was refreshing. It is all gleefully violent and shocking that knows the line of goofy and offensive. As you might have heard, there is a scene in a church that has to be seen to be believed.Overall, this is a fantastic spy film that embraces its campiness and makes it work as a parody of sorts and an action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service- Today's spy movies feature too much goriness and unneeded intensity that the final product always turns out generically the same and adds nothing to the genre. To put it simply, they have no style. Kingsman: The Secret Service, I am very happy to say, is an exception. Stylish is the best way to describe this movie. It is the best spy film I have seen since Casino Royale. It is a breathe of fresh air to see a movie that perfectly balances action and comedy together. It is more like the Pierce Brosnan Bond films and in my opinion, those were the most enjoyable. With great action, witty humor, and great performances from the whole cast, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the most enjoyable film of the year so far.Is it perfect? No. No film is ever perfect. The only flaw I could see though was some of the action sequences seem really far-fetched and hard to believe. I believe this is on purpose though. This is the quintessence of why kids want to be super-spys when they grow up. It so much fun and the spies always seem to do it with what today would be called "swag." The best aspect of the movie was, no matter what it was doing, it was doing it with style. It added something to the genre. Even though it didn't hold back on violence, it didn't focus on it and that was a huge difference in making it stand out from the other spy thrillers of the past. Everything going on in the film was so much fun. The action they did, no matter if a guy was getting cut in half or one guy was taking on a platoon of bad guys, no one ever had to turn away because it was never too much violence, it was just enough. The director, Matthew Vaughn, said this movie was in part a tribute to the old Bond films. He definitely did them an honor. The acting and action were both equally the best parts of this movie. Colin Firth by far had an incredible performance as the suave, badass Kingsman Harry "Galahad" Hart. No one could've played his part better. The way he was able to carry himself throughout the movie was the same kind as the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Sean Connery, and Daniel Craig. When I watched the trailer for Kingsman, I wasn't sure who the actor playing the main character was. Taron Egerton is his name and I believe the casting department did a great job at choosing an up and coming actor to play Gary "Eggsy" Unwin. This way, the audience did not think of him as any other characters as they were watching the movie and were able to believe his transformation into a Kingsman very quickly. He delivered a great performance as Eggsy, and you could tell he was having a lot of fun while doing it. Be aware there is a good deal of violence in this movie. But, if you are a fan of spy films or good action films in general, I recommend you see Kingsman: The Secret Service while it is still in theaters.

		<shortDescription>ladies and gentlemen.. i have a new favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected this film to be good.. in fact i expected this film to be great.. but nothing could have prepared me for the experience that is Kingsman: The Secret Service.. the only film which features a badass Colin Firth taking out what can be described as a sea of people single handedly.. whilst still being stylishly suave.The film follows a basic formula.. but isn't your typical spy film its more than that. The action is on top form, the humour is on top form and the cast is perfection. As well as Colin Firth we get a brilliant performance from Samuel L Jackson as our villain Valentine. I like when a film gives a character their own traits that you can only see a certain actor pull off, and Sam Jackson nailed it as this funny as hell character, who does have the worst lisp i think i have ever heard. To top this off we have Michael Caine and Mark Strong on top form and surprisingly newcomer Taron Egerton as "Eggsy" is absolutely brilliant, from streetwise chave to charming gentlemen. This was a brilliant start for the young actor.. give the man more work! Plus the lady with fricking razor blades as legs.. yeah she was awesome.I actually had the pleasure seeing this in cineworld's 4DX experience as well. This was fresh and cool to see. Made me feel i was in this film, when a gunshot was fired i felt it go past my head.. the seats moved (this was especially good during Eggsy's carjacking scene) and even bubbles filled the auditorium in one particular scene involving.. yes you saw this right.. exploding heads.All-in-all Kingsman is loud, badass, bodacious, stylish, funny and overall one of the greatest action films i have seen in my time, i highly recommend this. The action was very much like kick-ass so if you have seen that then you know what you're getting in to. One scene involving badass Colin Firth on top form in a church is a prime example of one such awesome scene and had me fixed to the screen the whole time in anticipation of what was coming next. At the end of a day when i feel this good about a film and i have already vowed multiple watchings that is when my highest rating is deserved which is why i feel Kingsman deserves a 10/10. Now i feel like putting on a suit and becoming a super spy. Not sure if thats a good idea but it has to be done. A new favourite for me for sure and the best cinematic experience since Whiplash.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My boyfriend dragged me to this movie last weekend and I went solely because he asked, I had no desperate need to see this film and though the trailers looked good I don't generally go for action types especially action/comedy duo's as they generally fall short of one genre or both. I thought all the best bits of the film were in the trailer as is nowadays, but I was pleasantly surprised when the film had so many little bits that had me laughing like a maniac. The film provides ample back story to the main character as well as a good amount of story to the plot, I like the way the story is set up with little nods to the knights of the round table. The comedy is questionable but if you aren't easily offended you'll enjoy it. If your a man trying to get your wife/girlfriend/female friend to watch it with you I strongly recommend this film (and perhaps showing the reviews for this and 50 Shades) 10/10 Best underdog film of 14/15.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun action film that managed to get (almost) everything right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>--Actually a 9.5 but IMDb doesn't let me do that--Let's be honest here, James Bond used to be the go-to guy for fun action while also maintaining a semi-air of seriousness and humor. Lately, though, he has been more serious and less about the humor, which saddens me. Luckily, we have a potential new group of people to look at, known as the Kingsmen.Kingsman: The Secret Service follows a group of people known as the Kingsmen who are spies and fight to save the world, all while being as gentlemanly as possible. One of these Kingsmen is known as Galahad (Colin Firth), who recruits a delinquent English boy by the name of Eggsy (Taron Egerton), sending them both on a whirlwind adventure of fun, mystery and action.First thing I should mention, Kingsman is not for those who do not like violence in action, and certain types of humor. It will probably offend you.The best thing about this movie is probably the casting choices. At first glance, I thought Colin Firth as an action hero would not work, but oh man, it did. He was excellent in the film. So was Samuel L. Jackson as the main villain - I won't spoil his role - but he was fantastic. Taron Egerton, a semi-newcomer to the game was very believable in his role as well. Everybody else did a great job to, from Michael Caine to Mark Strong.The action sequences in this movie are very well done. Vaughn has proved he can do action in Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class, and he does not disappoint here. Likewise, the music choices are well done (a certain church scene has a great song in it), the script is very humorous, and the dialogue flows very well.Perhaps my only slight issue is that it feels kind of detached from humanity at points. There is a scene where a lot of people end up being killed, and it feels like the movie is just kind of, "whatever," about it. But aside from that, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fun action thriller that pokes fun and homages spy films like Bond. Go see it if you haven't, and avoid Fifty Shades of Grey like the motherfucking plague.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Revival of the Original Bond Format on Steroids!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Kick-Ass and X-Men First Class you would expect something special from director Matthew Vaughn; Kingsman: The Secret Service will blow your expectations to smithereens. This ultra-violent, super-charged reboot of the spy genre may be the most exhilarating blockbuster of the year. A gloriously bold venture, Kingsman furiously pushes the limits of mainstream cinema to bring you exactly what you never knew you wanted.Colin Firth revels in the role of suave spy Harry Hart, who introduces us to elite super-secret organization, Kingsman. Hart recruits Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), the least likely candidate, to join Kingsman's grueling eliminatory training process designed to test his mettle and loyalty. Relative newcomer Egerton displays impeccable talent as the rough-around-the- edges Eggsy, commandeering every scene with utter charm.While Eggsy overcomes each challenge in this particularly unorthodox program, callous tech mogul Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) plots a global revolution of catastrophic proportions. Jackson is emphatic as the sadistic and flamboyant super-villain, Valentine who ironically cannot stand the sight of blood. Fortunately, a sexy sidekick with some killer blades is on hand to carry out his dirty work. Jackson's chemistry with Firth is particularly electric in an excellent postmodern scene, which sees the foes discuss their preferences in spy movies.Brimming with crisp aesthetic and vibrant style, Kingsman displays high value and sophistication. The fight scene choreography hits every mark flawlessly, allowing the effervescent action to flow in a way only Vaughn can capture. The Kingsman agents manage to fight off mobs of mindless killers in marvelous locations without acquiring a sole crinkle to their immaculately tailored suits. An excellent soundtrack by Henry Jackman is teamed with fast paced, well-timed rhythm that barely allows you to catch your breath. Kingsman brings the fun back to spy movies with this hilariously irreverent and brazen proof that the concept never got old, but was rather in dire need of some fresh and innovative oomph.Kingsman is not without fault, the gratuitous violence can become a tad tedious, but the sheer audacity to the step away from the watered down action to which we have grown accustomed is precisely what makes Kingsman special. An attempt to present a strong female character in Roxy (Sophie Cookson) is also admirable, but falls short when she constantly achieves by chance rather than skill. Unfortunately Roxy is left merely to overcome her fear of heights while the boys save the world. With Hit-Girl for comparison, Vaughn certainly could have done better here.A brilliant revival of the original Bond format on steroids, Kingsman brings street to the elite with surprisingly hilarious consequences. With a wealth of talent that also includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong this British bombshell is cinematic gold. It even carries the solid message that anyone has the potential to be a gentleman; it is all about what you project and how you carry yourself, after all, "manners maketh man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything You Hope For And More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Part of the genius of Matthew Vaughn's films is his ability to blend genres. Whether it was First Class, Kick-Ass, or even The Debt, he has time and time showed just how versatile he can be. This film is straight up awesome. I found myself laughing at just how ridiculous it was, but it worked. The film is also incredibly funny by itself make no mistake about it. It's also very self aware, much like the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, in that it toys with the fact that it knows it's insane and has fun with it.I have to say though, I didn't have high hopes when they announced the film a few years back. Why would Vaughn leave Days of Future Past to work on some film called Kingsman? Luckily, both films turned out to be terrific. The casting directors also deserve a lot of credit for finding Taron Egerton. Talk about a young kid who should probably be looked at for the new Peter Parker, man does he have talent. He also has something that other possible candidates don't necessarily have, which is comedic chops. This film has more laugh out loud moments than the recent SpongeBob film. Samuel L Jackson gives us many of those humorous scenes, as this is probably the best he has been in quite some time. His trusty Bond villain-esque sidekick is also a bright spot. Or perhaps the cinematography and special effects crew should be credited for just how seamless these action scenes are. This is likely the closest we will ever get to a non Gareth Evans Raid film.The film is also impeccably unpredictable. It's refreshingly to see the action genre get revamped a little bit. Even the best action films can be predictable at times. It's funny because I feel like I should have seen some of the twists and turns coming, but it's a tribute to Vaughn's directing that I didn't. Some may say that the action can be a little bit too over-the-top even for a film that acknowledges it's own boundary-pushing. There was one moment where I thought it probably didn't need to take it that far, but it was still immensely entertaining. I really do hope that this spawns a franchise. Egerton has a lot of potential, and this world deserves to be explored further. It's a film that even my sister, who isn't particularly a fan of these types of films, really enjoyed the experience. It's a much better choice than that one other film people are seeing this weekend...+Egerton's surprisingly good performance +Samuel L hasn't been this entertaining in years +Unpredictable +Over-the-top action works+Potential franchise -Don't get too obsessed with that ridiculousness9.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear God, Please Let There Be A Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the theater with very high expectations. The movie exceeded those expectations. Honestly, me and my buddies were just bored and wanted to watch a nice action movie. What we got was so much more. This movie had some of the best camera-work, special effects and style I've ever seen in an action movie. With effects and camera-work that would put The Matrix to shame this is a result of passionate and hard work. Without giving anything away, the script was actually more than acceptable. Nothing spectacular, but nothing too predictable either. The humor in this film was very clever and didn't feel out of place at all. It was a perfect blend of action and humor. The actors did an amazing job and the directing was splendid. I could not ask for more. I'm not even kidding! I was pleasantly surprised. This movie has to feature one of the most amazing fighting scenes ever, I sh*t you not. The way it is edited looks awesome and it all just kicks ass! The CGI is used wisely and the movie doesn't overly depend on CGI which was a pleasant surprise. Long story short, me and my mates laughed our asses off through the entire movie, and we were glued to the screen with excitement watching those adrenalin-pumped scenes. The best part of this is that this movie fits anyone! Teens enjoy it. Adults do too. Male and female. It's really a great film. I am going to watch this movie again soon and hopefully when it comes out, I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray. It deserves a great rating!!I'm hoping, and I do think that it's going to happen, for a sequel. Since the title has a sub- title, I'm guessing there'll be more movies. I'm hoping for some more, I am thirsty for more! Go watch it. Now. You won't regret it. (Unless you're a bigot or a Christian who can't take a joke, that is. I warned ye.)It gets a strong 8 out of 10. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great And Hyper-Violent Mark Millar Comic Book Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one individual who has most recently become a true legend in the world of comic book writing, then it would have to be Mark Millar. With works like Nemesis, Kick-Ass, Wanted, Marvel's Civil War, Old Man Logan, and Ultimate X-Men and Fantastic Four under his belt, Millar has managed to follow in the footsteps of classic comic book writers like Alan Moore, Frank Miller, Will Eisner, and Neil Gaimen, and like many of these artists, Millar has been able to see and even assist in watching many of his works be adapted for the silver screen.For Millar, film adaptations of his work have had mixed, but interesting degrees of success. Wanted (2008) was a stylish and adrenaline-pumping experience with some great performances by Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman, but I do admit that the actual film was an awful adaptation considering the story and characters had almost nothing to do with the comic. Kick-Ass (2010) was a gleefully violent, hilarious, and faithful adaptation of Millar's work that helped jumpstart the careers of Chloë Grace Moretz and Aaron Taylor-Johnson, not to mention it featured the last truly impressive performance by Nicolas Cage, and while Kick-Ass 2 (2013) was far inferior to its predecessor, it was still a decent adaptation. Now we have Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015), which while only loosely based on Millar's The Secret Service, is still a funny, well-acted, and beautifully ridiculous action film that more Hollywood studios should observe and copy in the future. Also, this film should make Liam Neeson nervous; he's not the only older actor who can pull off action movie roles. Welcome to the action ring, Colin Firth!The plot of Kingsman is very much in the same vein as a classic James Bond film, and the film is not afraid to make fun at Bond's expense (or even Jason Bourne for that matter). The film focuses on Eggsy (Taron Egerton), an unemployed London resident who has a cowardly mother and an abusive stepfather, and has spent his entire life giving up in situations where he could have easily succeeded (school, the military, etc.). After getting arrested by the police, Eggsy makes contact with a long-lost ally, Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth), who happens to be a member of an organization known as the Kingsman: individuals who pose as sophisticated tailors and businessmen who in reality have become the new "Knights of the Round Table", and work to protect the world and keep it in balance. Eggsy is then offered a chance to become a Kingsman like his late father before him, and must compete with other hopeful (and privileged) candidates like Roxy (Sophie Cookson), all the while under the watchful eye of Merlin (Mark Strong), a senior Kingsman and trainer. Meanwhile, Galahad, under orders from Chester King/Arthur (Michael Caine), is sent to investigate lisp-ridden billionaire, philanthropist and tech tycoon Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) and his bladed prosthetic leg-equipped assistant Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), who seek to drive the world into chaos and create a new world order, and eventually Eggsy and Roxy have to join the fight, and gleeful violence and action ensues.The plot is clearly inspired by the James Bond films of old, but director Mathew Vaughn and long-time collaborator and writer Jane Goldman, who've created excellent films like Stardust (2007), Millar's Kick-Ass (2010), and X-Men: First Class (2011), manage to keep the film deliciously retro and fresh. The story is great, the action is frenetic and edgy, and reminded me of Vaughn's previous work in Kick-Ass, and the performances are all excellent. Firth is great as Galahad, and I would love to see him star in more action films. Egerton and Cookson are solid in their roles, and it'll be interesting to see what future starring roles they'll partake in. Strong, Jackson, Caine, and Boutella all have moments to shine in the film. Mark Hamill and Jack Davenport are also funny in roles that could be chalked up as cameos, but their roles are important in driving the plot forward.The only criticism I have with the film are that in some instances the special effects are decent, but you can tell that they are just CGI. The same held true with Kick-Ass, and even X-Men: First Class; Vaughn is able to craft great movies on relatively small budgets, but focuses more on using great actors and a story rather than effects, and there is nothing wrong with that. It's just on a few occasions the effects were so obvious that I was pulled out of the experience. Also, while the humor in the film is really great, there were one or two moments where the comedy felt designed to be shocking and perverse but in no way to drive the plot forward, but that's mostly a warning for anyone who doesn't like seeing those kinds of things. Overall, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a fantastic action flick with a great story, excellent acting performances, awesome humor, and some jaw-dropping action scenes. If James Bond were to ever become rated R and hyper-violent, I think this would be the film to copy. Also, like Kick-Ass, Vaughn knows how to use classic rock songs in his action sequences. In my opinion, Vaughn and Goldman are the two individuals who are able to make excellent and worthy film adaptations of Mark Millar's work, and Kingsman is no different. Simply put, it's one of the best action films of the past few years, and should be seen by any fan of the action/spy/comic book movie genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All those things Bond hinted at.... Kingsman delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Been looking forward to this one since I saw the first trailer for it. And for the first time in an absolute age, the movie lived up to the promise of the trailer... and then some.The casting of Colin Firth was frankly, sublime. In exactly the same way that Liam Neesons casting was genius in the first Taken movie, so Firth delivers in ways you simply don't expect.With cool suave and barely a disturbed hair on his head, he dispatches the bad guys with a flourish, and hardly breaks a sweat doing it either.Taron Edgerton who plays 'Eggsy' was actually quite likable. Sure, his chav routine is a little wearing, but that in itself is essential, because his transformation has to be observed, and his voice and mannerisms are part of that transformation.He suited the role well, the only thing that seemed a little too simplistic, was all of the other recruits being posh 'Ruperts', which kind of slapped you around the face a little too hard with the "new boy is a chav and his competition can't talk for all the silver spoons in their mouths!".But in a way, that served well when Arthur speaks his last (you'll know when you hear it!), it just took a long time before Arthur did so.Mark Strong was particularly good, had plenty of decent quips, in fact the humour throughout the movie was very well paced, it never felt forced, it always felt natural, even after Harry Hart dispensed with a pub load of morons and then casually sat down to finish his Guinness.Samuel L Jackson was alright, would probably have preferred to have him not lisp his way through the movie, but I guess the intention was to show him as being the most unlikely genocidal maniac until he actually activated his plan.Lots of set pieces were done well, the Church fight scene was frenetic, but, Vaughn didn't shake the camera to pieces to do it. Yes, there is some shaky cam going on, but not so you can't view whats going on.There's a load of swearing, lots of gore and violence, its rude, and its about bloody time we got something adult.There's a further scene 2 minutes into the end credits, and I yearned for more.If this is the start of a new franchise, then i'm in for Kingsman 2</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring, talented fun, but too violent for sensitive viewers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very start, you can tell this movie is on a whole other level to most of the stuff coming out of Hollywood nowadays. From the innovative opening credits to the perfect comedic timing with EVERY line, it's fast paced without being in the least hard to follow. I loved the edgy new take this movie had on the spy theme. I loved it because like my favourite James Bond movies from decades ago, it doesn't take itself too seriously. I loved the main character Eggzy, with his street gait and kinda sexy cockney accent, and I LOVED Colin Firth as a spy. He was as gentlemanly as ever and BECAUSE of this, he was really interesting as an ultra violent fighter. And of course the villains were extremely bright characters, my boyfriend couldn't suppress giggles the whole time Samuel L Jackson was on screen. However, the ever increasing violence was too much for me. The church massacre scene I found out of place and tasteless, and it completely ruined my enjoyment for the talent this movie had to show. It made me feel complete terror at how desensitized to violence Hollywood expects its viewers to be. MOST of us normal people don't find that amount of killing acceptable or "funny", and it just made me feel sick for the rest of the movie. Someone in the movie theatre said aloud "What are we watching?" and I think a couple people left. Despite that however, you can tell love, hard work, and lots and lots of guts and talent went into making this movie and no one left the movie theatre indifferent. I recommend it for anyone who can stomach violence!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just Bond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a little note to highlight the fact that this is not just Bond, there are other classic Brit spies in there ones that were actually superior to Bond but never got the 'success'. One is Harry Palmer (who was an 'anti-bond'), who was actually played by a much younger Michael Caine in the 60's, (Ipcress File, Funeral in Berlin)all set against a cold war background. The glasses in particular are Harry's. Another screen spy was John Steed from the Avengers (not Marvel Avengers !) and New Avengers, played by Patrick Mcnee, I think I have heard that this is getting remade shortly for the big screen. Hats and the brolly are John Steed.Of course John le Carre Tinker Tailor series with its blue blooded gentlemans club as 'control'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and subversive as hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from an advance screening of &#x202a;Kingsman&#x202c;: The Secret Service.Found it funny and subversive as hell.Not a film for everyone. Some are labeling some of the humor (especially at the end) "laddish" or "juvenile" and getting PROFESSIONALLY offended. That was kinda the point of the humor in the first place.This an affectionate James Bond/Jason Bourne send up where the protagonist is a chav.The training sequence kinda drags a bit, but the film would be gutted without it.Colin Firth just absolutely STEALS the film though. Staid, proper, gentlemanly and will absolutely, positively kill you and everyone else in the room with you while barely breaking a sweat! The Church scene in this film absolutely has to be SEEN to be believed.Samuel L. Jackson is a very...quirky...villain (he can't thtand violence). And his right-hand man is a "handi-capable" killer with swords in her feet.Oh, and EVERYONE'S mission? Save the world! If you don't mind a bit of "laddish" humor, go see the film. It definitely deserves to be seen.And now I'll leave you with three words and this reminder of what I said about the humor earlier.Swedish Princess Ending</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sit back &amp; go with the flow romp. Violent, bloody &amp; hugely entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the acclaimed comic book by Jane Goldman (Stardust, The Woman in Black) and directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick-Ass) Kingsman: The Secret Service is a sit back, put your feet up, go with the flow romp. It doesn't pretend to be anything else, and it achieves its goals admirably.Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is an agent with a super-secret undercover organization hidden behind the façade of an exclusive tailor's outlet in London. When one of the Kingsman agents is killed in action, a brief, intensive selection process begins through which a replacement will be found. Whilst the majority of the potential recruits are public school educated and born with silver spoons in their mouths, Harry's proposition is Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a streetwise kid from the wrong side of town and a pitiful history. With death or expulsion the penalty for failing each task, Eggsy battles prejudice as well as aptitude tests in a bid to become a Kingsman.From the opening titles of Kingsman: The Secret Service we know we're up for fun. The credits tumble out like rocks from exploding walls as Vaughn sets the tone of adventure and derring-do. We think we know where we're going but Goldman and Vaughn have formed a reliable partnership that maintains the ability to surprise, to appall and to shock simultaneously. This is tongue-in-cheek, logic be damned magic.Throughout Kingsman: The Secret Service we are treated to bloody, violent, beautiful choreography that leaves us wincing, laughing and admiring the audacity of the mayhem they spread across the screen. The church sequence is a marvel to behold and a scene that Tarantino must wish he had created first. As for the grand, spectacular finale, well, let's just say you've never seen fireworks like this! It is a visual triumph that is, in an odd kind of way, mind-expanding. Riotous, beautiful and very funny indeed.One of the great joys of Goldman's and Vaughn's collaborations is that they seem not to care too much what anybody thinks. They just do it. They know the rules and they play the Hollywood game but they do it their way. Product placement has long been a standard of filmmaking, and though there is plenty of it on display here, one particular example is the funniest, classiest most blatant since, well, ever! Like Goldman's and Vaughn's other work, Kingsman: The Secret Service doesn't take itself seriously. It is joyfully camp at times, frequently taking digs at the genre it is mocking. In the Roger Moore years, James Bond became a buffoon, an unbelievable pastiche of himself. Here, Bond gets a makeover and frivolous fun is on the agenda throughout. All the ingredients are here: a super villain, excess, beauty and gadgets. This is gadget heaven and umbrellas have suddenly become cool.Colin Firth is clearly having an absolute blast as the suave agent. Who needs Paddington to boost your cinematic profile when you can shoot, stab, smash and bludgeon this stylishly? Firth is a class act and this is proof once again that there is far more to him than simply the stiff upper lip persona.Samuel L. Jackson is on scenery munching duty the as Valentine, a twisted tech genius holding the world to ransom under the guise of being its savior, and why not? There's a certain amount of ham in his performance but it works perfectly here and he's in good company.Egerton makes for a fine, watchable secondary hero that we may perhaps find it easier to identify with but he's not in the same league as Colin Firth or Michael Caine and does not easily drag our attention away from them. Mark Strong's accent takes a little while to settle in but he, too, brings light humour and a certain gravitas to Kingsman: The Secret Service, as we have come to expect from his presence.There are plenty of gaps in the plot (at what point does Eggsy actually learn to fight properly?), and occasionally the humour is a little too obvious and slips below the level Vaughn sets, but all of these glitches and flaws are forgivable when a film is this much fun.Unfortunately, when a film is as much fun as Kingsman: The Secret Service, the temptation (and pressure from the studio) must surely be there to forge a sequel. Let's hope Goldman and Vaughn resist that money making exercise and leave Kingsman to stand proudly as a unique experience that thrills and entertains completely.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The spy version of Kick Ass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wrote this elsewhere. Copying cause I don't feel like doing a new oneI'll start this by saying that this may not be for everyone. Metacritic currently has it at a 75/100 which is understandable. The movie can probably be best described as the campy James Bond type spy movie for the modern age. It takes the risks that no Bond movie will probably ever take again (not since the disaster that Die Another Day was). They make no attempt to hide this and halfway through the movie make it pretty clear that it's what the film is going for without breaking the fourth wall. Until it...kind of does break the fourth wall a little. To enjoy the film you're gonna have to turn off whatever part of your brain governs rationality and skepticism. Because the tech and gadgets used here will cause your eyes to roll if you're expecting this to be a Skyfall style spy movie. Seeing posters for this did nothing for me when I first heard about it. Then the trailers grabbed my attention. What I wasn't expecting was just how violent it was going to be. The action sequences are over the top to the point where the agents are superhuman. Again, you're gonna have to turn your brain off a little to enjoy it. If you're incapable of doing so, just don't bother seeing it. If you can, I think you'll enjoy it. Most of the theater who got advanced screening tickets applauded quite loudly. Twice. They applauded the first credit screen then partway through it there was a bonus scene. More applause at the end.I'm not quite sure how Colin Firth has never been cast as a gentleman secret agent before. He absolutely nails it. Samuel L. Jackson is actually pretty delightful as the villain with a disdain of violence (not exactly a spoiler as this detail of his character was in trailers). Micheal Caine is actually a touch disappointing in his role. I feel like they really underutilized his talents. Wasn't expecting Mark Hamill to be in it, but was pleased with his appearance, and his British accent was completely believable. If I hadn't seen pictures of Hamill prepping for Star Wars 7 I would've thought he was just some random British middle aged actor. Mark Strong was solid in his role but nothing too fantastic. The big surprise to me was Taron Egerton (who I had to look up, I'll admit), the lead of the film. The guy who kind of looks like Josh Hutcherson. It honestly is quite impressive to see him go from this British "bruv" to towards the end of the movie a sophisticated secret agent with honestly, the charm and wit of James Bond. The transformation is believable and impressive. Looking back on the movie that may be my favorite thing about it and given that he's only...24 (I think?) I don't think it's completely absurd to consider him to eventually replace Daniel Craig. Maybe he's not the best choice but he's made my list. Might not grow out of his boyish face, but if he does he should get a call.Anyway aside from the individual performances, the movie's plot is completely ludicrous (in a fun way), the violence is over stylized, but the humor is quite fun. After seeing all the comedies I've seen. certain jokes are just predictable and Kingsman has its share, but some jokes are quite surprising.TL;DR summary: Intentionally campy, a lot of fun if you don't expect a serious spy film, quite funny, super violent at times (I can only really compare it to 300...actually no this is more like a spy version of Kick-Ass really, but it's not quite as gory) more entertaining than most movies I saw last year. If there's a sequel, I will watch it. Also Sophie Cookson may just be my new celebrity crush. And also my ticket was free through the advanced screening service I'm signed up for but when I find time, I'm gonna pay to see it again...in 13 ****ing days.EDIT: back to the Kick Ass comparison, I think if this is well enough received as it was for me and the friend I took to see it, it may enjoy the same cult classic status. Luckily for...it. It will come way before the big blockbusters of 2015 will hit theaters. May give it enough time to gain that appreciation. In my personal opinion, it's better than Kick Ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that Kind of Tailoring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From time to time in these comments, I remark on my surprise at how sophisticated young viewers are, and how they demand ever more complex and subtle self-referential folds. It gives me pleasure to realize that my flower children cohort were and still are largely incapable of this level of abstraction. It gives me hope for the future because introspective abstract reasoning is the central factor in reasoning about the world.Then again, from time to time, the nearly suicidal revelation appears that these kids have lost much of what we knew, learned at great cost. We knew that governments shouldn't spy and torture; that women deserve level humanity; that death is not comic. We knew that feeding stereotypes, especially those of blacks, can be fun only when we know the game. We knew this, and still do.I was patient enough with the excess until the church massacre. After all, I liked Kick-ass and Layer Cake. These had a different balance: yes, they were comic-influenced compositions of set pieces; yes they shamelessly exploited stereotypes and had unexpected nonchalant pleasure in the violence. But they placed the audience and filmmaker outside the film.Here, the opposite is emphasized. This is not Bond or Bourne. No, it is not that kind of movie we are told. It is Bauer, who would shoot the dog after abusing it.After the church scene, I felt myself tumbling into a dead future. Who would tolerate this? Who would enjoy it?</fullReview>

Sorry to say that it was not funny for a moment. The needless brutality and the one-sided, lowly sexual references just made it even worse. I consider myself a liberal person - but banning these movies might be considered...Another thing is the really high average rating of the movie.

		<shortDescription>An old, tried and tested story in new shiny packaging.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Kingsman without any prior knowledge of the film, and without having seen the trailer, and as such my expectations were reasonably low. Because of that I didn't walk away disappointed, but at the same time I feel that there at least two serious things wrong with this movie: 1. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is painful to watch. It's 'Snakes on a Plane' bad, maybe even worse. His lisp is forced and unnatural, and it constantly makes you wonder if it's some kind of stab at gay men.2. A young, rough around the edges character gets picked up by a secret agency to replace an older agent, has to go through some training, and then has to try and save the world? Where have I heard this before? Men in Black? Wanted? Any number of other films? It's old goods in a new packaging.Warning, some pretty major spoilers below: 3. Suspension of disbelief fails. The action scenes are pretty and well done, and I could accept the hyper-violence at face value, as something that occurs in this comic book universe that the film works in, but it drops the ball on so many other important areas. First of all there's no adequate explanation of how or why the protagonist goes from street kid to bad-ass super spy.We're simply expected to believe that being dipped in water and jumping out of a plane, somehow trains you to be able to take on 50 men armed with machine guns, and come out unscathed. Then we're expected to believe that biometric security systems are impenetrable to hacking. If it involves a scan of your hand, it can never be hacked into apparently. Or how about that brilliant billionaire villain, who is determined to carry out his plan, but designs his doomsday device so that it only works as long as he's physically pushing a button on it. He can't flip a switch, it has to be pushed continuously, giving the hero ample opportunity to stop the event. It's the antithesis of Veidt in the Watchmen.Where suspension of disbelief died completely for me, was when the villain explained how he convinced state leaders, presidents, royalty and celebrities to join cause with him. His solution to global warming is to cull most of the world's population, and somehow these leaders of the world are all in agreement and support his plan? The whole film they're building up to this event, this massive catastrophe that will occur at the hands of Jackson's character, and you're expecting something really clever, a twist or a turn or some rationale that would justify world leaders going on board with this insane plan, and then Jackson spouts a few lines of weird Malthusian-extremist rhetoric, in that weird lisp of his, and that's that. No adequate explanation is ever given.I didn't believe any of these things made sense, even within the film's hyper-violent cartoon universe. It felt like they were so busy making all those violent action scenes, nobody stopped to think... hey is this even making sense?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had the potential to be one of my favourite films in recent years. A well-executed action movie with Michael Caine, Colin Firth as a brilliant James Bond-esque character, Samuel L. Jackson as an original (and funny) villain, two awesome female characters (one who was bloody scary) and jaw-dropping fight scenes. It grabbed my attention from the very start and then kept it...until the end, where it devolved into yet another boring, sexist, "pandering to the f*ckboys" film, where women are prizes for a job well done, and are literally just a**holes to f*ck. It tried so hard not to be "that kind of movie", and ended up being exactly that kind of movie, but without the Bond charm or romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not usually a fan of "violent" films per se, but there was a certain degree of "candidness" and "innocence" in the violence portrayed in this film... and that combined with great acting, action and humor made this film just simply FUN and a delight to watch.The idea of "gentlemen" agents is to the degree that they are not fully super"heroes" yet they are not fully "ordinary" either. It gives the audience the perfect room for a perfect level of "fantasy" combined with reality (for instance, the tailor shop in London).There was no mucking about in this film. You are not given the time or the need to try delve into everything that is happening. You are not asking yourself 'why' is he doing that? what is the meaning behind that action? That symbol? etc. The film does not require you to wonder beyond what is necessary. In most of the "superhero" films these days we wonder what the back-story of the hero is - why is he the way he is? I was surprise to realize at the end of the film that not once did I really try to fathom where all these characters CAME from. They were just there doing all these amazing stunts and looking so dashing in these suits and I really appreciate that about the Kingsman. It is just PURE FUN. You are given the movie to enjoy and enjoy is what you do.Everything is straight-forward. The story really does seem simple when you think back on it but at the same time, everything is done in such a DETAILED manner and that is what allows us to enjoy it as it is.I found this movie just completely refreshing and original. Great cast, great locations, great stunts, great music and just.. a great time overall!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lisp speaking billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine poses this question to a gentleman-spy Harry Hart, currently in disguise; which results in the smartest and funnest conversation you will see this year. From every frame of this film the love for old espionage and old James Bond films is tangible and mostly it is in this scene where the protagonist and and the antagonist of this film profess their mutual love of "far-fetched theatrical plots". Also a point is raised that the adventures were as good as the villain. The love for making films, having fun and letting yourself loose in the whirl of ideas can be felt throughout the whole film.The strength of any film is to have rightly cast actors. Taron Egerton, the most important piece of the puzzle, is the most promising talent to appear in the film since Jack O'Connel in Starred Up. He is charming, witty and just straight-up lovable. If the audience would not like him or sympathize with him the film would fail. Luckily, that is not the case. Colin Firth's talent is finally being used in the proper way. I finally started to enjoy Firth as an actor in last year's Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight and here he plays completely against type. The idea behind his casting was ? ?Who is the least likely people would imagine as a spy?" Colin Firth is delivers the performance of his life as the typical British gentleman with incredible fighting skills. Mark Strong is fun and entertaining as ever, this time differing himself with a Scottish accent. Samuel L. Jackson is the funniest and funnest villain you have seen in a long time. Matthew Vaughn decided to turn the villain formula on its head and Jackson spiced things up with a speech pattern, which results in the most ridiculous bad guy I have ever seen. I also always enjoy a villain with a noble cause. Sofia Boutella as Gazelle, Valentine's partner in crime is a great play on the typical henchman we see in the movies. Her having blades instead of legs is one wicked idea. Michael Caine of course is a national treasure and it is such a pleasure to see him in any film because no one has a screen presence as him.The camera work in Kingsman is the best I have seen since Bad Boys 2. The cinematography is fluent - no furious cuts, steady - no shaky camera, and is usually done in one take. The pivotal and arguably the bes scene of the film is the people are calling the 'church scene'. That scene is when everything cuts loose, people go berserk and generally mayhem ensues. This is the most violent, bloody action sequence you will see this year and it is all done in seemingly one take.That brings me to the highlight of the film. Since the film is not censored by American studio executives Matthew Vaughn was completely in hold of the reins. He could cut himself loose. Therefore one of the film's biggest appeal is its ultra violence. Now, I don't want to sound like some blood-lust psychopath but having people be killed in a movie without any blood or the consequences shown is wrong and it hurts the viewer's enjoyment (if I want to see Sylvester Stallone film I expect blood, which wasn't the case with Expendables 3) and it hurts the psyche of a potential young viewer who might get the wrong impression of violence.Vaughn's taste in music is very similar to mine. I have always dreamt of hearing Dire Straits's 'Money For Nothing' in a film and that is the song the film starts with. I was immediately in a paradise. The brilliantly put together soundtrack continues with Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' and KC &amp; The Sunshine Band playing at the most inappropriate times resulting in a great comedic effect.Matthew Vaughn is ,for me, one of the smartest directors, since he is always is in sync with the audience's taste and its demand. So run to theater as fast as you can to see the best action film in years and the best movie of this year. I guarantee that you won't regret having an amazing time with this ultra violent, mega fun, self-referential spy action masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an experience and like many others one you have to see in the movie theater, it is very rich in style, great sound, sharp images and fast moving, over the top action. Many things are in just the correct amount, some just to the edge, but it never gets too much, it becomes much, but it fits the timing of the film and it is glorious. There clearly is a very big love and respect for the spy genre and they clearly have very good control of their references to earlier works like James Bond, Jason Bourne and others. It is a very classic English spy, spiced up with some young British talent and an American villain wit a lisp :)All of the actors do a very fine job, the guys with the routine, Colin Firth, Michael Cain, Mark Strong and Samuel L. Jackson all do a fine job and they are playing parts that we don't experience them in every day, but it fits them very well. The young Taron Egerton who takes the lead role is also doing a fine job and we will be seeing more of him in the future, I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is THE BEST action-comedy movie I've seen in a long time... it's so much better than I expected. It had an intelligent script and had me laughing out loud more often than teens text "LOL" or tweet random nonsense with hash tags. The fight scene choreography and the accompanying music blew me away!!! Be jealous other so-called action- comedies, be jealous. I've never seen a movie in theaters more than once, but I just might make an exception this time... yes, it's THAT GOOD. You will NOT be disappointed. The opening sequence alone made my jaw drop. WARNING: This movie is NOT for the squeamish. If you can't stomach blood and guts, don't go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely going on my top ten list of favorite movies. Colin Firth is amazing in Kingsman, as well as Taron Egerton. Also, it's fun and humorous. It's filled with amazing action sequences. For a R-rated action movie, the blood is not too gore-y. I definitely thought this movie was going to be more bloody than it actually was. The aspect of being a gentleman spy seems very interesting, not to mention the puppies.It does seem a bit over the top at times (good or bad depending on how you look at it). Samuel L. Jackson's lisp does distract you a bit. And the last scene, wow. In conclusion, this is a brilliant and by far, Matthew Vaughn's best film. Maybe he could top it with a sequel?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wasn't sure what to expect, but my brother-in-law saw it so I thought we would check it out. Awesome! Haven't had this good of a laugh at the movies in ages. Great to see my Brits doing their thing - great writing, directing, effects, music, the spy thing, over the top Monty Python violence and humor. What a great movie!Growing up in England, there were lots of British references, but I don't think they are lost too much on international audiences. The special effects are awesome. The music just right - including the best musical orgy of laughs I've ever had.The British film industry is alive and well, and this is a spectacular example of the genre. The class juxtapositions were just right, and the use of extensive swearwords fit perfectly. A real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, slick and immense fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time when celebrities mysteriously started to disappear and environmental damage caused by human overpopulation became the top agenda for a tech tycoon, a small gentlemen's tailor shop in London stood as the last defender against rising evil. For decades, the Kingsman secret service operated as an independent international intelligence agency in the guise of the tailor shop. Its meticulously dressed agent Galahad proudly defines the agency to a recruit, "The suit is a modern gentleman's armour. And the Kingsman agents are the new knights". Matthew Vaughn ('Kick-Ass', 'X-Men: First Class') provides the campy seriousness of a James Bond villain's threat but also has slick, bloody action that shocks they way 'Kick-Ass' did. This spy thriller is a patiche of several franchises but with Vaughn's bold, ruthless and stylized action sequences, it creates a genre on its own. The more ridiculous it gets, the more fun it is.Having the guilt of losing an agent during an unfortunate mission, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) aka Galahad offers aid to his family. Years later, the son Eggsy (Taron Egerton) grows up in the East end with a middle class upbringing and when his immature acts led to his arrest, he used his wild card and contacted the Kingsman. Harry bails him from prison and offers to recruit him as an agent. Any doubt in Eggsy's mind is laid to rest when he witnesses Harry taking down some rogues in a fast reflexive, stylishly canny brawl at a pub. The recruitment for the one agent who will become a Kingsman will see six youngsters in Hunger Games or X-Men type tests to determine their worthiness. From a flood in their dorm room, to keeping a dog constantly by their side and to dive from the skies to land on target while avoiding radars. Meanwhile, Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), the lisping tech tycoon who dresses up like a rap artist is the opposite of the suave secret agents. His evil plan for saving the planet from degradation is to cull the population of the dominant virus. With an app that triggers a micro SIM card installed in each subscriber, he can force aggressive behaviors in humans anywhere on the planet with the help of a satellite. The Kingsman must attack his stronghold and disengage him and also destroy the satellite that would transmit global ruin. The action is stupendous in parts. The pub brawl is only an introduction to Vaughn's style of slick, fast paced action but it is the precursor to the final mission, that is Harry's solo rage war in a church that stands out as one of the most brilliantly choreographed action sequences in recent memory. This one can be more astounding than what was witnessed in Kick-Ass. Throughout the movie, Vaughn pushes the clichés to new, darker levels that are crazily entertaining. "This ain't that kind of a movie". Algerian babe Sofia Boutella is the stunning steel prosthetic leg bearing human cleaver who dances her way through some shocking action scenes. As Gazelle, she is a threatening supporting villain who aids Valentine by doing all the dirty work. Samuel L. Jackson is a wickedly cool villain. After playing Nick Fury for so long, it is great to see him in a role where he can really open up and be at his expressive best. Michael Caine also gets to step out of his norm of being the gentle elder in the story and his stubbornness as the head of the Kingsman instigates suspicion and despise at the same time. Quite an unusual way to feel about Alfred. Mark Strong is excellent as Merlin, the resourceful Kingsman agent who sees the recruits through their testing stages and plays a critical role in the climax. Mark Hamill is unrecognizable as Prof. Arnold who witnesses the bold rescue attempt in the beginning of the movie by an unlucky Kingsman agent. Taron Egerton is impressive. He plays an East-ender with the same natural ability as he plays a Kingsman with a suit on. Among his best scenes is certainly the one where he hesitates while pointing a gun at his pup 'JB'. Egerton remarkably holds his act well in the midst of such powerful actors. If Daniel Craig can be the hard faced serious agent, Egerton will be the earnestly entertaining one who can still kick-ass. Colin Firth is a veteran of a different genre of films. Therefore, to see him play such a lead role in a movie that mocks a spy genre and involves action that makes even 'Kick-Ass' look amateurish, is just difficult to grasp. Yet, he does so with such ease and finesse. The double-breasted suit was just tailored to perfection for him and he pretty much defines what a Kingsman agent is all about. Kind in his words, gentle in his behaviour but occasionally, needs to let off some steam in a crazy manner. He delivers an equally serious performance as he did in 'The King's Speech' in a movie that is overall just funny and crazy. That, precisely, is his strength as an actor. Michael Vaughn drew inspiration from Mark Millar's comic book series titled 'The secret service' but quickly altered many aspects of it to add his story-telling style that occasionally goes from stylish to outlandish but it never stops being immense fun. Vaughn pays tribute to the entertaining spy genre but uncannily, forms an alternate one where slicing victims with prosthetic leg blades, exploding heads and stylish gadgets will be common dealings for the Gentlemen who will save the day. Even James Bond would smirk at this job offer.- 9.15 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Umbrellas have never looked this cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Umbrellas have never been so badass.When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman: The Secret Service, it seemed like a bit of an eye-roller. It looked like a forgettable action comedy with stupid one-liners and standardized action built for people who like movies like Real Steel or Agent Cody Banks. I was wrong. More movies need to be like Kingsman: The Secret Service, and there are three reasons why.Reason number one: It's rated R. This movie could have easily been chopped up and delivered with a PG-13 rating, good for all ages, sans balls (I'm talking about you, Expendables 3). It wasn't. The action here is fantastic, full of glorious head trauma, exit wounds, and broken bones. One scene in particular - set in a church - is one of the coolest scenes you'll see all year.Reason number two: It's an original property. Yes, I know it's based on a comic book called 'The Secret Service', but it basically just borrows loose plot points from it. I wish more studios would take chances on unknown entities instead of churning out sequels, remakes and superhero flicks. That being said, I bet this gets a sequel...hopefully still helmed by Matthew Vaughn. When someone else takes over something that he made, we get crap like Kick-Ass 2.Reason number three: It was fun. It took itself just seriously enough that it didn't border on parody, like the last two Pierce Brosnan Bond movies that nearly killed the series (The World is Not Enough and Die Another Day). There were serious, heartfelt moments mixed in with a ton of levity. It paid a ton of homage to classic spy movies while being a blast to watch. Rarely do I leave movies saying to myself, "I need to own that", but this one fit that bill.The year is young, but I'm pretty confident that when 2015 is over, there will be no bigger cinematic surprise than Kingsman: The Secret Service. It's not perfect - it drags a bit at points and Samuel L. Jackson's lisp is eternally grating, but every actor aside from him is fantastic (including Colin Firth, which I never thought I'd say), the action is amazing, and the gadgets are fun. If you're into action or spy movies, Kingsman is a must see.My final grade - A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manners maketh the person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by trying to describe how I feel. How does it feel when something surpasses your expectations to such an extent that you have to grope for words to try and articulate how happy you are? Especially when that something happens to belong firmly in the mainstream milieu, something that has forgotten that it can be as fun, as creative, as those blossoming in the Indie milieu as well. That's how I feel.I did not want Vaughn to direct this. I wanted him to do either Kick-Ass 2 instead (I still do), or the sequel to '1st class' ('Days of future past' was made possible due to his vision, though Singer has turned out to be a sellout). But he chose to follow his heart, and his vision, surrounding himself with his trusted team (Jane Goldman for one), who've consistently churned out top-class, top quality fare ever since their mutual association began since 'Layer cake' turned out to be the Bond audition for Craig.Well, to the movie in question: I have not read the Mark Millar graphic novel (The Secret Service) on which this movie is based. Perhaps a good thing. I had read KA2, and was disappointed by the movie. Maybe had I not read the novel (but then again, Vaughn could only produce that, and did not direct).Its a throwback to the Bond (and non) spy flicks of the 60s (maybe a little from the 70s), when the villains motives were simple enough, and dashes of primary colors determined where your allegiances lay. While giving us a close look into the process that dictates candidate selection, it also metaphorically brings to the fore King Arthur and the Knights of (a not so round) table, sans Guinevere. The casting is spot-on, and bringing together Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Mark Strong in the same flick has to be something of a coup. The younger cast is also spot-on, and the tale is nothing like the way mainstream movies treat their imperfect match-ups - the older person and the younger one, the female and the male and so forth. Each and every clichéd plot detail is dealt with in all sincerity, and you will never question the motivations that each character has that takes them in a particular arc/path, or allow the audience even to treat each dalliance as casual.Whilst doing that, Goldman/Vaughn also give us refreshingly surprising, and adrenaline-pumping set-pieces, that surprise, sometimes amaze, and are always dealt with sincerely (that word once again, but how important it is!) and keeps things fresh.There is also a meta element to the whole thing, with characters in the thick of things being self-aware of all the goings-on, their impact on their surroundings, consequences surrounding their actions et al, but not to the point that it becomes (kind of rolling-one's- eyes) distracting. Things are brought up, and let go of, at the right time. Most movies do not get that balance right (here's looking at you, self-aware 'Birdman', with the golden statuette).There are action set-pieces that would be right at home in a hard-R Korean movie, that are pulled off with aplomb, and elicit the right level of shock, awe, disgust and revulsion at the perpetrators of such gross acts. Style is used, but always in the service of the narrative/plot, not just for effect like it almost always is in other mainstream works (I'm looking at you, Michael Bay). To me, this is a signature Mathew Vaughn movie, something he has been capable of since directing balls-to-the-wall action sequences in 'Stardust' (not including 'Layer cake' for now, since that was smaller by choice, in ambition and execution, and remarkably effective for all that nevertheless). Samuel L Jackson, when given free rein, can become a caricature of himself, and I confess that I was bothered about that, and was hoping that Vaughn had not cast him. However, chalk it down to Jackson being aware enough to rein it in, or Vaughn being in complete control of his craft throughout, Jackson's demeanor, character tics (even the not-so-affected lisp, apparently), motivations et al, are in perfect service to the plot, and he makes for a suitably menacing villain, with one of the perfectly nasty sidekicks (front and back too, pun completely intended) to boot. Not menacing enough though, and perhaps that was 1 small almost mis-step in a mostly perfect spy genre thriller.Taron Egerton, who could have turned out to be 1 more forgettable character among all the heavy-weights, should really be grateful to the helmers (Vaughn, and Goldman, + Millar, for sure) who give him one of the most 3-dimensional characters that a young protégé kinda character has ever been asked to enact. His character is treated with a respect almost never seen in movies of this genre, especially in the mainstream/commercial milieu. More points to the makers, and pointers to those who wanna follow suit, whilst crunching studio numbers. Not much to expect, but something to focus on when it has been done right, with this as a showcase to that aspect.Every frame looks perfect, and the score contains a few gems from the yester-years, and are used in a good way. One of the slickest made mainstream features in a long while. All the technical aspects are used in the service of narrating the tale, the way they always ought to be, and never call attention to themselves while doing so.Not to be missed on the big screen, in spite of a few reservations that one might have. Not for the conservative/safe viewer though. you can't please them all, for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The secret service is a thoroughly entertaining movie. It sits somewhere between the Bond movies and the Austin Powers movies in terms of action comedy genre.The film follows the prospects of Eggsy (Taron Eggerton) in his attempts to follow his fathers footsteps into the secret service. Galahad (Colin Firth) is responsible for trying to get Eggsy to join the service. The film succeeds in the area that so many other films fail - you care about the characters! This isn't only true of the lead characters either, it is also true for several of the supporting cast. There are plenty of laughs and a very memorable visual scene towards the end of the film. I guess some of the laughs may be a little vulgar for some peoples tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Truly Strange Black Comedy Action Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's uncertain whether or not Kingsman reflects the best of the evolving black comedy trend in movies or not and whether such a trend is a passing or permanent element of a classic movie. Whichever it is, Kingsman currently is a superior film with its finely honed balance of black, dark murderous content being portrayed alongside British, gentlemanly wit. This film is a Colin Firth's best actor Oscar high English version of the The King's Speech (2010) meets the comedic spy romp of James Coburn's Our Man Flint (1966) meets the hard edged, raw espionage of the refurbished, rebranded James Bond in the form of Daniel Craig in Casino Royale (2006). Dark comedy in the spy genre has been gaining more prominent film focus as they have evolved from the more entertaining comedy action motif of the popular and zany Wild, Wild West (1999) or the romantic interplay of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005) taking on the more darker and serious ambiance of the action crime thriller, The Dark Knight (2008) as Sam Rockwell in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (2002) and Pierce Brosnan in The Matador (2005) seemed to make be some of the first forays into this gumbo of movie genres that began with the classic Pulp Fiction (1994), Kingsman appears to take its basic thematic tone from the blackest of action comedy of Uma Thurman's Kill Bill 1 &amp; 2 (2003, 2004) and incorporating a culturally off-balance brush stroke of the military black comedy war movie Tropic Thunder (2008). Recently a number of movies have taken murderous death and blended these atrocious acts with a finely balanced hue of comedic overtones such as Bill Nighy's Wild Target (2009), Violet &amp; Daisy (2011), Brad Pitt in Killing Them Softly (2012), Kevin Costner in 3 Days to Kill (2014) and Katie Holme's very proper but fatalistic Miss Meadows (2014). Kingsman includes the added bonus of a strong performance as a villain in the form of a fascinatingly speech impeded Samuel L. Jackson. This dark comedic action thriller comes across as something, fresh, new, and bold while sustaining an especially emotional intensity throughout and grabbing the audience refusing to let them go until the end. Whether or not this whole creatively new comedic frenzied experience is a passing endorphin high or some established benchmark of greatest remains to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>17 years after the sacrifice of his friend Lee and welcoming Lancelot into the secret spy organization Kingsman, Galahad/Harry finds Lancelot killed in a solo rescue attempt, and Lee's son Eggsy arrested. Harry then have a chat with Eggsy where he dismisses the thugs who had a quarrel with Eggsy. Soon Eggsy comes to the tailor shop, which has the secret entrance to the Kingsman HQ. Harry offers to recruit him and Eggsy accepts. In boot camp Eggsy quickly gains a friend in Roxy, and an enemy in Charlie. Meanwhile, Harry investigates on leads from Lancelot's death and gets thrown into a coma by an explosion. At night Eggsy and the other recruits find their room full with water. Roxy finds a way to get air, while Eggsy breaks the two-way mirror to their rescue. Eggsy visits the recovered Harry and they learn that the leads all lead to Valentine, who's sharing free SIM cards.Harry visits Valentine under guise and finds only information about a hate group in Kentucky. Eggsy and the recruits are tested to parachute with one of them having no chute. Only Eggsy, Roxy and Charlie passes this stage. Eggsy meets Harry back in the tailor shop and to their surprise Valentine is also there trying a suit. The three youngsters have another test to sweet talk a girl. But actually it's a test to endure interrogation, in which Charlie fails. The final test has Eggsy and Roxy to shoot their pet dogs, in which Eggsy fails, thus Roxy becomes the new Lancelot. Harry dragged the angry Eggst and revealed that the bullet for the dog is a blank. Harry goes to Kentucky to investigate. But Valentine activates a signal through his shared free SIM cards, which makes everyone kills each other, from which Harry is the only survivor. But Valentine waits for him at the exit and kills him. Eggsy meets Arthur about Harry, but he learns that Arthur had gained a scar like the professor Valentine kidnapped. Thus Eggsy evaded Arthur's murder attempt by switching his drinks. Eggsy meets Merlin and Roxy to stop Valentine. Roxy wears a special suit to go into orbit and take out a satellite to inhibit the signal while Eggsy and Merlin goes to Valentine's base. Eggsy manages to sneak in and help Merlin hack Valentine's signal. Eggsy goes back to Merlin as Roxy nails her target. But Valentine gets another satellite and uses his biometric security, preventing any hacks as long as his hand is on the scanner. Eggsy arrives and fights Valentine's hench-woman Gazelle, and finally throws one of Gazelle's bladed prosthetic leg to Valentine.The story is very nice. It's reminiscent of oldies Bond movies yet it's even more. At first I thought the movie's edge is the combination of the comedy into it. But after I see it, the movie very much like a great nostalgia as it also looks very lively to the younger generations. The elements paying homage to old Bond, and spy movies in general is a great thing to refresh the spy movie sub genre. spy movies get to be varied now; as some rely on the sly gadgetry like Bond movies, while other focus on the intrigues like Spy Game, action like Bourne movies. Or even humor like Austin Power movies. But this movie definitely states that a spy movie can have all of that and still be great without losing focus.The action is very nice. You get to see classy action and fighting, using the classic spy gadgets like the poison-bladed shoe, lighter grenade and bulletproof umbrella. Don't expect to see efficient fight moves like the ones in Bourne movies. The fight moves are flamboyant with flips, somersaults, and also has a Kill Bill feel to it with close up blood and gore.The comedy is also very nice. Overall they are funny and well paced. They even get to be very funny at some spots. I couldn't stop laughing at the scene where Eggsy takes JB for a walk. Matthew Vaughn really used his Snatch and Lock Stock experiences to a good way in making some of the fights, particularly the fights with the local gangsters, look funny at times.The acting is decently good. Having Colin Firth as the focus gentleman spy is a great thing since he has the roots and the face to create the authentic Bristish gentleman aura. He did play as the British king George after all. Taron Egerton didn't disappoint in his performance. Samuel L. Jackson adds a thing to the villain that makes the character easy to remember. Having Michael Caine really adds to the British feel.MY say is that Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014) really deserves an 8 out of 10 score, and a must-see recommendation. Entertainment is guaranteed for me from this movie, and a sequel is a yes for my wish list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is hands down one of the best films I have ever seen. The films perfect blend of witty comedy and over the top action makes for a movie that rivals the forefathers of the spy genre. I have never really been a fan of action or spy movies, as I found that they have become stale over the years with a recycled plot line (with Skyfall being my only exception). However, Matthew Vaughn has managed to make something truly amazing rise from the ashes of the action genre. This is an epic movie filled with ultra-violence; laugh out loud moments and a strong and coherent plot, thus paving the way for this to be an inevitable success. As some of the other reviewers have put it, this is what would happen if Kick-Ass and James Bond made sweet love and created the ultimate spy action movie. It contains all the same nuance's that you would expect from a British spy movie, with the elegant spoken word and the dapper costumes and suits. But it is all built around the framework of over the top violence that will make even the strong willed wince in pain. The best way to describe it is, this is an action movie that understands it's an action movie, Vaughn hasn't tried to water it down to make it more 'child friendly' if anything he has turned the dial up and chucked in as much violence and foul-mouthed comedy as he could get away with (however I must stress that it is just enough to carry the film and its brilliant plot, and it isn't just violence for the sake of it)But I would say the number one thing that kept this film fresh and entertaining was the undeniably awesome cast consisting of heavy hitters like Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson mixed with up and coming stars like Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson. For me, Colin Firth stole the show as the suave super spy with the ability to kill you with his pinkie finger ? because we are so used to seeing him play roles that require such seriousness, it was refreshing and fun to see him out of his comfort zone and play a more dynamic character. Whilst talking about cast, it's only right that I mention that Sam Jackson delivers another sterling performance with a character I promise you weren't expecting, but also Taron shows that he is well on his way to stardom and that he has a range that his acting chops are developing very nicely. All in all, the breath-taking cinematography and witty script backed by an impeccable cast means that Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the best films I have ever witnessed. It is original and cool, but most of all it doesn't require much thinking on your part. So you can sit back, relax and enjoy the epic story as it unfolds before you. P.S. If it is a decision between Fifty Shades of Grey and this masterpiece, I urge you wholeheartedly to make Kingsman your choice as I promise you, you will not be disappointed. 10/10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A must see movie! It's been a very long time since a movie can make me this excited and interested. I've watched Kingsman twice I and maybe I'll watch it again, like tonight.Colin Firth as Harry Hart was brilliant, never think I would be this crazy because of a middle age man who is even older than my father LOL. His aura while playing the character was indescribable, a gentleman but at the same time, have great humor, and swearing smoothly. Just full of charisma. Taron was fantastic too, he was terribly cool, handsome at the end of the movie. Can't forget Merlin.Love everything about the movie, hope there will be part 2.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and I watched the trailer for this film two weeks ago and she wanted to see it and I didn't. Seemed a silly sendup of the spy genre badly miscast with Colin Firth in a lead role and shot in a frenetic style. Surprise, surprise. This is the most fun we've had at the movies in a long while now.Colin Firth is exactly right for his part. He deftly wavers between dead serious and quiet amusement. Not once did I think even for a moment that anyone better known for action movies could have done half as well. He's very entertaining and in a lot of ways the film revolves around him to its benefit.I found Samuel L. Jackson's lisp a bit distracting and a little off-putting, but no deal breaker. The character I was most intrigued by was Gazelle the villain's henchwoman played by an extremely comely Sofia Boutella who would make an impressive Bond girl. Throughout she's a delight to watch doing evil despite her having no feet.There's humor here and a good sense of fun. But I can't say I'm that enthused about a sequel though the main character here, Eggsy, played by Taron Egerton, is quite good. His transformation here is pretty impressive, but he's awfully young.Of course, I started out thinking the movie was going to be boring, and I was quite wrong about that. I could be completely wrong about Eggsy in a sequel. I do know they've racked up enough goodwill with me that I won't be able to resist taking a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little bit of Bond, Little bit of Kill Bill, little bit Austin Powers. I've always liked movies where the main character evolves into a bad ass better version of himself. The fighting in this movie is definitely above average violent. John Wick recently..i didn't love the movie, but i did appreciate that the violence and fight scenes were more graphic than usual. The scene in the church in this movie was very reminiscent of the scene in the Japanese restaurant in Kill Bill. Also worth noting....I remember reading that Tarantino had to make that scene black and white to get around the censors because there was "too much" blood in that scene. There is a scene towards the end of this movie where some animation was inserted in lieu of horrific graphic violence, which i thought was hilarious. There are also movie lines that stay with you for the rest of your life, "I am your father", etc... and this movie has might what go down as the single greatest line in movie history...taken in context..who said it...the situation, the fact that it was out of the blue and seemingly out of character for this person, and the other persons response to it...was just great. If you like Bond, Men in Black, Mission impossible, 24, etc....and you have an above average sense of humor, go see it. There are so many movies that are just recycled and lacking in originality...its nice to see a movie that contains elements you don't normally see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie practically makes a case for itself. It's every bit as outrageous and bizarre as old Bond movies with equally colorful outlandish characters. It uses anticipation of gritty spy movies made in recent decade, then unapologetically opts for much more eccentric route, even though some of them are a bit too strange. When all the bullets have been fired and nifty gadgets used, the aftermath might not be sensible, but it will definitely delight.Story revolves around Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a young man who has a less fortunate life. After a few events Harry Hart (Colin Firth) recruits him to join a secret service known as Kingsman out of respect for his fallen father. This may play out similarly to a few other spy movies at the start, but what separates it is the exaggerated antics. It has action theme, but everything is done with lighter candid tone. Egerton is a good cast, as he's new and represents youthful bravado with slight volatile emotion.As the rest of the cast are veteran actors, half of them being dapper British and also Samuel L. Jackson, there's bound to be elegance, especially in the profanity. Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Colin Firth look like they are just having fun, it's fresh to see them beyond their usual somber characters in thrillers or dramas. Props to the character Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), she's as agile as her name suggests. Her character expresses personality a lot through motion and the bionic legs are really nice touch inspired from classic Bond.Choreography is blatantly over-the-top, all with dodging bullets or deflecting them with umbrella. The direction delivers either pleasant yet surprising details or excessive burst of loud explosion, both are done in earnest whimsical nature. Script is very honest, the movie realizes it's better to play to its strength rather than using convoluted gimmick, as it aptly puts it.It's loud and occasionally senseless, but one can't fault Kingsman for not having class. After all, looking good is half the battle. is half the battle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Comic book films have become a genre in themselves over the last decade. The well-known characters ? Batman, Spiderman, Xmen, Avengers etc have been consistently successful which has led Hollywood executives to plunder the more obscure titles in search of the next big thing. Kingsman: The Secret Service is one such title based on the graphic novel, The Secret Service by legendary writer Frank Miller but the difference is this is not a film to take the kids to. But don't let that put you off, it's one of the most enjoyable and over the top experiences you'll see at the movies all year. Kingsman kicks off in 1997 somewhere in the Middle East. Secret agents, AKA The Kingsman led by Harry (Colin Firth) are on a mission to extract information from a prisoner who duly blows himself up, killing one of their agents. It's Harry's duty to break the news to his widow and in turn meets young Egsy (played by newcomer Taron Egerton). Years later The Kingsman are looking for another recruit and Egsy (now grown up and in the midst of a local gang war) comes to Harry's attention. The next hour of the film is a cross between The Apprentice and Full Metal Jacket as the potential recruits are tested in life or death situations and whittled down to find the best of the best. In the meantime we are introduced to token megalomaniac billionaire villain Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) who is making it his mission to sell his "product" to all the world leaders in an attempt to save the Earth from extinction ? of course nothing is ever as it seems and it's only a matter of time before the Doomsday clock starts ticking. It's here that the film starts to have fun. The casting of Colin Firth is a genius move ? always known as a gentle type of dramatic actor in his first action role, Firth is let fully off the leash and must've spent months in training for the two brilliantly filmed, and extremely violent fight scenes that are as good as anything similar you've seen on screen before. Taron Egerton ? plucked from relative TV obscurity ? does a fine job and this will no doubt be the start of a new career for him. Samuel L Jackson is good value and can play this role in his sleep and his henchwoman, Gazelle is straight from the Comics and slices up opponents with her blades that double as legs. The director Matthew Vaughn (director of Kick Ass ? the copied style of funny, ultra violence here is clear as crystal) is also on great form and handles the action superbly - clearly setting the tone to be an enjoyable ride whilst frequently referencing the old school James Bond films before he went all serious ? gadgets, guns and girls are the order of the day. All in all, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a cracking piece of OTT cinematic excitement ? Mission Accomplished!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When dealing with a James Bond type of thriller you always need to suspend belief and go with the flow. I get that. But when the flow is boring as watching paint dry, and the main hero character has zero talent or screen presence, you're in for a long couple of hours. Colin Firth was excellent in his role but no one else added anything to this film. Samuel Jackson plays another yelling, complaining character on screen, now there's a surprise for you. His character was also so stupid and cartoonist that it was impossible to believe he rose to the power he was suppose to have.It's just a lot of noise that went south quickly. I rather watch a rerun of any Bond, Bourne or Mission Impossible movie than this train wreck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do you parody something that already parodies itself? James Bond boasts 23 cannon films. 25 if you include David Niven's Casino Royale (1967) and Sean Connery's remake of Thunderball (1965), Never Say Never Again (1983). Those who venture to see the whole series will no doubt understand just how far-fetched and outlandish the world of James Bond is. Crazy megalomaniacal villains, convenient gadgets, patronizing (at best) treatment of women; Maybe Daniel Craig's severe take as 007 has made audiences forget just how silly the series got.Kingman: The Secret Service is the story of a British hood named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who is given the chance to prove his mettle as a member of an elite secret service organization. Colin Firth plays his mentor (code name: Galahad) because years ago his father saved his life during a mission. While Eggsy is in training an eccentric tech billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson) is in the final stages of his nefarious plan to stop global warming. Can the Kingmen stop him before he submerges the world in chaos?Critics are calling this movie a cheeky send up of the spy film genre. "Stylish, subversive and above all fun..." says the rottentomatoes.com banner over a 74% critic score. I must have missed something. Stylish? I suppose if you think the interiors of an old-timey tailor shop mixed with the interiors of Professor Xavier's School for mutants is stylish. Subversive? Does this movie subvert conventions? No it embraces them. Fun? Well, if your definition of fun is a church full of innocent people getting slaughtered while "Free Bird" plays in the background.Now I'm not saying that gratuitous amounts of violence can't be fun. Who can't see a movie like Shoot'Em Up (2007) without a sense of awe an infectious giggling. But in that movie there was a premium on innocence. Those not directly related to the plot were omitted from the bloodletting and the one innocent in the film (the baby) was the one thing Clive Owen was protecting. The point driven home in Kingmen is there is no innocence. By virtue of being alive (and living in London, Rio or Kentucky) you're a participant in the villains endgame and an "entertaining" pawn in the story.But hey, the good guys succeed in the end right? Well they do but the villain convinced nearly every head of state to go with his plan so realistically the world would still descend into chaos anyway. And what of our heroes? An organization that is old-money-rich, white, and British with one co-opted hood laying the kill stroke. Meanwhile the conspiracy they stop is diverse, largely new money and Samuel L. himself is black and if the medallion around his neck is to be believed, Muslim. His ultimate goal: stop global warming. Well if that's not a plot dreamed up by the editorial board of The Daily Mail I don't know what could be.Each scene that doesn't involve gratuitous violence is rushed at the expense of the actors humanizing their characters. Firth sits in an office full of Sun headlines and explains that each headline represents a day he accomplished a mission for the Kingmen and the world never noticed. Egerton leaves his mother's house by taking a moment to comfort his little baby sister. These are moments that could have shown emotional resonance but were undermined by the villain making an appearance and Egerton escaping baddies with parkour respectively. Why get to know the characters at all when we could briskly move onto the next martial-arts set piece.All in all, Kingman is an overloaded male fantasy with a fatalistic view of human behavior and an insultingly out of touch, Anglos- know- best mentality. The action, while occasionally cool to look at, can't hide its hatred filled heart and its attempts at parody are at the very most half-assured. Yet despite all this, I'm taken aback by the movie's critical success and the formation of a cult following. What is society coming to when we celebrate the demise of hundreds with computer chips in their neck and laugh at the potential deaths of billions who only wanted free cellphone service.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn slams into the world of spy and espionage with Kingsman: The Secret Service, a marvelous 2 hour montage of high octane action, witty dialogue and gentlemen being gentlemen.Kingsman centers around Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton) whose is recruited by a top secret spy organization where he is trained by Harry Hart (Colin Firth) to become an agent in this secret service. They, along with a crew of Kingsmen, must together foil a plan by villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson).Director Matthew Vaughn brings his visual flair to Kingsman with some highly stylized action set pieces. The movie may have a budget 3 times less than James Bond movies but it isn't apparent here, where each sequence is used till it's maximum potential.Colin Firth is terrific as Harry Hart; suave and stylish while Taron Egerton provides a nice pairing. Sofia Boutella delivers a standout performance as henchwoman to Valentine, Gazelle. She is lethal from start and makes some gratuitously violent kills, while always maintaining a threat and formidable opponent to the Kingsmen.The violence is over the top but gleefully so. Many violent scenes shrouded in other spy movies are at full display here despite many of them being cartoonish.Kingsman is self referential and that element provides many of the humour for the movie. It recognizes James Bond, My Fair Lady and 24 amongst many other popular movies &amp; TV Shows.Overall, Kingsman is a blast and with its solid direction, magnificent score and sense of fun, is a spy movie for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Class Apart Spy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of spy films and an addict of Bond films. Must have watched each Bond film multiple times. However, I also like the good old spy films like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Basically, spy films according to me are of two types - the Bond type and the non Bond type. Bond type is where the plot is thin as a wafer and there are fast cars, gadgets, comic book villains, big action set pieces and sexy women. The non Bond type is exactly opposite of the above. Solid story minus the glamour.Matthew Vaughn just turns the tables. He and his writers create an excellent and delicious cocktail of the above types that left me high for a long while.So like Bond films there is a comic book villain (played deliciously by Samuel L Jackson), a bit ridiculous plot, some cool gadgets, good action sequences and a couple of hot women which includes a villain's henchwoman who has blade feet and cuts people apart literally.It also has the story of who are Kingsman, an independent spy agency and how time on time have saved the world from crisis. Kingsman can be looked as a coming age of film of a young man who is wasting his life who turns into a spy and gets meaning and purpose.So you have the writers who spoof Bond, Jason Bourne, Jack Bauer and all the major spy movies we have seen till date. However, its not like Austin Powers and Johnny English which were out and out spoofs. Here Vaughan ensures that things are in control. It also helps that he gets in a good bunch of actors to play key roles. What attracted me to this film was Colin Firth playing the role of a spy and doing action sequences. Frankly, Firth is a marvelous actor but never seem his doing an action film. After watching Kingsman, I say man please do some more action films because Firth is a pretty decent action hero. Check out the pub and church scene.Egerton is also a star to watch out for in the future. He is talented and nicely plays the part of young drifter who turns into a good spy. Jackson is brilliant as usual and Strong does a commendable job.However, the only thing I didn't like abt the film is the blood shed. Well, killing people with guns and bombs in fine. But here Vaughan is very inspired from Tarantino's work. So there is lot of blood spilled and the church scene is a classic case. If you are someone who doesn't like blood and gore stay away. However, if you love spy films and don't mind the blood spill...you'll enjoy Kingsman. I hope there is a sequel for it.</fullReview>

If you do enjoy fun, old school, aesthetically gorgeous sets and direction and superbly choreographed fight scenes, this is for you. Though some of these moments were not always too my liking, it's hard to deny the pleasure you have watching this movie. The makers of the movie were all in great form: Millar's script is craziness at its best, and it is paired with Vaughn's superb eye and perfect pacing.

		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this film for a long time and I have to say that I was surprised as to how good this movie is. The trailer seemed boring, so I was not expecting much, but the first ten minutes was great and it set the tone for the rest of the film. What I truly loved about this is even though its a spy movie, it still had fresh, original characters with great personalities, mainly Valentine. The plot is great and the events are played out so well, even though anybody could think of this plot. But it is the action sequence and dialog that makes this film a memorable one. Its truly British so it was great to finally see a culture other than American, especially one as charming as the Brits. Kudos to the director for this amazing work. I am not sure why it got an R rating though, the blood and gore seemed okay to me, not over the top but still so very good. I was pleased to see fresh faces and Samuel L. Jackson playing a chill role. The biggest surprise was Colin Firth, I never knew he could kick so much ass ! I am never going to forget his role. Finally, the best thing about the movie is the absence of over the top explosions. The 'big' scenes are all hand on hand combat (with appropriate gear) and it was fantastic ! I have never felt more alive or joyous to see people get brutally killed and have their limbs hacked off or their brains splattered out as I did in this film. Maybe its how the Brits do it, but for the first time, I didn't see the badass girl wearing skintight clothes that barely cover anything or having a supermodel pose throughout the film... the girl with the legs was a complete badass and I am in love. Its a great film that you will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What you get when you mix a James Bond movie like 007 and Matthew Vaughn's 2010 hit Kick-Ass? You get Kingsman: The Secret Service, a wildly funny and pleasing action comedy starring Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson. This film is packed with everything a great action comedy needs: amazing casting, gut busting humor, and a fantastic script. Kingsman is easily one of the best funniest comedies I have seen in recent years and contains some of the most clever one-liners, especially from Samuel L. Jackson. It had my friends and I laughing almost constantly throughout the duration of the film.Taron Egerton plays Eggsy, a young man in his late teens or early twenties who is called by Harry Galahad (Colin Firth) to join a top secret organization known as "Kingsman", a corporation of spies. There, he must go through a grueling training to take down an evil villain, Richmond Valentine who is bent taking over the world by using mind control chips on everyone around the world. Sound familiar? The funniest part about this how the chips causes people to engage into fist fights and kill each other which is shown in various scenes. This movie is filled with insanely hilarious scenes such as Colin Firth beating the crap out of thugs with an umbrella and Eggsy blowing up everyone's heads into cartoonish explosions, as well as the comedic chemistry from Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, and Taron Egerton. If you are a big fan of Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2, this is a movie not worth missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is brilliant. Lets not mess around here, it's a truly fantastic movie. Matthew Vaughn delivers a cracking spy film which delivers thrills and spills but also emotion so you can connect with the characters.The acting in Kingsman in sublime. Colin Firth puts in a stellar performance, acting with grit and getting the comedic side bang on. Newcomer Taron Egerton is also fantastic, getting the right balance between hard man and nice man, without making his character too clichéd. The action and soundtrack are 2 other things which really stood out for me in this film, with the action sequences shot in a very unique and stylistic way that makes the action enthralling. The finale, without spoiling it, it particularly good for action sequences. The soundtrack is a mix of composed music made directly for the film and well known songs, like Guardians of the Galaxy. This works really well, and gives the film a fun tone and makes you smile.The only reason this doesn't get a ten is because it felt a bit short in places, especially when Eggsy is training. Hopefully this will be extended on DVD, to add that extra bit of story. Maybe the back story was too confusing. Make up your own mind. Watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The summary line accounts for the only spoiler I'll include with this review.Rarely have I seen a movie so full of acting potential that ended up being so completely wasted. Colin Firth should be ashamed of himself for "acting" in this excuse of a film.I get the uber-violence genre. It worked in Kick Ass, it worked in The Hills Have Eyes. In this movie, it was just gratuitous and unnecessary. To be honest, it made Kick Ass 2 look like the Sound of Music.I went to the movie with my wife and two friends. They sat through it; I didn't. About half an hour before it ended, I walked out, found the movie theater's manager, told him some little 5-year old kid was running up and down the isle squealing in delight while people were being butchered on screen and his parents were too busy taking selfies in the front row to notice (no joke, this actually happened - the mother was wearing a burka, so I can't say exactly how the selfies turned out, but they DID use a flash). An usher was immediately dispatched and the family was escorted from the theater. Apparently, they'd been there for 6 hours, slipping in and out of different movies all day.Now you'd think that THIS was what got me to walk out, but I can assure you, it wasn't. It was the asinine dialog, the poor attempt at acting (a miserable failure, by the way, from some of the great actors of our time) and the unrelenting noise and violence, editing snafus, ridiculous attempt at character development, the complete inability for me to experience suspension of disbelief, the sad attempts at manufactured pathos... they all conspired to make me give up on this film before I lost any more brain cells.My ticket was refunded by an apologetic manager. I told him it wasn't his fault that the British film industry lost its ability to produce anything that isn't crap. For what it's worth, he agreed.I know there are a lot of 12 year old reviewers who are going to disagree with my review. But as someone who's been going to the movies once a week for over 40 years, this was hands-down one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some serious doozies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>American movie that try to do British humor. I can't rate 0 out of 10. Too bad. I just lost 2h on this movie so i wont throw away 30 more minutes to my life in writing a stupid review. Take my advise if you like movie with a bit of common sens and something worth to watch. If you don't and like to eat dejection with your pancake please be my guest and enjoy this crap. In fact i hated this movie so much that it push me to write a review on it, thing that i never do. I can't understand why it is so overrated on the internet, but when i see 9gag going crazy about John Wick and the probably sequel i'm wonder why we invented cinema in the first place. I don't like "bad movie" but Kingman is over the notion of "bad" or "worthless" in fact know i will said this movie is "Kingman" to say how stupid, and awful a movie is. Thank Kingman to be the new reference to really not worth movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a very few surprises (that make this a 3 and not a 2) this is a crass, violent, poorly thought out movie. Sending up the spy genre has been done better elsewhere many times. The acting by Firth is enjoyable, but everybody else much less so. Jackson's lisp helps add some levity, but there is nothing else redeeming to it.The gadgets are predictable, the side plots underwritten and unbelievable. The plot points revolving around hacking computers just interminable. 30 years ago this would have seemed clever, now not so much.a movie for kids with nods to Hunger Games team competition that go nowhere. wait for a slow evening and redbox it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Pleasant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance one would expect from viewing the trailer that this was the typical action undercover hero plot; filled with high tech gear, sick defense skills, some handsomely dapper suits and a mission to save the world. And without surprise, the film would consist of those elements in entirety. However, this hero spy movie actually has a stranger element that is rather a progressive and growing controversy surrounding the ever growing issue of global warming. This film I think tests the strange and rather immoral ideas of a human genocide to ultimately control global warming by decreasing the inhabitants of Earth dramatically. Viewed by most people, it is such a distant and abstract thought that I think reveals some truth to the reality of the situation we have on this planet, although it may not be the best solution to saving the planet for our society. The film's villain and mastermind, Valentine, is played by the comical Samuel L. Jackson. The oxymoron of Valentine begins just as Jackson says his first lines, expecting to have an intimidating factor, with a lisp. This small and seemingly insignificant detail just makes it a little hard to take his "scary" character so seriously. I think Jackson did pleasant job portraying his role with such intended sarcasm and humor. Beside the sci-fi half the film revolves around, the other follows the noble and strong heroes of the film, the 'Kingsmen'. The high speed action and intense side of the "life of a Kingsman" created the typical hero element with such a clever sense of humor that seemed to get better throughout the movie. Towards the last scenes of the film there was a whole lovely package of smart and witty humor that just kept getting better. Taron Egerton who played the role of Eggsy, the misfit protégé to the Kingsman fellowship was a fitting addition to the cast. I personally adored the character of Eggsy and was won over when he chose not to shoot his beloved pug at the end of his Kingsman training. He fit right along the dashing and classy Harry Hart played by the talented Colin Firth. The pair together was quite fitting as makeshift father and son. That made it just as heart wrenching when Harry passed right in front of the eyes of Eggsy, a definite shock. My favorite scene perhaps comes at the very end where Eggsy comes dressed in a suit and carrying an umbrella fit for a Kingsman to the bar he first met had exposure to Harry's role as a Kingsman. He comes to take his mother from his step-father only to end in the infamous scene shown an hour before in the movie originally performed by Firth as Harry Heart. It was a humorous tribute to the already clever scene. All in all this film was perhaps the greatest pleasant surprise I have had in awhile attending a show still in theaters. Not a waste of a ticket, but instead 130 minutes sarcastic and profanity stricken humor that in my opinion; the best kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, twisted, thrilling, funny, pleasantly enjoyable and agreeably entertaining. Matthew Vaughn strikes gold (again). He has a licence to thrill this time. A winner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have got eight more months until we see Spectre, which we be Bond's next outing on the silver screen. If there in anything in these eight months that would entertain us while waiting, Matthew Vaughn's Kingsman: The Secret Service is one of the closest to your calling.Five years ago, we got Kick-Ass, a spoof superhero movie that unleashed a new cinematic language. It was rather one of the most irresistibly entertaining films of the past few years. It's ultra-violent structure and bar-over-topping scale of profanity and humour proved that director Vaughn could be a genius at this stuff. The plot focuses on a teenager who decides to become a superhero. Basically for me, even though it isn't one of my favourite films of all time, the film feels like an instant classic.Newcomer Taron Egerton plays Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, a cockney teen from London. Harry Hart (Colin Firth) is a secret agent who works for Kingsman (a secret spy service similar to MI6) on a "Diagon Alley", like London street. He finds 'Eggsy' and recruits him to stop an evil mastermind, Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). He wants to take over the world with an evil plan (the typical baddie plot, hey?). But before doing so, he needs to complete in a few life-risking tasks with other opponents (sounds familiar to you? Hunger Games? Divergent? Yes, most of the young adult books seem the same these days. Don't you agree?).Mark Strong and Michael Caine play supporting roles alongside Firth in the service. Even Star Wars' Mark Hamill pops up (as a professor, not a Jedi in case you were wondering...) and clearly and obviously, at 63, looks different to how he looked four decades ago. Let's see how he revisits as Luke again in "The Force Awakens" this December.The jokes arrive agreeably but not as quickly as I was expecting. The film deals with themes such as dysfunction families and bullying. These are serious issues so some ways it has a more mature nature than Vaughn's previous film (Kick-Ass). Vaughn's tone hasn't changed which is a relief. Even if it takes time to register, it's pretty funny stuff. Vaughn and his co-writer Jane Goldman also throw in Bond references as well which add to the fun. The lacking of ultra-violence is really the only disappointment. There's an overlong entertaining church fight sequence, and the climax at the finale is overblown (probably one of the biggest key references to Bond throughout the whole film). There's also a noticeably clichéd but really fun pub battle. Other than these, there's not a huge amount of action.You can't help thinking that it might be a mirror image of Vaughn's previous film as it's done by the same director and writers. But after a while, you get used to the different structure of the film itself.Could Vaughn be an expert at spy movies? I can't answer this. It's a question only for you to answer. Myself, I consider it to be perhaps the best and most clever spy spoof since the Johnny English films. So my answer would be that he would not entirely be an expert at spy movies but one at these style of spoofs. Having done a superhero spoof in 2010 and a spy spoof in 2015, we'll have to see what handle he'll give us in another five years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, exciting, exhilarating roller-coaster of a film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who watches action movies these days and thinks, 'Hmm. For an action film, this is pretty tame'?Don't worry. This thought doesn't exist when watching 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. At least, not in my head.With F-Bombs galore, plenty of fighting, some great acting, and a overall exciting story, Matthew Vaughn and co. have successfully helped make a enjoyable film that favours towards fans of mature action movies. First off, the cast. I'd like to make it known I've never watched a Colin Firth film in my life. Good thing 'Kingsman' was my first one. Who'd have thought he could pull off the role of a sophisticated secret agent that just so happens to be a kick-ass fighter? By all accounts, Firth himself did 80% of the stunts in this film. And believe me, for all the moves his character Harry Hart pulls, 80% is impressive. Very impressive. Samuel L. Jackson is equally as enjoyable to watch, playing millionaire tech genius and megalomaniac Richmond Valentine. The man is clearly enjoying himself in this role, and clearly making it his own. My only flaw with his character is sometimes, it's a little difficult to take him seriously as a villain. With his obvious lisp, flamboyant clothes, and squeamishness towards blood, you'd be forgiven if the number of laughs outweighed the number of shocked gasps when it comes to Valentine (except for one MAJOR scene that made my jaw drop to the floor). But I'll be honest with anyone reading this; I seriously don't care about the 'funny villain' act. In fact, it suited him. I haven't seen many bad guys get laughs like Jackson does in 'Kingsman'. And that impresses me. Impressed by Firth and Jackson and we're barely into the review. Told you I enjoyed this. Moving on to the rest of the cast; there's Michael Caine who, let's face it, can pretty much play any role he's offered...which he does in this...fantastically. Mark Strong, a Vaughn alumni previously seen in Kick-Ass, also does a great job playing the 'M' of the film, known as Merlin here.And to my personal favourite cast member; Welsh newcomer Taron Egerton. Playing Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin, he perfectly portrays a male version of Eliza Doolittle from 'My Fair Lady'...of sorts (that popular story is referenced in a rather amusing scene between him and Firth). While already possessing skills of superior physicality and intelligence, he squanders these and, not exactly by choice, lives a life of petty crime.That is until he is recruited by Harry Hart to become a Kingsman. How this happens would be venturing into spoiler territory. But don't worry. It isn't glossed over. There is a particular reason Harry helps Eggsy as you'll see... As the film progresses, Eggsy is a character you root for in every scene. Whether it be for him and his Pug (I did just say 'and his Pug') to make it to the end of the Kingsman training course, or to helping the other Kingsmen save the world, you can't help but feel hopeful that he'll end up successful. He's also hilarious. Did I not mention that? My ("dopeass top) hat" goes off to the rest of the cast, too. Sophie Cookson was a great choice for a fellow Kingsman recruit who bonds with Eggsy during the challenges they face together in the recruitment process, Sofia Boutella masterfully plays Valentine's beautiful but lethal sidekick who has razor sharp blades in place of legs, and even the supporting cast like Eggsy's mother, played by Eastenders actress Samantha Womack, and the Kingsman agent Lancelot, Jack Davenport of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' fame, are well casted. Even Luke Skywalker himself pops up in a couple of scenes as Professor James Arnold, portrayed enjoyably by Mark Hamill himself.As you have seen, a sterling cast. But when you get a good cast in an action film, you need to have good action sequences to go with them. And this film rarely disappoints. While I did go in expecting the violence to be a bit more graphic (that doesn't mean it's all sunshine and lollipops violence-wise!), the choreography in the fight scenes were some of the best moves I've seen in movie history. It's exciting without looking like a mess, brutal without being too O-T-T, and entertaining without dropping a beat. A pub brawl, a 7 minute fight scene in a church (yes, you read correctly), and a duel between 2 characters towards the end are just a few of the many joyous action sequences we see. And for those who took my previous statement of the violence being SLIGHTLY less graphic than expected to heart, this film originally had an 18 rating here in the UK before it had reductions to some scenes of violence, meaning it's more than likely the DVD and Blu-ray copies will be released with the 18 rated version in mind. An honourable mention goes to the soundtrack of this film which, in my eyes and ears, is one to watch out for when it's released officially. There are some incredibly epic sounding tunes in the movie, some genuinely moving ones, and even a tune from Take That themselves in the credits, which I've listened to every day since it was released...and I'm NOT a Take That fan. Overall, while being slightly less violent than I was expecting (not necessarily a bad thing), 'Kingsman' is definitely the best new film I've seen recently. While you may be put off by the lengthy running time, the 2 hours fly by as you watch this hilarious, action-packed, exciting, and above all, fun film. But don't take my word for it! Go see 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' and enjoy it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was embarrassingly stupid from start to finish. A stinking load of feces with huge lapses in logic and riddled with the most senseless violence with no nod towards reality. It was like some high school kids had an unlimited budget and access to top-notch actors and went on to make a childish mess of a film. I can't believe this was written by anyone out of their teens. I doubt that I will ever be able to take these actors seriously again. Sam Jackson was idiotic as a lisping half-moron, Colin Firth was no better in his role as a Bond wannabe. A hire-the-handicapped assassin? Completely and utterly stupid.I just wanted the movie to stop. Please, please stop!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Uncensored Bond, for a New Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comic book and graphic novel adaptations are something of a speciality for Director Matthew Vaughn. He has proved his worth with the ultra-violent 'Kick-Ass', the superior 'X-Men First Class' and now the stylish 'Kingsman: The Secret Service'. He is in my eyes one of the most original Directors working today. 'Kingsman' sees him at the top of his game and with the upcoming release of the twenty fourth Bond film later this year, what better time to release this spy parody.Now, the English have had a poor track record when it comes to spy spoofs. If 'Johnny English' was a guilty pleasure then 'Storm breaker' was definitely a disappointment to say the least. But 'Kingsman' works so well on multiple levels and even the plot is pleasurable.With the untimely death of two Kingsman agents, the others working in the field must find two suitable replacements. One of the candidates happens to be the son of a Dead agent from a botched mission that took place in 1997. He is Gary Unwin or 'Eggsy' if you are his friend. First time actor Taron Egerton who plays him with edge and conviction, if this is his first role imagine what he could accomplish in the future. The candidates participate in the "most dangerous job interview" they will ever get. Eventually Gary takes up the role of a Kingsman agent who is taught their prestigious ways by the smart and very talented Harry Hart played by Colin Firth. Whom still proves that he has got it, even if he is in his mid-fifties. I have heard that the majority of the action scenes he undertook himself and therefore I have to hand it to the man.Once the agents are assembled they must take down Valentine a villain with a lisp. Samuel L Jackson takes up the role. I would have thought that he would be unable to impress me as he is always able to outshine other major players. But, he proves that he is still one of the most dependable and bankable actors of this generation. Valentine hatches a plot to rid the world of those whom he deems are less than worthy to inhabit it. As he realises that the population is increasing the rate of global warming and must be taken care of. He wishes to carry out this plot through biological warfare with the help of amputee Gazelle whom has razor sharp legs that can pierce human flesh with ease. What follows is one of the best spy films and parodies ever created. This is because every single detail and element is handled with grace.One of the most important factors for a parody is the laughs. 'Kingsman' always delivers and makes me ever so thankful that the BBFC did not butcher this film and make it a 12A instead of the intended 15 certificate. It would lose half of its essence and almost every gag would land flat. Thankfully they do not and I had to use my arms to keep myself sitting straight and stop from falling face forwards onto the floor. Whether it be when the film takes the mickey out of the James Bond franchise, Valentine struggling with his ever so obvious lisp or the song that the villain plays to commence the end of the world, the film never falters where jokes are concerned.I will be brief here because with Vaughn behind the camera you know that the cinematography will be dazzling. But, also he is a Director who knows how to orchestrate fight scenes well, which is becoming increasingly rare for action films. One of the techniques that he uses to maximum effect is speeding up and slowing down the action. We get to see reactions more clearly and the full power of a single punch is never wasted. Rest assured the action is photographed spectacularly well and never descends into unwatchable shaky camera.The whole film maintains a sense of joy that is palpable throughout the two hour run time. The film is a sugar rush of the highest class. For the faint of heart it may be too much to handle; with the majority of characters free loading F bombs in every other sentence, heads exploding like shrapnel (to be honest it does have hundreds of deaths) and jokes about sex. But for others it will be a thrill ride that no other film can replicate or capture.For all action and spoof fans to miss out on 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' would be sacrilege to your country. Suit up, relax and freak out as Vaughn delivers a high octane, frequently funny and incredibly entertaining treat for teenagers and over around the whole globe. This is a younger, more daring and uncensored Bond for the new generation. If this was to be the next super spy franchise it would be joyous cause for celebration indeed. When it comes to furious action and elating energy, nobody does it better than Vaughn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Choreography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>n summary, this movie was rather brilliant, looking back on it, there isn't much i would change. i didn't like the visuals that much in the first scene with the motion graphics, also, this film isn't something you would re-watch soon, it is an action comedy. the movie is quite heavily focused on the comedy, but the action had great choreography, and with this some great and not very commonly seen camera angles for it. what i will say is that sometimes they did feel they were trying a bit hard on the camera movements and editing to hide some things, but it isn't exactly much and it only really happened in one scene, in fact to some it might not be as visible. as for the plot, i think it is an almost original idea, is did follow a secret service kinda style, which follows the James bond theme, but in the movie James bond is referenced, along with in some marketing, and for me, i think it was better than a lot of th recent James bonds, with gadgets and gear, and also putting it a bit on its head, showing some back story behind the main character, what they do in training, and showing what the agency is about. another note i want to make, it did also reference movie clichés and then went against that, it isn't a big note, and to avoid spoilers, i will not say anything. as one final note, i did like how the main character, held his character throughout, and didn't just change character just because oh what he was doing. i did also like the character development that was shown when the main character had to run away before any of his training, he did show off one of the traits that was mentioned about his childhood that he was good at, which in a way reinforced how we see he has hidden potential. near the end of the film, it did show the audience with imagery that it wasn't a movie that was meant to be taken completely serious, but more of as a comedy, which also has action in it. using visual effects and music to draw away some of the seriousness from the film and show it as something else, following this with the final scenes, were more comical than anything else, but while sticking with the style of the movie and looping back to nearer the very start of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Matthew Vaughn delivered with this one and delivered in a big way. Like, this movie needs sequels and "Can I buy it now on Blu-Ray?" big way.The story to "Kingsman" is action-packed and never ever lets up on being funny and exciting. The action scenes are incredibly put together and are capable of being amusing and totally badass in the same sequence?not to mention they actually proved that it is possible for Colin Firth to play an action hero. Additionally, the film is incredibly self-aware and wasn't afraid of taking easy shots at itself or the entire spy genre. While not technically a parody, the film is reminiscent of the time when parody meant you could both love and make fun of the genre you were working in?not this stuff now that is just people falling down, getting hit in the nuts, and dated pop references within a scene that kinda/sorta resembles the movie it is trying (and usually failing) to make fun of.Finally, the film has a truly epic cast of talented actors all performing interesting characters. I had some reservations about Taron Egerton because I never saw him before but he was absolutely fantastic in the film. When you have him, Colin Firth showing he can be a tough guy and the suave spy, Mark Strong perfectly balancing being a badass and a funny guy, Michael Caine being Michael Caine and showing that there isn't a role he can't play, and having Samuel L. Jackson look like he is having the time of his life as the wickedly fun villain Valentine, this film proves to have a cast that works as insanely well as every other aspect of the film.I have no complaints about this film because I saw nothing that didn't work. Even the film's music never falters as it tosses out a great score that feels like it belongs with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and is capable of using a popular song like the guitar solo to "Free Bird" to make movie magic and scenes that are memorable. Everything about this film worked for me and resulted in a film that is action-intoxicating and stupidly hilarious. It will be a sin if this film doesn't become a franchise and get several sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kingsman" is not only a story about a young lad being trained in an ultra-secret service agency similar to Mi6 of the James Bond universe. Kingsman is also about satirizing Bond and other similar action fair. Other films are directly or indirectly referenced in "Kingsman", sometimes to good effect, other times with mixed results. So is the film about it's story/plot or its references to other cinematic shoot-em-up films of similar ilk? Rather depends upon how you look at it. For my money, the endless references to action cinema did become a bit overdone."Kingsman" incorporates two plots which become intertwined by the end. The first, and most interesting, is the training of a youth on the eve of adulthood. "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is the son of a Kingsman who sacrificed himself to save his colleagues on his mission when his son was only a toddler. One of the operatives, code named Galahad (Colin Firth) gives the toddler a medallion. The late father was code named Lancelot. The film then fast-forwards many years later and now Eggsy is near adulthood but not very mature. He encounters Galahad who offers him a spot in a program with other recruits designed to train future kingsmen, in particular to fill the vacant spot of Lancelot. The training program I thought was the strongest part of the film as the coaches/trainers use no-win scenarios to challenge their recruits into finding creative solutions.The other story involves a billionaire, Richmond Valentine (Samuel Jackson), who has some strange ideas about defeating global warming. He makes endless speeches to both audiences and individuals with a lisp. Also in Jackson's service, as either an employee or slave, is Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who sports razor sharp blades in place of normal feet. I started to guess when she appeared in scenes without Jackson, an extra or three was going to encounter the business end of Gazelle's "shoes".Underneath Valentine's seemingly innocent philanthropy in which he offers free internet and cell phone service through his network is a calculated plan to eradicate global warming. Trouble is, the plan involves causing people to engage in Godzilla-like violent behavior. He also implants computer chips into peoples' necks in which they become mindless minions in service to Valentine. Eventually, we see a demonstration of Valentine's plot in action when he decides to off the congregation of a church of far-right congregants in Kentucky who make Mussolini and Stalin look pretty democratic. The violence in the church was so over-the-top and grotesque, I found I was not enjoying it and wanted to fast-forward out of the scene.While I definitely liked the youth's introduction to Kingsman through Galahad, and I thought Jackson made a good baddie, the endless references to Bond-like cinema I thought was overkill. Not only are Bond films and "Trading Places" referenced, but there's parallel's with "2012" and there's even an indirect wink to the film "Pulp Fiction", which also starred Jackson. Also, the combat scenes were gratuitously violent for no apparent reason. This film is billed as an action-comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing when people's limbs were chopped off. When either Galahad or Gazelle rip into their victims, they literally come apart at the seams.By the end of "Kingsman", I wasn't sure what I had seen. Was this a comedy? Kind of. A spoof? Maybe. An homage to action cinema a la the 1960's variety? I guess so. At one point Jackson and Firth talk about those films from their youth, and Jackson even says "It's not that kind of a movie". And I think I had to agree. I wasn't sure what kind of movie this was in the first place, and I was still confused by the end.</fullReview>

The overall plot is kind of lame -- do we really believe all the politicians and elites would go along with such a scheme? I suppose those vacuous "Occupy Wall Street" types might.

		<shortDescription>Not many new ideas, but more than enough fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(67%) It doesn't break any new ground, it's very childish, silly, cartoonish; and overall just yet another throwaway action movie. But dear god it's superbly entertaining right from the very beginning to the very final frame. This resembles everything that the awful Avengers (not the Marvel one) movie should have been, with its touches of the Austin Powers movies, and of course the Bond films. If this had been released at around the same time as the poor Quantum of solace movie then it would have been the only case when a part spoof picture would have actually been better than the film being spoofed; but as Skyfall was fantastic then this doesn't get that most rare accolade. The cast is strong, I warmed to the characters, the direction is solid; while the action sequence in the church is worth the ticket price alone. All in all a near perfect spy popcorn movie with plenty of tricks up its tailored sleeve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Co-written by Mrs Jonathan Ross (Jane Goldman) and director Matthew Vaughan, this is a smutty action comedy from the FAST AND FURIOUS school. Megabucks have clearly been spent on the fight scenes and CGI. Colin Firth and Mark Strong are visibly enjoying letting their hair down (Mark of course is bald), although Michael Caine looks as if he's uncomfortable slumming (not for the first time, Michael: we haven't forgotten Jaws 3D, hardly your finest hour). Taron Egerton, more Bourne than Bond, appears to have been cloned from Daniel Craig. Samuel L. Jackson's lisping zillionaire philanthropist and would-be world dominator Valentine is presumably spoofing Javier Basrdem in SKYFALL. Valentine's female sidekick runs on Pistorius-like blades that are more lethal than Oddjob's bowler hat, of fond recall.The death toll is like a war movie. The level of violence and the f-word quotient are probably way too high, but KINGSMAN is firmly pitched at the teenager in all of us; it certainly found the teenager in me and my companion, both of us clearly not kids but more clearly still kids at heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential then lost it all in a HORRIBLE way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers) Trust me when I say this review will be spot on. Good story line and had great potential. Also had good cinematography. Here are the 2 MAJOR errors which made the movie horrible! (1) There is a scene in the movie with a mother cutting into a bathroom door with a knife. The 2 year old kid who is in the bedroom to be safe from crazed mum is terrified, and screaming. There is no such thing as a 2 year old "acting" to be scared. The parents who subjected their child along with the director should be charged with child endangerment. This scene is so disturbing my 17 and 20 year old daughters were disturbed. (2) There is a scene at the end where a princess being saved tells the young leading actor that if he saves the world, that he can have sex with her in her anus. Again my entire family was horrified. This came out of no where. But it didn't stop there. When he was finished saving the world, he went back to her cell where she was held captive and had anal sex with her and left his video glasses on so the secret agent helper could see. They didn't show them have sex, but he went back to room with a glass of wine and the movie ended with a scene of her butt. This literally is how the movie ended. This raunchy no good scene was uncalled for and took everything good in this actors role away. If I could give lower than 1 star I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Complete garbage this film is. The story line is somewhat original, but as far as any spy movie goes it's not that thrilling or creative. The writers felt it important to "please the audience" by going the route of disgusting sexual innuendos and violence(I know it's a spy movie and that violence is naturally included but too much is just annoying). There is also an abundance of unnecessary scenes including: animal "violence," death, and vulgar language, so much so that I could barely finish this movie, and the end was even worse. I don't know how this film was OK'd by anyone with eyes and ears but it was. Do NOT recommend. I love Colin Firth and this was just, very, very sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly poor action film aimed at the "young adult" market</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was picked by my 15 year old son as a family film, suitable for middle-teens up - obviously.To any parents contemplating renting this film for kids nearly 15 "because they're quite mature" I'd suggest caution. This should really be an 18.How the BBFC could have awarded this offering a 15 certificate beggars belief - without offering any spoilers, the language in the film is rather excessively bad with most sentences containing the F- word, and a couple of variants to do with incest. There is also a highly inappropriate gag relating to anal sex that has a visual punchline at the end of the movie.Disregarding the prolific foul language and surprisingly graphic violence, it's actually a very formulaic teen/young persons' actioner akin to "Storm Breaker". Tough inner city underdog wins through to overcome a bunch of snooty Oxbridge toffs and become a Kingsman - some sort of Super Army Soldier/MI6/Ninja agent.Colin Firth appears to be tired of his career as a softly spoken, typically-English romantic lead and is trying to more street by incorporating a few four letter words into his vocabulary, kicking wholesale ass, and decapitating women with a fire axe. He really should stick to what he's good at. Samuel L Jackson is also at his cringe-making worst (I actually rather like SLJ in pre-Star Wars era) as the camp, lisping super villain of the piece. Even by the standards of "Snakes on a Plane" this is not one of his finest hours.The rest of the cast do their best with what they're given - Mark Strong and Michael Caine will no doubt have been grateful for their cheques for turning up and going through the motions.Bottom line in my opinion is that it's a slightly below par, adolescent thriller/actioner starring a group of talented actors who for whatever reason (Aging, or early career) need the work - but really should have known better. It's spoiled as a family movie by excessive bad language and somewhat too graphic violence - admittedly without much blood-spatter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well suited junk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this one a "2", solely due to the fabulous suits. Damn they look nice! But all this talk in the film about being a gentleman is poorly reflected in the dialogue and the horrendously violent action scenes. I'm sorry, but I immediately feel disgusted and come to think of all the massacres and horror that's going on in the world. I don't want to watch that as entertainment. That is just sick.The movie also lacks something else: easy going, "real" characters. As it is, everyone behaves and talks very strange. Harry Hart, for example, is as stiff as a tree. A smile and a joke, or a witty reply to the villain would have been in order. Valentine's motives are unclear, or at least difficult to understand, and so are many of the other characters actions too. They just don't seem real, any of them, except Eggsy, who is very well played by Egerton.I love spy movies, but this one could have been much better with a different approach. As it is, it's more or less junk and leaves a bitter after-taste due to the violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action driven and fun. Slightly disappointing story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one word I would use to sum up this movie is: cool. The main intent of the filmmakers was to make an adrenaline fueled action film with awesome fight scenes and gadgets that, while they may be sort of cheap, are great fun to use and see used. The story is nothing special, though you could argue that it makes up for this by parodying other spy movies and world-saving plots.I'll get the plot out of the way first. Personally, I was disappointed in it because the trailers and ratings it was getting made it seem like it would have a mildly interesting story. I must admit that the way Valentine tries to self destruct humans is different and fairly interesting. I've heard that one of the things that is supposed to drive a film is a ticking clock, but I feel like this and many other recent films (e.g. Winter Soldier, MI 2 and 4, 2012, Avengers, Dark Knight Rises) take this a little too literally and make the entire climax scene based on how fast a certain computer file or whatever can upload. The driving force behind the entire plot is action. Basically every plot element is used to spoof other spy movies or as an excuse to add in a fight scene, though most of the excuses are pretty good and plausible. However, there is a little bit too much seriousness for it to officially be a spoof.The characters could have been better. Eggsy isn't an award winningly written hero, though you can sympathize with and root for him to an extent. Harry Hart is probably the main character and undeniably has the most depth and he's generally cool besides. Arthur is written with okay proficiency, though he isn't on the upper side of Michael Caine characters. Merlin, while he has little depth, is a very prominent face with an agreeable personality. Roxy I think could have been written better since she got a lot of screen time and was a mentor of sorts to Eggsy but was never really treated seriously as a character. Valentine isn't really an interesting villain since he has little or no motive for his villainous actions, but he is different in that he sees the problem with keeping his adversaries alive when he has a chance to eliminate the danger they pose. His Noah's ark speech bumps him up a level as a villain since it makes him persuasive and charismatic. I really wish the original Lancelot (Jack Davenport) hadn't been killed off in the first few minutes because I loved his character right away. Of course the biggest element is the action. Most of it involves the use of ultra-cool spy gear like Harry's umbrella. The scene where all of the government bureaucrats' heads explode is a little ridiculous (though if you're a Republican you might enjoy seeing Obama's lid combust into blue smoke in that scene). The fight scenes get a little over the top, but not excessively bloody. Of the movies I've seen, only Desolation of Smaug and The Amazing Spiderman 2 parallel the action choreography of Kingsmen. The church brawl is probably the most incredible raw fight scene in all of cinema (by the way, the people may have fought each other by Valentine's wishes, but something must be said for the fact that they all brought guns and knives to church with them). The training scenes were pretty good, but it seemed like there was a step that got missed in the transition from pretty good martial arts skills to one man wrecking machine level. The way the bullet proof suits are utilized is pretty good, though you might say that they reduce the quality of the heroes.In terms of overall quality, I guess it gets a B-. The acting isn't exceptional, but it's slightly above average. Visual effects of course gets very high scores. The script isn't great, and goes a bit overboard with it's language. Sometimes that works out fine like in Good Will Hunting where the language feels natural and fits the overall setting, but here I felt like they just threw a few curses in without any real reason behind them. The camera work in the skydiving scene was pretty good, and it wasn't all GoPro cameras. The ominous red used in Valentine's cave added to the serious and spoof atmosphere. Henry Jackman's score was incredible with his intense horns. Lastly, I felt that they used slow-mo pretty well.My overall rating for this is 8.5/10, but I've decided to round down because I don't think it deserves to be on the Top 250 and is about to move off anyways. If you like action and can sit through a weaker plot for two hours, definitely put it on your list. The satirical feel is present though not overpoweringly prominent. Think more Ocean's Eleven than Mel Brooks comedy. So for all action fans, definitely consider renting or impulse buying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this last night and read some of the reviews. Yes, over the top with some of the violence, but know that it is what it was supposed to be. Colin Firth plays the role well and Samuel L Jackson brings a comic villain. The low ratings were most definitely individuals that had expectations of a serious Bond film. I would say this is a cross between Bond and Austin Powers. 80% good and 20% campy. Sit back and enjoy a film for what it was made for: entertainment.As for the "sexualizing women" comments. I didn't see it. One scene, but otherwise they play a strong role as a good and bad individual. But the one scene brings the human aspect into it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film. It was a mix of the Avengers and James Bond. Not quite as slick all the way through as a James Bond flick but that's what gave it a distinguishing feel. A lot of old-new tech all the way through. A lot of new-new tech as in spy flicks as always too. I liked that. It is the story of an underdog. Also,I have never seen S Jackson in a role like this film. Pretty good. Colin Firth is great. Some of the cheeky humor goes overboard. Quite a lot of lines they use to make fun of other spy film phrases, actions, etc.However,the not so smooth feel of it makes it more interesting, I think. James Bond is not fallible, these folks are. I would have rated it higher,but if felt like so much of the story is missing....maybe on the cutting room floor? I think they needed a bit more to immerse me in the training portion and other sections of the film.</fullReview>

There is also the Eggsy's personality change factor that helps the quality of the film. That "vintage spy" style that Eggsy acquires is clearly unexpected early in the film and the young personality of the actor himself turns out to be a fairly complete film. Eggsy becomes a responsible secret agent for but keeping with him the young and rebellious spirit. Also is detachable the great role of Samuel L. Jackson that also manages to be a hilarious villain and a great evil master,with a touch of intelligence and also some ignorance. Definitely recommend the whole community ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kids version of James Bond Rebooted crossed with fifty shades of Grey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is definitely worth a watch, but it sits in that awkward space between being a little too mature for tweens, (tweens wont get some of the throwback references) and and a little lacking for parents. (meaning, that only the 'new kids on the block' are able to save the world, when, the 'Kingsman' could have used any number of their veteran, battle-hardy field agents with years of experience instead.Most of the movie is tongue-in-cheek, with good guys easily overcoming multiple baddies, all the while not loosing their cool or British charm.In addition, the movie ends with the boy getting the girl, just like in all bond movies, and the girl promises that the protagonist will get 'more than a kiss' if he does save the world. When that is developed, the girl literally says that he can put it in here asshole.Naturally the boy saves the world and the movie ends showing the girl sprawled on a bed, with her bum in the air, without nickers on.Obviously its all meant in good fun, but for me personally, I would hate for my teen daughter to behave in such a fashion, and found it in quite poor taste. I saw the move while abroad, and truly hope that part is edited out for audiences here in Australia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is just a little over the top, as it's laced with comic book violence, but somehow, that manages to stay in the background. So, start with a little bit of the Matrix, add in a big helping of "JB" (James Bond, Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer, your pick), and finish, maybe, with Mars Attacks and exploding heads (sorry about that part!)... and wrap it up in a Saville Row suit. How does that sound? Samuel Jackson is a smashing (eccentric) bad guy, newcomers Sofia Boutella and Taron Egerton look to be on the rise, and then you have the dependability of Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and a couple of other familiar names. In summary, a suitable evening's diversion. I hope they do a sequel... I have a soft spot for underground lairs and high tech gimmicks, etc., etc.</fullReview>

The movie brought unpredictable twists that surprised an audience that is used to know the whole story by the trailer and guess the end by the first 20 minutes of movie. But, really, those were conjunctures that didn't bring anything new to the structure, I feel like we saw the same Hollywood things, just under a well-confectioned mask.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good to be King! Kingsman: The Secret Service is over the top, fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a love letter to the old school bizarre campy spy films, while also reenergize the genre to the mature audience, by keeping it modern and smart. Without spoiling it, the movie is full of movie references. Too many to list, here. The movie is also full with satire comedy wit, reverence melodrama, and hyper-violence action. Kingman has the right amount of realistic, and camp value to be entertaining for the most part. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, and loosely based on the comic book The Secret Service by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The movie tells the story of Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton), a young trouble man, who might end up for a life behind bars. However, he is saved by an old friend of his late father, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), whom recognizes potential in the youth and recruits him to be a trainee in the secret service organization call the Kings Men. Meanwhile, villainous Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) launches a diabolical plan to solve the problem of over-population by worldwide killing spree. Can Harry and Eggsy stop the madman or will Valentine's plan come to light. Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, every character, every frame, and nearly every line of dialogue is delivered with a hilarity tongue in cheek, brash motion. Newcomer Taron Egerton was pretty good as Eggsy. The trailer of this film, make it seem like his character was an unlikeable thug, but I'm pretty glad, that they didn't go that way. Eggsy is coarse and prone to fights, and at first glance appears to be a typical Lower-Class Lout, but he's also protective of his mother and sister, has a deep well of kindness and loyalty to animals, and wants to do right by others. Colin Firth works great as the mentor, Harry. Firth is the veteran actor, with a smooth, proper British charm, but also a deadly operator. His ability as an action hero is amazing. The church scene with him, alone, is worth the price of admission. I love Samuel L. Jackson's character. Valentine is a very friendly, cheerful, and charismatic man who cares about the world so much that he's willing to kill most of humanity to save it. He's also appalled by the violence and afraid of blood. I love how Valentine discusses various tropes of Tuxedo and Martini Spy Fiction: like the James Bond series with various characters over the course of the film, showing how dangerously, he can be. I haven't saw, many of those types as villains, before. One thing, I didn't like about the character is the lisp. It was kinda annoying. It kept coming in and out. His henchwoman, Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) is very intense. She really look like she could take down the hero. The fight toward the end in the dance floor, was good. I love how they adapt dance moves to the fighting style. The movie has this stylized action and design that people will clearly love or hate. I think the endless parade of so-over-the-top-that-it's-almost-cartoonish violence; is pretty cool, but kinda jarring. Don't get me wrong, I love how the action sequence are shot: very clear, without shaking cam, and quick cuts, but the violence and its choice of using blood is a bit confusing. It's a bit odd, that anything worse than a gunshot wound is remarkably clean. Most notably, when person is cut in half or head explode, it does not result in a single drop of blood. It's gruesome, no matter what. The movie language is also harsh, and the movie's odd sexual ending, might offend some. Still, it makes me wonder, why the movie didn't try to go for a hard Rated R. It seem that the movie was trying to go PG-13, but change its mind, half-way, through filming. Another fault of the movie might, to be how loose the adaptation is, compare to the comic book. They took a lot of artistic license on this story. A lot of things have change, big time. Gary London becomes Gary "Eggsy" Unwin. Gary's Uncle Jack is no longer his uncle, and is renamed Harry Hart. The Secret Agents become referred to by codenames derived from Arthurian legend, so they might retain their names if they aren't ever called by their real ones. Characters like Sir Giles and Rupert Greaves in the comic are no more. They form Merlin (Mark Strong) and Arthur (Michael Caine), respectively. The villains change, also. Gazelle was a man in the comic. The character of Mark Hamill is combined with the character of James Arnold played by Mark Hamill. Much of James Arnold remains in the form of a new character, Richmond Valentine. Another thing, annoying from the film is the product placement. McDonald's being eaten by the villain. Come on! The movie has a great movie score by Henry Jackman &amp; Matthew Margeson. It was easy listening. The movie made good use of establish songs such as Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing" in the intro, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" during the church massacre. KC and the Sunshine Band's "Give It Up" was also rocking! Director Matthew Vaughn expressed interest in a sequel if the film did well at the box office - as the film exceeded all box office expectations it is a definite possibility. I hope, they do. Overall: Despite, the large amount of violence. The movie does have an enduring message with the quote, 'Manners maketh man' meaning, class and money aren't what define you -- your character does. Loyalty and hard work are rewarded. This movie is a must-watch. I do recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A screenplay that verges on the point of trolling, but with cool action scenes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie started off pretty well, but it soon went downhill when I realized what kind of movie this was. Such troll, would be how I would describe this movie. The jokes are so corny that it just felt too ridiculous. OK, it was quite funny at times but not enough to make up for the rest of the ridiculousness.The story itself is also a little typical. We have the bad guy, corrupt people in high places, the good guys, and the novice spy who becomes a professional during a crisis. And though I should be glad that this film did not have a typical romantic ending, in this case I will make an exception.The character of the bad guy played by Samuel Jackson is just so offensive that I can't believe it. First off, he is of dark skin, which wouldn't really have made a difference except that in this case he had a lisp. So on top of being overall racist (black person playing a bad guy), they are emphasizing that racism by giving him a speech impediment (black people can't speak). I am hoping that this is the result of them so subtly bringing to light issues/ stereotypes by blatantly showing it.The swearing and the gore. Oh my goodness. Really not necessary and adding to the ridiculous factor. I'm not a fan of swearing at all, but in some cases I concede that it actually helps to get the point across. But overusing it is definitely too much. The gore in fighting scenes too was a little much. The fireworks is ridiculous.Though the gore was too explicit, the action scenes were actually pretty good. In fact, they were great. The camera work, fighting, editing, all worked together to create great action scenes. The music helped too.There is a lot of big names in this, and they all played their part relatively well, but it does not change my mind about what I think about this film. I am also thinking that a lot of the humour in this film is 'British' so it is subtly but in a blatant way, showing all the things wrong in cinema or the world today. I don't know. Please let it be satirical.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While not as good as critics would have you believe, it's still the best film of 2015 thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw two films in two days here, yesterday I saw Chappie which I was told I would hate and actually kinda liked, and today I saw Kingsman, which I was told I would LOVE and actually only kinda liked. As much as I try not to have any expectations going in, there's only so much you can do to avoid that. And because its hard to get a gauge on your outside influences, it can be hard to know just how much not loving a movie was because you had it over-hyped, and how much is because its just not your thing. I had the same problem with Gone Girl, and, like Gone Girl, I'm gonna assume it was predominantly the former and not the latter, and bump it up from three starts to three and a half by the skin of its teeth. Now you may have noticed that I said I "didn't love" it rather than "it was garbage". That's because I liked it, I really liked it and there is a lot you'll carry out from Kingsman that you'll hold on to for a long time. Matthew Vaughn is an absolute goddamn MASTER filmmaker, Colin Firth, Mark Hammil, Sam Jackson, Michael Caine, Mark Strong and Geoff Bell all get to flex their acting muscles here, and that is never gonna fail to get me stoked. You may not have heard of Taron Egerton or Sofie Boutella before, but mar my words, after their performances in this, you're gonna start hearing about them a lot, real damn soon. I'm calling it now, unless they somehow start making some monumentally poor decisions, household names by 2018. I did like Kingsman, and I feel obliged to tell you it earned the right to hold onto the top five box office for over a month, and its appeal is, while not universal, still broad. It may well be the best film of 2015 thus far, but it's also not so glamorous as most would have you believe.</fullReview>

Matthew Vaughn's use of the same formula that helped elevate the status of X-Men First Class once again hits the mark in Kingsman. The charismatic swagger that both films share really helps Kingsman achieve the status of a new age spy movie. The addition of some witty dialogue, flashy CGI, and substantial casting are just the icing on the big ol' cookie. Kingsman is truly an awesome movie that serves as a surprise since the 2015 movie year is currently experiencing its low.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lowbrow, crass, sophomoric, yet still entertaining..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just got back from the theater seeing this movie. Over all it was pretty entertaining, yet kind of let down too. I really wished I chose the other one that had Liam Neeson in it.It started out pretty well, but like most movies these days they feel they have to push it over the top.I think they were going for some kind of humorous feel, a bit of a spoof at parts, but it ended up feeling kind dirty and tasteless. It felt like instead of making a more quality story they went for the cheap thrills with a lot of four letter words, violence, and needless sexual overtones.In one particular scene it was non-stop over the top violent. I don't know what they were going for but everyone in the theater seemed to get tense. We were all wondering what the hell we just saw. Was this supposed to be funny or dramatic?And in the James Bond films (which this movie tries to spoof at points) the sex scenes are sort of implied, good enough, but this one became weird. Several people, mainly ladies, walked out on the film early.Over all fairly entertaining, but felt kind of cheapened by attempts to make it too edgy and contemporary..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fun! If you are at least partly Anglophile then there is a lot in this movie that you will enjoy. If you also like over the top action sequences, then you're sure in for a ride! The movie prefers style to realism, and gags to deep thoughts - which I do not mind at all. It is also meta in many ways, a celebration of the genres that inspired it.The main flaw in this movie is the villain. In the movie they refer to the Bond-movies only being as good as their villains, and if that was the case with this movie, it wouldn't be that good. Jackson is charming as always, but the character itself is not that interesting. Luckily, the heroes are more than enough to keep you entertained, and the grand plot really does not matter that much.And wow, Colin Firth really shows a new side of himself in this movie! Another thing: I am a bit uncertain about how the movie tries to convey an anti-elitist message. The main character is not born into luxury, but was it not for his father then he would not end up in the position he ends up in. And he does not seem to mind the privileges his newfound occupation gives him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Secret Service Agent, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), visits the wife of a fallen agent, with a view to presenting her with a bravery medal. However, she is not feeling very sociable and snaps at him, which results in Hart giving the medal to her son Eggsy (Alex Nicolov). Hart points out a phone number engraved on the back of the medal an tells Eggsy mother to use it and tells her the coded message she should use.The movie then jumps some seventeen years, and sees another agent, Lancelot(Jack Davenport), killed by a female assassin known as Gazelle(Sofia Boutella), who works for the billionaire (Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson). Meanwhile, Eggsy (Taron Egarton) is finding life hard, living with his mother, young half sister and nasty stepfather.Despite having many qualities, Eggsy feels disillusioned and opts out of his training with the Royal Marines. He ends up being arrested for car theft and rings the number on his medal, which finds him being released. Standing outside the police station is Hart, who invites Eggsy to a local pub for a drink. Hart tells Eggsy about a secret organisation known as Kingsman that he and Eggsy's father worked for. Hart informs Eggsy that Kingsman have a vacancy for a new agent to fill the space left by Lancelot. After dispatching several thugs with his umbrella, Hart takes Eggsy to their training headquarters, where he is greeted by Merlin (Mark Strong) and several other potential candidates. Eggsy fails his final test, which results in him leaving Kingsman and a girl named Roxy (Sophie Cookson), being made a fully fledged agent. However, Eggsy returns to Kingsman and discovers the leader Arthur (Michael Caine, as been secretly working for Valentine. Eggsy, together with Roxy and Merlin, then feel obliged to go and shake things up at Valentines secret hide out.The Kingsman is an action movie directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Kick Ass, X Men: First Class, Stardust). The movie takes you into a gadget filled make believe secret service organisation. The sets are quite impressive as are the weapons and gadgets. The movie will undoubtedly appeal to the fan of the Bond movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's an interesting movie to watch. It doesn't draw you in but you seem to watch from a safe distance.It's a comic book spy movie that works best while training recruits and looking for the next James or Jane Bond type of spy. It works least when Samuel L Jackson is doing his Truman Capote lisp, which is most of the time. Colin Firth tries to play Liam Neeson and Michael Caine is now always Michael Caine.There is a ridiculous level of violence with plenty of severed body parts. The spy, slasher, comedy, gore, genre is an assault on the senses. The movie begins to feel long when they run around and around Jackson's compound. Some time is spent blowing up a satellite for no reason. It is OK to shoot people but never dogs.The movie plays well on the big screen with big sound. It is nothing great but it is kinda fun to observe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: Spies, Villains, and Rock and Roll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaughn wants you to know that the spy movies today are too serious. They are too dark, too long, and too exhausting. He fancies a time back when spy films had a sense of humor, took chances, and were over the top because, in his eyes, that made them something he feels these films were born to be....fun. It's hard not to agree with him. Some of my fondest memories watching the old Bond films of Connery and Moore were how over the top they were. The cheesy villains, gadgets, and one liners. They made you roll your eyes but you didn't care because you were enjoying the hell out of the movie. Now in in my opinion, the darkness of recent spy films, especially in the Bond franchise, has greatly improved the genre. While the old spy films are fun, they became almost too ridiculous and repetitive to the point where they were just bad movies. Kingsman: The Secret Service is Vaughn's homage to the old spy film. Reminding Hollywood to try to have a little fun once in awhile.The story really is pretty formulaic throughout the first half. You have a mission from the past where something goes wrong and an agent goes down and that agent just happens to be the father of who will be our hero Gary....excuse me, I mean "Eggsy" (Yeah...I don't get it either) played competently by up and comer Taron Edgerton. Years pass and Eggsy has become the young lost soul who can't see to find a place in the world while trying to protect his mother and baby sister from an abusive stepfather blah blah blah. But again, much like those old spy films, you aren't seeing this film for the story.The film really gets rolling once we get more familiar with Harry Hart, Eggsy's mentor and certified bad ass in one of the very best performances of the early year by Colin Firth. When you think of the casting going into the film, Harry is the most crucial. He is used to embody that old school spy who is one part bad ass and one part distinguished English gentleman. Firth is an English gentleman by nature but the risk of casting him in the role is he is just about the least bad ass type actor you and even HE can think of. You'll read this same thought in any other review of the film but that point really can't be overstated. Any director worth anything can make someone look like they can kick ass with effects and such (cough...cough...Tobey Maguire), but if the actor isn't believable throughout the rest of the film as a force to be reckoned with, then the film suffers. Firth talks the talk of the gentleman and kicks ass as the spy. He is smooth, funny, and blows up the film with his swagger. A performance not to be forgotten any time soon.The rest of the casting is fitting. Samuel L. Jackson was the ideal choice to play an over the top villain because....well....what hasn't he been in his career if not over the top? Probably my favorite thing about his Valentine character is that I was originally going to write about how it was a little difficult at times to understand what some of the British actors are saying due to their thick accents. Vaughn gives a wink to the audience (especially the American audience) by giving the American Valentine a lisp that makes him sounds ridiculous AND gives him a line calling out the issue Americans have with Brit actors "You Brits...Y'all talk so funny". Well played Vaughn. We also get some solid supporting performances from Mark Strong and Michael Caine (playing a real ass hole in films lately) to round out a solid cast.If you're going into Kingsman: The Secret Service and expecting Skyfall the you're going to be disappointed. Kingsman isn't about being dark and serious with some powerful societal message to go along with it. Kingsman does what Matthew Vaughn intended it to do which was to give you a fun time. It's got violence, comedy, and some great music adding up to a great time at the movies. So turn your brain off for a bit, enjoy the chaos and don't bother trying to hide the smile you'll have when you walk out of the theater....we all saw it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and Exciting Young Bond's Spy Film with Intense Old School Actions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comic adaptation is full of hyper-stylized action sequences, graphic violence and smart humors that thrill the audience to feel unstoppable for 130 minutes of mission insanity. Though with the predictable core story, it does surprise with some plot twists for the second half and director Matthew Vaughn manages to overcome the short with well constructed plot without any drags, exciting old school action cinematography, stylish commercials fun of Guinness and McDonald as well as great electronic mix of scores by Henry Jackman and Matthew Margeson. The performance of the cast is perhaps one of the major factor that the film is extremely entertaining, it gathers four Kingsmen - Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson, in which each of them represent the characters that they are not used to be in other recent films, while it is also undeniable that young potential actor Taron Egerton sparks in his character as Eggsy too. With a super villain, this young James Bond spy genre looks high standard, smart, exciting and definitely the only great film to opt for this Valentine Day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well done although there is no actual Roundtable in the film, this movie is more action based than your typical Bond film which leads me to strongly suspect it was made by mostly Americans besides the actors of course; I reference Charlies Angels for the creatively composed action scenes... tasteful use of CGI and the clever and sometimes ironic use of songs (mostly American) that play over some of the more violent scenes.The movie pokes fun at the formulaic pitfalls of typical Bond films with some tongue in cheek dialogue and presents some plot twists that really were unexpected from what I gleaned from the trailer; most everyone's back story is explained with the exception of the villains henchwomen whom I would call scissor-legs but the story of how she arrived at her present skill-set is never addressed.The fight scenes are very well choreographed.. one in particular seems at first to be a single shot until you realize the cut-away scenes of others reactions in satellite locations although they are not the Kung-Fu style I prefer such as in movies like Charlies' Angels or more recently Oldboy (American release) and more along the lines of a Jason Stathem movie but with more violent outcomes.In all it was clever, comedic, thoughtful and action packed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early on in the film, Galahad (Colin Firth) asks Eggsy (Taron Egerton) if he's seen Trading Places, Le Femme Nikita or Pretty Woman, as a way to describe their relationship. For those of you who don't know, all those films, simply put, depicts down on luck protagonist(s) meeting a benefactor who brings them to a higher level. Eggsy, upon realizing Galahad's intention, counters with My Fair Lady, a film that has a similar plot to those mentioned, but was in theaters way before the rest. Kingsman: The Secret Service displays this intention by being a spy film that would not fit nicely with today's Jason Bourne or Ethan Hunt, but instead stands beside 1960's Roger Moore's James Bond.Galahad is a member of the Kingsman, a secret spy agency, who recruits Eggsy into spy school because Eggsy's father saved his life years ago. Eggsy makes friends, gets made fun of and shows calmness and ingenuity when it comes to his tests. Unfortunately, he fails his final test and gets kicked out. However, an evil plan concocted by Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson) leaves Kingsman crippled and Eggsy is required to help save the day.Plot wise, there really isn't anything original. Richmond Valentine stole 70% of his plan from Hugo Drax (1979's Moonraker) and Karl Stromberg (1977's The Spy Who Loved Me), both of who just happened to be villains in the Roger Moore Bond era. The mentions of My Fair Lady and co. obviously depicts Galahad and Eggsy's interaction and relationship throughout the film. The story of the chosen one who excels, get kicked out and returns to save the day is a plot line that has been in films for ages. You will even see most of the twists coming. (Come on, Michael Caine is obviously not that nice a guy. 4 out of his 5 films post Dark Knight Rises had him play someone whose intentions ain't that pure)However, I don't think Kingsman was trying to achieve anything fresh in the first place. It pays a huge homage to spy films, in particular to, once again, Bond films. Kingsman feels like MI6, with Arthur (Michael Caine) taking the role of M and Merlin (Mark Strong) taking on Q. Gadgets that can do anything are disguised in everyday objects. The "Bond Girl", largely unseen throughout the film, fulfills her role near the end by sleeping with Eggsy, a move that would be completely illogical and came out of nowhere unless she's a Bond girl. Valentine, a character with questionable fashion sense, speaks with a lisp and vomits upon seeing blood, feels like one of those goofy, over-the- top maniacs that Sean Connery and Roger Moore faced during their tenure as Bond.They also had a phone in the shoe joke (Get Smart) and what appeared to me as musical cues from Austin Powers's Dr Evil? Yet on the other hand, it is self aware enough to make fun of the clichés present in spy films. "There is no elaborate traps and even more elaborate escapes from the super spy." and "You wouldn't find a cheesy punchline anywhere near this film" are points raised by characters in Kingsman. As Valentine says in the film:"We ain't that type of movie."The fight scenes in Kingsman are glorious, especially those by Colin Firth. To put it in words, the fight scenes are one long take focusing primarily on Galahad using tons of creatively badass ways to kill people. The choreography is beautiful, the blood and gore actually brings you into the action and there seem to be no end to the number of ways you can kill someone. You really have to see it to believe it. Those by Taron Egerton weren't as fun to watch, but he still does a decent job. Kudos to the Black Widow signature.There are of course minor flaws with the film. The CGI are really horrendous during several points in the film, particularly the fight between Eggsy and Gazelle (Sofia Boutella). That will take you out of the moment. The protagonists makes some really questionable choices. Eggsy clearly would have known the gun he needs to shoot the dog with wasn't loaded. Kingsman already faked out twice beforehand with the parachute and train tracks. They also should have given more for Roxy (Sophie Cookson) to do, being another fully capable Kingsman, but she does well throughout the filmKingsman is a cross between a spy film and a spy film spoof. Instead of being indecisive and messing up its tone and direction, it manages to achieve a delicate balance between the two genres. You will still keep in mind the lingering danger the characters face while you witness the goofy humor Kingsman exhibits. It really is great fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Bond on Steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quickie Review:After the loss of an agent the Kingsman spy organization start a recruitment process to find a replacement. Harry Hart codenamed Galahad (Colin Firth) believes that a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) has the potential to be a fellow Kingsman. Meanwhile billionaire Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson) has plans for worldwide domination that could cost billions of lives. Kingsman is mindblowing, nay, it is mindblasting fun. Director Matthew Vaughn, brings us another comic book movie that is not only well made but reinvents the spy genre with clever satire. This is a throwback to the classic bond films, but with all crazy violence and beautiful action of Kick-Ass. Watch this movie unless you hate having a good time.Full Review:I will confess that when I first saw the trailer for Kingsman I thought it looked a little campy. Then I heard Matthew Vaughn was directing and instantly all my doubts disappeared. This man has proved that he can take a genre that has been done to death and reinvigorate with new life. Kingsman is exactly that.In this day and age, dark and gritty tones are all the craze when making an action movie. That's fine when done well but most of the time it forces all personality out of the film. Kingsman on the other hand is an homage to old spy movies, filled with crazy gadgets, eccentric villain, intimidating henchman (henchwoman in this case), and of course a wacky plan for world supremacy. This type of film in the wrong hands would definitely have been cheesier than hot pot full of fondue. However, the movie is fully aware of what it is and with the help of some satirical comedy it is able to get away with the absurdity. Then there are the action sequences that were gruesome pieces of art. Best of which was the fight scene at the church. The insane choreography with probably one of the longest chain kills in cinema made my jaw drop. I would pay full ticket price for that scene alone.Colin Firth is the perfect gentleman, sophisticated, well dressed, with just the right amount of mystery. But if you get on his bad side, good luck because he is going knock yours and half dozen other people's teeth out without breaking a sweat. Taron Egerton is a newcomer to Hollywood but I have a feeling he is bound for more. He plays a character that is clearly a street delinquent, but you can tell deep down he is kind hearted. He transforms himself inspired by Firth's character, and by the end of the movie you are cheering him on with every punch and pull of the trigger. A movie is only as good as its villain, and Samuel L. Jackson was a great villain. He is an internet billionaire genius in his 60's who wears clothes like a teenage hip- hop artist, and plans to kill billions of people but can't stand the sight of blood. What? And yet he is having so much fun playing this character that you can't help but laugh with him.With Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class, and now Kingsman, Matthew Vaughn for me has become the best comic book movie director out there right now. Funny dialog (occasionally inappropriate but no harm done), amazingly choreographed violent action, and memorable characters helped revitalize an entire genre with a modern twist. An endlessly fun adventure that I will definitely experience multiple times in cinema.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tributing Old School Spy Movies 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director: Matthew VaughnWriters: Jane Goldman and Matthew VaughnStarring: Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Strong, Taron Egerton, and Michael CaineRelease date: February 13, 2015MPAA Rating: R for sequences of strong violence, language and some sexual contentRuntime: 2 hours and 9 minutesStudio: 20th Century FoxThis is my first official 2015 movie. I have been wanting to see other movies, Blackhat, Project Almanac, and Jupiter Ascending in theaters. However, due to negative reception, I decided not to see those movies in theaters (2 of the ones that I just mentioned are January movies, by the way). When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was excited for it, because it was from the director of X- Men: First Class. People are also saying that it is a tribute to classic spy films (mainly the James Bond movies of the past), and judging by the posters, it pretty much is trying to be. Now, after seeing the movie, what do I think about it? Let's find out.The plot of Kingsman: The Secret Service starts out by showing us a Kingsman secret agent dying during a mission. After that, Harry Hart, another Kingsman secret agent, visits the agent's widow and their son, Gary "Eggsy" Unwin to give them a medal with a phone number on the back. He tells Eggsy and his mother that if they need any help, then all they need to do is to dial the number and use a special message. 17 years later, Eggsy is now a teenager living with his mother, abusive stepfather, and baby sister. He constantly gets in trouble in the law, with his friends. One time after he is arrested, Eggsy dials the number and Harry bails him out of prison. Eggsy the learns all about the Kingsman and due to the fact that another agent died during a rescue mission, Harry chooses him as a candidate for an open position for the agent. Harry puts Eggsy into the TRAINING PROGRAM and this puts him though a series of tests along with other candidates. Meanwhile, a technology tycoon named Richmond Valentine (ironic considering that this film was released on Valentine weekend) is developing many special SIM cards. When these cards are activated through a special program, it sends a signal which causes all humans to turn violent. Valentine wants to use these cards to wipe out most of the human population, because he wants to save the earth from global warming. So, the Kingsmen have to stop Valentine before his plan succeeds.The acting is great from the ensemble cast. Colin Firth, does a great job, carrying charm and wit to his character. Newcomer, Taron Egerton also carries a lot of charm and wit to his character. Samuel L. Jackson is very charismatic and bad ass as the villain. The supporting work from Michael Caine, and Mark Strong, are also great with the limited material that they work with. Overall, the cast is great and all look like that they are having fun in their roles.This movie also carries some great action sequences. Like everyone else, my favorite is the church scene, which is one hell of a memorable sequence. The visual style and direction from Matthew Vaughn is are both very stylistic. The finale is also really over the top and so memorable at the same time.The script is also great. This movie is supposed to be a tribute to classic spy films of the past, and it delivers so well. This is thanks to an over the top tone that makes the movie very refreshing. The film is darkly hilarious and this is mainly due to how self aware it is and how it satirizes spy films from the past. It is also very unpredictable at times, and there were some moments that caught me off guard.The only problems that I have with this movie are that it took me a little while to really get into it. Though, once I did, I was hooked from beginning to end. I also felt that it was a little to self aware at points, even though it mostly worked with its self awareness.Overall, I loved Kingsman: The Secret Service. It is a super cool action movie that is very funny and manages to be self aware as well as satirizing old school spy movies. If you want to see a great tribute to those old school spy movies then look no further.Overall, I'll give Kingsman: The Secret Service an A- (90%).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year there are a few films that fly under the radar. I'm not talking about the Oscar nominated films that are released in select cities and then a month or so later are released for the public. I'm talking about films that you just want to sit back and enjoy and instead walk away much happier than anticipated. Kingsman: The Secret Service is the first of 2015 for me.With the right amount of action and comedy, the director Matthew Vaughn delivers a film that most people of the genre will love. It's very violent and at times over the top. But the movie doesn't take itself seriously and after an intense scene the comedic timing by the actors are perfect.Because a young boys father saved a "Kingsman", this particular character played by Colin Firth, vows to watch over him. This leads to bringing the boy to train to be the next "Kingsman". But first he must beat out around 10 other candidates. The series of tests that the recruits are put through are thrilling scenes to watch.The fight choreography gets better throughout the movie including a massive fight in a church and the final fight near the end. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes action/comedy. I would also just recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies. A solid 8/10</fullReview>

I was pleasantly surprised with what the movie ended up being about. And after seeing Mr. Firth fight on both of the Bridget Jones movies, I was so not expecting him to be able to open up a can of whop a-.I have to say, they need to give Mr Jackson more roles like this.

This film focuses on a young boy who has been somewhat of a delinquent his whole life and finally embraces his true potential when he gets the chance to become a kingsman; which is basically an international spy. Every moment of this movie was just great. It is full of laughs and huge twists that will shock you along the way. Taron Egerton, as the star, will definitely be in many more films to come.

		<fullReview>Thrilling, fun, it had that Matthew Vaughn touch written all over it. He made a movie using extremes and opposites. It's classy with a bit of filth in it, funny but also serious, a real adrenaline rush. Kingsman is a well made, nicely paced action film that has the James bond movies flair. They modernized the spy genre and mixed in with a drop of comedy. The action scenes are amazing, beautiful to watch well choreographed and fun. As violent as it may be it wasn't gruesome or tiresome despite the body count. The actors did a great job but I am commanding Matthew Vaughn for his work, because the plot is not the most original one but its done in such a unique way that it feels original. He - and his team - took everything we've seen, again and again, but added a twist to them. So every time there was a cliché, something we expected, there was a little twist and that made it not quite what was anticipated. I usually don't like to spoil but one of Colin Firth's aliases is DeVere, which is Vaughn's real name.</fullReview>

Jackson and his evil plan. Basically bond meets Ender's Game. With less training. And more action.-Kingsman, much like Edge or Tomorrow, takes the elements of its genera and respects them while following them in a still formula manner, but excels at everything about them! -The story is really good. It should be predictable, but so full of compelling scenes and characters that you forget to guess ahead.-The pace is great because the film feels longer than it is, which is great because I did not want it to end! -The acting is great. Collin Firth, the kid, Sam Jackson, Michael Cane. They all did great. Mark Strong was great, but his accent went from mostly English to mostly Scottish. I was alittle confused.-The characters are fun and complex, but are also aware of the world around them (like the film) so much that they can reference and joke about the fact that they are pretty much in a Bond/spy film. I would, so why wouldn't Collin Firth? -I loved the music. X-Men: First Class meets Casino Royale.-The effects weren't great, but I feel like they didn't need to be because?.-?.because the action totally makes up for it! Yeah, them fight scenes were either totally boss or hilarious.-The film is just super sharp and satisfying. It exceeds in most of the elements it puts forth and did not stop entertaining for a minute! -I will say that a downside is probably that Kingsman is rated-R for language. Sam Jackson. It is not too bad, but not light. The film also has a butt and some violence, of which could have been a heavy PG-13.-Kingsman is one of the best spy movies I have seen. If you don't like spy movies, that's cool. Don't see Kingsman. If you do like action movies, spy movies, or something to see this weekend, Kingsman is?. Amazingtastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great film that does exactly what it aims for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into kingsman I had high hopes for a fun film and I believe that I got it in this hilariously fun spy comedy film. This film sees a young chav recruited into a secret spy organisation and with the help of his mentor he must defeat a crazy internet hacker who plans to destroy mankind. Newcomer tara egerton plays eggsy a character that could have been really annoying but he manages to pull off this role masterfully. He has enough charm and charisma to make you care about him and his situation and you really want to see him succeed, plus he is really funny. It helps that they give him a supporting cast that is filled with some of Hollywood's elite, Colin furth plays his mentor and he is like a more violent version of roger Moore's bond. He was funny and likable but this is the best action he has ever done. Samuel l Jackson plays the villain and he was great everything he said was just really funny, they gave the character a lisp and I truly believe that any other actor wouldn't have made this work but he really does make it work. Michael caine is the head of kingsman and he is great as always just like mark strong who plays the trainer of the recruits and he is great in his role too. The story is the one big let down in the film for me though, now I know that this film is all about fun and some people would argue that story doesn't matter but it does. The villains motivation seems crazily over the top and just not convincing at all. Also their is a direction they take half way through the film and I must say that I think it was a bad decision. The script is fantastic with the humour all working for me and hitting the right places. The interactions between characters makes this film feel alive and great. The style has been much talked about but i think it is great and this film wouldn't have worked without it. The action is all awesome ans there is a particular scene in a church that is one of the most memorable action scenes in recent memory. Overall this is a great film and one that you should definitely see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: The Secret Service Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Thoughts:First off I will admit that I loved the comic book Secret Service that this movie is based off of and when I first heard that Matthew Vaughn was making it into a movie I was super excited. I liked his take on Kick-Ass and couldn't wait to see what he did with this comic book. And boy he does not disappoint with this movie. Yes people will notice that there are some changes from the comic book to the big screen but I do not think the changes they made really have that much of an impact on the movie. People are calling this a James Bond movie on steroids and I will have to agree. To me this kind of reminds me back to the older Bond movies that weren't always grounded in the real world like the newer Bond movies have become and I grew up on those Bond movies and love them.Samuel L. Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson he really doesn't change up his acting in his movies but he really doesn't have to cause we just love his over the top style he does. Some people might call me out cause I do have some issues with actors that seem to do the same shtick over and over again but for me Samuel L. Jackson just seems to bring it whenever he is on the screen and doesn't seem like he is beating you over the head with it.I could talk or type paragraphs on the outstanding cast that is in this movie and everyone hits there mark in this one. Even semi newcomers Taron Egerton (Gary 'Eggys' Unwin) and Sophie Cookson (Roxy) shine in their roles as Kingsman trainees.I do say that some of the action shoots and how they filmed them had me dizzy at times do to how they were jerking around the camera that sometimes you lost track of what was going on. But with that said the action scenes are over the top and ridiculous fun to watch. If you don't enjoy all that great action then you might as well lose your head.One thing I will call out that during one action scene they do have the unlimited ammo gun syndrome and I always call those type of things out. The thing I find funny about is that up until that point they were good at showing people changing out their clips and or running out of ammo. But it really doesn't detract for how awesome the scenes are.Now if you are not into these movies that are not truly grounded in reality then this movie will not be for you, which is sad because you are missing out. With the number of crappy Winter Block movies we are getting this is a shining gem. My Recommendation:Hell I am probably going to go watch this movie again, so if I am going to pay for it then you need to go out there and watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun than being a spy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the get go of this movie setting up a story and our two main characters of Galahad and Eggsy. this movie has amazing style and detail to each and every fight, as well as it being well choreographed and fun to watch as it is interesting and never boring. The actors from Mr Jackson to Caine are on top form as menacing, funny and serious delivery comedy and seriousness with efficiency and wit. Its impossible to take the film on much of serious level.. Which is great considering all films seem the lack fun for seriousness which can become a bore. This film even takes the mickey take out of what it is and even takes shots at other films of a similar genre that just adds to the comedy.All in all this film a ludicrously entertaining! See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman (2015)A huge spy spoof, lots of fun, with all the usual exotic tools and locations. And it includes a spy academy section where recruits perform bizarre and impossible feats. But not all spoofs are equal. This one is a bit mashed together, ranging from James Bond references (with Colin Firth playing that kind of spy in a suit) to kids being kids (racing cars around or taunting each other like they are in high school). There is a plot, for sure, and Samuel Jackson plays a quirky bad guy with a lisp out to ruin the world via everyone's cell phones.Things never get slow. Fight scenes are over the top improbable, not in the Jason Bourne way where skill prevails, nor even the James Bond way where cleverness and a couple of gadgets comes to play, but a combination of these with entertaining excess. One woman on prosthetic legs manages to leap, fly, and cut people in half with gymnastic (c.g.i.) aplomb. The principle character is one of the recruits, played by young British actor Taron Egerton, and for me he lacks screen presence. But we are meant to relate to him, for sure, a troubled kid with immense talent who gets a chance to fix his life by becoming a super spy. OK overall.Bottom line?a great fun movie for people who already like spy movies. I'd compare it to "Guardians of the Galaxy" but that movie is far better than this one?funnier, better effects, better spoof referencing. "Kingsman" has lots of clever twists, so give it a go. But you might have a feeling along the way that it's all kind of "stupid" and a little disappointing. And you might give the parallel, zanier "Spy" a serious (and non- sexist) try...I liked it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>C'mon,i thought we did away with this genre after spy kids...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected so much much from the actors (Colin Firth, Nick Fury, Alfred, Luke Skywalker), you have got to set certain standards. I would say Colin Firth came out on top from the big four with a class act and others were pathetically under-utilized (point one). You see Bond - style introductions to everyone and then the movie deteriorates to a cross between Austin Powers and Spy Kids. If you enjoy some violence though, you will get your money's worth, sickening killing scenes in there. I enjoyed some of the action sequences and hence the 5/10. The film was awful - the script was crazy and oft-seen to the point of being so predictable. The character eggsy is a classic Karate Kid role and a stupid kid turns out a great warrior at the end, you should be a movie virgin to not see that coming!Samuel Jackson as the bad guy is so dumb and he might as well be sucking on a lollipop through the movie, that's how stupid his character seems. Michael Caine has so much less screen time than in first half hour of Nolan movies but then refer point one. Mark Hamill should have been drunk when he accepted the cameo and you feel sorry for Samuel Jackson to be a part of this movie. If you wanna watch, have very low expectations and you might just scrape through.In the same genre, have you seen this series "The Middleman (2008)" - I strongly suggest you do, only a handful of people have seen it before it got cancelled. It is an excellent example of how good this movie could have been..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Kingsman is a rather dubious proposition for so many reasons. The key character, a young working class lad, is taken under the wing of a super secretive organisation that has a knights of the round table meets 007 thing going on. In spite of unconvincing protests to the contrary, the only way the working class lad can make good is by aping his upper crust "betters". Transformed from a working class nobody surrounded by dodgy, listless criminal types, into a Savile row suited snob with a weaponized umbrella. Oh and to prove your upper crust, psychopathic character, apparently thinking you are killing a beloved pet is the way to go ("ugh"). Its ugly, judgmental stuff and the nastiness doesn't end there.Environmentalists also take a jolly good thrashing, as does any bounder who thinks the anachronistic, Royal establishment, is a worn out symbol of inequality, that's had its day. If you don't delve too deeply Kingsman is moderately entertaining, 007 knock off. If, on the other hand, like me, you can't help but take a closer look, this flick is actually a pretty nasty, negative piece of work, that reinforces toxic social and political norms. Four out of ten from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Brit film I've seen recently. If you've seen Attack the Block, this is the Bond version. Perfect look outside the posh and pristine of idealized UK, this gritty murder fest is topped off with snappy suits, hot bods, and plenty of action.Imagine Agent Cody Banks but with butt action and murder. I loved this movie. It was refreshingly new for an action flick. I'm not a fan of Bond, and this cheeky film pays enough homage to the franchise to bring in that fandom. With a convoluted plot of world destruction, the villain is funny and quirky, with a murderess sidekick and league of henchman behind him, the final battle is a fun, explosion of gun fights and martial arts.Speaking of battles, the church scene is the most violent of any scenes and reminds me of the various fight scenes in Ninja Assassin. If you aren't into bloody violence, this film isn't for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a violently funny, and brilliantly heroic super-spy movie. It has the action sequences of a Bond movie, while also delivering laughter due to it's own uniquely rare touch to comedy. Director Matthew Vaughn has managed to portray the brilliantness of action and comedy combined, without coming close to the lack of creativity or the sense of dullness.The movie is about a spy-organization that is recruiting a young, but promising kid that may be of high value to the Service, but also be of great use in preventing a global threat that suddenly has emerged. While time goes on, Kingsman faces difficult tasks, but the movie itself is keeping getting better and more crazier.The fight scenes are just as good as the filming is. It's extraordinary mounted and well acted true out the entire runtime. Also, the story lines are excellent told and are filled with humor, tension and action that keeps the overall story fluently moving, and the movie joyful, but especially powerful.The movie presents rare genres that goes strangely well together, but would normally be avoided in storytelling. It's like the movie tries to accomplish a difficult and compelling mission from special agent 007, and crazy enough, succeeds so due to the great use of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is essentially a fun, modernized, homage to the 60s bond films. It's really nice if you love the old bond films more than the modernized bond and you wanted to see that again. However, do not confuse this with the old bond films it's far crazier than any bond film I've ever seen. That being said the films self awareness makes it a fun movie to watch. The humor, action, pacing and villain make this movie a blast to watch. All in all Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth are great, and Taron Egerton carries the film well. So if you've ever wondered what a modern, fun, crazy bond film would be like this is your film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great blend of a spy film with crazy OTT action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service was just simply so much goddamn fun. I had heard that it was a fun film but i had no idea just how great it was going to be. This movie was filled with crazy intense action sequences and some more subtle jokes that show up every now and then. The plot of this movie you think is something you have seen before but it continuously surprises you throughout and just when you think you know is going to happen it throws you a curveball. These surprises helped to make the film so much more entertaining. Lets start with the action sequences because they are by far the best scenes of the movie. They are just awesome edge of your seat action sequences that are exaggerated in terms of the violence and gore to make them really unique. The way they are shot is incredible how they don't use conventional shots instead there are some crazy rotating continuous shots that make the scene that much more awesome. This film did have its fair share of comedy, and i thought it did pretty well to make me laugh. Only 2-3 times it didn't work for me but otherwise the smart and subtle comedy was very effective. And the jokes and bizarre action would not have been as awesome without the incredible cast they got. From the big names such as Samuel L Jackson and Colin Farrell to Taron Egerton and Sofia Boutella they all did amazing jobs in their roles and were so fun to watch. They do a good job at creating an enemy who you know is bad but you cannot resist to love him because of the character itself and the actor playing them.The main criticism i give this film was that there were a couple of moments that it slowed down a little too much before going into some intense action scenes. The jokes they crack during these scenes and just overall interest in the plot help a little to not get too restless. But they are a minor offence as all of the good this movie does overshadows the bad. In the end, this movie was a great blend of crazy intense action, engaging characters and plot, and a little bit of comedy to add to the fun - 8.9</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go into all of the details that so many others have, I'll just give my overall opinion of the movie.Frankly, this was one of those movies where it felt like the producer and director weren't entirely sure where they wanted to go with it. Is it a comedy, is it a drama, action pic, etc? I'm not sure they knew.In the end, it felt to me like it was lacking so much, and what was lacking they tried to make up for with over-the-top extras which didn't add to the movie in the slightest.Yes, it was an "R" movie, but when the language ... seriously? It didn't add to the movie at all (took away from Jackson's character with me), and just was overbearing. Add to it the absolutely idiotic sex scene at the end (was she really that pathetic?) and it felt like they didn't know how to end it.The comedic death sequences seemed extremely childish as well. Maybe they were aiming for a particular target audience ... but the "R" rating cuts down on the number of 15- and 16-year-olds in the theater.The group I was with when I saw the movie all said the same thing - if you're going to have that over-the-top profanity and the gratuitous sex bits at the end, at least spend a moment or two reviewing it so that it adds to the movie and doesn't detract from it. Without those, this would've been a much better flick in our opinion, worthy of the mid-8's. Instead, a solid 7 for us.Just my opinion in the end, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a film, Kingsman. I never expected it. Great comic and great action. It blue my mind. It was unreal. Music was fantastic. It was the normal music score. E.g The American Anthem was played etc., etc., Plot was a bit hard to understand the first time, I went. From what I could gather, Harry(Firth) highers, troublesome teen Eggsy(Egerton), after Eggsy' father Lancelot is killed in action. So Harry trains him in a series of tests. Then a global danger is imminent. Valentine(Jackson) is creating a SIM card chips, whereby when he activates, people all go Homicidal.One class scene I'll never forget it. Harry(Firth) is in a Hate group church in the US, whereas they's against Abortion, Unmarried etc., etc.,One woman prevented him from getting out, as he couldn't stand it. I was beginning to get nauseous myself. So he attempted to get out. This woman attempted to stop him, and his reply was class. "I'm a Catholic whore, currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic. Hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon madam". The Church is against Colored ppl too, let alone Homosexuals etc., The first scene too is class, whereby Harry is wanting to teach some thugs a lesson, and later is passed onto Eggsy(as Eggsy does the exact same thing to Dean(Eggys step father(well boyfriend anyways) "Manners maketh man." Do you know what that means? Then let me teach you a lesson".Great crossovers were done to. Whereby Eggsy is asked during one of his tests, "Cute dog, whats his name,", Eggsy replies "JB". Then Arthur(Caine) tries to guess, Jason Bourne(Bourne Francises), James Bond(Bond), when Arthur fails Eggsy replies with "Jack Bower" from 24.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a film about a veteran secret agent takes a young upstart under his wing.As you might have seen in previous posts, I went to the world premiere of this film here in London, but was unable to score a ticket. Every cast member that I met was down to earth and extremely friendly. Having to wait at least two weeks before I finally got to see the film was painful as seeing the small pieces I did while at the premiere made me really excited.This film was an unexpected favourite of mine for this year. I went into the film knowing little about it, apart from the fact that Matthew Vaughn, the director of the original Kick Ass and X- Men: First Class, was adapting the comic to the screen. And boy was the film a piece of work. And, of course, the trailers. Director Matthew Vaughn, as a director, has definitely come a long way since the days of Kick Ass when he had to mortgage his house so he could help fund the film. Kingsman shows how he could balance both comedy and action without overdoing it in either direction. Many have described the film as a hybrid cross-breed of James Bond and Kick Ass and I couldn't agree more. The film is a lot of fun and definitely shouldn't be taken seriously. The film was so self-aware, it added to the comedy of it.The film clearly shows how much fun the cast and crew had in making it, particularly in that of Colin Firth, who you would never expect to see such a film as Kingsman. It is really good to see Firth branching out from the role's he's usually known for playing (especially in the likes of charming British aristocrat, Mr. Darcy). He definitely shows his range in this action packed film.Unknown Taron Egerton held up his own against fellow heavyweights Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson, proving his worth in the new wave of emerging actors.Kingsman: The Secret Service was a film I didn't know I wanted. If you have a spare two hours, make sure you spend it on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking "wow that looks stupid" but as the film got more &amp; more positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. And, it was better than I could have ever expected. The films strongest point is it's comedy. The film takes every opportunity to make the audience laugh and all the jokes are spot on. The cast were superb, Taron Egerton as the lead was great and I hope to see more of him in the future. The rest of the cast were awesome (Firth, Caine etc) and Samuel L. Jackson plays one of the funniest villains ever put on film, at first I thought it was going to be annoying to give him a lisp but no, it had me rolling on the floor. If I had any issues with the film, I'd only say that the fight scenes can be a little too over the top &amp; that can be a little distracting at times. Overall, Kingsman is a great film and I'd even go as far as to say it's one of the best comedies in the last 10 years. Its clearly satirizing the James Bond films but this is how satirical films should be done. Humour, a good story and a lot of heart and memorable characters. There are talks of a sequel and I'm all for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, yet brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie of 2014, and is(at least on my list) in the top 25. Actually, I'd place it before all the old Bond classics. Mostly because of the storyline, which is incredible, the acting is great and visuals astounding. Yet that is not the entire reason. I love the fact that they combine the classiness of a gentlemen spies(Bond-style), with the humor of the rebel youth.As mentioned earlier, the acting is absolutely spot on. Honestly I think Colin Firth, known for the soap-musical "Mama Mia", would have been a better 007 than those who have tried before him. He act with such grace, and to say the least, class. He and his stuntman should probably be awarded with an Emmy. Adrian Quinton were also spot on with his acting. He is really likable, and is easily the best guy for the role. He has this rebel-ish look about him, and he sure uses that to his advantage. He presents to the audience a lot of humor and fun, yet he manages to bring some tears out of you at some occasions. Again, SPOT ON ACTING!The rest of the cast were either OK+ or good. However the super villain played by Samuel Jackson, needs a little bit more credit. His character will probably go down in history as one of the best villains ever. Both in form of character depth, but also the way Jackson played him. The thing i like the most about this movie, is the fact that the villain's intentions aren't biblically wrong. Global warming is a threat towards the humans, and is also caused by them. Therefore, by playing god, and wiping out most of the human being, he actually manages to rationalize his actions. And he should be able to rationalize that, even if it is kind of cynical. Because he saves the humanity in a sense, doesn't he? At least one could see it from his point of view, and empathize with his mindset and way of thinking. This is actually proved through religion, in form of Noah. Therefore you have to ask yourself, is this ethical wrong? God did it.Lastly, I want to recommend this movie to everyone, and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as i did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015) Rating: 4/5 I was hopeful, but a bit wary when I decided to go check out "Kingsman" but my fears were for naught. The movie has some flaws, but I found it to be an expertly made action movie that also hails back to a beloved era in James Bond-style spy films and features a lot of laughs. AS far as I'm concerned, that makes director Matthew Vaughn 2 for 2 (his previous film being "X-Men: First Class"). The plot here concerns an independent secret agency, the Kingsman; when one of the members of the secret organization is killed while out in the field, a replacement is required. Among the candidates is Eggsy (Taron Egerton), a thuggish young man who nevertheless has a lot of potential.In the end, I'm giving this movie a 4/5 and I can tell you exactly who and what is to blame for that missing one star. "Based on the comic by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons". I've read a decent amount of the Millar's work, ranging from the excellent "Red Son", to the needlessly cruel and ludicrous, but admittedly kind of clever "Nemesis". I'd say overall that I'm not a huge fan of his writing because of his sense of humor, which always, for some reason throws in sexual references and acts that I find more awkward, or even disturbing than genuinely funny. Thankfully, when his work is adapted into a film, other cooks in the kitchen have the good sense to exorcise most of the awkward moments (did "Wanted" really need a scene in which Wesley rapes an A-list celebrity? No, it really didn't and thankfully that was completely absent from the film). However, I feel the need to mention this brand of humor because the film is mostly devoid of anything that rubbed me the wrong way... except for the second last scene in the movie which contains a sexual reference that I thought was plain terrible. It feels unfair to be so critical, but what would you rather watch? A race in which a runner stumbles at first but catches his feet and then ends up winning, or one in which the runner trips while ahead of everyone and then gets up in time to still finishes first? I'd rather see something improve over time than end on a truly awkward note. The good news is that other than a few moments here and there where the humor feels mean-spirited, the movie is a real joy to watch.I think the highlight for me has to be the action sequences that pepper the story. In an age when so many pictures have fights that are chopped up so that can make even an old man look like a bad ass, presuming you can tell what is going on, I had been starving to see this kind of camera work. The shots are nice and long, the action sequences are creative not only in terms of the weapons and techniques used, but in the way the battles are set up. Those bone-crunching kicks and punches get you amped up to see more, and the movie delivers with a spectacular "final boss" battle. Even when it wasn't a fist or gun fight, the movie had me literally shaking in my seat. My legs got very jittery staring down falls that meant nearly certain death and timers counting down to Armageddon. The stunts here and the high stakes, it's exactly what I was hoping to find as I bought my movie ticket. I really did not expect to see some of the most satisfying action set pieces I've seen since "The Raid 2" in a February film.The next praise I have for "Kingsman" is one that's very particular to me, but I think a lot of you, if you think about it will agree. I miss seeing crazy villains. Yeah I appreciate the villains we see in films nowadays, like the special effects extravaganza that was Electro in "Amazing Spider-Man II" or the morally complex Magneto in "X-Men: Days of Future Past", but I think back to some of my favorite bad guys from when I was a kid and you know who I picture? I picture the silly X-ians from "Godzilla vs. Monster Zero". What do they want? To take over the world and destroy anyone who doesn't kneel before them. How will they accomplish this? Realistic manipulating of governments and careful management of resources? No way! Crazy evil plots is what I want to see! In addition to being an action film so violent it becomes comedic and a genuine comedy, "Kingsman" is also a love letter to those old James Bond movies. The villains in this film rival the classics that I've come to love, like Oddjob, or Jaws, or even some of the one that are so imaginative they don't really make any sense, but sure are cool to see fight bad guys from comic books. When you don't know who you want to cheer for because the villains are so awesome you don't want to see them beaten, you know you have something special on your hands."Kingsman" is a fun action movie. It delivers the action you want to see, it has a story that balances out the zaniness of the classic bond films and the more modern plots we've become accustomed to, it's got a lot of big laughs and some memorable characters. It missteps right before the conclusion, but that's not enough to sink it completely. I enjoyed myself very much and hope to see more of this world in the future.

		<fullReview>For those of us who have wondered if there will ever be an action thriller without the usual mixes seen over and over all these years, yes, this is the one, do not wait to read till the end of my review, go grab your tickets and watch it already, in case you still haven't. Throughout the movie, pretty much only these happened with the audience. In repetition. Laughing, a lot, wolf-whistling , clutching head. A little bit of shock and lots of awe. Must mention - Taron Egerton's jaw will make you swoon. I guess it was so good thanks to that charming crisp script, detailed character sketches, incredible cast and, AND that BGM score and stunt sequence.I should add, a bit of the violence may not be well received, but it is exactly that which makes it better for some of us. This has easily got to be Matthew Vaughn's best yet, in fact, the freshest new age action thriller in a long long time.Euphoric was how i felt, in comparison, other mass entertainers will fade in leaving that lasting feeling long after the movie gets over, but not this one, no.As quoted several times throughout the 2 hour run time, "this ain't that kind of movie"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthew Vaughn's brilliant take on the spy genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge spy, action fan I was very excited going in to this movie. Also having seen Matthew Vaughn's previous works like Kick Ass, X-Men, and Layer Cake I was anticipating his take on the spy, action genre.Kingsman is about a veteran spy who takes a promising street kid under his wing to try to be recruited for a spy organization, just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.I adored this movie, for me it really capitalized on the campy nature of the spy genre. Vaughn's direction is top class, from the perfectly choreographed fight scenes to the smaller more human moments between Taron Egerton's "Eggsy" and Colin Firth's "Harry". Samuel L. Jackson's "Valentine" has some gut wrenching one liners which he delvers with a often hilarious lisp. What also impressed me was the development of the characters especially are protagonist "Eggsy" who starts out as a promising street kid with no real opportunities and later becomes a full blown spy hero worthy of his tailored suit. The over the top action suits the story's perfectly and never feels forced.Taron Egerton and Colin Firth give brilliant performances and we are sure to hear from Egerton in the not to distant future. Overall I don't feel the need to nit pick from this movie and believe the story was told perfectly.I am going to give Kingsman the secret service a 8.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing how everybody praises this movie i decided to see it myself despite the fact that i was sure this will be an average film at best after seeing the trailers. Surprise, i was right. But i believe in giving credit where credit is do and there where some parts that i enjoyed. The movie used a lot of spy movie clichés but by having the characters mentioning the old bond films in the movie it became clear that all those where meant more as an homage rather than cheap plot lines. This works for the over the top spy equipment as well as for the ridiculous plan of the villain. Also, the scene at the beginning where Harry gives young Eggsy the medal of Eggsy's father was a good excuse to set the story in motion. When Eggsy was calling the number on the medal to get help it didn't felt as convenient as it might could've been.However, there where also a lot of dumb scenes like the same grenades having completely different timers or the character of Roxy performing the side mission to blow up a satellite instead of Eggsy despite the fact that she is afraid of heights and is also an official agent and Eggsy is not. But i liked that the didn't establish a romantic relationship between those two characters. Everyone told me that the character of Harry was really cool which would be right, if he had any character. Aside from being a bad ass and a gentleman he has no personality whatsoever and i didn't care when he was killed. The big problem with this movie is that his has no Identity. It obviously tries to be an action comedy like Kick-Ass, which is equally overrated like this one, but for it to be such a movie the action was too boring and the humor was, for like 99% of the time, not present. Also, while the film tells you that you should not take it too seriously, it falls completely apart at the moment where the villain reveals his plan to save the Planet. By doing this the writers completely reverse the style of the film to press an environmental message in the audiences face instead of staying true to what they are claiming to do. The movie would be a little more enjoyable if the bad guy had a completely generic plan to take over the world because it would stay more true to the campy style of the film. However, the methods he used to achieve his goal where still ridiculous like in some old spy films. In the end, I'm not mad at this movie because it was exactly what i thought it would be. It's a partially enjoyable spy film that leaves no impression and is quickly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is...well...exactly what you would expect from a Jane Goldman adaptation of a Mark Millar comic book. It's absurdly violent, devoid of any subtlety in characterisation, insistently profane and ? just occasionally ? bloody funny. Colin Firth plays a John Steed style spy, recruiting noob Taron Egerton into a troupe of impeccably tailored spies. Rather more restrained than 'Kick Ass', it's okay and you'll probably think you want a sequel ? but bearing in mind what the same team did in 'Kick-Ass 2'...you REALLY don't. As a parody of posh super-spy tomfoolery (incessantly referenced in the script), it works. Samuel L. Jackson is amusing as the lisping baddie, sending his usual cool screen-persona up, and the ever-reliable Mark Strong gives able support as the de facto 'Q' for the team, but it is essentially lightweight, disposable fare. Best scene involves a VERY inventive use of 'Land of Hope and Glory', which provoked a round of applause at the screening I viewed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spy film with no clichés.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immersive, entertaining, funny, well-acted but forgettable. Words I use to describe my experience with Kingsman. A spy movie that acknowledges the various tropes and clichés often associated with the spy genre and then proceeds to break them with minimal effort and often a frenzy of laughter. As Samuel L. Jackson's character Richmond Valentine and Taron Egerton's Eggsy state, "It's not that kind of a movie". Which means no convoluted plots, impossibly smart heroes, wooden and expendable supporting characters or illogical situations (except a few).The latest directorial/scriptwriting/production venture of Matthew Vaughn of X Men First Class and Days of Future Past fame. Sadly, unlike the aforementioned movies as well as Kick-Ass, Kingsman is not as memorable. It fails to find its footing and identity and at every step aspire to illicit the same laughter James Bond does and fails miserably. Kingsman's overarching plot is one of its weaknesses. It's not particularly original and not well thought out either. So are many if the action sequences, but we'll get there later. Valentine drives a hard bargain with a sensible speech. He compares human to a virus on the host, the nature. With the current trend of population growth, it can only lead to two outcomes. Either the host kills the virus or the virus kills the host. But in either case, humans die. Unless someone does something to change that. So, after earning billions, Valentine takes it upon himself to save the human species from extinction. To do so, Valentine proposes a biological weapon. Neurological waves emitted from the SIM card his company will give away for free that trigger the aggression centre of the brain in a bid for humans to kill one another and martyr themselves for the greater good. All the while keeping the influential and powerful safe to be a part of the new world. On the surface it seems A-grade but on going deeper the logic starts to crumble. The true strength lies in the interactions and relations of the characters. The on screen chemistry and the dialogues. They never failed to charm the audience and keep them drawn into the tale of Harry (Colin Firth), Eggsy and the Kingsman's race to save the world.The movie does a fantastic job in being fresh. It outright breaks the various tropes and clichés associated to it. The duration of the movie, I kept on applying the various tropes and clichés to see where the movie would slip up. But sadly, when I walked out, I had a hateful respect towards the movie for being original and insulting my intelligence again and again. No obvious double crossers. The villain not missing the clue that Harry Hart is not a billionaire and instead somebody with a much bigger agenda than that of a billionaire. The lead character, Harry Hart (Colin Firth) having a plot armor giving him a get out of situations free card. The movie outsmarts you at every step. Expanding more on the characters, the movie does an amazing job of handling its characters the movie took its time to build up the characters. While the movie focuses on Harry and Eggsy's relationship for the first half, it sets up other characters, another Kingsman Merlin (Mark Strong) as the cold test taker and Roxy (Sophie Cookson) the eventual latest initiate to the Kingsman so they can take control of the movie in the second half without it becoming too rushed, messy, unfamiliar or awkward.In the opening scene of the movie, Harry Hart a.k.a. Galahad and the rest of the Kingsman are interrogating a Middle Eastern terrorist in a fort in the Middle East. Obviously. The terrorist pulls the pin on the grenade Galahad missed and it costs Lancelot's (another Kingsman) life to save everyone. That Lancelot was Eggsy's father, thus the on screen time and relationship of Harry and Eggsy which led Eggsy to the test to replace the recently fallen Lancelot in a botched rescue mission in the mountains. It would be a crime to not give a special mention to Samuel L.Jackson's performance as Valentine. He acts as the movie's primary villain as well as comic relief. He has a lisp, thinks big, and is a scaredy cat and a joy to watch, all the way till his last scene.Just like the movie does so many good things, it also has its flaws that sadly cannot be overlooked.The action sequences were too long and illogical. The movie always tried to be something else, a sci-fi movie (a woman dodging bullets), too James Bond-sy, a martial arts/karate or Matrix style jumping around. They served no purpose other than 'oooohs' and 'aahhs' from the audience. Another gripe that will detract from the experience is its heavy dependence on stereotypes. Eggsy, single child with abusive stepfather and no aim in life His mother, a victim of low self-esteem. People from Oxford and Cambridge being snobs. Boys being snobby and unfriendly. All in all, though, Kingsman is one of the most well-paced spy films that has its moments and deserves a watch, well because it is fun and forgettable. Rating: 3/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks Consistency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman, by far the best movie of the year so far, despite strong competition from cinematic classics like Chappie, Hot Tub Time Machine 2 and Fifty Shades of Gray, is the most memorable homage to the Bond movies of the 60's and beyond since Spy Kids and Spy Kids: All the Time in the World. Samuel L. Jackson plays Valentine, a billionaire who plots to kill all poor people to prevent Climate change with SIM cards and a distracting lisp. Taron Egerton plays Eggsy, a poor British hooligan with chiseled abs, a fantastic jaw line and a broken home terrorized by his mother's alcoholic boyfriend, who is recruited by Colin Firth (who is the movie's only redeeming quality) to join Kingsman, a secret spy organization. Eggsy must first face a series of boring and uninteresting trials like skydiving, almost drowning but then punching a window and a bunch of rich kids who are mean to him because he's poor. Then watch him inexplicably become a character from The Matrix as he defies all laws of gravity while retaining perfect aim. This movie is boring for long stretches as it's idea of humor and wit is a pug that adds nothing to the film, a speech impediment and Colin Firth occasionally saying something cheeky in a British accent. Its best scenes are the action sequences, but all of them feel and look the same with their overuse of fast and slow motion, extreme close-ups and bad cinematography. The movie's best scene is when Colin Firth kills a bunch of religious fanatics in a Church (it's okay, because they're racist) which is entertaining at first but then lasts for another 7 minutes and becomes more tasteless than anything else. Even the climax feels kind of tedious as it drags on for 30 minutes before grinding to a halt with a completely unsatisfying ending. The movie has so little respect for you that it ends with a butthole, rolls credits and then gives you a midcredit scene which is essentially the same fight scene from earlier in the movie, but with a worse actor. Overall, this movie was amazing. 11/10, better than The Dark Knight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Ride Through A Heroic World Of Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I purposely try not to know too much about a film before I watch it. This film starts out like a typical Bond film, but quickly dispels that notion. The viewer is alerted that this is a film where you can expect the unexpected. After a while, I recognized the comic book origins of the story and allowed myself to just enjoy the world of "Kingsman", where style trumps substance.Meanwhile, the references to other films were flying left and right. Some of the more obvious to me (besides the Bond canon) were "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.", "V for Vendetta", "Kill Bill", and even "The Princess Bride."One of the best things about this film is the photography. The camera is always moving. In fight scenes, it does not film from afar; it enters the fray and traces the flights of bullets, bottles and fists. It moves from scene to scene with a smoothness that is enjoyable, unlike some modern films that feel like they are edited to change camera views every split second.The film is violent. There are violent characters intent on mass destruction and intrepid heroes who do what is necessary to stop them. But still this is comic book violence, though some may not understand the difference.The heroes are "gentlemen" agents--men of chivalry and refinement, like James Bond distilled to his essence and perfected over the years. I give this film high marks for its creativity, its style, the scenery and sets, and its action scenes. With tongue in cheek, it takes the viewer on a fun ride and sets the table for future sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My cheeks are hurting, my ribs are aching and my head is numb, that's how much fun I had with this f**ing awesome film! There isn't really a word to describe how entertaining this experience is, I'll just say that in fact of fun factor it reaches levels that had been missing ever since The Avengers hit theaters.How can I start describing it when the only thing that I really want to get through is just: go see this film and have a blast. Really, I have been a fan of Matthew Vaughn before people even knew he existed, ever since Layer Cake, which I still contend is one of the great underestimated movies of cinema possibly. The action is clearly the culmination of all Vaughn's experience and it pays off, every single frame pays off. Be it the fast paced scenes, the frenetic ones or most of all the stunning long takes, the action is always excellent. Sequence after sequence my jaw war dropped, most of all the sky diving and the church scene, which I for one did not find in any possible way offensive, were a force to be reckoned with: I challenge you not to go on the edge of your seat in those moments! silently, but clearly pays homage to the likes of Edgar Wright and that makes it all the more entertaining to watch. A big, big highlight of the movie is the music which I found to be spot on right from the opening credits. Taron Egerton breaks through and shows us his potential, which believe me is incredible. Of course the cast surrounding him is flawless, but with names like Firth, Strong, Caine and Jackson that's a given by now. All of the cast is awesome the old and the young, they all craft characters who are interesting to watch, for whom you feel empathy and even do great stunts. Every aspect of the filmaking here is an example of technical perfection and this added even another layer to the film, because other than watching characters interact with great, funny dialouge and kick-ass everywhere, I was genuinely admiring the brilliance of the filmaking.Because of this I really can't call out the movie for any negatives, per say, it fulfills its job more than perfectly and actually does much more. But, I will acknowledge that a movie that immediately came to mind when thinking of this one was "Kick-Ass", in particular the fact that "Kingsman" is missing some small things, that made "Kick-Ass" instead the gem it is. For example: the story behind this film isn't the greatest I could have asked for, it serves its purpose, but I could have easily seen something slightly edgier fitting in, just like in "Kick-Ass" where, moreover, the fact that it had a great story, made it actually, amongst all the madness in the movie, a quietly moving and partly inspiring film. That's not to say that "Kingsman" doesn't have good storytelling, on the contrary it has some excellent, balanced and clever way of telling its story, but doesn't have a high enough concept.Yet, that's really too much bragging for this film, I look forward to seeing it again and if you are still reading this review: what are you doing here? Get up and go have a blast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see action/Spy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up one of my favorite franchises to watch was James Bond. A world based in reality, but with all these over the top gadgets, weapons, cars and villains. The kingsman did an amazing job at recreating the tone of these classic movies while putting this gratuitously violent, original spin on the spy thriller. The Kingsman is a story adapted from a Mark Miller comic book. This comic book tone was that insanely crazy quality that I think set this film apart from other spy franchises. Another aspect of this film I enjoyed, was the wink to the fact that Director Matthew Vaughn New how over the top this film was. The fact that he did this made the moments in this film that felt campy and a little cheesy feel fun while paying homage to the stereotypical spy film. The things I really liked the most in this film were the performances, the villains and the action. it's funny because these aspects if not done right could have made this unbelievably stupid. They stayed with a consistent tone and they really pulled it off. This main character eggsie is played by up and comer Teron Edgerton. This dude is awesome, he did such a good job. Colin Firth did a great job also, playing a mentor figure, and his action sequence is absolutely amazing. It is one of the highlights of the film. You will know what I am talking about when you watch it. Samuel L Jackson is the man, who else can play a sociopathic genius with a lisp and still make it his own.. At first I really did not care for his character but as the film progresses you end up think this villain is absolutely hilarious. I don't think anyone could pull that off as good as him. Besides Taron Edgertons character Samuel L Jackson was my favorite character in this film. I wrote in my marvel piece last week about what makes a good villain. The idea of a villain that thinks they are bettering the world by their actions, creates a whole other layer of evil. As over the top, and as crazy as his character was, this was the of the layer that made him a great villain. The only complaint I have about the kingsman is really minor. There were definitely a couple of occasions were I felt the film was a little corny. I will say this, those moments seem to pass quickly, and I mostly felt this in the beginning 20 minutes, before you really figure out the tone of the film. These moments are there to remind you that this is the tone of the movie. Overall. I really enjoyed this film. It was a total throw back to those over the top, 60's and 70's outrageous spy films that we all know and love. Cool gadgets, good action, it's very, very violent. Teron Edgerton was just awesome he played a good action star while being able to portray a relatable character with depth and substance. I highly recommend The Kingsman: The Secret Service. I give it a solid 8 out of 10. I can't say it enough if you like over the top violence and you like spy movie you will definitely dig this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fifty Shades of Blood!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine putting the James Bond movies into a cinematic blender with the Austin Powers comedies, and you'll see what British director Matthew Vaughn does with his outlandish movie "Kingsman: The Secret Service." For the record, Vaughn made his first film as a director in 2004 with the murderous mobster melodrama "Layer Cake" (2004) starring Daniel Craig. Three years later he followed up "Layer Cake" with "Stardust." This imaginative Neil Gaiman fantasy romance bore little resemblance to the gritty "Layer Cake." Vaughn didn't come into his own until he adapted Mark Millar's subversive graphic novel "Hit Girl" as the Nicolas Cage actioneer "Kick Ass." This controversial revenge thriller about a dad and daughter who dressed like comic book super-heroes to destroy a dastardly gangster spawned a sequel. Vaughn's biggest success came with the incomparable Marvel Comics "X-Men" prequel "X-Men: First Class" about the costume-clad mutants in their youth during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Vaughn has recycled many of the themes and characters from those movies for his adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel "Kingsman: The Secret Service" that features Colin Firth, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong. This uneven but entertaining homage to the James Bond movies provides an overdue departure from the usual formulaic, testosterone laden fare that sacrifices wit and style for realism and gore. Mind you, Vaughn grinds his action gears during the early scenes as he sets up his improbable plot. Happily, he has everything running smoothly for an explosive finale. The big problem that Vaughn had to contend with in launching a new franchise was pairing relatively unknown actor Taron Egerton with veteran actor Colin Firth who rarely plays armed and deadly heroes. Meanwhile, sympathetic heroes and treacherous villains tangle mercilessly in this larger-than-life, hyperbolic espionage escapade that could easily qualify as "50 Shades of Blood" for its sensational number of mind-blowing action scenes. Hundreds of thousands of people perish when an evil megalomaniac plans to solve overpopulation by implanting SIM cards into their heads, controlling their thoughts, and converting their cell phones into improvised explosive devices. "Kingsman: The Secret Service" qualifies as the kind of silly but stout, R-rated saga that might repel squeamish moviegoers.Matthew Vaughn and his wife Jane Golden, who has collaborated on every film her husband has helmed except "Layer Cake," have adapted Mark Millar's graphic novel with the same audacious abandon that they infused in "Kick Ass." Indeed, they have made some extreme but inspired changes to Millar's narrative. "Kingsman" concerns an independent, international espionage agency hidden behind the façade of an elite tailor's shop on London's Savile Row that operates at the highest level of discretion like "The Man from U.N.C.L.E" television series. This private outfit makes Navy SEALs look like second-rate shrimp. Indeed, if such an ultra-secret organization existed, world peace would be guaranteed. Latter day British knights of the realm with appropriate code-names like Lancelot and Galahad, these dudes cut dashing figures in their globe-trotting missions to preserve peace and solidarity. The cream of their crop, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), ranks as their top agent. He is at his best when he has little more than an umbrella to vanquish the villains. British actor Colin Firth, who plays the impeccably clad protagonist, has been acting since 1984, but he is known largely as a lightweight leading man in romantic comedies like "Mamma Mia!," "Shakespeare in Love," and "Bridget Jones' Diary." In 2007, he ventured out of his comfort zone and played an armor-clad knight in the above-average medieval swashbuckler "The Last Legion." During one of Vaughn's many impressively staged action set-pieces, Firth devastates a hatemongering Westboro-style church congregation in a no-holds-barred, free-for-all fracas.As "Kingsman" unfolds, Harry Hart's closest comrade, Lancelot (Jack Davenport), dies during a mission but saves Harry's life. Predictably, Harry consoles Lancelot's grieving widow and son. Understandably distraught by her husband's mysterious demise, Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack of "Breeders") wants nothing to do with Kingsman. Nevertheless, Harry persuades her only son, Eggsy, to accept Lancelot's medal inscribed with a phone number and a code word should he ever require help. Seventeen years later, as an underprivileged teen living in the projects, Eggsy finds himself in deep trouble. Our wild, impulsive hero steals an automobile belonging to a gang of loutish British lads who have been badgering him. Commandeering their vehicle for a joyride, Eggsy careens through congested London traffic, driving the vehicle in reverse, with the police following him nose to nose, as he executes several complicated maneuvers. Vaughn excels with suspenseful scenes like this careening car chase. Later, with nobody to help him, Gary 'Eggys' Unwin (newcomer Taron Egerton) contacts Harry. After Harry gets Eggsy out of the clink, he takes him for a tour of a local tailor's shop that serves as a front for Kingsman. Since he feels guilty about the death of Eggys' dad, Harry helps the lad compete with other candidates for the job-of-a-lifetime as a Kingsman. After surviving the gauntlet of an incredible obstacle course, Eggys stands poised to become a top agent who can match wits and swap fists with either James Bond or Jason Bourne. Unfortunately, our hero commits some interesting mistakes before he can redeem himself in the eyes of the Kingsman and save the world.Samuel L. Jackson steals the show as goofy looking, Internet billionaire philanthropist Richmond Valentine. Adopting with a quirky lisp, Jackson wears his baseball cap askew like a gangsta. Clearly, Valentine represents Jackson's best performance since "Pulp Fiction." Although the tongue-in-cheek Jackson overshadows handsome Harry Hart and his unusual arsenal of weapons, Valentine's number one henchman--perhaps 'henchm'am would be better--is a gravity-defying dame equipped with razor-sharp, 'Flex-Foot Cheetah' blade feet, who slices up her adversaries like deli meat. Nothing can prepare you for Algerian dancer Sofia Boutella of "StreetDance 2" when she performs her breathtaking acrobatic feats in a variation on Oddjob and his razor sharp bowler hat from the Bond groundbreaker "Goldfinger." Altogether, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" amounts to amusing but polished nonsense.</fullReview>

Substantial spy actioner based on the comic book "The Secret Service" about England's elite squad to serve queen and country with Firth as a veteran gentleman soldier who recruits young Egerton (in a decent big screen debut) in an open slot of the squad out to stop meglamoniacal genius Jackson (lisping his way into yet another obnoxious over-the-top performance; really needs to dial it down a bit) hellbent on destroying humanity via technology (that old Bond chestnut). While it plays like an ode to the aforementioned 007 (and even nods to America's Jason Bourne with some clever fight sequences adrenalized with '70s soundtrack hits) it does enliven the genre with some nifty nips and tucks (i.e. an Odd-Jobian Asian henchman with a sex change and Ginsu-sharp artificial legs played by the sly, lithe Boutella and to see dapper, mild-mannered Firth kick some serious ass) it does become predictable and old hat in its grande finale of carnage (not a dig but OK, we get it) no thanks to the shoot 'em up screenplay adaptation by young turk filmmaker Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman).

A delightful premise overcomes its hints of cheese fairly quickly, and evolves into a spy drama that evokes a lot of thrills, laughs and pulse-pounding excitement. Of the cast, there is much to celebrate. Colin Firth is superb as the classy and ass-kicking spy who first introduces us to the world, Mark Strong is a magnificent Q to Taron Egerton's Bond, and Samuel L. Jackson's villain is one of Hollywood's most memorable characters in the last few years. Mark Hamill's cameo was a great deal of fun. The breakout stars, Taron Egerton and Sophie Cookson, are young actors I really want to see more of. And everyone in the film is darn likable. The violence is refreshingly, a delightful reminder that after the watered down Hunger Games movies, some Hollywood directors still have the guts to be in your face. However, whilst the bloodbath in the church was a magnificent scene that I thoroughly enjoyed watching, the violence against women was a little too much for me. The story is amazing, with a credible villain motive and execution strategy, perfect highs and lows, and wonderfully fleshed out characters. The society of Kingsman are clearly thought out and the training is a delight to watch.The main thing stopping this film getting a perfect 5/5 review is that tasteless and grossly immature anal sex jokes at the end. For a film selling itself on class, it just blew a lot of its good will. I could easily swallow the rest of the film's minor flaws - stupid exploding heads, easy to spot stunt men - but I have to knock Matthew Vaughn's film down a peg for being so immature.But immaturity has its benefits, and for 99% of Kingsman's violent and ludicrously entertaining run time, I was loving it. Bring on the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is the type of movie that from the trailers, looks to polarize audiences. The previews are stylish, ridiculous, over-the-top, but potentially fun. The question was, would it pull these things off successfully, or be so self-indulgent as to be depraved of any quality?Despite fun-font opening titles, Kingsman starts off rather serious. It begins in the Middle East with a group of secret service men prying for information, before their subject proves to be a suicide bomber. One of the men sees this and immediately sacrifices himself to save the group. This weighs heavily on secret service man Harry Hart, an experienced kingsman who should have seen it coming, knows it, and doesn't ever forget.Harry Hart is played brilliantly by Colin Firth. He's the type of bad ass who will take down everyone in the room, but will be a perfect gentleman right up until, and right after, that very moment. "Manners maketh man" he exclaims, just before brutally assailing an entire group of men at a bar. Harry Hart's emotions are just beneath the surface much of the time, but Colin Firth does so well with nuance, that it never feels overdone.The real star of the show, however, is Eggsy, played wonderfully by newcomer Taron Egerton. Eggsy is the son of the man killed in the beginning, and despite his fashion, manners, and swiftness to throw fists to solve his problems, Eggsy is a very respectable character, because he stands up for himself, looks after himself and his troubled mother, and he's determined to do well when called upon. Though his character can pack a lot of laughs, as he is often wide-eyed about the fancy gadgetry, Taron Egerton takes the role very seriously, making for a very charismatic lead. Eggsy is the do-gooder of bad boys, with intelligence and wit.The film's plot sets these two lovable characters on a collision course with megalomaniac villain Richard Valentine, portrayed in full-blown theatricality by Samuel L. Jackson in one of his most memorable roles to date. Valentine dresses very flashy, has a ridiculous lisp, and often speaks in simple terms, but is cunning and terrifyingly brilliant. Much like Jackson's performance, the over-the-top nature of Valentine is a facade to fool the world into thinking he is harmless. But as his outlandish plot unfolds- and it is easily one of the most ridiculous villain plots in a movie in a long time- we see how dangerous he can truly be, and the stakes are raised.And that's why I loved Kingsman. Despite being cool, fun, and full of charismatic characters, Kingsman doesn't let its nature from overriding all the dynamics that make movies so enjoyable: it gives us characters we love to watch and care about, puts them in suspenseful situations. All this is achieved through the strong, but never self-indulgent, performances, led by director Matthew Vaughn, through selectively stylish, non-derivative cinematography, and a meta-script that knows what type of movie it is and pays respect to spy films. It is careful not to cross over into parody territory and allows itself to break the rules we come to expect in the genre.Still, Kingsman is not perfect. Many of the characters that seem to get Eggsy into trouble are very generic, preppy teenage jerks. The character Roxie, who Eggsy has great chemistry with, gets less and less screen time as the film progresses and by the movie's end, doesn't feel very important in the grand scheme of things. There is also the stereotypical action-movie problem of bad guys who have no aim with their weapons, yet the heroes are master marksmen. This becomes very apparent in the movie's final action sequence, which also starts to drag after some time. There's never a dull moment in the movie, but towards the end I was starting to wonder when it actually would end.These issues don't bog the movie down very much though, simply because it has too much going for it. There are lots of memorable action sequences; one is a gruesome, hilarious riot inside a Westboro-Baptist inspired hate-group church; another features secondary villain, Gazelle, a lethal amputee whose prosthetic metal legs act as blades that can slice a person in half with ease; another is an incredible skydiving training sequence with a terrifying twist. I was on the edge of my seat. Kingsman is not the type of movie that is going to get any accolades later this year, and while I do think it's a polarizing film, I think far more people will enjoy it than not. It's the type of movie that reminds us why we go to the movies: it gives us characters we can laugh with but believe in, keeps us on the edge of their seat as it continues to raise the stakes, and it never forgets to have fun. Kingsman is the first great movie this year.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had such high expectation for this movie. I saw the trailers and I was so damn pumped to see this. Yesterday I finally went to the theater, purchased my ticket, sat down in the theater with my two friends and let me tell you this did not disappoint. This was exactly as good as I predicted. The film boasts an incredible cast. Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine, Samuel L. Jackson, newcomer Taron Egerton, even Mark Hamill! Yes, Mark Hammill. It was very refreshing to see him return to the big screen and fans of him will not be disappointed. The action scenes are by far some of the best I've ever seen in my life. This is one of the most violent films i've ever seen. If you do not enjoy strong violence and lots of bloodshed this is definitely not for you. Limbs are cut off by a prosthetic legs- toting lady servant , people are stabbed, impaled, shot in the head, poisoned, you name it, this movie's got it! From the director of Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class comes yet another amazing title that you should definitely go see. Forget Fifty Shades of Grey. This is by far superior in every way. Bring on Kingsman 2!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best, most original movies I have seen in a LONG time. The cast is incredible, the plot is original and very well executed. The story is full or twists and will have you on the edge of your seat. The villain in this movie could hold his own as a classic Bond villain, (minus the seriousness), and the fighting/action scenes are incredible and extremely fun to watch. The ending scene will have your eyes watering with laughter. As awesome as the trailers for this film are, they do not do it justice. They pretty much put as much into the trailers as they could and still get away with it, but the actual movie has so much more to offer than the trailers would let on. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking to laugh while cringing at the same time. Parents!! Leave the kids at home!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Loved it! A super secret spy organization, not affiliated with any government, works behind the scenes to keep evil at bay. Headed by "Arthur," and guided by "Merlin," each of the agents who also have Arthurian codenames, conduct their own investigations into the seedy side of evil all over the globe. There are only so many seats at the round table, and so when agent Lancelot is killed, the first active agent in 17 years to die, the Kingsman begin recruiting his replacement from a group of young men and women. Our main character is Eggsy, who is sponsored by Galahad (Colin Firth), a young man who lacks many of the others social graces, coming across as a bit rough on the edges. The young men and women begin a very long job interview that is very rough and potentially fatal to weed out the lesser candidates and find the next agent worthy to sit at the round table. At the same time, Colin Firth's character, Harry Hart, codename Galahad, is tasked with finding out who, and why, Lancelot was killed. Even thought it was R rated, I did take my two boys (7 and 9) and truly regret that decision. I know it was R...but I thought it was because of the violence and the language. For the most part, I was right. There was only one scene, in the last few minutes of this otherwise awesome flick, that ruined that expectation. I won't go into graphic depiction, but when Eggsy asks the female hostage if he can have a kiss if he frees her, she replies (in the trailer) "I'll give you more than that," and he states, "I'll be right back." It's very funny in the trailer...but in the movie, she actually states exactly what she'll do to repay him...and that's where it got awkward with my children. So...if they weren't there, I would have a great time. If that scene wasn't in there, or cut short, it would have been a great time.I find it hard to figure out if the movie works for an adult crowd, because the action scenes are cartoonish (mostly). There is a bit of blood and gore, but on one occasion, the blood and gore was replaced by pyrotechnics. If you've seen "My Name is Nobody," and remember the scene with Henry Fonda shooting at the Wild Bunch, you'll understand what I mean. There are many references to spy movies and TV shows--James Bond, Bourne Identity, "24" and even "Get Smart." It's fun, almost a parody...and then it throws out the R-rated stuff. It could have been a much more accessible movie without that one scene...so I don't know why they are trying to limit their audience...weird.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman is one of those movies that just makes you lose yourself and forget about the world for two hours. It is not quite a spoof of classic spy movies, but it uses some of the archetypes, acknowledges it is using them, then gives them a little twist to make them unique for their use. I think all the actors fit their roles well, and it is refreshing to see Sam Jackson step out of the type of bad ass roles he has been cast in lately. The stop motion wire fighting is top notch, and every time the violence borders on going too far, something is done to lighten the mood a little. I think the only major issue I had is the use of the "f-word," it not only bordered on over use, I don't think it fit all the characters. It could have been well used to differentiate the boys from the--well,from the Kingsman. All in all, a fun ride from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Etiquette has it's place, even in the world of espionage. "A gentleman with manners waits to be seated and drinks martinis stirred with gin." That's the sentiment of suave British spy Harry Hart (Colin Firth). His 'Manners make the man' philosophy is what drives him and his highly trained super spies in Kingsman: The Secret Service. He operates out of a tailor shop, sports custom suits, and has the moves of a ninja. In the film, Harry loses one of his agents while on a mission. Many years later, he encounters the misdirected son of the fallen agent and decides to take him under his wing. Apparently, it's just in time when the 'Kingsmen' are faced with battling an unknown evil that threatens to destroy the world.There's nothing to not like about this film. The idea that "Kingsman" releases on Valentine's weekend made so much since to me after watching the film, because I fell in love with it within the first 30 minutes. Every element of this movie is on par from casting to costuming. Firth is superb as the calm, cool, and collected Harry Hart and the fresh face British actor Teron Egerton is believable as a troublesome teen, who Harry gives some much needed direction. The evil forces in this film are also smartly cast, with Samuel L. Jackson as Valentine, a lisping mega-millionaire tech maniac who has his sites on ruling the world. At his side is the stealthy and stoic Gazelle (Sofia Boutella) who gives the term 'blade runner' a new meaning as she flies through the air slicing and dicing anyone and anything in her path, with leg prosthetics that have blades for feet.But what stands out most for this sartorial sleuth is the styling in this film. The tailor shop Harry runs is actually a front for the top secret headquarters of the 'Kingsmen' and it also contains the ultimate wardrobe arsenal. The fashion includes stylish pinstripe suits and shiny oxford shoes. When the wearer clicks their heels, they don't get transported home, but rather swiftly release a mini switch blade from the toe. The accessories are just as crafty including a see-through, bullet-proof umbrella, a watch that shoots tranquilizer darts, and a lighter that is a hand grenade. How can you lose with chic gadgetry like that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie but too violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10 if it was not for the gratuitous violence.This movie has a great script, a great cast, good acting, but needs about 30 minutes chopped to be really great.This script is fast paced with nods to some of the iconic spy film including of course James Bond. Surprisingly there were also some elements from the one TV show that Ian Fleming did. The Man from U.N.C.L.E. in the 1960s was originally titled Ian Fleming's Man form U.N.C.L.E.Where the movie fails is the level of violence. Scenes showing necessary violence to advance the plot go on much too long.Colin Firth was great as a classic Ian Fleming style agent. He would have made a great James Bond. Taron Egerton is excellent as a young man Firth mentors.Mark Strong who has a "Q" like roll and Michael Caine who plays the "M" like role in the movie are also excellent.If you like James Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E you should like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Kingsman, I thought it looked completely over the top, yet over the top enough that it'd be a fun and enjoyable movie to see. Boy was I right.In the movie one of the characters says "Nowadays (spy movies) are all a little serious for my taste. Give me a far-fetched theatrical plot any day." Well, the movie basically explained itself right there, and it worked perfectly. A far-fetched plot with highly entertaining action sequences, cool gadgets, and great humor. After three straight 007 movies with what, two gadgets total in them? it was great to see that kind of fun creativity in a spy movie again. Kingsman is like James Bond meets Mission Impossible meets Quentin Tarantino. Who wouldn't wanna see that?Kingsman goes where most action/spy movies don't attempt to go anymore, and they had a lot of fun with it. It's entertaining from beginning to end and is definitely worth seeing.</fullReview>

There are a lot of cool gadgets! And Colin Firth! Wow.. his style is impeccable, he has a style, very gentleman and lethal. He can really portrait the international spy with suave. And Taron Egerton is not bad. He can play the green spy accurately. The story is not bad, there is a little twist at the end. For the villain, Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular, he can be very entertaining and twisted at the same time. The action is non-stop and original. Overall, this movie is very recommended!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Kingsman:The Secret Service", starring Colin Firth-The King's Speech, Mamma Mia!; Taron Egerton-Testament of Youth, The Smoke_tv; Sofia Boutella-Streetdance 2, Dance Challenge; Samuel L. Jackson-Nick Fury in almost all of the Marvel movies, Unbreakable and Michael Caine- Alfred in the Dark Knight movies, On Deadly Ground.This is based on a comic book series called The Secret Service and is directed by Matthew Vaughn-X-Men:First Class, Kick-Ass, Layer Cake. If you like Bond, James Bond, then you should love this one-I know I do and I did. Colin plays a Kingsman, a secret agent that works for her majesty's secret service in London. They work out of a tailor shop- anyone remember The Man From U.N.C.L.E.? FYI: There is a new movie based on that old t.v. show that is coming out in August. Michael plays the leader of the Kingsman and starts up a recruitment drive after their ranks are seriously depleted. Colin sponsors Taron, and all the candidates have to go through some rigorous training and learn how to use all kinds of Bondian gadgets; exploding lighters, guns that shoot different types of ammunition, bullet-proof umbrellas and of course, the blade in the shoe gimmick that was used so well in From Russia With Love. And what would a good spy movie be without a good villain? Samuel plays that part and he has it covered, with a speech impediment-he talks with a lisp-and he also hates violence-he actually gets sick at the sight of blood. Samuel's master plan is to kill most of the population; he thinks thinning the herd will be better for the planet and the eco system. Sofia plays Samuel's enforcer that goes by the name of Gazelle- mainly because of the way she moves and she has prosthetic sharp blades for legs, which she uses quite often-evidently, she has no problem with the sight of blood. There is a lot of humor along with the tributes to everything that is Bond and the music is good, too-I remember hearing some Lynyrd Skynyrd during the church massacre scene. Oh yeah, see if you recognize Professor Arnold, one of the first people that is kidnapped by Samuel. It's rated "R" for violence, language and sexual content-including some nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 9 minutes. I am a big Bond fan and really enjoyed this one and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I used to like the old James Bond movies, which were so over the top, but humorous at the same time. Usually I avoid all movies with a lot of violence in it and only went to see the Kingsman because I saw an interview with Colin Firth and just could not imagine him as an action star and wanted to see it for myself.I have to say I laughed through the whole film. It was impossible for me to take the fight scenes seriously, they were so exaggerated that it reminded me of fight scenes in Asterix and Obelix, the only comic books I ever read. I liked the dystopian message of the film. Control through the little electronic device nobody is able to be without anymore. I can imagine that some corporation will give people free phones and internet access in order to watch their every move and control them. We are nearly there anyway.I thought the sets were impressive and the acting great, no surprise there with that cast.. Good entertaining movie. Much more people in our movie theater than in 50 shades of Grey next door, by the way. No surprise there either.</fullReview>

Men who are less masculine in their actions do not mean they have to talk with a silly fake lisp... pronouncing their S's like a TH sound. What silly acting on Samuel L. Jackson's part.

Anyway, despite how spectacularly absurd the whole thing is, there's actually some pretty good writing and acting in here. Colin Firth and Samuel L. Jackson in particular deliver some outstanding performances. Lot of people might take issue with how over-the-top violent it can get, so if you're sensitive to that sort of thing maybe pass on this, but personally it didn't get to me that much. There's a scene later on in the movie that nearly killed me with laughter over just how ludicrous it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spoiler-Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At once a slick spy movie in the Sixties' James Bond mold, while also being a satire of those films, Kingsman: The Secret Service reminds me of films like Hot Fuzz in how it sends up the tropes of a genre by making a good movie in that genre at the same time. The Kingsmen are an independent spy organization modeled after the ideals of being a gentleman and protecting others. Director Matthew Vaughn delivers more of what he is known for here, slick visuals, kinetic action sequences, and a fair amount of blood spatter, and yet I found myself not only entertained but emotionally involved as well. A large part of the film's success in those regards is the relationship between Colin Firth's Kingsman named Galahad and his twenty-something protégé, Taron Egerton's Eggsy who goes from a street kid to Kingsman all in the course of a two hour movie. The bottom line is, you wind up liking all of the characters because Vaughn cast the right actors in each of the roles, I mean, Samuel L. Jackson is so charismatic as the Bondish bad guy Valentine that you almost want him to succeed. While had this film dialed down the blood and usage of the f-word it could have easily achieved a PG-13 rating, compared to a lot of other action movies in the modern era, this one is almost tame (key word, almost). Truth be told, none of the gratuity of this film bothered me as much as other movies made in a similar vein, and a large part of that is that the film never really lingers on anything gratuitous, it just kind of moves on with the story, focusing more so on the characters and what's happening with them. So at the end of the day, if you enjoy a good spy movie, or simply an action movie with likable characters and some clever laughs interspersed throughout, Kingsman: The Secret Service will more than satisfy.I give Kingsman: The Secret Service a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well played Mr. Vaughn. Well played. I've always appreciated Matthew Vaughns cinematic style, but the plot is always a tad too unique or doesn't click. Everything seems to click here. The plot is a bit out there, and the good vs. bad animated characters almost play out like a Saturday morning cartoon but it seems to work. Good is mostly good, and bad is evil. The characters are intriguing, the dialect entertaining, and the action is an old fashioned good time. Pun intended when referring to the Kingsman. The movie although predictable in some senses as far as the training for the most part, many things are not predictable. People die. Good people turn bad. And the beat down you always want to see from Eggsy (Egerton) to his mom's boyfriend? doesn't ever happen even though he deserves it. There are many things that happen in the movie to keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat and I wasn't really bored for a minute. I was surprised by the rating and wasn't sure what to expect from the R-rating. I expected a barely adult movie that was almost PG-13. Way off. There are numerous profanities used, and lots of blood. It was actually refreshing for there to be a legitimate adult movie made and not just an R-rated movie edited to fit mass PG-13 audiences. The action scene with Galahad (Firth) and the crazy church people?.amazing. I will definitely be watching it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this last night and had an absolute blast with it. Even if you takes Kingsman only at face value and see it purely as a riff on Bond movies, it works incredibly well. Matthew Vaughan brings such verve and energy to his scenes that it's difficult not to be caught up in the flow and I love the little touches, such as the way he uses a snow globe in a London flat to shift scenes to a remote frozen mountain. Jane Goldman also deserves due credit for her script, which is a lot sharper than many others which have tried to do the same thing. I've never read the comic on which this based but, if nothing else, she turned something that a lot of people apparently disliked into something that should have widespread appeal.I really really liked Colin Firth in this and it's been a while since I could say that about him. I think the surprise factor is another reason why this movie worked so well for me ? I was genuinely surprised at how excited I got when Firth showed up on the screen. I will admit to letting out a genuine sigh of disappointment when he got killed and I'm sure I wasn't the only one in the audience. I should have seen that scene coming. It's pretty essential for almost apprentice-mentor story when the mentor is killed and the apprentice must rise to the occasion. And yet I didn't. Or at least I didn't want to.It's a testament to Taron Egerton that I was as invested in Eggsy's story as I was. Amusingly, there were a group of boys not dis- similar to Eggsy in my cinema row and I initially wrote them off as potential disruptions to my cinema experience. It probably didn't help that the first trailer was for Fifty Shades Of Grey and so they laughed quite loudly at it (which is, well, understandable). But, once that movie began, they didn't make a sound (other than laughing in the right places) and, after it finished, I heard one of them declare that the movie was "pretty sweet" (which I assume meant that he liked it). I think that's a good parallel for the movie which suggests we're all so much more than what's on the surface. As a Brit, the discussions on class probably said a little bit more to me than they would to some international cinema-goers. My friend, who saw the movie with me, argued that Eggsy should have been black, which I dismissed because then it would have brought race into the mix and that's a whole different kettle of fish. Eggsy needed to be white to show that he was the same as everyone else in that room, bar the circumstances of his birth.Also: How great was it to see Mark Hamill back on the big screen, but wielding an English accent? I was oddy giddy about that.This was actually my first visit to the cinema this year and it was a great way to re-introduce myself to the experience. I have Jupiter Ascending lined up for next week and, if it's anywhere near as enjoyable as this, I can see 2015 being a good year for myself and cinema. As one of my audience members remarked last night, that's pretty sweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only ever reviewed one movie on IMDb but after seeing this movie I just had to talk about it. I'm a film maker myself. It's my dream to become a famous film director working on superhero movies for all ages in Hollywood. But of course there are kinds of films I don't like. I tend to faint to the sight of gore and this movie had quite a lot in it.The trailer for this movie is what got my hyped. It looked so badass and fun. It was also a very interesting idea of a movie to me and the trailer music was fantastic. So today I saw it with a few friends and I did have to leave at one point because I felt a bit light headed. I knew the director of this movie directed Kick-Ass and I know what's in that movie so I expected the violence but I read reviews before I saw it everyone says the violence is terrible CGI and I do kind of agree but it's action violence so in a way they make it look fun but the slow motion violence and the points where they take it too far just made me light headed. The kinds of films I do not like are ones with an overload of violence shoved in our faces, constant teenage swearing and deaths that are just so blunt and cold. Lots of movies made like that get the high ratings these days and I really don't understand how people can love a movie with that stuff. If they say they love it cos it's realistic then I think to myself "My life isn't like this. I don't have sex with people I met a few minutes ago, I don't kill people brutally with sword legs, I don't swear in practically every sentence. How is that kind of stuff loved so much?!"But anyway, on to the aspects I liked. I really loved the whole idea of a secret service of spies fighting for their country, I loved the fighting techniques (without the ones that result in blood parades) but most of all I loved the cinematography, editing of shots, weapons, costumes and score. I really think that if this got rid of most of swearing to just allow the same amount of profanity in Marvel movies, the blunt deaths, cold people and actually showing the gory violence than I would have rated this movie a 9 or 10. I just think not shoving the violence in our faces and instead suggesting the violence and letting it happen off camera but we still know what has been done like Alfred Hitchcock did in his violent scenes in his films then it would have been much more powerful in my opinion. I would have also preferred the excessive violence that went to far to remain out of the movie. I have a feeling people will call me a sook or a baby or something because I'm not a fan of gut fests so please note this is just my opinion.Overall, it's a fun movie and I think I will see it again when it comes out on DVD. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another enjoyable spy movie spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing about movies set in London is that they tend to grab a part of me that reminds me of the times that I have visited the city. In a way I feel a stronger connection with London now that I have been there than I have in times past. However, while most of the movie is set in London, we are taken to other places, such as the secluded hideout of the arch villain, though unlike many of the other spy movies that I have seen, Kingsmen does not take you to all that many exotic places (actually it doesn't take you to any).It's not a bad film, and in fact it is quite enjoyable. The premise is that there is a secret organisation that is not connected to any particular government which enables it to act in the interests of humanity as opposed to any particular nation or political party. The Kingsmen are top secret, meaning that the only time anybody ever hears of them is when they are born, get married, and die. In fact their operations, even the successful ones, do not even make it into the newspapers (though it is interesting that the newspaper that is referred to is The Sun, which I suspect isn't one of those newspapers that anybody should really pay any attention).As with any spy movie, we have an arch villain with a diabolical plan to remake the world in his own image, and it is up to the Kingsmen to stop him. However this is where their independence comes into play because this particular villain has his fingers in an awful of lot pies. Mind you, even though we aren't supposed to like the villain, this particular one was downright annoying. I guess it was the nature of the film though because while it is not satire in the traditional sense, it is still a spoof.Kingsmen focuses around a young drop out named Egsy, who happens to be the son of another Kingsman that was killed in action when he was a baby. More recently another Kingsman is killed in action, which opens up a spot, meaning that the remaining ones bring in potential candidates, and thus we have the candidates attempting to pass the tests as a team, and also excelling so that they are chosen. This is where I had a bit of some difficulty with the film because it seemed as if they were trying to cram too much into the film, and it seemed to jump from the plot where they were trying to track and outsmart the villain to the training. It wasn't until the training came to an end that the film actually began to flow a lot better.As I said, this is a spoof of the James Bond movies, and it quite amusing in parts, however there were problems, and as I said, the arch villain really, really annoyed me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie, but Horrifying Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting, just there are some parts which are just too much for me.Maybe it's because I'm the sort of person that sees things that other people don't, but the ending is just too terrifying. It has good morals such as it doesn't matter what your upbringing is to make a difference, or that we need to help the earth before it's too late, but the stuff near the end makes you wonder exactly how many people died due to the villain's plan. Also, it's revealed that the British Royal Family (the list says all their names) accept the villain's plan. Just...think about that during the implant scene near the end. On the whole, it is a perfect subversion of spy movies and gentleman spies, but those with a weak stomach might not like the church scenes or the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Hilarious and Hilariously Bloody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is literally the lovechild of classic James Bond and Matthew Vaughn's own Kick-Ass. It's about a super secret agency that sends spies around the world to take down eccentric and bizarre supervillains that live in mountain bases. They have lighter grenades, umbrella guns, and poison-tipped knives in their shoes, but above all they're also suave, upper class toffs. It's James Bond all over again. However, add in the swearing, blood and ultra-violence, truck-load of black humour, and copious amounts of pop culture references and self-mocking tone from Kick-Ass and you get Kingsman.The kind of comedy you get here is very dark. If you don't find violence or gore funny, you won't be laughing much. Whether it's the amputee with swords for legs, or implants that cause heads to explode into colourful fireworks, there's plenty to go around. To be honest, I was actually taken quite aback by it all. I know it's Matthew Vaughn (and a 15), but I never expected it to be quite so bold and unapologetic. I mean the opening lines are "Oh s***, we f***ed up." And not long after, a guy is cleaved in half. It's unrelenting as the movie goes on as well.There is a little bit of wit on display as well though. It's not all about the violence. There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek references that almost break the fourth wall, like the recurring line "It's not that kind of movie." And Eggsy's choice of dog name being representative of three of the biggest spies in pop culture (JB is the dog's name, and he's asked whether it's after James Bond, Jason Bourne, or Jack Bauer).If there was particularly a weak point in the movie, it would probably be the CGI. In this day and age there's really no excuse for bad CGI. The opening titles are done in a really imaginative and integrated way, but the CGI used to do it looks really obvious. There's explosions from a brick building, and the bricks crumble, tumble and form into the words of the titles. Then the camera zooms into one of the windows. Unfortunately this scene is rife with CGI that looks like it was rendered in the 90s and just looks plain awful. There's no real effort to try and make the bricks blend in with the rest of the wall at all, and the way they tumble down and form into the words reeks of a cheap video game. It gets better later on, but for an opening, it doesn't leave a particularly good impression.The other thing that didn't really rub right for me was the split personality of the film. Kick-Ass managed to hit a happy medium between being over-the-top and being grounded. It was horrifically good fun, but also tugged on the heartstrings and always felt completely natural. Kingsman on the other hand, you can tell they've aimed for the same kind of thing, but the mix just doesn't sit right. It's got the language and violence for adults, but the core of the movie feels like Spy Kids. It's over-the-top in the wrong kind of way, which is the point; it's to make fun of those classic spy films, but it just didn't mix particularly well in my opinion. It would be lighthearted, then super violent, then serious and dramatic, and there was no real transition to ease us into the new feel. It didn't ruin the movie by any means, don't get me wrong, it just prevented it from quite being the masterpiece Kick-Ass was.Kingsman is certainly a very fun movie, full of lots of great actors, old and new alike. It's brave and unapologetic in it's mockery and depiction of violence, and that makes it an extremely entertaining watch, despite it's faults. It's bloody hilarious, and hilariously bloody. I give Kingsman an enjoyable 7/10, and would definitely recommend it to those that enjoy ultra- violence depicted in a lighthearted manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprised this movie received such a high score on IMDb. The storyline is transparent despite the cast of talented actors. The over the top action scenes with gore have been done before in movies like kill bill. The kingsman trials the candidates go through are ridiculous cause they make no sense. The remaining candidates have to choose between shooting a dog or being kicked out of the kingsman, another nonsense plot point. The main protagonist is apparently from a low socio economic family despite his father being a kingsman of the secret service, once he dies then the family get no pension or support, yet his son is more than happy to join the service no questions asked. Save yourself some time and go watch spy kids for a better storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was, for lack of a better word, trash. I do not recommend it, unless you are 14 year old. The casting was mediocre, the performances were contrived and overacted, the characters were unappealing to anyone over 14 and the story line probably took 10 minutes to think up. There is precious little to praise in this movie save for the action, I enjoyed the brutal fights and gore but I spent most of the movie hoping someone would rip Samuel L Jackson's tongue out so I didn't have to endure yet another unbearable performance by him, this time complemented with a repulsive lisp. I'm not sure how Jackson is still being cast, he hasn't put in a true performance in over 20 years and his boorish personality is hardly appealing, especially after we've seen him be the same person in every single movie.. Back to the movie. The scripting and dialog was awful, the costumes were gaudy and the entire movie just came of as tacky and a hollow attempt at seeming polished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really cool action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is awesomeness redefined. Every time I believe the world has seen enough action movies, I get jolted off my senses to accept that there exists million other exciting ways to kick, jump and fight. And when violence combines with humor and Lynyrd Skynyrd solo, the jolt is even more devastating. Kingsman, the secret services, as the title suggests is an undercover organization 'tailored' to protect the world from unprecedented dangers which threaten mankind. Its members are the world's most agile, skilled, intelligent, suited and British gentlemen with a penchant for vintage whiskey and cute dogs. The movie covers basically two issues. One is to find an ideal replacement of one of the most able members of the service. The screening process is one of a kind, I have ever seen. It's wonderfully conceptualized, pulsating and unpredictable. The other issue is to avert a massive catastrophe which I cannot comprehend at all until the last quarter of the movie. This certainly forced me to speculate and commanded focused attention throughout the movie. Among the characters, the first pick is of course Colin Firth. Very few can portray the grace of a king and valor of a knight as convincingly as he did. At the helm, the think tank is always Michael Caine who exudes the persona of a wise old man who stands firm on his beliefs and ideals- either for good or bad; we have to decide. 'Taron Egerton' is one of the most able contenders for being a Kingsman but disappoints a little when he actually is. All in all, the movie is a must watch. A real refreshment for the ones who are actually bored of typical action movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Congratulations people who got out of the house and paid people money for this. This is a watered down kiddie rip off of James Bond movies you could get in the bargain bin of a walmart.The visual effects were good, the gadgets and to some degree the scenes like escaping out of the water to test the "agents" or driving backwards flipping the cops off was the only interesting parts. This movie tries to be edgy. Any other training place I can imagine if he didn't shoot the puppy he would have been kicked out. During World War 2 in 1933 to get your stripes you had to break a German sheppard dogs neck in front of your superior officer. Not all nazi solders had to do this but it raises a good point. This movie at first has the atmosphere or feeling of the first harry potter movie or a crappy spy kid like movie and it fails miserably at being edgy like the boy and the princess near the end but it doesn't save this movie much. The visuals and a few scenes save this from a 1 star. I think the best actor was Samuel L. Jackson as only him and knife foot girl were the only two I'll remember years from now as you can't get any more unoriginal than our hero and the guy who gets shot in the face by Samuel L. Jackson. God I suck with names.I Saw this on the weekend and didn't know anything about it. So no WOWWW hype to get an honest opinion. The script was so predictable and unoriginal it makes you wonder if they should have paid people to write this.ways for this movie to improve .. it's hopeless we needed cellphones and internet to be what would kill us? whats next a movie about how facebook becomes a serial killer and causes our monitor to eat us? The people who wrote this movie I'd blacklist from Hollywood production teams and hire some people who are older than 23 to write this. This shouldn't have been made. Ian Flemming (James Bond creator) would be spinning in his grave over this steaming pile of dog crap. I'm not a hardcore james bond fan boy I've seen 4 or 5 of the movies tops but forgetful kids like the buster brady (mrs browns boys) rip off that kid was, was about as likable or I got about as emotionally involved with him as I did with the abusive father in this movie, the baby acted better too.Don't spend people money on this atrocity.</fullReview>

There is nothing that compares to this movie. Some get close but none can match it for the sheer exhilaration you will experience. It is funny, it is fast-paced, it has A-List stars and great breakthrough performances and is wonderfully written and directed. There has been some mention of the CGI so let me tell you the only time you will notice it is when you are supposed to, to enhance the comic effect of one particular scene. This is one you have to watch in the cinema and then again and again on Blu-Ray. If it wasn't for the R rating it would be on TV every Christmas for the next 30 years. There is not one single bad part to this movie and it's not very often you can say that. An action film with a solid 8+ rating on IMDb says it all - watch this now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even a surfeit of blood can't tarnish the fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deftly directed by Matthew Vaughn, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a nostalgic throwback to those early Bond days of the 1960s, when just about every other comedy coming out of Hollywood was a spy-movie send-up ("Our Man Flint," "In Like Flint," "The Silencers," "Agent for H.A.R.M." etc.). This latest addition to the genre, based on the comic book "The Secret Service" by Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons, tells of a spy agency so secret that even other spy agencies don't know it exists. Kingsman is made up of a cadre of highly trained, dapperly dressed "gentlemen" spies who consider themselves to be the descendants - in spirit, if not in flesh-and-blood - of the knights of yore (they've even given each other code names like Lancelot and Galahad). That dapperest of dapper gentlemen Colin Firth plays Harry Hart, aka Galahad, a veteran agent who recruits a directionless youth (Taron Edgerton) from the streets of London - the son of an agent who over a decade earlier saved Hart's life - to train in the art of spying (like in "My Fair Lady," the eager trainee pipes in). Eggsy's first major assignment will be to thwart the dastardly high-tech plot of a crazed gazillionaire, played by a lisping Samuel L. Jackson, who intends to save the planet by eliminating the "virus" (i.e., humanity) that seems bent on destroying it.The humor in the Jane Goldman/Matthew Vaughn screenplay ranges from brittle and dry to pitch-dark satire, so dark in fact that the movie occasionally threatens to run off the rails into a tonal train wreck. Luckily, however, it always manages to right itself just at the point where we're about to bail out on it. It's true that the violence may probably be a tad too graphic for a movie of this type but the overall spirit of good cheer and unalloyed fun triumphs in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most fun theatre-going experiences I've had in recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of "Kingsman: The Secret Service" involves various agents of an international secret intelligence agency (The Kingsman) on a mission to take down an insane billionaire's plot of 'improving' the world. One of these agents is 'Eggsy' - a troubled young man who is given an opportunity, among stiff competition, to become a Kingsman.QUICK REVIEW: Matthew Vaughn steps it up again with Kingsman: The Secret Service. Yes, the humour and violence may seem immature and tasteless to some, but if you enjoy the kinds of humour and violence in movies made by Tarantino or even Edgar Wright, then this film is perfect for you (I personally love stylized violence myself). Most of the action scenes are done hand-held, but they're proficient enough so that you can see every punch, kick, and gunshot clearly.Expect to see one of this film's lead star, Taron Egerton, in a lot more films in the future. Not only did he get his character's tough exterior and quick wit down, but he also has his character's sweet and caring side down. The chemistry between him and Colin Firth's character is also strong.Speaking of Firth, he too proves himself as an actor who can take on physically demanding roles in this movie. I would even go as far as to say his performance is as suave as Sean Connery's when he's James Bond.Vaughn could not have picked a better actor to play the main villain of this movie. Samuel L. Jackson is as HILARIOUS as he is cold as billionaire Richmond Valentine.Fun, irreverent, and jam-packed with action, Kingsman: The Secret Service is one film you don't want to miss in 2015.VERDICT: See it in theatres... NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: The Secret Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some months ago, I read the comic The Secret Service, and I loved it. Its story is absolutely perfect: very dynamic, internally consistent and with the precise degree of humor in order not to be taken too seriously despite its violence and catastrophic global threats. Oh, and it also had an abundant number of "geek" references to delight the fans of comics. Therefore, I was very interested in watching the film Kingsman: The Secret Service, and even though I found it entertaining, it didn't live up to the high expectations set by the comic, mainly because co-screenwriters Matthew Vaughn (who was also the director) and Jane Goldman decided to "improve" the story altering abundant elements and breaking the balance of the well built characters. But, well... those complaints will only be relevant to the few people who read the comic, so I will now try to focus myself on the movie itself. The basic premise of Kingsman: The Secret Service is interesting: a centennial secret organization of expert British agents dedicated to the protection of society, not due to a mandate of the Crown, but due to a moral duty; and since they are independent from the government or political institutions, they avoid harmful influences which could corrupt their noble mission. Colin Firth brings an excellent performance as the classic "knight spy", and he also displays a wide dose of charisma. On the other hand, Taron Egerton feels a bit insipid and not very charismatic as the apprentice Eggsy. And it was obviously a pleasure to see Michael Caine as the leader of the organization. The violence is quite bloody, totally justifying the "R" rating and giving us an idea of what action cinema can be like when it doesn't care about commercial interests which prefer a pre-teen audience. On the negative side, the screenplay feels occasionally too erratic, seeking the correct proportion between the two sub-plots (the investigation of missing celebrities and Eggsy's training), but not always achieving it. Another thing I didn't like was the superficial way in which the villain was written; the character has so many affectations that they destroy any sensation of purpose or threat. In conclusion, I think I would place Kingsman: The Secret Service at the same level of Kick- Ass, which was also directed by Vaughn: in both films, the action is pleasantly bloody, not all the characters are well written, and even though the concept is interesting, it's not always handled with enough ingenuity to take full advantage of it. Nevertheless, I think I can give a moderate recommendation to Kingsman: The Secret Service as an entertaining action film, despite not being totally satisfactory. And besides, it served for me to lower the expectations for future cinematographic adaptations of other extraordinary comics (Saga, Sex Criminals, Alias) which will probably lose many attributes on their road to the big screen. It's an unavoidable fact I will have to accept. The fans of Howard the Duck's know what I'm talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick-Ass meets James Bond: Superbly Stylish and Highly Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is the latest hyper-violent offering from Layer Cake/Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. Starring Colin Firth as highly gentlemanly secret agent Galahad, Kingsman tells the story of Eggsy, (exciting new-comer Taron Egerton) a chavvy London teenager who seems to be at a low point in his life, until he meets Galahad and discovers the Kingsman society, which includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong as members of the Secret Service. As Eggsy begins the process of joining Kingsman, he discovers the plot of human-hating Valentine (a lisping Samuel L. Jackson.)Now where Kingsman succeeds is perfectly blending elements of laugh-out-loud humour, nailed by the spot-on comic timing of Egerton and Firth, a subversive commentary on the spy genre (from the silliness of the 1960s to the Bourne-ification of the James Bond series) and very fun, extra stylish action sequences. Notably a stand-out sequence in a church full of racist Southerners, to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird," has viewers visibly grinning with delight as they watch the eye-catching, finely-staged action unfold. By making the characters and the "gentleman" ideals realistic, Vaughn creates a fine film in which you not only want to be the characters but also could be them. Unlike a certain 007, Galahad and the true Kingsmen represent the qualities of what a real, every-day gentleman, which is both riveting to follow and entertaining to watch. There is little bad to be said about Kingsman. I suppose if you hated Kick-Ass and dislike the spy genre in general, it is almost certainly not for you, but it is probably worth watching anyway. Also, once the main plot begins to get under way, it slows down for a while. Nothing major actually happens for a while, but it's still highly entertaining. Jackson, apparently doing his lisp on a whim, is just as interesting to watch as always, as is his "legless" sidekick Gazelle. Mark Hamill appears for a while, simply to prepare us for the shock of seeing him on screen again in The Force Awakens this December. All combines to make a thoroughly amusing and exciting film; the best non-Bond spy film in some time. Please don't see Fifty Shites of Grey over this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never judge the movie based on its trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Do not judge a book by its cover." is often the common idiom that suits to possibly many underrated films out there, including "Kingsman: The Secret Service." There has not been any sacrament of myself planning to watch this movie because of a dull and cliché trailer that gives off an impression of the cheesy action movie with a ghost of hidden excitement. It definitely resembles to an obscure and mediocre Hollywood goof, solely based on the trailer.However, I ended up watching it after coincidentally getting involved into the plethora of great reviews and positive opinions about this film that have littered the media and my surrounding. And I am glad I did. Almost everything about this film stands out among a lot of its counterpart. The introductory starts strong off by unleashing bits and pieces of prowess and personality of the private organization, Kingsman in the most entertaining way. And as it carries on, things get more intense with more character development and a series of predicament that leads to the breathtaking climax after a great amount of well-written shenanigans that transpire in different places which makes the cast twice look cool and bona fide. Although, I wish the director had them articulate little slower or clearer to neutralize the accent to make it easier for others to comprehend. By watching a whole movie, each cut scene that I think of it as an underwhelming performance or over-the-top in the trailer surprisingly turns into an awesome sequence. It does not squander a minute to fully describe the protagonist who puts all of its energy into improving himself while fervently vying for the one and only Kingsman title with several others under the Kingman's unerring guidance as well as using all the skills he has obtained during the span to fight against the ominous and wicked pair that tries to get a grip on everyone in the world with manipulative SIN cards that can be inserted to mankind. There is no such thing as "Too much" or "Too little" in the name of Kingsman. The moderate amount of characters, dialogues, and battle scenes are timely introduced and shortly edited. And what every character says is critical and relevant to the plot and those words speaks for its identity. The same thing goes to the battle scene. It effectively capitalizes on a shaky and fast-paced camera technique as well as focusing on significant parts where nifty artifice and brutality are vividly depicted. The massive scrum of entire nation beating each other up has more depth to it because as the outset gradually builds up, the origin of the outbreak gets disclosed, thus gives you another reason to watch it.In a nutshell, the atmosphere of this film reminds me of the mitigated, but funnier version of "Kill Bill" sequel where the meaning of death is quite redundant. Obviously, the level of blood spattering and cruelty is different, but sharing one similarity would be the main character focusing on its nemesis as the deadly number of enemies and unexpected twists ensue. What truly differentiates the "Kingsman" in a good way from the "Kill Bill" would be types of weapons with a variety of uncanny attributes and the level of humor in which most action genre can rarely utilize.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost entertainment value with excessive violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was very clever and entertaining. Both Colin Firth and the other characters made a great movie. However, the producers excessive and prolonged use of violence really detracted from the movie. The ending (before the credits) was too explicit. The ending (after the credits) was a nice touch. Obviously, MARV and others couldn't really decide what to do with this script. Too bad that it was an opportunity lost. The computer graphics were novel and well imbedded seamlessly into the movie and plot. I will go to see Colin Firth and several of these key actors again, but if it is a MARV production I will check reviews before I spend my money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good because it featured some good action scenes and good acting. I liked Colin Firth, he did an excellent job because his lines always had a touch of arrogance to them. I like the concept of kinsman because how they're sophisticated British gentlemen but deadly is awesome. The hero is arrogant but in a bad way at the beginning which is really annoying. I loved the sky-diving scene it's completely awesome. I don't mind the bad guy, sometimes his lines were hilarious but sometimes they were embarrassing. I really hate the creepy music playing in the background every time Valentine comes on because the repetitiveness is really annoying. The story is really dumb but it's meant to be ridiculous so it's not bad. 2 action scenes really stood out to be great, the final scene and bar fight. There aren't enough good action scenes. The whole concept of the bad guy's plan was really absurd and the last scene where Valentine's system keeps going on and off is insane in a good and ridiculous way. I don't like the way they keep making references to James Bond and Bourne, it really sucks you out of the story. I loved the scene where Eggsy kills the boss by switching their glasses because you really don't see that coming. The church scene where Colin Firth is murdering people is really insane and when it isn't brutally gross it's awesome (not often). The movie's suspense is good and I love the shocking moments, Colin Firth's death. I feel compelled to repeat the action scenes were very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our best joke was one about butt stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Shaky cam, CGI blood, and poor fight choreography." "Never insult other better movies in your own film" "We thought our best joke was one about butt stuff, so we saved it till the end of the film" "We thought James Bond parodies hadn't been done to death already" "How much product placement can we put in one film...?"If the above quotes haven't yet helped you decide if this is a movie for you, maybe the rest of my review will seal the deal. Kingsman is a poor man's James Bond parody. It is a movie painfully aware that it is not taking the spy genre seriously, and it keeps reminding us by literally mentioning how serious the James Bond movies have become. But that's strike number one. Don't mention or criticize a better movie, in your own movie. It also serves us the line "a movie is only as good as its villain". Bitter irony, since the movie has a pretty poor villain, in the form of Samuel L Jackson with a terribly forced lisp. But there is a lot bad about this movie.Lets start with the tone. This movie is inconsistent with it tone. It starts off as a comedy, right with the animation of the cartoony opening credits, yet then follows up with a serious tone, and then switching back to comedy for the last half of the film. It is as if the movie was written by two very conflicted writers, with vastly different views about the tone of the film. The movie takes its biggest deviation in tone right about the moment where it serves us with a very violent, and poorly choreographed fight scene in a church.Then the comedy. The movie aims for the very lowest bar in comedy. When a joke about anal sex is the best joke that you were saving for the end, you should retire as a comedy writer. The movie got only a few chuckles from the easily entertained in the audience. But several people simply left the theater. That made me realize that those people were probably wiser than me. Comedy isn't easy. James Bond was funny, because it tried to be a good exciting film, while having a charming lead drop some occasional humor in it, without completely destroying the suspense. It kept the action lighthearted, without completely going for cheap laughs. Austin Powers on the other hand, was a full-on parody that was all about having a good laugh at all the characters. It wasn't being insulting to James Bond or other spy thrillers. It was just having fun with it, and you could tell there was love in it too. Not so much with Kingsman. The humor occasionally felt spiteful, and almost offensive.The fight choreography. I already mentioned this before, but shaky cam is just a poor way to hide bad fighting. It is what directors do when they want to ruin a fight scene, or when their actors aren't very good at fighting. By the way, it seems as if the director thinks that a hail of bullets is like rain during a bicycle ride. You just hold your hand before your eyes, and keep going, and it won't hit you.Now the soundtrack, is occasionally pretty good, when it is isn't assaulting you with annoying licensed pop music during action scenes.The story, is terrible. I know that it is intentionally trying to serve us a nonsense spy thriller plot. But it was just lazily written. A large plot of the finale revolves around Hollywood once again not understanding how hacking works, or how satellites work, or how computers work.I was severely disappointed. Several people left the theater during the movie and they did not return. I should have done the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun spy romp with plenty of action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman takes itself seriously enough to avoid the label of spoof, but keeps it's tongue firmly planted in cheek as it carries the audience along for a fun ride. I would say it's neither James Bond nor Austin Powers, but ultimately resides somewhere in the middle alongside 60's spies like Matt Helm or Derek Flint, but with the kind of action and set pieces we have grown accustomed to in modern cinema. Everyone involved is endlessly watchable, even those with smaller parts. Newcomer Taron Egerton was very good as both the street-wise punk with an oddly sophisticated past, and the dapper Kingsman he eventually becomes. The action and effects were well done, although some may find a certain choice near the end to be a bit odd. It does serve a purpose, however, adding levity in place of violence that would be excessive even for this film. In my opinion it works. Overall Kingsman is a fun update to an old concept, and I can hardly wait to see more.</fullReview>

I have always been a fan of Colin Firth and this role was right up his street. I've always liked Samuel and like Colin he was perfection in his role. The supporting actors/actresses were all good and the film soundtrack, well let's just say I'm still humming it! The story line is fantastic but hey it worked. I loved the beautiful baddie and it is nice to see Mark Strong as a good guy for once. All in all to me this film is so good there absolutely has to be a sequel.

		<shortDescription>Kingsman is simple awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So Fifty shades of F***ing Sh*t top this movie at the box office where 50 shades got everything wrong and there's nothing good about it, but Kingsman got a lot of good things to talk about so at the end of the day Kingsman win.The story is about a street-wise punk with a set of fast hands (and a faster mouth), finds himself recruited by an underground spy agency. If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world.Every since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome.Kingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that.Matthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn.Jack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him.Now at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me.Samuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park.This movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint.Now for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it.Overall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman deserves better than listing comparisons of it to other films. So let me get it out of the way: Imagine a cartoonier Bond film, influenced by Edgar Wright's brainy editing, with Wanted's unabashed silliness, Kill Bill's oddly gorgeous violence, and Guardians of the Galaxy-style comic book humor and you begin to get the picture. Above all, it's an absolute blast of pure movie fun. Boasting a great cast of perfectly matched characters and actors, kinetic scifi action choreography, and tons of slyly intentional silliness, Kingsman is funny, ultra-violent, and bursting with vibrant color. The Kingsman is a secret British organization that combats against the biggest of Earth's threats currently looking to replace one of its most recent lost members. Its structure has the skin of the ubiquitous YA-novel-turned-film genre, only much rougher. With director Vaughn at the helm, my fear was that Kingsman would be similar to many of his recent efforts: an interesting but ultimately sad miss. Blatant product placement and a couple too-clever-for-its- own-good jokes aside, this is happily not the case. Led by the classy and surprisingly action-inclined Firth as the elder statesmen of the group, the movie chugs along with inspired verve. It's also really smart. Themes like the presumptuous danger of playing God and personal honor vs. public persona bring just enough moral complexity to put it above films of its type. However, the boldly big goofiness that propels the film is never far from sight. Kingsman is a super smart action thriller that won't disappoint anyone wise enough to skip 50 Shades of Grey.</fullReview>

Cinematography is superb, and the production values are first rate. The budget for Kingsman was a fraction of that of Quantum of Solace, and yet Kingsman looks much more polished.The score, by two gentlemen whose names I was unfamiliar with is evocative and memorable.In short I can't endorse this movie strongly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a charming movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After ages I saw a good Action/Thriller/Comedy movie. How many times you watch a movie and say 'great action! but could have had a little more comic scenes' or 'all action but where is the story?' but with Kingsman you get a package deal.There is a secret service/intelligence agency called Kingsman which is "very secret" as Michael Cane says and its working domain is international. This time they loose one of the kingsman and want to find a good fit for it. That's where the real story starts.In one of the initial fighting scene in the movie you can find out which kind of the movie it would be. This scene has a little humor, sleek action and a kick-ass/funny introduction of the Villain.The story is very simple and nothing new in that and it would have been a very ordinary movie in any other director's hand but Matthew Vaughn makes it stylish and irresistible!The Action scenes are of course the highlight of the movie but everything else shines out as well. The dialogues, the costumes, the swag, setup everything.Performance wise everyone has done a great job but Colin Firth has acted marvelously and he has taken the movie to whole another level. His dialogues delivery is excellent, his fight sequences will certainly shock you in a positive sense and most importantly his chemistry with Taron Egerton is awesome. Specially the church fighting sequence will blow your mind.Samual L. Jackson as a Villain has enjoyed most in this role. You can clearly see that he is very comfortable in this character who has a slight lisp (and you will love it) and a fear from gore/bloody sights and yet he is the one responsible for all the blood and gore in the movie! He has a very likable personality as a Villain and never forgets to be a funny but dangerous antagonist.The training of new Kingsman part could have had a few more scenes as you would enjoy them.Taron Egerton is good as Eggsy and has some good action sequences in the movie.Overall a great action movie which I would love to watch again because "A gentleman never ceases to appreciate a good movie" :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Spy Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Eggsy was a toddler, his father was killed in the line of work. He was given a special medal by a well-dressed gentleman, telling him that he can call when he is in trouble. Seventeen years later, growing up in a rough London suburb, Eggsy got himself thrown in jail after engaging police in a backwards car chase. He calls the number behind the medal, and in comes the dapper Harry Hart to the rescue. Knowing Eggsy's wasted talents in gymnastics and academics, Harry brings him to try out for a vacancy in his ultra-secret spy organization, the Kingsmen.The fun begins with the opening credits, when letters would form out of the rubble that fell from various explosions of an ancient temple, to the tune of Dire Straits' hit "Money for Nothing". You knew by then that you should be ready for something tongue-in-cheek. The beginning sequences do not hide the fact that this would be a graphically violent film. Throughout the film we will be regaled with fights with guns, bombs, and blades, all in extraordinarily spectacular fashion we have never seen before.Colin Firth, an actor who is practically typecast as the shy or dour guy in romantic comedies, shows a totally screen persona here. As Harry Hart, aka Galahad, he is a swashbuckling super spy like we have never seen him before. Mark Strong makes another memorable screen appearance as Merlin, the Number 2 man among the Kingsmen. The ever reliable Michael Caine plays Arthur, the head Kingsman. You know he can play this role with his eyes closed. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as the villain Richmond Valentine, an insane megalomaniac telecom tycoon with a lisp planning to have mankind kill each other. Exotic beauty Sofia Boutella is Valentine's vicious henchman Gazelle, a graceful killer with her deadly sharp prosthetic legs. Mark Hamill was unrecognizable as the elderly environmentalist Professor Arnold, whose abduction starts the action.The biggest surprise is the breakthrough star-making performance of Taron Egerton as Eggsy. In the beginning it took some time getting used to the new face. But as the film went on, Egerton will possess the screen with his action skills and suave charm, even in the presence of his esteemed co-stars. By the time the film ends, you could not wait to see more of this young man in future films. Overall, this is a very entertaining, visually stimulating film. The production design, with all those gadgetry and weaponry, is very inventive and eye-catching. The musical score is pulsating and exciting. The action sequences were really relentlessly bloody, with various body parts getting impaled, sliced off or blowing up. Yet, this was all done with typically British wry humor and aristocratic class. Director Matthew Vaughn takes the James Bond genre, and mixes in the superhero and hi-tech elements of two excellent films he directed before ("Kick-Ass" and "X-Men: First Class"), as well as some Cockney elements from his earlier productions like "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels". With "Kingsman", he has actually managed to create something even more fantastic. This is the best 2015 release so far. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just the best James Bond spoof yet . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . but KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is even more important for its vicious critique of and poetic justice for the One Per Cent. In spoofing Bond, KINGSMAN touches all the bases with its own twists. Secret agent trainee "Eggsy" names his obligatory pooch "J.B."--not for Bond or James Bond wannabe (if he could just remember) Jason Bourne, but for Fox TV's loose cannon Jack Bauer. There are takes on the Bond gizmo's, the Bond martini, the "Bond girls" (Eggsy's are no holes barred), the Bond one-liners, the Bond villains, the Bond villains' mutant-like Henchpeople, the Bond predicaments, the Bond implausible escapes, the Bond outer space Hijinks, the Bond villains' verbal diarrhea, the MI6 elaborate hideouts, the villains' more elaborate hideouts, etc. David Niven's CASINO ROYALE Bond spoof was a total mess, and the Austin Powers series was ALL tongue-in-cheek spoof, laying it on way too thick most of the time. KINGSMAN hits a more perfect balance of wry, self-conscious (and often self-proclaimed) homage, and a movie with plots and characters the viewer can take somewhat seriously.Regarding the One Per Cent, is it too much of a "spoiler" to say to watch carefully when "Pomp and Circumstance" starts playing in order to see Barack Obama's head explode? Unfortunately, in most of the 23 Eon Company Bond flicks out so far, Agent 007 only looks out for the interest of the One Per Cent, everyone else be darned. Refreshingly, KINGSMAN is just the opposite. When Samuel L. Jackson's villain comes up with the idea that a few billion "little people" need to be "culled" (or purged, for those of you non-lobster eaters), he has absolutely no trouble convincing most of the world's "elite" to go along with his plan to create more elbow room. ALL of the villain's Rich and Powerful collaborators' heads explode in a Candyland sort of way toward the close of KINGSMAN, thanks to Eggsy and his allies. Jack Bauer could be counted upon to behead a baddie or two, but it was just one at a time. KINGSMAN goes Bauer and the Fox TV thousands of times better. (What else would you expect from Twentieth Century Fox?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember the very first trailer for "Kingsman: The Secret Service" almost a year ago being rather unremarkable in the way it portrayed the action and spy genre, sort of seeing it as a spy film playing safe and not giving it much thought. However, when a release date of October 2014 was pushed back to February 2015, and the trailers began to become more prolific, it seemed that the marketing team behind the film started to deal with the film in an entirely new sense. The trailers became a riot, showing so much craziness and complete insanity that one wondered what would be left to show in the actual film. I went from a generally dismissive attitude to genuinely being excited for, what I saw, a something totally new and fresh."Kingsman" is exactly that; a film that slaughters convention and any and all expectations to create something completely unpredictable, zealous, and most importantly, highly enjoyable. The film opens by showing a mission in the Middle East, carried out by the honorable Kingsman, an elite spy organization. We see a Secret Agent by the name of Harry Hart (Colin Firth) try his best but fail to save the life of one of his fellow agents, leading him to deliver a medal of bravery to the man's widow and young son. He tells the song, Eggsy, that if they ever need any assistance to call the phone number on the back of the medal and state a special message.Seventeen years later, another Kingsman has fallen, leaving the organization questioning how to proceed against Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a wealthy inventor who is dolling out free cell phone service in efforts to control the population and his henchman Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), equipped with sharp metal legs. Eggsy lives in London with his mother and abusive stepfather, and is arrested after stealing a thug's car at a local pub with some friends. He uses his sole phone call in prison to call the number on the back of the medal given to him as a child, and is bailed out by Harry, who wants him recruited for the secret service agency known as Kingsman in efforts to stop Valentine and company.The Kingsmen use a variety of sophisticated weaponry and fighting styles that would normally leave the untrained aggressor crippled and sore for weeks. Harry, however, is not an untrained aggressor, using suave tactics to brutalize his enemies or instigators and assure that justice be served in a fair manner. He takes Eggsy as his prodigy, showing him the ropes of a Kingsman and what it means to work for the organization, as it's more than just umbrella guns, knives that propel out of dress shoes, and inconspicuous grenades.Obviously, "Kingsman" is a blatant parody of the Bond franchise, but it is so in the best possible manner. Rather than lazily parodying character names, mannerisms, and proposing direct references to films of the franchise, writers Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn ("X-Men: First Class") lampoon style, which will always bear a greater longevity than mindless name-calling and spoofing in parodies. The key to the art of parody is in style and convention, which Goldman and Vaughn understand from the get-go. What results is an uproariously fun film that never runs out of energy and always provides something fresh in a currently overcrowded pool."Kingsman" wisely comes amidst a time where the superhero genre and the spy/espionage genre are in their primes, but never adhering too much to one particular side, creating a joyful hybrid rather than yet another project to get lost in a sea of others. In what looks to be a big year for the superhero/action genre, "Kingsman" provides those experiencing fatigue and dissatisfaction from the ubiquity of such projects with a pleasant sense of originality and style to their content that could've easily been just another example of muchness in a genre.The film is likely to play nicely, with generally little competition in the same vein and an obvious push with communities like Reddit and 4chan embracing the content for its simultaneous slickness and uniqueness. Moreover, the film plays nicely for people simply looking for a cinematic experience that appears to have a pulse after a month of general ho-hum and mediocre releases. There's an unabashed level of excitement the film bears during a time of unimpressive titles that will undoubtedly find ways to cheer up a crowd that has long been done a disservice so far this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. It is one of the best movies of the year. I was only disappointed once, and that was because the movie had ended. Highly recommend the movie, especially for those action movie lovers. Know I'm just going to sit here and try to hold back the tears. Yes I literally want to cry because the move is over, and it's been two hours already since I have seen it. The acting was phenomenal, and hilarious. Samuel L Jackson did an outstanding job! It was so good that it was so tempting to go back and buy another ticket just to watch it again. Only good words and thoughts come to mind when I think of this movie. There will be parts where you may cry, parts where you will defiantly laugh, and parts where you will anticipate, but it will all defiantly be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help but wonder if all the folks reviewing this movie saw the same film! The movie is based on a comic book, folks! This is a satire-spoof type movie of the 1970's spy movie/show genre. Think early Bond or the Man from U.N.C.L.E., but WAY over exaggerated, over acted, overly violent (but in a funny way), overly ridiculous &amp; overly implausible (ah, but is it?) BUT utterly great in its delivery. We and the audience around us laughed out loud throughout. Entertaining &amp; engaging characters. Samuel Jacksons lisp which many called distracting was part of the over acting. It's meant to be distracting. I know the church scene is what blows the violence level through the roof. But following the movie premise, it's kill or be killed. People complain about too much F bomb. We do not remember an overuse of the word. We walked out of the Wolf of Wall Street disgusted &amp; complaining about the 500+ F-bomb drops. We can't recall an instance of it being said in this movie. The movie will bring up discussions on micro chipping, cell phone technology and technology in general, and global warming, or lack there of, to a lesser degree. Yes, that is Mark Hamill playing Professor Arnold. Don't miss that fact until you see his name in the credits, like I did. Don't take the kids. Just go see it for what it is, funny &amp; enjoyable. And don't miss the 3 second long scene where you see Valentine with Obama in the window of the White House listening to him (Obama) speak. Sounds just like him too. Could it be...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First great movie of 2015</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The secret service is about Gary "Eggsy"(Taron Egerton) who is a teenager who's gets in a lot of trouble but when Harry Hart(Colin Firth) has the chance to recruit someone to be a kingsman and chooses Eggsy because he see potential. The Kingsman is a spy organization. First off, thank you Matthew Vaughn for making this movie. I haven't had this much fun in a theater since Guardians of the Galaxy. Let's start with the acting, not one person was bad. Colin Firth plays his role as a spy so well. Samuel L. Jackson was great as the villain. One of the best and funniest villains in the past few years. Everyone did great but the person who stole the show, was newcomer Taron Egerton. This was his first film and wow, he can act. Hope to see him in more movies. There some cameos that just makes the movie more special. The action was amazing, the way Matthew Vaughn handles each action scene, just makes you wanting more and more. This was the first spy movie to add a little bit of every other spy movie and make it great and different at the same time. It's James Bond meets Austin Powers.Overall Kingsman: the secret service is a crazy, fun spy movie, that everyone should check out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the weekend you are probably going to theater. And if you have a partner you are probably going to Fifty shades of Grey. Do yourselves a favor,go to this instead. Its a movie packed with action and humor,that is hard as Bond. Full of excitement and amazing fighting scenes,and it delivers lot of fun. Director Matthew Vaughn has made right choice when he decided to direct this movie,cause its even better than First Class. His directing was right at the spot. This movie sets a really high standard for movies in rest of the year,and is definitely worth watching by every film-lover. It deserved more attention than it got but i hope it will earn at box office since its spectacular. This might not be convincing enough,but its true that the movie is an amazing action movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Kick Ass of Spy Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I hadn't cared to much about this movie because their was no hype for it but then when I had seen the first trailer this looked like a great film. This is basically if Kick Ass and James Bond went splat because their is a lot of elements of those two movies in this one.For off lets start with the bad, well their isn't much except for in the beginning their British Accents are really thick so it is kind of hard to understand them, kind of like Bane in the Dark Knight Rises but otherwise it is a great movie.Now with the good parts first off the most important part of this movie, the humour and I have to say this is a really funny movie their were more then a few times when this movie had me laughing out loud.Also the characters are just great like the main character Eggsy played by Taron Edgerton is such a good character he is funny, smart and just well bad ass. Also it was so weird to see Samuel L. Jackson playing a villain but I have to say in this movie it really worked their were some scenes where was the funniest character. And yes Colin Firth's character was just bad ass in all kinds of ways.So overall Kingsman the Secret Service is a great movie and if you liked Kick Ass chances are you will like this movie so go see it.</fullReview>

A absolutely fantastic film that I highly recommend for you guys that like Tarantino's films or the Kick-ass movie. Samuel L. Jackson delivers a excellent performance as the lisping villain Mr. Valentine while Colin Firth plays his role as a charming gentleman spy so well that I often found myself asking why he does so many horrible romantic love movies. Those roles are obviously beneath him. The young guy(who's name has, for the moment, fled my mind)delivers an excellent performance and I do think that he has a bright future in front of him within the film industries. Great actors.

		<shortDescription>A great combination of action and comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman was originally a graphic novel by Mark Millar (the creator of Kick Ass) and Dave Gibbons. Having read the novel, it's a decent story, that is sort of a coming of age film combined with a James Bond-like setting. It's a decent novel, but in my opinion it is overshadowed by Millar's previous works. However, the movie takes his ideas to different levels, and in almost all aspects it outperforms the novel. The story is about a less fortunate 'lad' named Eggsy (Taron Egerton), who lives in a council flat after his father; a kingsman, is killed in action when he was a child. The movie centres around the spy world of the kingsman, Eggsy being trained to become a kingsman, and Samuel L Jackson's plot to 'save the world' by killing most of humanity, in what can only be described as a send up of our technological progress in the last 20 years. Colin Firth is the true star of the show however, displaying the class and mannerisms of the gentlemen that are the kingsman, while kicking some serious ass in some scenes, and making amusing jokes in others. The action you would expect in a spy movie is there in full force, some scenes are directed extremely well, combining a blend of blissful carnage while a blistering soundtrack plays overhead. The comedy is strong as well, while it may not be laugh out loud all the time, the film ticks along with a constant pace of puns and quips you would expect from this genre. The movie also pokes fun at the genre throughout the film, whether it by using sarcastic remarks, breaking the fourth wall or using Eggsy's working class background to undermine the gadgets and flair of the 'kingsman'. While the movie is great fun there were a few minor niggles that annoyed me. Obviously there are changes from the novel that change the story, but there are certain lines (one in particular involving a Swedish princess) that sometimes leave you almost cringing, and really felt out of place in the context of the movie. Overall, if you are looking for an action packed movie full of entertainment and surprise then this is really good fun movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epitomizes the Definition of the Term, "A Total Blast"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.4/5 starsStylish, subversive, and above all fun, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" finds Director Matthew Vaughn ("Kick-Ass", "X-Men: First Class") reinventing the rules of spy films with gleeful abandon. Yes it's completely bonkers, totally wacky, unabashedly over-the-top, and at times even indulgently campy, but it's also, downright, one of the most no-holds-barred, entertaining action-comedy romps you're bound experience in years. More importantly, it's a celebration of the fun-filled, lost art of political incorrectness.Based upon the acclaimed graphic novel by exalted comic book writer Mark Millar ("Kick-Ass") and illustrator Dave Gibbons, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius. Basically you need to imagine a Sean Connery James Bond movie with the potty dialect of "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" and the action from "The Raid" franchise. But there are numerous deviations from the source material - albeit of the extremely rare kind where the adaptation offers a refreshing take on your something you're already familiar with and immensely fond of - to the point where one could deduce that on day one of filming, the creators must have thrown away the moral compass and taken a group vow to splatter our sensibilities with stylish, gratuitous violence and one "wait, what...?" moment after another.At its heart, "Kingsman" is just as much a parody of James Bond and his spy genre cousins as the "Austin Powers" franchise. Admittedly, it's not a full-on spoof like "Austin Powers", but this action- comedy is very aware of the clichéd world in which it operates. Eventually, it's an entertaining, endearing, delightful ode to spy flicks from the 1960s - a rowdy, amusing romp - spoofing the James Bond concept of dapper gentlemen involved in international intrigue. Still though "Kingsman" is a loving homage to spy movies, it has just enough gravitas to stand as a memorable film in its own right.Much of the credit for this crackling adaptation from Millar's popular graphic novel goes to Director Matthew Vaughn, who, by now, has done more than enough to hold his own among the likes of Tarantino, Kurossawa, Spielberg, John McTiernan, and Eastwood as one of the best in the business when it comes to helming action movies. He keeps the action coming and astutely juggles numerous topics to deliver a vibrantly entertaining good time. Providing a sedate detour from the grizzly violence and insanely diabolical plot are the witty one- liners that range from eliciting chuckles to uproarious guffaws.Assisting Vaughn in delivering a seamlessly fun package is the top- notch cast. Oscar winners Firth and Caine add action star and sly backstabber to their resume with spirited aplomb. Firth's performance in particular is nothing short of a revelation; not in a million years one could've imagined that one day this serious, dramatic actor would clean house armed with nothing but his wit, charm, and a bulletproof umbrella. Jackson, clearly had a blast playing a megalomaniac, and camps it up in hilarious fashion. Newcomer Taron Egerton fares solidly as Eggsy, becoming the story's driving force, and evolves into a junior version of Firth, complete with tie, 1960s-style spectacles, and the aforementioned umbrella.This isn't for the politically correct or the faint of heart. But, if you're on its groovy, twisted wavelength, it's a stoned blast. A smarter spoof than "Austin Powers" devoid of the over-seriousness of the "Bond" movies, "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a stylishly assembled, crazy action-comedy, and a much-needed fresh take on spy movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman The Secret Service is a fantastic spy thriller that has a lot of heart and is very funny. The direction from Matthew Vaughn is dynamic, using steady and shaky cam as well as they possible can be used and not relying on 30 cuts every 5 seconds during the fights. The acting is great, from Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson to newcomer Taron Egerton and Vaughn regulars like Mark Strong and a nice smaller role from Mark Hamill, everyone is on their game and fits flawlessly into their roles. The story is smart, fun and easy to follow and the musical score fits to a T. All in all Kingsman is a great entertaining movie that has a little too much violence and language then needed, but other then that is a great ride of a movie. 4 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review http://youtu.be/d0fUozleeRU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review: Kingsman: The Secret Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon first glance, Kingsman: The Secret Service looks like an outdated, outlandish attempt to reinvigorate the action spy genre that saw Pierce Brosnan fail miserable as his final appearance as the famous spy-agent James Bond in The World is Not Enough. Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results. One of these aforementioned films that inhabited a reality based narrative structure was the recently re-envisioned X-Men film franchise, which was, ironically, reinvented by Matthew Vaughn in X-Men: First Class in 2011. The film, which took place in 1962, set around the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, showed just how much the comic book genre succeeded among audiences when introduced around real-world events.The amazing thing about Kingsman: The Secret Service, is that the same man who was responsible for breathing new, raw life into the X-Men franchise, after the disaster that Brett Ratnet's X-Men: The Last Stand was, is the same man that is bringing back the absolutely manic and outrageous spy-agent genre with a vengeance. Thankfully for everyone, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the action movie we have been waiting to see and the is the tremendously alternative to a highly unbelievable 007 movie that never came.Upon first view, I too was worried about the dynamics of Vaughn's newest Millar adaptation (Vaughn had already adapted Millar's Kick-Ass). Looking back at the trailers, the action looked silly; the players too clichéd in the world of agent-spy standards; and gimmicky thanks to the inclusion of adorable pugs and attractive cast members. Boy was I wrong!Kingsman is a highly calculated film romp that never takes itself too seriously, yet never lets go of its grip of highly entertaining action movie and escapism Hollywood fluff. To think that Vaughn could have potentially abandoned this project completely to make X-Men: Days of Future Past is sad. Thankfully, the highly visionary and confident filmmaker stuck to his guns, and delivers easily, one of the most entertaining films of 2015 thus far.Kingsman begins as any action movie should; with a girl. But this girl, is a recently widowed mother who surprisingly has a stranger visit her in the late night, to tell her that her husband, a Kingsman (unbestknown to her) was killed in the line of duty. The stranger, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), is unwelcome in the home, and focuses his energy to his partners newborn son, Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton), where he discloses to him that, if ever in the future he encounters any problems, the Kingsman are indebted to them forever thanks to the bravery of their patriarch.Flash forward a decade, and Eggsy is a troublesome youth, whose failed attempts in the marines, and trouble with the law finds his luck at the crap end, time and time again. It isn't until Eggsy, who in an act of defiance for his mother against her petty mafia boyfriend, finds himself in a police station, in deperate need of the Kingsmans help. After a quick phone call, that ends ambiguously, Eggsy is released of the police station and greeted by the same man who visited him and his mother upon the news of his father's death, Harry Hart. Luckily for Eggsy, Harry offers him a job interview, that could see him in the same line of work as his father, and could change his world forever thanks to an unexpected visit to a tailor shoppe.On the surface, Kingsman seems to be a neat and well dressed action film. Once cracked open, Kingsman is a rough, tough, cocky-filled fuel ride of adrenaline, bad manners and tailored attitude that puts James Bond and company to shame.Vaughn, whose decision to keep the material in his native English tongue, complete with attitude-filled cockney accents and strong British accents, breaths new life to the very apocalyptic world take over plans of the film's villain, and easily the best and most iconic villain of 2015, Richmond Valentine, played with such bravado and vigour by the astonishing Samuel L. Jackson. I know what your thinking. How in the hell can Jackson, whose playing a villain with a bad and wholly unnecessary lisp, offer any bravado and vigour to a role that is more comical than anything? My answer to you, is that you just watch the film and see for yourself. In addition to being one of the best aspect of Kingsman along with his highly inventive and wholly contemporary scheme to rid the virus known as mankind, Valentine, as well as the film itself, is a highly meticulous and thought-out tongue and cheek ode to the many iconic and memorable films and film villains of the early 70's and 80's. One of the best dialogues in the film, when Valentine and Hart meet for the first time, and indulge in some fine, wholly signature American cuisine, the two discuss, each of their displeased thoughts with the current state of spy, action movies. "A spy movie is only as good as its villain", says Valentine, in which Hart agrees formidable. I can only imagine how big of a grin screenwriters Jane Goldman and Vaughn himself had penning the script to this film with that notion in mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where after the it ends you will say, that was 2 hours well spent. Action begins from the go, and it is very realistic or at least they have made it look realistic on the screen, unlike some other similar movies, there is no flying or gravity defying moves here, its more of a close combat and that really intrigued me. Precision perfect stunts and amazing cinematography with a touch of humor will definitely make you come alive. The characters in the movie are really appealing, A notable candidate would be the super villain, calm,humorous and villainous all at the same time, loved his character. Even though the movie is action packed, it comes with a good story, a very good one in fact, so the bottom line is, this is a Great Movie and worth your time !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually intrigued by this movie. A spy movie with action and comedy... I love those types of movies. The beginning started out good. I actually liked this movie until... ALL THE KILLING! Don't get me wrong. I'm not one of those anti-killing people movie type person. My problem with this movie is that the killing distracted me from the story... (the story lol) Especially the fireworks scene in the movie. Yes the special effects were cool in all, but come on, fireworks? When you're gonna kill a bunch of people, you turn it into a fireworks show. That part completely ruined it for me. Onto the story... I got the basic plot of the story, but once again, the killing kept distracting me away from the story! In conclusion, the movie had A LOT of potential, but did not live up to my expectations. I do have the admit, cinematography was actually pretty decent compared to the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsmen: The Secret Service is a fantastic send up to old fashioned spy thrillers that truly kicks butt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time that my dad tuned the channel to BBC, he shut off the TV, claiming that the Brit mentality had tired him out in less then five minutes. My poor father, as I'm a big fan of British television, especially of comedies like Mr. Bean and Blackadder. It might be for the funny accent as I found their sound very fancy, but it may also be for the mindset on how they process ideas. With Doctor Who and The Avengers (not the Marvel heroes, but a spy series). I've always seen their thinking as more out of the box and oddball. Who else but the British would have come up with something like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. One of their most well known properties are the 007 spy movies. They too had that British set up as we had a super human that had a lot of strange gadgets, cool vehicles, and an actor that can both kick butt and be very suave. The course of the films have gone from being realistic to almost science fiction-like. This had put fans at a crossroads of where something like Skyfall would fall. For those that want a return to the more outrageous should come to Kingsmen: The Secret Service. While on a mission in the Middle East, secret agent Harry Hart (played by Colin Firth) witness a fellow agent killed by enemies. He visits that family back in London where he gives a young boy a medal that has a phone number to call should he need help. We cut to years later as the boy has grown into Eggsy Unwin (played by Taron Egerton), an unemployed youth whose intelligent was once training in the royal marines. He's arrested for steeling a car and finally takes up the phone number to see what happens. Eggsy get's released from jail, as paid for by Harry. With a vacant slot open, Eggsy is recruited to apply to join. He sees what Harry is capable of when he fends off a set of drunken ruffians with his fighting skills and an umbrella with gadgets. Eggsy meets up with the other possible candidates while Harry investigates billionaire Richmond Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson) with the too good to be true free cell phones and Wi-Fi he's giving away. Eggsy meets up with the head of the agency, "Merlin" (played by Michael Caine) but fails his next test, sending him home. But when something goes wrong and Valentine may be looking to take over the world, Eggsy may be needed to be a kingsmen after all. Kingsmen: The Secret Service made me realize that it's been a while since I've seen a spy film like this; one that totally embraces the tuxedos and fine taste along with the high tech weapons and machines. The Bourne series was a more realistic spy movie and the 007 movies still have the strangeness, but relies on being more of a blend of the old and new ideas. Kingsmen: The Secret Service is more of a comedy-action movie then anything. Oh there are some action scenes (some really good ones!), but I was surprised with how much fun I had with the spy sequences and the witty banter. Colin Firth is one actor I would have never pictured as an action hero, but I now see that no one else could have played this guy as well as he did. Samuel L. Jackson is great as always, really loving his role as the villain. Newcomer Taron Egerton is a force as he had movies like Bond and a sassy mouth that could also lead him to be a comic star. He could go wither direction.I'll give this ten umbrella guns out of ten. The Kingsmen: The Secret Service is another British creation that I hope both strikes a cord with American audiences and sparks a series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingvaughn: The Kingsvaughn: The Director Brings a Quality Action Film and Makes Colin Firth an Action Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young Critic 2/18/2015 It's nice to have these kinds of surprises in the winter season of rubbish. Along with Paddington, the wide release of American Sniper, and now the surprising and bold Kingsman: The Secret Service it's turning out to be a good winter season. Going in to see Kingsman, I expected the typical action-spy thriller with the high stakes, stunts, and evil villain, but I wasn't expecting an artistically directed film with a perfect contemporary plot and courageously pushed comedy. Director Matthew Vaughn did it yet again with the help of veteran and rookie actors who pushed out of their comfort zones.Kingsman is adapted from a comic series that was first published in 2011. The premise of the film is that of a young English troublemaker named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who is recruited by a Kingsman agent named Galahad (Colin Firth). The Kingsman service is basically a continuation of King Arthur's knights. They are an organization more secret and discreet than MI6, and their work goes largely unrewarded (Galahad's office is covered with the front pages of newspapers the day after all his successful missions). Eggsy is tested and evaluated along with other recruits to fill a vacant spot of a murdered Kingsman. As Eggsy trains we find out that the assassination of the Kingsman agent is Silicon Valley billionaire Valentine's (Samuel L. Jackson) fault. Valentine has an evil plan that actually ends up being less absurd and is worrying for most of the audience; it plays around with our ubiquitous smart phone usage and with the climate change problem. Valentine's plan (if you don't mind my revealing it) is that through his phone products he can trigger a violent and uncontrolled part of the human brain that would cause an unfiltered surge of violence. This evil plan would cause death and bloodshed, but it would also get rid of the problem of overpopulation, global warming, and even extinction animal species. As Valentine says: "Humans are like a virus. When you get a virus your body heats up, trying to kill the virus, and that's what the earth is doing." The smart line made me think of global warming in a way I hadn't before. Now of course I'm not defending or rooting for Valentine and his plan at all, I would much rather cheer for an awesome fighting Colin Firth.The genius of this film comes from director Matthew Vaughn. His film resume includes Kick- Ass and X-Men: First Class, both really good films that also stood out from other action films for their boldness and originality. I admire Vaughn for being so risky with his films; in Kick-Ass he went on to mock the very genre that was becoming the highest grossing and most popular genre in the world. With First Class, he retook the decayed ­X-Men franchise (and a superhero film) and revived it by unerringly replacing the whole cast, making it a prequel, and mixing the historical, dramatic, and comedic genres. With Kingsman he avoids falling into the standard clichés, by riskily conducting his action sequences (one is a huge massacre in a church, another depicts a woman tearing down a door wanting to murder a child, exploding heads at a cocktail party that turn into fireworks) and he doesn't shy away from adult humor (usually coated or avoided by action films that want to play it "safe"). His touches of auteur-ship are seen and faintly remind us of Tarantino with scenes such as the exploding heads one, which is tuned to "Pomp and Circumstance," or with the snappy and extremely smart dialogues that seem out of place, but ground the characters' humanity. But the greatest feat of all is that Vaughn avoids being predictable, some important characters die, which you don't expect at all and there are some unseen betrayals. These surprises make us be on the edge of our seat, actually fearful for the stakes of our characters.But having a great director only takes you so far; the spectacular cast was a big factor in attracting an audience and keeping their rapt attention. The star of the marketing campaign for the film was Colin Firth, but you would never expect Colin Firth to be an action star. Firth was known for his gentlemanlike roles in all his films from Love Actually to Pride and Prejudice and even in The King's Speech. In Kingsman he plays a badass secret agent, but nevertheless the role is suited for him (that's meant to be a pun). The Kingsman service is unique in that their agents dress in expensive suits and carry umbrellas, heavy rimmed glasses, and gold watches and rings. Firth fits perfectly into this agency, it was almost made for him. He succeeds not only by pulling his own stunts, but also by maintaining a cold and straight face throughout the entire film, smirking once or twice after some awesome stunt or another. If I may be so bold it was the first time that we've seen the wide range of Firth's abilities, he had been enclosed previously to one type of character. We also have the more than worthy Taron Egerton, who plays the lead role and whose transformation from London lowlife to gentleman agent is extremely smooth. I hope to see more of him, be it in future Kingsman films or in other films. Finally, we have very notable contributions from supporting actors: Michael Cane and Mark Strong, who both are Kingsmen in the film. And of course we have Samuel L. Jackson, having the time of his life playing a villain with a lisp and cackling evilly.The great chemistry in the cast along with the spectacular and bold directing from Matthew Vaughn make this a needed tribute to the 007 films that at the same time spawn a quality and enjoyable franchise.

		<shortDescription>An Excellent and Over the top Spy Spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman is a movie that will either make you cry laughing and have your eyes peeled to the screen for every second, or it will offend and disgust you. For me, it was the first option. This movie was delightful and over the top in every sense, yet self aware. This self-awareness is what made the movie really shine for me because it played off of that a lot and created very clever jokes. As for more specifics, the villain, played by Samuel L. Jackson was hysterical and a clear homage to classic spy movies. The choreography for the actions scenes is flawless and the contrast between dialog and action gives the movie a perfect pace. Overall, Kingsman is one of the best movies of the year thus far and I look forward to what Matthew Vaughn has to offer going ahead.</fullReview>

There was sounds of appreciation during the movie from the viewers and certainly much clapping at the end (and sorry, this may be a spoiler bit, when Obama's head exploded) All good fun, don't take it too seriously however, and it was certainly poking fun at Britishness and previous films, but in a fun way. No one I spoke too had a bad word for it, it was well paced and kept you involved. All the cast were good, but Samuel L Jackson was terrific. Although a certain resemblance to Bond movies, it made it's own distinctive style. I am guessing there will be a follow up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: The Secret Blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've got to admit that this movie looks like a combo of Bond, Johnny English, and Austin Powers and this is the result. But the film however is flawless in almost every sense; good action and cast, plot was realistic, and some pretty dramatic twists that you couldn't see coming. The action is solid and entertaining to say the least, weather it be Colin Firth (Galahad) beating up thugs on his own and not breaking a sweat or Galahad just straight-up massacring a church full of Valentine's followers. The only downside to the action scenes is the obvious use of green-screen and CGI for the loss of limbs or fast punching, but that is very minor complaint compared to how well directed this film is. Also, the cast was well chosen. Sam L Jackson nails (basically) himself as a evil businessmen and Michael Caine and Colin Firth completes the classiness needed in order to be a Kingsman. The plot was great because it felt like a realistic for a comic-book movie. Finally, the 2 twists really make the you sympathize with the characters: when Valentine kills Galahad, you feel for Valentine when he says killing people is wrong or when it is revealed that Arthur joined Valentine, you see how people can be easily corrupted. Final thing, the end-credit scene is top notch. It shows Eggsy getting revenge on his mom's deadbeat boyfriend and his goons. This final scene really shows how Eggsy has evolved from being a British punk to being a well educated Kingsman.All in all, I would say this movie will get a sequel and is slightly better than Bond (just Skyfall). I really want to see if SPECTRE can beat my expectations and raise the bar even further than Kingsman has done. Take care, bye-bye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Bond on Steroids Equals a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie surprised me in every way. I expected a decent action movie, instead I get a masterpiece of a movie that manages to execute its plot fantastically.Today so many movies have a long beginning, introducing us to the characters and the plot, but it get's boring as nothing really happens, and so the result is just an exciting last half. Kingsman: The Secret Service however does not make you wait and begins the movie on a BANG!Another thing movies tries is to have several plot lines at the same time, but it gets confusing, and they loose the audience. Kingsman, on the other hand executes this perfectly. Every plot line has a beginning, climax and a satisfying end. So what is it that makes Kingsman execute everything so nicely? First of all a great cast. Colin Firth proves that he can play an action role, and performs excellent. He does his character so well its worthy of lots of awards. The rest of the cast, even the ones appearing for just a short period of time does nothing else but make the movie shine. Second reason is the perfect action scenes. I thought I had seen well executed action scenes, but Kingsman takes it to another level. The reason for this is use of the camera, and the pure brutality. Every move, every punch, and gunshot was so satisfying it makes you begging for more, and they deliver. But Kingsman also knows how to balance the movie, and when the movie is not hardcore action scenes it manages to stay bad-ass by having lots of humorous scenes, and exciting interactions. The plot line, twists and buildup is perfect. And just as the conversations and buildup would get boring in any other movie they perfectly time it and go back to action.Lots of movies have good action, or good plot lines, but no movie has ever executed it as well as Kingsman: The Secret Service. This movie is a must watch, and should be bought on blue-ray!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for Kingsman as soon as i saw the trailer, it gripped me in and definitely sold it to me. When i watched the film earlier i surprised myself, there was much more to it than meets the eye. The story was strong throughout the film and it continued to excite me. This film was truly exhilarating, it kept me on the edge of my seat and it did not fail to please me with the full hardcore action sequences which took place. However being an explosive film it also came with a side of comedy which worked very well and i could not stop laughing! Overall a great film and 100% recommended for a film to watch this year! Don't miss out on the fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was funny and action packed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a British secret agent film that calls back to the old spy films, especially the James Bond series of films. There is a lot of fun to be had in this film. The acting is great all around, even the small characters that only have a minute or so of screen time are up to par. In terms of the plot there are very few issue I had with it. The training segment was cool but there was almost no training shown on screen, just tests that took place between the training. This made it kind of jarring to see a people gain tremendous skill so fast. The music is fun and fits extremely well into the fun, over the top action scenes. This whole movie is very self-aware about how over the top it is. There are many times in the story where characters will reference old spy movies and bring up how clichéd their current situations are. The dialogue is very witty so most conversations are very interesting to listen to. There are many interesting and unique characters that I loved watching interact with each other. Some of the accents can be a little thick so I may take a little time to get used to. The action is not to be taken seriously. If you've seen the trailer you know what I am talking about. People will be hit in the face and flip a couple of times before hitting the ground. This is definitely a positive; the film definitely gained a lot from that. The villain's motivation is kind of dumb, but you can get into it because of the self-awareness of the movie. The action scenes are phenomenal. While they can be a little shaky, you can definitely see the immense skill that went into them. The editing of the action is very original and blew my mind. Be warned that this movie definitely earned that R rating. This is the source one of two real negatives with the movie. The language is just filthy but does not feel like it had to be. I am perfectly fine with some F words during action scenes. I'm sure that if I was fighting for my life I would curse, too. The problem is that people cursed constantly, even if it wasn't necessary. It didn't feel natural when people would curse about small, irrelevant things. If you want an example of a movie that utilizes cursing is a realistic way, then watch the movie Chef, or V for Vendetta. I typically don't care too much about this but there was so much cursing in inappropriate places that it began to bother me. The gore on the other hand was fine. Yes, it was pretty gross and shocking, but the film did it rarely enough and never lingered on it for long enough to really bother me. There was a very unnecessary (and very brief) nudity scene at the tail end of the film designed to be funny, but just came of as awkward. My final complaint is rather small but there is one product placement for McDonalds that was so obvious and in your face that it took me out of the scene for a while. Be sure to stay for about minute after the credits roll because there is a little scene that concludes a somewhat important arc.</fullReview>

This movie is about the British class system and how even poor people are worthy to become pawns in some meaningless struggle between global economies. Also, a lady offers anal-sex as an incentive for her rescue from imprisonment. Cause that's what women so often do, in real life. There are so many other choices to offer than anal sex right off the bat, a hand-job, a blow-job, just regular old vaginal sex, when did vaginal sex become not good enough? Is this a new thing? I mean you are just giving away the keys to the kingdom to like the first dude that comes along, does that sound prudent to you?

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailers had me anticipating something like early James Bond as a Super Hero. This movie made the Characters look like Jokes. The obviously 'sped up' fight scenes looked stupid and (OMG) Samuel Jackson looked Ridiculous dressed like a Skater Punk. Besides the fact that it was Totally Outside the 'Atmosphere' that the movie was supposedly creating it is just Sad for Samuel Jackson. I get why the studios might want to hide the fact that he is almost 70 and looks more like 90 these days. Sean Connery had the good sense to age gracefully instead of foolishly and Jackson or his handlers should try that. Other than that what I can tell you about the movie without 'Spoilers is Limited' - It is an action movie that I suppose is about as good as most in the Genre; but it could have been more. It seemed to be an attempt to create a new 'Mythical Hero' in the Kingsman and I believe that was a failure. It was unclear Why these people existed as Chaos and Death seemed even more likely with them than without them. Kingsman is a Poor Myth because it does not seem to have any purpose other than its own glorification. That's Hollywood I guess; but I hoped for more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret Service is a film that is far better than it has any right to be. What could of been a by-the-numbers parody of the recent Mission: Impossible, Bourne trilogy and Daniel Craig Bond flicks, though each of those respective franchises are great in their own right, is in fact something truly special. Kingsman gave me the same feeling as last year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy' unpretentious, well directed and fun yet clever. Kingsman works on a number of different levels that make it a joy to behold. For one, it's an intriguing premise. A young boy living on a council estate in London is recruited to join a secret intelligence service working to preserve peace and order in the world and from there, must face a deadly megalomaniac who is intent on bringing about a new world order.For one, Kingsman is flawless in it's acting, Taron Egerton is sure for high heights, Colin Firth embodies the brilliance of Roger Moore's Bond but gives a far more lethal edge. While Mark Strong, Samuel L Jackson and Micheal Caine all shine in each of their respective roles.The film is also incredibly slick, the design on the film from the fact all of the Kingsman wear suits to the nostalgia fantastical plot is all a homage of sorts and yet Kingsman is profoundly original in a sense, it blends humour with a plot that is intelligently self aware all the while will still make you actually care for the characters and has enough curve-balls to make this seemingly predictable romp be far smarter than you were expecting.The music is great, a fight scene to 'give it up' by KC and the Sunshine band was a highlight for me and while the CGI isn't the big Hollywood Blockbuster standard, it still has that visceral punch to it that makes it a beautifully aesthetic and 70s feel to it.Whilst it's violence, though shockingly brutal is just stunning. Never before have I seen an action scene that is so well shot and paced and disturbingly amazing! If you have seen the film, I am sure you know what I'm talking about.It's a controversial film, that wears it proudly on it's sleeve, it's not afraid to offend and is something that many films lack the bravado to do so. It is also incredibly funny, with some great lines and still has some heart and emotion at it's center with a fantastically British flair.Kingsman is one of the best films I have seen in a long time, whilst Award season is currently progressing, with films that only possess depth or tackle big themes and overly convoluted, complex characters only being nominated. It's so refreshing that a film that is at it's core: fun whilst still being great is finally bursting into Cinemas. This is one of the rare films that I do hope is successful in order to warrant a sequel, if not, then it'll be a shame but what Matthew Vaughn and his creative team have done, is made a film that I will watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 9 until the last 20 minutes of the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so utterly disgusted with one scene that it compelled me to write this review, my first one...ever. Okay so to begin with, I thoroughly enjoyed the film (prior to the last 20 mins). It was highly entertaining, humorous in bits and the lead actor did an amazing job. I did feel however that due to the amount of foul language and over the top violence in one particular scene at a church that it lost one point. This movie would've made it on my top rated list so you're probably wondering what was so terrible that it completely ruined the movie for me. So let me tell you...Now, bear in mind that I am a woman in my mid 30's and not conservative by all means but there is a scene in the movie where Eggsy (the main character) is propositioned by an imprisoned princess. What is so wrong with that you ask? Nothing...had she not offered her "a..hole" in exchange for him saving the world. WHY?!! it completely took me off guard and cheapened the entire film. It was completely unnecessary and utterly distasteful! Such a shame because it was such a great film too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst mainstream movies I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge fan of blockbusters. So maybe I am not the target audience of this movie but I do enjoy them from time to time. But this movie was a huge disappointment and frankly it was one of the worst mainstream movies I have seen in cinemas. Granted I have not seen many movies in cinemas in recent years. It reminded me of another movie which I consider as one of my least favourite movies, Wanted. To be honest, there are many elements of that movie that have been used in this movie and frankly it seemed like a partial remake of that one.The first problem was maybe Colin firth. I thought he was so incredibly miscast. It seemed awkward to see him do the church fight and the fight with the thugs. He was saying such corny annoying lines which would not seem out of place in one of those Bollywood movies where the hero is all powerful. Even in comparison, those movies at least seem more original. Many of the characters reminded me of many older movies. The same old "rough kid being trained to fight" story has been done over and over again. The whole banter between the posh guys and Eggsy is cringeworthy. The lead actor who played the role of Eggsy has zero presence and is pretty much forgettable. He really doesn't have the look for such a role.I guess also this movie was mostly supposed to be funny. But most of the humor elements fall absolutely flat. What was the point of the head explosions? That was absolutely the worst scene that I have seen in cinemas in recent years. I expected something much more substantial and believable but that really disappointed me. The church fight was also stupid and meaningless. Just meaningless violence but without the beauty of John woo or even movies like the Matrix. The whole movie is so cynically geared to getting a reaction from teenage boys. I am just surprised that there was no eye candy pretty much throughout the movie. Sure there were women but there are no suggestive sexual scenes (maybe that last one in the end). And another thing that I disliked was the use of classic rock music like Freebird. It seemed like an insult to this song to be associated with such tripe.Now lastly, the presence of Samuel Jackson didn't really elevate the movie much. He does better than the other actors. But as far as I can remember he doesn't really have many memorable lines or scenes in this movie. But I am thankful he is involved in the movie since that made it a little bearable for me and I was able to finish it. There are just too much unbelievable fight scenes and ridiculous things like head explosions (which have been done more realistically by Tom savini in low budget 80s movies), church fights and so on. I know my rating is a little harsh since Samuel jackson is not so bad but I am just rating as far as my personal experience is concerned.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matthew Vaughn has made yet another amazing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My brother had told me about this a month or two before it was to come out and I watched the trailer and found myself really looking forward to the film. I love action films and the fact that my brother had described it as "Alex Rider but better" set my hopes pretty high and I was not disappointed. Matthew Vaughn is a great director and it is an unspoken rule in my house that if "Stardust" is on TV, we must watch it and I also loved "Kick Ass". This film had the slight gore of the latter, which is fine by me since I've always watched films like that, and the characters and aspects that don't turn out to be how they look on the surface. In my opinion, the perfect balance has been achieved between comedy, violence, action and even tragedy/seriousness. The actors used are amazing in their parts and it is a star studded cast of Michael Cain, Colin Firth, Samuel L. Jackson and Mark Strong but I think that Taron Egerton gives an amazing film debut performance.I've read some reviews where it has been described as "laddish" and brash but what else can you expect from a 15 rated spy film based on teenager from South London? In fact, Eggsy's contrast to the typical gentleman spy is what makes this film so good. We need more films that are like this one and push boundaries on the genres that we are used to.I came out of the cinema desperate to talk about it with my friends but none of them have seen it so I will have to think about how good it is by myself. It is also the first film that I have come out of cinema desperate to actually buy a copy of the film.</fullReview>

It was if the movie was written for specific fight scenes and then pieced together in a rush. Recommend as a rental, but even then it should be low on the list.The others I went with had similar opinions (with only the argument of which was worse this or Jupiter Ascending). Having only seen this one, I am rating it a 4 because of the decent acting, cool villain, and good score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this was a really nice movie! It started off as a really really serious movie with spies and everything and as it evolved, it also incorporated some humor along the way. It felt at sometimes as a movie that is targeted to teens, you know, the ones that are usually aired around lunch time on weekends. Overall it was this kind of a movie for me but one with a bit more realistic effects and nicer performances as far as the cast is concerned. It would be a 6 out of 10 for me but Colin Firth kind of saved it for me. I don't know why on earth he would do such a movie but then again, Piers Brosnan did the other one with the Greek gods (Persi or sth). Overall it was a nice feeling watching the movie but it's certainly one of those movies that you know that the trailer is as good as it gets and no matter what's in it, you won't be amazed by it. Especially some of the director's findings in the end, as well as the way he portrayed some of the killings in the end were not for my taste. Watch it if you have some time while you're eating your lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing more, nothing less. Don't pay a cent to go to the movie theatre for this one. Not worth it, definitely not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>6.5 - Entertaining &amp; OK Type - 007+KillBill +SpyKids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After I saw the rating of 8.1 and various comments, thought that this movie would be extraordinarily good. Period. My own perception of the movie was it was like one of the "Old" James Bond movies and then and here and there it became like "Kill Bill" but since actions involved gadgets - it resembled spy kids too. It's an entertaining movie - definitely. Many of the actions were unbelievably over the top. Villainy was not exactly fearsome. Some of the actions were kiddies type and some were of Kill-Bill type. Last few scenes where they alter satellites were all of "Spy Kids" type and childish. Also the movie lacked depth in gadget showcasing. Controlling satellites and then showing percentage etc...were all like a TV discovery show. But do not get me wrong , the movie is largely entertaining...but the some versions of Spy Kids were also entertaining but kiddies' type. This is definitely not a "Kick Ass" type movie - which was a different class altogether. The similarity lies in "all crazy stuffs and actions happening.." That is all. But all these apart , "Colin Firth" was very good and even better than "Taron Egerton". In fact I felt , he is probably a better replacement to the old 007 legacy - "Roger Moore or Sean Connery "Can suggest watching once. You do not need any brain to watch this movie - just let it flow and relax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So imagine for a moment if you will, that Quentin Tarantino took on a James Bond movie. Yep, that about sums it up. From sword legs to brain splatters! Unrealistic? Of course! Vulgar? Most definitely. Crude? Only always. Ludicrous? You bet. From the random sarcastic comments to the gory fight scenes, this movie pretty much has it all. Hot chicks, hot dudes, blood, humor, etc. Wouldn't recommend taking a small child but an almost adult, say 17 or so could handle it. It was worth the arm and leg theaters cost these days. But seriously, if you are not a fan of Quentin Tarantino movies due to his graphic nature or your just plain sensitive i suggest you find something else to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman Secret Service: Could Have Been So Much Better -Lack of Diversity in Casting Regarding Certain Roles Seems Almost Racist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, the movie was somewhat entertaining but not great. You could see that the producers tried really hard to create a good product and they succeeded to some extent. I would give this movie a rating of 7 out of 10, no higher.In my opinion the major problems could have been easily fixed and instead of being an OK movie, it could have been a great movie. (It's the difference between getting a C+ or B- on your report card versus getting an A- or an 'A'.A 'C+' represents the low grade mediocrity and a 'B-' the high grade mediocrity. These producers tried really hard and it showed, so I would give them a 'B-'.The major problems with the movie were as follows: (1) The casting undermined one of the major themes; (2) insufficient dramatic elements or scenes to counterbalance the comedy; (3) the movie had no soul.THE CASTING UNDERMINED THE THEME One of the major themes in the movie is the privileged vs the unprivileged or the high class vs those with no class or those who are given special opportunities in life vs those who are not. This being the case, the casting should have included at least a few young attractive visible minorities who were given the opportunity to compete for the position of the new Kingsman. But no, in the movie all of those given the opportunity to become Kingsmen are white and all of the existing Kingsmen are white. So in spite of the privileged vs unprivileged theme, what the movie ends up teaching us is that there is a privileged class and the privileged class remains today and that in order to be part of that privileged class, one has to be white. I don't think that this is the message that the producers intended to send to the audience, yet nevertheless this is the message that they sent. (When producers dabble in tokenism, when they fail to even attempt to reflect the diversity of the world around them, the unintended consequences can include sending such messages to the audience.)It would have been so easy to introduce a few visible minority Kingsmen both at the older level and at the new recruit/ candidate level.INSUFFICIENT DRAMA TO BALANCE THE COMEDY The movie has a light feel to it. It is heavy on comedy, yet there is very little drama. The movie does not take itself seriously. So the audience will not take it seriously. Without some dramatic elements, the movie seems unbalanced. Unlike the movie RED, which was a pure farce of the spy movie genre and quite funny, this movie Kingsman is not a pure farce, so it requires the audience to buy in at some point. The movie fails to anchor itself with even one or two dramatic moments, which would help to change a C+/B- movie to an A-/A movie.THE MOVIE HAD NO SOUL For me a movie has a soul when I actually really care what happens to the main characters and I have made an emotional investment in the movie. If a movie has a soul I will be anxious to see the sequel.This movie had no soul. It undermined one of its most important themes -the privileged vs the unprivileged- by showing no diversity in either the existing Kingsmen or the candidates/ new recruits. When a movie so blatantly undermines such an important theme, it's hard for me to care what happens to the main characters. Like I said above, one of the messages that this movie sent to the audience was: if your are white you can be part of some of the most privileged clubs in society; if you are not white you are not permitted to apply.The movie never anchored itself with even one or two dramatic moments that would make me care one way or the other about the main characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not Amazing. It's just Not Bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw the trailers for Kingsman The Secret Service, I thought it would be a holy new take on the spy genre. A bloody, destructive and funny new film. But unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The film is another Traditional Spy film with a bit more blood and a bit more swearing. But it does good at what it does. The whole film revolves around a kid with a ridiculous name. Eggsy. YES. But I'll call him Gary because that is his real name. He is chosen by Harry Hart or Galahad from Kingsman. A spy organization that is on the verge of being discovered by a internet billionaire who is almost child like, Valentine, who is planning on giving out free SD cards that will give you free calls and internet forever. But it turns out that the whole thing is just a mass murdering machine that will turn everyone into bloody destructive hating killers. The film as a whole is traditional and doesn't add anything new to the genre. It's your simple spy movie about a villain who wants destruction. The Comics are by Mark Miller. A guy who created the comic Kick-Ass. So when I watched it, I expected it to be very bloody and gory. But instead, it's bloody. But I feel that It could have been gorier which could have made this film a lot more fun. I'll just say it without spoilers. The three main actors, well... lets just say something bad happens to all of them. Samuel L. Jackson's Valentine is a good villain. He acts like a child who can't stand the sight of blood. Michael Caine and Colin Firth have some great things to do in this movie and its fun to see Firth kill like 40 people in a white supremacist church.I can't really say much because I expected it to be this groundbreaking new spy film that would become a classic. But unfortunately, this doesn't go on classic levels. It is a huge crowd pleaser though, and will entertain many fans of the genre. 75/100 B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven at times, but it shows a lot of potential for a future franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."Kingsman is director Matthew Vaughn's fifth feature film and there was a lot of speculation over this movie considering he had chosen to direct this over the sequel to his highly successful X-Men First Class. He was also in talks to direct the new Star Wars franchise, but Vaughn wanted to adapt Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons' comic book "The Secret Service" instead. A comic book I had never heard of, but Vaughn's dedication to the material is inspired by his love for the old James Bond films, and this adaptation plays out as a love letter to those former movies with fascinating villains and a far fetched plot. Kingsman is rich in style and the film is beautifully directed by Vaughn who has always proved his abilities behind the camera. His 2004 debut, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig might actually be the reason why he has now become the new James Bond. Vaughn, who had produced some of Guy Ritchie's films, was heavily influenced by him in that first film, but he has established himself now with his own personal style. My favorite film from Vaughn is still Kick-Ass which felt fresh when it first came out and established itself as a refreshing parody of super hero films. My expectations for Kingsman grew when I heard that this comic book adaptation was written by the same person who wrote the Kick-Ass comic because I was a huge fan of that film. However, the idea didn't feel as fresh this time and I had some issues with a couple of violent scenes that took me out of the movie. Kingsman does do to spy movies what Kick-Ass did to super hero movies, but if you saw that film you could expect some of the dark turns and twists that were going to come here. It is very similar in style and some of the characters go through the same fate but it is still fun and entertaining. Kingsman centers on a British spy organization run by Arthur (Michael Caine) that is trying to stop a global threat from a billionaire tech innovator named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). When one of the spies dies during a mission, the agency decides to recruit a new one. Each one of the spies chooses a young candidate and Harry Hart (Colin Firth) puts his eyes on a street kid named Eggsy (Taron Egerton) who shows a lot of promise. The recruits have to go through an intense program under the guidance of their instructor Merlin (Mark Strong). Meanwhile Harry continues to investigate Valentine and try to discover what he is up to as several celebrities and government officials begin to disappear.The film felt bipolar at times. There are incredibly fun action sequences that are directed very well by Vaughn, but at the same time there are some disturbing violent scenes that take place in a church. The violence is cartoonish, but there are instances where it does feel out of place. I don't know why some of those scenes took me out of the movie because Vaughn is just having fun with the action scenes, but they just felt out of place. The things that did work best for me in Kingsman are the strong performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth who play off each other extremely well. The scenes they share together are wonderful and their self referential movie talk is hilarious. Valentine has a lisp which reminds us of some of the physical dysfunctions that the early villains from the Bond franchise had. Vaughn introduces small elements like this as he pays homage to some of those entertaining films. Newcomer, Taron Egerton, also delivers the good as this young street smart kid who is learning the ways of becoming a gentlemen. His scenes with Firth are another highlight of the film. Perhaps the most entertaining thing about Kingsman is the recruiting process the kids have to go through. One of the other potential candidates is Roxy who is played very well by Sophie Cookson. She shares excellent chemistry with Egerton. Mark Strong might be my favorite character in this film and he also gets plenty of screen time. Sofia Boutella also delivers a memorable role as one of Valentine's sidekicks. Kingsman is highly entertaining and has many positive things going for it, but there are a couple of disturbing scenes that felt out of place. Despite this, Vaughn is still five for five and a director I will continue to look forward to.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night, I wouldn't say that it is a great movie by any means but it is one of those fun spy movies like Austin powers, It needs better jokes like Austin Powers but it was fun to watch all the action in the movie. One part that could changed is the exploding heads at the end of the movie, very weird.I have always loved the old British spy movies like James Bond and Sherlock Holmes. This is kind off a funny versions of one of those. It has some gory scene to keep the audience interested and it is very funny to see Samuel L. Jackson with a lisp. I do with there could have been a hot girl to save like there is in the Bond movies, they tried to sneak a girl in at the end of the move but it was too weak and too late for me. If you have nothing better to do go see this movie. Right now the movies coming out are weak and the weather is cold so you might as well go see it.</fullReview>

I would not give it such a high grade, may be 7 out of 10 is more appropriate.The problem being that I saw so many films like this before, spy thrillers/comedies. I have to say this one brings in refreshment as far as the plot goes. It is very well thought out plot with very cool and sexy ending ;) Acting is excellent. I really liked all the actors who participated and they mostly did an excellent job.What I did not like was too many aristocratic sets, with leather chairs, fireplaces etc. Too much out of time and date. Times have changed. Somehow it does not fit in the modern world.All in all if you want to watch a fun film with action and comedy this is a film for you. Otherwise if you are not into James Bond films, you might skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than fun, thrilling, and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, while it may have its flaws, is a great movie worth watching for thrill and excitement. To begin with its flaws, the movie at times seems a bit choppy and some scenes seem as if they're just placed chronologically for the single purpose of exposition and expanding on the plot. In addition, a few key characters aren't developed as well as I think that they could have been. One final flaw is in a few scenes, it was slightly noticeable that green screen technology had been used, since you'd be able to notice how the background and the characters aren't quite in the same shot. But that's it for the biggest flaws.As for its pros, the movie as I mentioned is extremely enjoyable with exciting and well-choreographed action scenes as well several instances of funny moments and lines. For the type of film that Kingsman is, its flaws don't take away much from the movie itself, since it is made solely for enjoyment and excitement and not for a perfect script and a completely original story. It's a entertaining film and strongly recommended for anyone just looking to watch something simple and fun.</fullReview>

The final third of this mess is just unbearable. It takes a huge cliff dive of over-the-top shoot-em-up slop, cheesy lines and pathetic uncalled for sequences, a plot that just gets dumped on, which drags on and carries out this convolution of garbage that should end 15 minutes earlier. It's like there's 8 (anti)climaxes and 10 ending scenes. So much potential that the final half brings this production heap down to 2 stars.

The soundtrack perfectly matched every scene involved and never failed to complete the scene.

		<fullReview>It is always a pleasure to watch Colin Firth, Michael Caine and Samuel Jackson. Even if it is in a adaptation of a not so good comic. Never been a Millar fan, to little story,to much need to shock and awe. But as a parody of the James Bond movies, this movie works.The idea of an initiate saving the world is not new, Men in black springs to mind, and Kingsman is more of the same. Over the top violence, the kind we have come to expect from a Millar comic, corny one liners, and the trust no-one philosophy from b-moves.The fight scenes are great, stylized and fun to watch, no blood and minimal screaming, so you can enjoy the popcorn without gagging .... Until the whole suspension of disbelief is broken by the anal reference. It does not fit in the movie and it pulls you out of the flow of watching a mediocre but agreeable action movie. Re-release the movie with this bit edited out and you have a good movie, now it's watching 100 min. and 30 min of wondering what the director was thinking .... Shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this back on the opening weekend of it release and I just joined this site so I thought I would review Kingsman to dive in the site. Anyways Kingsman is directed by Matthew Vaughn who is amazing at what he does. My favorite of his is probably Kick-Ass, check that out if you haven't already. Kingsman has a great style. The gadgets presented in this film are not that original for spy movies, but they sure as heck get you excited. Kingsman is really like a wave of Nostalgia from old Bond movies and others like it. It also owns it and Kingsman is very self aware making for a few moments that make you smile. This is definitely a film that has a good re-watch factor an I will pick up on Blu-Ray.Spoilers from here on outI would have given this film a 9 but the church scene where the entire congregation was shocking and I was confused during it. Not to say it wasn't cool, I just think they could have done something else to reveal Valentine's plan. Also Eggsy at the end getting the girl, I think it was unnecessary to include her butt as the final shot but whatever.</fullReview>

Sure, there were some pieces of the movie that were far-fetched and a couple of points that might defy reality too much (as some would argue) but at the end of the day I think the movie embraces this as one of its strengths.

		<shortDescription>Fun spy story, but aimed at 14 year old boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actor Colin Firth brings a measure of class to all the movies he appears in, and this film is no exception. Colin Firth plays Harry, code name Galahad in the Kingsman Agency, a sort of secret service that is reminiscent of the old classy style James bond films, but with fun set pieces of almost cartoon violence. It is all a bit tongue in cheek, quietly making fun of itself, or so I felt. Others may disagree. The movie looks to be the launching pad for a movie series starring the young recruit Eggsy (Alex Nikolov)a bad boy with a heart of gold, surely meant to appeal to boys as a clever tough guy, and to girls as a diamond in the rough. Sadly the story kills off Harry about half way through, and with his departure goes the class and better humour. As such, sadly, the first half is much better than the second half.These movies rely heavily on the quality of the bad guy. After all, how can we display the excitement and daring do of the good guy, without a decent bad guy to battle against? The film planned well, employing Samuel L Jackson to be Richmond Valentine, an evil tech billionaire. Unfortunately this is Samuel Jackson's possibly worst performance of all time. It may not be entirely his fault. His is dressed like a 12 year old from the 1940's, talks with an unbelievable and quite annoying lisp, and his actions are not intelligent, despite the fact that he is supposed to be brilliant. The more his character is on the screen, the worse the film gets.If there is a sequel, which one would expect was the whole point of this movie, the absence of Colin Firth, and the bad writing that gave us the Richmond Valentine character, should ensure that it is, sadly, terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, look at this CAST: Colin Firth Mark Strong Michael Caine Samuel Jackson Jack Davenport Mark Hamill Along with great newcomers: Sofia Boutella Taron Egerton Edward Holcroft Sophie Cookson Now the plot. It really sounds a little dumb at first, but when you think about it, it's actually very smart. I'm not going to sum it up, because you either already know the summary or you know what the twisted tech genius is actually planning. Also, no spoilers. I talked about the cast before, but let's talk about the performances. By far, the breakout performances are great when holding up to the great heavyweights in this film, such as Firth, Strong, and Jackson. Sofia Boutella is an awesome henchman to Jackson's villain. Yet, th good guys are fantastic too, with Taron Egerton giving one of the best breakout performance I have ever seen, and possibly the best one I've seen in an action film. Sophie Cookson and Edward Holcroft are great as training recruits in the Kingsman facility. Colin Fifth gives one of the best performances of his career in Harry Hart, a veteran agent who wants to repay our main character, Eggsy's father, by recruiting Eggsy in Kingsman. Mark Strong is also cool as tech sidekick Merlin, who directs all the training activities. You could say he's the comic relief, but really, everyone is. I haven't mentioned how funny this movie actually is. I laughed, hard , more than several times during this movie. And part of that is thanks to Valentine, played by Samuel Jackson. He is hilarious in that he I so meta, swears a lot, and has a lisp. Now for the action scenes. These are some of the best filmed action scenes I have actually ever seen, in that the camera follows the actors-yes, the actors- and you can see what's going on. The gadgets are awesome, with a bullet-filled umbrellas and lighters that are actually hand grenades. Now, of course the music is terrific, with a soundtrack that includes "Free Bird" and Dire Straits. Same with the score, composed by Henry Jackman. So, what am I trying to say? Go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Manners Maketh Man"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Matthew Vaugh, director of "Kick-Ass" and "X-Men: First Class" once again succeeds in adapting a comic with "Kingsman: The Secret Service". While the film takes a few liberties with the original Secret Service story, the movie ultimately delivers an outrageously fun take on the spy movie genre ? one that should appeal to fans of the series as well as moviegoers who are in the mood for cartoonish violence and action. Certain elements might be a little too crude for sensitive viewers but Vaughn's film includes enough crowd pleasing laughs, stylized fight choreography, and slick spy gadgets to make it an easy recommendation for casual moviegoers in search of popcorn entertainment.Kingsman relies heavily on toying with genre expectations. It retrofits spy movie tropes (gentleman who are super spies, twisted villains, and zany henchmen) with modern filmmaking aesthetics. The core storyline and character outright acknowledge these parallels to humorous affect; though, the film itself is still locked in a relatively stock spy outline (a game of cat and mouse between heroes and villains) paired with the familiar tale of a scrappy young person given the chance to do something extraordinary with their life ? assuming they are bold enough to take it. Vaughn's moment to moment execution supplies a constant stream of sharp action, enjoyable characters, and clever pop culture nods.In fact, while recent James Bond films continue to retrace 007&#x2032;s signature style, Kingsman presents a hyper-stylized variation that, without question, offers some of the best fight choreography that moviegoers will have seen in the spy genre as of late. The tone can be tongue-in-cheek, and gags are lewd, but Kingsman isn't just a silly spy romp either - there's a heart to the story that, in between all of the blood, explosions, and sexual innuendo, imparts thoughtful commentary on the men behind the suits. For that reason, Firth (whose name had been thrown around years back as a possible candidate for Bond) furnishes one of his most likable and entertaining performances, in an already illustrious thirty-year career, as Harry Hart. Fans may never get to see Firth don a 007 tuxedo but, thanks to Kingsman, the actor proves he has the necessary charisma and flexibility to lead future action vehicles - often out-Bonding recent James Bond movies.As stated within the film, a spy movie is only as good as its villains and the combined pairing of Jackson (doing his best Russell Simmons impression) and Sofia Boutella (as his bladed henchwoman Gazelle) are a fun set of opponents for Hart and the Kingsman. Unsurprisingly, Jackson is a scene stealer as Valentine ? injecting laughable quirks that punctuate the character's contagious charm and unrepentant insanity. Kingsman also features a strong cast of supporting players ? led by Taron Egerton as Eggsy. Even though Hart is the biggest draw of the film, Eggsy is the central figure of the story ? as he transitions from troublemaker to a tailored suit wearing hero. To that end, the juxtaposition between the young actor and Firth is especially captivating and, often, heartwarming ? providing a unique and layered mentor/mentee relationship that isn't often explored with such care in the spy genre. Rounding out the cast, viewers are also treated to genuinely fun moments from Mark Strong (Kick-Ass) and Mark Hamill (Star Wars) as well as Michael Caine (The Dark Knight Trilogy) and newcomer Sophie Cookson.Vaughn and Goldman borrow heavily from espionage-thriller classics but through smart genre riffs and hyper-stylized action, Kingsman: The Secret Service manages to provide a clever twist on the spy movie format. Vaughn successfully balances a hefty amount of world-building, humor, action, and character drama into a tight two hour runtime ? laying the foundation for a film franchise that, much like its main character, might be a little rough around the edges but delivers where it counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched a trailer for this movie, I wasn't expecting this much from it. I was thinking that it's going to be something like James Bond or like that, but we get a lot more then that.Based upon the acclaimed comic book and directed by Matthew Vaughn, Kingsman: The Secret Service tells the story of a super-secret spy organization that recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.So, the story is, by it self, a lot more then usual spy and agent movies. I really like this idea about those sim cards for controlling people.In this movie, there is a lot of good acting. We have Colin Firth (Harry Hart / Galahad), Mark Hamill (Professor Arnold), Samuel L. Jackson (Valentine) and, of course, Taron Egerton (Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin). All of them did great.This movie is also funny, I'm not going to tell you the jokes because i'll spoil you fun then.The action scenes are done well. All of those slow motion scenes are done great and they are in perfect timing. Idea with umbrellas that are multipractic (gun, shield, stunner etc.) is great. In every scene there is something new which, of course, I really like.This movie has a big potential for sequels but, I don't know how the director and writers are going to use that potential. For this movie, when I read some reviews, I was so exciting and finally, I watched it. It was worth waiting. From now on, this is one of my favorite movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Kingsman, but it wasn't a masterpiece in cinematography, acting or a winner of any Oscars (it won't be), but this movie isn't striving for that, this is pure awesomeness. Anyone who loves badasses in suits, ultra- violence, and Colin Firth killing people in the most brutal possible ways will love this movie. The acting is still really good, with a complimentary cast, Samuel L. Jackson's character is hilarious, Colin Firth going from something like The Kings Speech to this is a wonderful breath of fresh air, and he fits in perfectly, Mark Strong also holds his own really well. But the real star is the newcomer Taron Egerton acting as the main character 'Eggsy' in the film, and he shows huge potential, and creates an extremely likable protagonist in Kingsman. Go see this movie if you want a tongue and cheek load of fun (if not quite inappropriate in terms of violence and sexual references: don't bring your kids). Really if you loved the original Kickass, this is a movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so when it comes to English action films, we normally find something that makes us roll our eyes and think, really we don't do that but when I started watching this film from the start it reminded me of me and my mates growing up in the streets of Croydon, it all just felt so natural also when it came down to the fight scenes it was all so real with the exception of a few flashy moves but other than that it had a great blend of the way we talk as a common person mixed with the way we talk as an upper class posh person and the transition from street thug to gentleman killer it was excellent. The comedy was your typical English humour which made the film just that little bit more personal to the viewers really made me laugh. 10/10 looking forward to part 2</fullReview>

Its one of my favourite films and I hope the sequel is good too. It most likely won't be as good but it still hopefully will be good. If you're into spy films this is definitely the perfect film for you. I loved the scene where Harry is fighting with everyone in the bar. Taron egerton and samuel l jackson are funny in this film.

		<fullReview>Expect cheeky man whore spies and equally convoluted spy movie clichés? Kingsman: The Secret Service is not that type of spy movie.Slated for an American release in February amongst the lame romantic comedies and other dud-like films released in the dead of winter, Kingsman: The Secret Service shocks all by being quite a great movie.Kingsman is the name of the super secret espionage agency that polices the world and England in anonymity and without recognition. Only the most intellectual, moralistic, and talented are able to join this selectively reputable group. And, of course you must be invited and pass their highly competitive and rigorous training program. For this year's recruits, Galahad (played by Colin Firth) chooses Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton), a rough around the edges hooligan with promise, to represent him amidst the rest of spy- hopefuls. Meanwhile a new 'bad guy' is ready to unleash his evil twisted plan and effectively destroy the world.We've all seen a spy movie, and if you haven't, you just simply must let me know where you found your rock. Gone are the tactical plot points and character archetypes, and instead Kingsman: The Secret Service is a refreshingly good, novel and entertaining film. The plot is linear, unlike most spy movies of recent time, and it makes for a very clean and captivating film.What is a spy movie without a protagonist, villain and killer action scenes? Colin Firth makes for the quintessential 'seasoned' spy while Taron Egerton makes for the perfect 'cheeky' anti-hero. Both have amazing chemistry and play well off one another while being engaging enough to continue garnering the audience's attention during solo scenes.And now, for the action. At first I thought Colin Firth had somehow managed to nonchalantly steal the award for best fight scene in an espionage film and then Taron Egerton showed up, a secondary dark horse in the running. The fight coordination is fast, concise and without flourish but stylized for a flare seemingly unique to Kingsman: The Secret Service.Admittedly, I was on the fence about this film going in. The trailer looked sick, and Colin Firth has never known to make a heinous misstep?but a spy movie in February that was more superficial and light than its dark and edgy peers? I was happily proved wrong, if you will, and Kingsman: The Secret Service is sure to entertain. I just hope there is a sequel/prequel.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow so after seeing this i have a lot of positive things to say. The good things were the comedy and action, and those were ripe. On the flip side the special effects were questionable and the story was scrabbled. But setting that aside it is a must see for fans of action and comedy. I urge u to view this film. Also in the movie morals are told. Also lessons about friendship and hardships are put out there. The movie was what i hoped and something more. So even tho its a little overboard its still a decent film. No more should be said then simply wow. Because this movie makes u say wow and other things i have decided against putting down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A high bar for entertaining blockbusters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A weekend cinema-outing of this slick UK spy actioner which is a surprisingly excellent revamped Bond-esque espionage genre fare inundated with polished set pieces and beguiling plot twist albeit the whole movie is ground in the same old saving-the-world-from- a-super-villain mode. Director Matthew Vaughn has been constantly on my radar as one of my favourite genius in commercial filmmaking, I have watched all his previous four features, from LAKE CAKE (2004, 6/10), X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011, 7/10), to my absolute guilty-pleasure treasures STARDUST (2007, 9/10) and KICK-ASS (2010, 9/10). His latest is by all means a thoroughly engaging adventure with unconventional violence and visual gags, which all delightfully surpass viewer's expectation. So, Kingsman is a secret British spy organisation with agents all suited-up in a refined and old-fashioned cavalier comportment to fight the evil minds. After losing one of their top asset Lancelot (Davenport), the headquarter, presided by Arthur (Caine), decides to recruit a new agent from promising youngsters, one of the recruits is Eggsy (Egerton), an unpolished street kid under the aegis of Harry Hart aka. Galahad (Firth), one of the top Kingsman who is indebted to Eggsy's deceased father, also a former Kingsman. During the boot camp, Eggsy befriends another recruit Roxy (Cookson), as the world is going to experience a holocaust schemed by a billionaire and radical elitist Valentine (Jackson) through his free SIM cards distributed to every corner of the globe. While all the rich and famous are privileged to survive in the new Noah's Ark constructed by Valentine, as long as they are conceded to implant a chip into their brains so that Valentine can have the full reign over them. In general, it is a partisan aggression to counteract the swelling global population which will endanger the entire human race. In hindsight, this execution is the major weak link in this otherwise inventive script, it is far more efficient to annihilate his targets if Valentine can simply detonate the self-explosion program designed in his SIM cards, if he could and should have been a bit more clever and as we all know, the chosen scenario is only to make the movie apparently dazzling for its special effects. It is a no-brainer that Valentine's plan is doomed to founder in a typical last second endgame to maintain the suspense on the high-point, but Vaugh and his co-writer Jane Goldman gallantly deploy a take-no-prisoners manoeuvre to outrun audience's common sense of "we don't need to worry about our heroes, as Bond will never die in the movie", more impressive, it is the work of visual department, from the grand opening aerial shot, the highly-entertaining action-in-suit and swift parkour, to the adrenaline-surging church massacre in a stylish and perfectly coordinated slow-mo technique, and the final game-changing heads-will-explode firework, they are all high-end spectacles can suffice audience of today. Plus the movie has moderately good humour, it salutes without descending into snobbishness when tries to reanimate the nobleman brand of espionage. Colin Firth finally finds himself in a box-office gainer in the nadir of his post-Oscar bad career choices, and he is great here too, even in the action sequences, he should go on a profitable path as the noble version of Liam Neeson in the middle-aged killing-machine type. Newcomers Egerton and Cookson are genially well-chosen in the rookie plot-setting, but they do not exhibit ample allure to lead in a sequel all by themselves, so I guess some big name can still wait for his casting call. Also Mark Strong takes a hefty task in the game, first as a ruthless trainer, then a valiant pilot, an omnipotent computer hacker, and a professional ass-kicker. But the most indelible character is Sofia Boutella's Gazelle, Valentine's hench-woman, an extremely dangerous double amputee killer. Ultimately the film lifts the bar of our appreciation of heavy-budgeted blockbuster, and sends a defiant message for the cutting-edge industry to emulate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joyously entertaining - and clearly the first in a franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed the 2010 movie "Kick-Ass" (and I certainly did), you'll be joyously entertained by "Kingsman". That's no accident since the films have the same British director Matthew Vaughan and the same British writer Jane Goldman (aka Mrs Jonathan Ross). Whereas "King-Ass" was a twist on the super-hero genre, "Kingsman" is a homage to the spy caper with particular reference to the earlier Bond movies. While "King-Ass" was wonderfully violent, "Kingsman" at times presents a gore-fest, notably in over the top sequences involving a fight scene in a church and heads exploding to accompanying music.It is a cleverly constructed work with excitement from the opening seconds, a narrative that fairly zips along, and lots of wry humour. And it deliberately pitches for a wide audience with a host of older familiar stars (Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Samuel L Jackson) plus a raft of new younger talent (Taron Egerton as the working class young buck, Sophie Cookson as his side kick, and Sofia Boutella as his intended nemesis). Sometimes it is all a little too contrived, with the device of a line of dialogue repeated later in a slightly different context used over and over again, but it is all so much fun you forgive such contrivances.The plan is that "Kingsman" will become a franchise and early in the credits a scene sets up the central character for the next movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Since Guardians of the Galaxy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman: The Secret ServiceRemember Agent Cody Banks? That crappy movie about the kid who goes to spy camp? Well Kingsman is like if that movie was good. And completely awesome.There way be spoilers ahead.StoryThis movie is based on a comic book written by Mark Millar. Even though I haven't read the original comic, I can tell that the movie strayed from the source material. Even so, I think it was probably for the best. The plot of this movie is a basic rags to riches story mixed with a classic James Bond film. The main character Eggsy is a naturally gifted troublemaker who hasn't had it easy in life. Eggsy's father was a member of an ultra-elite super-spy agency.Years after his father's death, Eggsy is approached by Harry Hart, another member of the same ultra-elite super-spy agency. Harry offers Eggsy the chance to "join the club." After the that, the plot is quite predictable. Eggsy gets trained, there's an over the top charismatic villain with a lisp, and he has to save the world. Look, the plot isn't the most original or unique?.or the most sensible. But the amount of action and entertainment in this film makes up for that.Side Note: I am a big fan of over the top action movies, and I think action and entertainment in an action film should always take priority over a logical plot. So there?Acting/DialogueThere were some stellar performances in this movie. Colin Firth played his role of gentleman spy brilliantly. Taron Egerton (Eggsy) was able to play a character that could have easily been annoying. However, I sympathized with his character, and I think his performance really made the movie.Another actor to note is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the role of the over the top and ridiculous supervillain.The lisp really seals the deal.Action/SFXIn recent years, action movies have been really gritty and realistic. I personally favor old school action movies, with over the top and impossible stunts and fight scenes. If you share my preferences then this is the movie for you.Action is abundant in this movie, to point where I was on the edge of my seat more then I was relaxed in it. Not only that, but the action sequences are long and intense, not to mention the fact that most of the stunts could never be performed by an actual human being. But that's what makes it great!Most of the fight sequences are filmed with "shaky cam," but unlike other movies, (*cough* Jason Bourne Series *cough*) the sharp camera movements isn't too distracting and you can actually tell what is going on.Award Time!Best Performance: Taron EggertonBest Scene: The Church FightFunniest Line (and possibly my favorite line in a movie ever): "I'm a Catholic whore, currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic. Hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon madam."ConclusionKingsman is probably the best movie that I've seen since Guardians of the Galaxy. I give it a 9/10. It's really good to see a return to the style of actions that I love?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is self aware cinema at its best, with nods toward old Bond movies the way they used to be. Especially with Roger Moore (even though Colin Firth is channelling David Niven's mannerism, the movie channels the Roger Moore era of Bond films more than anything else). The gadgets, the suits, the one liners, the impeccable unflinching gentlemen attitude, and even the perfectly choreographed gory and violent fight scenes, all point to one thing - it's a movie that doesn't simply knows it's a movie, it's a movie that wants us to know it knows. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and the firework's display is an obvious proof of that fact. But like all great movies that don't take themselves too seriously, it does it with all due professionalism. Acting, editing, cinematography and all other aspects of movie making are of the highest calibre. And plot twists are abundant - it's a real eye-feast that might be a start of a brand new franchise. I know I'll be waiting.</fullReview>

But this was different, it had the similar style and gadgets used in James Bond, poisons, explosives, guns, stun guns, umbrellas. My most favorite gadget was the umbrella. It was exciting from start to finish, there were a lot of violent scenes in the film but it was worth it. I myself can take that sort of thing because i've been used to seeing mild violence in movies when i was young. I watched almost all the James Bond movies and some Jason Bourne. This movie is a little different than them. It has some funny moments which there aren't much in these new James Bond movies. The ending was fantastic, the bad guy was impaled by his bodyguards sword legs, and at the very end, the hero was reenacting the main characters speech when they were at that same moment.</fullReview>

Perhaps one of Jackson and Firth's worst contributions to the industry, Kingsman: The Secret Service bathes in blood and, if matters couldn't even be worse, Vaughn throws in a less than subtle 5 minute McDonald's product placement commercial. Truly an insult to the actors' potential; this film is additionally a waste of their opportunity and talent. Ending the film with an anal sex scene between Taron Edgerton's character and a Scandinavian princess who was widowed no less than ten minutes beforehand, Vaughn spits in the face of any who call out his obtuse morality. The final credits contain an attempt at a cliché representation of the eccentric and poorly executed bar- fight scene in the beginning of the movie</fullReview>

Young British actor Taron Egerton gives it his all and is surrounded by other young British stars like Sofia Boutella, and Sophie Cookson. He is also surrounded by British thespians Jack Davenport, Michael Caine, and Mark Strong. All of whom give outstanding performances. I had the honor of seeing this movie and I would definitely recommend to others. Young kids should NOT see this movie because it is rated R and full of strong language including the F word.

The trailers promised a fun entertaining spy story that takes modern Bond's seriousness, and adds a bit of Austin Powers' silly humor.The fighting were fun and entertaining. Sharp, crisp, quick, and clean. The kingsman showed what it was to be a level above the others. Everybody did great. EDIT: I just found out I've missed a whole sequence of in-church fighting due to Indonesian censorship. Bummer.The evil plot: out of this world, and yet.. understandable. Sam L. Jackson was spot on with his delivery and the reasoning behind his evil deeds. And he was scared of blood.The downside: some of the jokes were... well.. unfunny, especially at the end with the *SPOILER ALERT* head explosions and butt f***. The explosions were done as a joke, with every head blowing up in sync and Technicolor to match the fireworks music. I kinda cringed at this.The offer from Princess Tilde was completely out of the blue. And the fact that young agent Eggsy accepted enthusiastically was very uncharacteristic of the young lead character. I mean, he had the best character and personality among all other cadets and him jumping at this odd chance is very.. unlike him.Basically the whole thing started off great (save for the cutting in half, I was a bit shocked, but.. I could live with that) and then there was a few shockers in the middle, and by the end it gets a bit random. Although, overall it was an entertaining film.Bottom line: I should like it more, but I probably had too high an expectation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would have thought Colin Firth could play such a suave James Bond type? He displays enough cockiness, looks quite dapper in his custom made suite, and can probably pick up any babes he wished if we had more time in the movie. Jackson also has the time of his life, with his speech impediment villain. In addition to that, we are treated to the training phase of the future spies, and unlike "Birdman" where there's nothing funny, this parody skewers the genre, giving us action fan plenty to cheer throughout the entire movie.We have the gadgets, the action scenes, the incredible requests to earn certification and become a member of the select few. We meet the fatherless hero who must prove himself worthy of the recognition and hone his natural talents to be able to save the world. Who wouldn't love the poisonous tip oxfords, the cool pens, key chains, and doesn't that umbrella come in pretty handy before and during a lethal encounter?In order to give the film more panache, we have to include Michael Caine, who has already graced a few "Batman" films with his class, and Mark Strong adds a touch of cerebral ability, as he must prove his resources are after all, important to succeed in this era. What is most important here is the amount of fun we have throughout the film? Loved the intimate dinner between the two adversaries, the sexy villain who proves to be quite a challenge during the entire adventure, and it is plenty of fun to see some of those selected few get their due, as they find themselves once again worthy of salvation just because they have more money than the rest of the world. Of course, the villain plans are both hideous and hilarious as we see which groups are depicted in the movie. Most of them are one step short of getting into that type of frenzy anyway, so it wouldn't take much to trigger that type of behavior.This is a movie that is a bit over two hours, but we don't want it to end because it is so much fun. There are films out there that are overpraised because it looks like they're trying to be original as they criticize, satirize, or make a half-hearted and pretentious parody of other genres. "Kingsman" is an example that the film makers are able to wink an eye and tell us these types of films are excessive, with just too much of nothing in order to pack it with special effects to hide its creative weaknesses, but this one also shows that you can show intelligent commentaries without dragging or calling too much attention to it. I can't remember how many times I look at my time during "Birdman", but I had forgotten I had a watch or a cell phone while I laughed and rooted for the heroes and villains equally, and there were a few unexpected turns which gave me some faith about the simple fact that we can still hope to find some fresh material out there.We might getting too much of the Marvel universe, with a break needed soon. It is also important to note that originality and creativity and their blend with comedy and action are really difficult when they were done. A good work of art doesn't try that hard to call attention to itself. Instead, it's all there, and it flows naturally on its way to its well-deserved recognition, without the overeager critical support to tell us how great it is, when it really isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman is a royalty of laughs, style, and violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "Kingsman: The Secret Service" was moved to the 'dump month' wasteland of beginning of the year, my expectations for the movie were lowered significantly. The advertisements for "Kingsman", which glamorized a variety of displayed weapons, promised an October release date, but was pushed back by the studio until February. A film can be delayed for a variety of reasons, but the common assumption is that a shift guarantees box-office and critical failures. Leave your expectations at the theater door. Director Matthew Vaughn leads a stellar class in an original and modern interpretation of the spy genre. Similar to his work on "Kick-Ass" and "X-Men: First Class", Vaughn continues to prove himself as an established filmmaker, especially when adapting graphic novel source material. The usually stiff and reserved Colin Firth is unleashed as Harry Hart (codename Galahad), a veteran secret agent who emphasizes personal etiquette and style. An enthusiast of Hemingway and Horman quotes, Hart carries the appearance of an English professor, but fights with the brutality of the deadly killing machine that he is. After a mission in the Middle East is botched and results in the death of a fellow agent, Hart delivers a medal with a contact number to his murdered comrade's mourning family. The son Eggsy (a star-making performance by relative newcomer Taron Eggerton) grows up and is a reckless youth without job or a future. After stealing a car, and accelerating it into a police vehicle, Eggsy desperately phones the number on the medal from prison. The Kingsman, with code names from Arthurian legend, recruits Eggsy and other selected youths as potential members of the spy program. Hart works alongside fellow Kingsman Arthur (Michael Caine) and Merlin (Mark Strong) as both trainer and mentor, presenting the candidates with a number of grueling tasks to determine their qualifications. The agency finds itself pitted against Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), a billionaire tech genius intent on implanting SIM cards inside of people for his own sinister and megalomaniac intentions. Jackson, having fun with a lisp that sounds like a Mike Tyson impersonation, is the best he's been since his remarkable performance in Django Unchained, and his villain is a testament to the Roger Moore Bond films, when the baddies used to be fun with their preposterously foul intentions. During the films crowning scene, Hart fights through a Kentucky church overflowing with bigoted rednecks, and blood sprays to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird". The graphic visuals are brilliantly choreographed, and makes your jaw drop at how hilariously violent it is. The scene seems to last forever, and that's not a bad thing. Updated advertisements of the film with the corrected February release date displayed characters standing beneath the splayed artificial legs of Gazelle ? the hottie Oddjob to Valentine's Goldfinger. The posters are a homage to "For Your Eyes Only", in which Roger Moore stands beneath the legs of his adversary. The images are a fitting testament in how Vaughn effectively handles his subject material ? a loving tribute to a genre that is enjoyable and relevant, without straying far into the realms of parody. With the Bond and Bourne franchises glooming with humorless realism, "Kingsman" strives to make an espionage feature enjoyable again.The posters of Kingsman are destined to grace the dorm room walls of college kids, thumbtacked next to the likes of Fincher, Nolan, and Tarantino offerings. With his fifth consecutive excellent film, Vaughn is destined to join these ranks of these applauded and revered directors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woah.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>......Holy sock puppet in a sausage factory. Just, wow. Without a doubt, this movie is mindblowingly awesome. I honestly don't know how to put my enjoyment of this movie into words, but here goes. From the very opening scene, in which we're treated to a fortress being destroyed by missiles set to the tune of Money For Nothing, to the jaw-dropping scene involving Colin Firth and a hate-group church, to the absolutely hilarious climatic sequence, almost every scene in this movie has had the OTT dial turned up to 11, and that sure as hell isn't a bad thing! Each scene is an absolute blast, combining brilliantly-choreographed fight sequences complimented by slick editing, great cinematography, beautifully off-kilter humour and much, much more. You will be lost for words after all of them, probably with a huge goofy grin on your face. Of course, if the cast didn't look like/perform like they were having a blast then the overall effect of the movie would've been reduced. Fortunately, they do; from Taron Egerton as generally awe-struck Eggsy, to Colin Firth as his mentor, to Samuel L. Jackson as lisp-bearing scheming mastermind Richmond Valentine, to the other minor cast members such as Mark Strong as tech-aficionado Merlin, Sofia Boutella as Pistorious-esque Gazelle, and a very welcome cameo from Mark Hamill as a professor in an unfortunate position, everyone really gets into their roles, managing to at once and really giving the viewer sense that they're having the absolute time of their lives. The soundtrack only heightens the effect of these; they're perfectly fitting, and some pretty great tunes as well (although in the aforementioned church scene, changing the song to Don't Stop Me Now would've blown the awesome level through the roof for me). At 129 minutes, it is definitely on the longer side for these kinds of movies, but fortunately two hours fly by, never feeling dull for one single moment. Kingsman: The Secret Service can best be described as a hybrid of Trading Places and Bond, and it only takes the best aspects of those movies and makes them even more awesome. If you're looking for a great big dose of gobsmackingly silly fun, go here. Only here. No exceptions. This is the one that you need. It's out- f**king-standing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2015...please don't waste your money on that piece of garbage 50 shades of crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Best movie so far, 2015, and will probably rank in my top 5 for 2015. The trailer looked cool, which is why i saw it, and i'm glad i saw it the first weekend and at the theater. Def worth seeing it on big screen. All the comparisons to Bond meets Kick-Ass, part Matrix in fighting, makes this the best action movie i've seen since Gaudians of the Galaxy. Like Captain America Winter Soldier, it truly makes you want to go outside and kick some evil butt. Don't though, you might get arrested, just saying i felt after this movie like i did after seeing Cap 2, i wanted to be a spy, try and save the world, and kick some local hooligan's behinds...NOT FOR KIDS!!!!!...a lady actually brought 7 young preteens to this movie for some reason unknown to me. The violence is a little gratuitous, and i wouldn't want any kid to see that. Some unnecessary nudity/sexual innuendo, which is why i didn't give this movie a 10. Like Age of Ultron, my most anticipated film for 2015(screw star wars), this movie has a real feel to the danger humanity faces, one evil genius villain trying to rule the world with through violent means. Both precursors to the Anti-Christ, a real life person foretold in the BIBLE, that will one day try and do what Hitler did, rule the world through destruction of his enemies. That day will surely come, but if you believe in Jesus Christ, that HE died on the Cross to pay the penalty for your sins, you can be saved from the temporal and eternal wrath of GOD, which also, will surely come....please, before its too late, turn to Jesus...HE can and will save you, if you can believe....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kingsman: The Secret Service" - Directed, and Co-Written by Matthew Vaughn, is a spy action comedy, based the comic book "The Secret Service". The movie centers on "Kingsman" secret Agent Harry Hart, played by Colin Firth, and his protégé Gatry "Eggsy" Unwin, played by Taron Egerton. The Kingsman are a secret spy agency, based in England. Hart, whose past history with Eggy's father, which is revealed at the start of the film, ends up recruiting the troubled Eggsy to try to become the latest Kingsman. The movie is a great tongue and cheek/often campy spy comedy! The movie turns serious, with a couple surprises when it needs to be, but returns to it's tone, without missing much of a beat The cast do an all around great job. Along with great performances by Firth and Egerton, Samuel L. Jackson is a hoot, as the villain "Richard Valentine", and the rest of the cast are great as well! As soon as you accept the tone and roll with it ? A Fun Movie! 3 ? out of 4 Stars, 9 ? out of 10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hyperviolent cartoonish fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film directed by Matthew Vaughn to be based on a Mark Millar-penned graphic novel series after 2010's insanely brilliant 'Kick-Ass', 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' maintains the former film's stylish mix of pitch black comedy, ultra-violence and creative narrative twists. Essentially a send-up of many classic British spy franchises (most prominently 007), 'Kingsman' focuses on a veteran secret agent (Colin Firth) taking on an inexperienced apprentice (Taron Egerton), with both individuals coming up against a diabolical billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson). The plot's been done to death thousands of times before, but 'Kingsman's' unique self-referential humor and willingness to cross narrative boundaries and defy genre clichés makes it stand out amid a sea of mediocre espionage films.I was initially worried that Eggsy, the apprentice and the film's main protagonist, was going to be unlikable due to his somewhat arrogant nature, however ultimately Egeton is able to make him a worthy hero by providing the right amount of charm and vulnerability. Colin Firth fits right in as the old-fashioned, gentlemanly Harry Hart, but in some places leaps out of this familiar territory to become a ruthlessly brutal action juggernaut. Samuel L. Jackson is also a terrific watch, with his prominent lisp and aversion to the sight of blood making him a highly unconventional but highly watchable and entertaining villain. As mentioned earlier, like in 'Kick-Ass' before it, 'Kingsman' is genuinely shocking and brutal in certain stages. At other points, over-the-top, ridiculously well-choreographed violence is fused with the film's morbid sense of humor, providing yet another unique viewing experience from Matthew Vaughn. Like his other productions, the success of 'Kingsman' lies largely in its ability to not take itself too seriously, as well as its tendency to both pay homage to and make fun of the other films that have inspired it's creation.Even though it's still relatively early to tell, 'Kingsman' will easily be considered one of the best action films of the year.</fullReview>

Normally i don't like unknown actors, but he killed it. I want to see more of this guy. Mr. L. Jackson did an amazing Job being the antagonist. Loved it.There was like i said before a lot of humor in this and it blends so Well in this movie. Its enormously selfaware talking about the pop culture we know.

		<shortDescription>The gentleman spy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman wants to be a lot of things. A James Bond homage mixed with The New Avengers and a touch of The Man from Uncle. Lets throw in Eastenders as well with scenes set in a council estate pub. Taron Egerton plays the young hero Eggsy and Samantha Janus plays his mum.Kingsman is an independent spy agency with an Arthurian leaning which operates out of a gentleman's tailor shop. When one of the agent dies on duty, Colin Firth nominates a small time criminal (Eggsy) to be a replacement. Eggsy's father was also a Kingsman once.All the nominees go through a tough selection process. At the same time the organisation investigates the mysterious disappearance of some celebrities and the actions of a well known philanthropist and cyber billionaire Valentine played by Samuel L Jackson who is concerned about climate change and wants to give away free sims, free phone calls and internet.Valentine obviously watched that episode of Doctor Who where the dastardly villain used mobile phones devices to control people's emotions.Director Matthew Vaughn as with the Kick Ass films uses strong humour and cartoon violence although in this film, the violence has a video game footage look about it. I do think an anal sex gag at the end was misplaced!The film is entertaining enough, makes you laugh a few times but lacks a lot of originality. Maybe the comic book it is based on is itself been inspired by many other film and TV sources.In short its a fan-boy remake of a James Bond film from the Roger Moore era. However hearing Samuel Jackson describing spies and megalomaniacs also reminded me of the film Unbreakable which itself was about people with superpowers and super-villains and Jackson had a major role in that film as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never realised that Matthew Vaughn was a complete coward. The 'turning point' of this film hinges around Colin Firth going a bit bonkers and killing people and what a surprise he decides to set that scene in a chapel because 'they deserve it'. Now would he have been brave enough to set it in a mosque or a temple - No because he is not brave but wants to ride the popular wave of sneering at people who believe in something that he doesn't. Oh yes we call it intolerance. For that scene to go on with such offensive imagery says quite a lot about the bitter heart that orchestrated it. I know 'designer violence' is very popular but so is screaming at the teacher and throwing chairs in the classroom. Not big, not clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a PSY-OP for the Satanic New World Order - and it's Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most propaganda laden films I've ever seen!This movie is all about planting seeds in your psyche for the impending New World Order and the fulfilment of the UN's Agenda 21.Lets look at the antagonist and the protagonists in the movie...Protagonists (Kingsman Cult) - The movie tells us that this is an intelligence organization formed and endowed by unnamed members of society's ultra-elite. They have no loyalties towards any nation state, but rather they're more like global enforcers.Antagonists (Valentine Cult) - The movie tells us that his motivation for trying to kill the majority of the people on Earth is because he is trying to save the planet from "climate change".In this movie, no matter who wins, the people of Earth are screwed. The protagonist Kingsman clan is a direct product of the global elite. In real life this would include people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, David Rockefeller, George Soros, Ted Turner, David de Rothschild, etc, etc... These people and many others like them are the driving force behind the New World Order. "Some even believe we (Rockefeller family) are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it." &#x2015; David Rockefeller - in his own book "Memoirs" pg.405Rockefeller's sentiments echo the ideology of the vast majority of those on the Forbes 400 list. I'd estimate that 7 or 8 out of every 10 billionaires is part of this "secret cabal" of globalists. The "Kingsmen" are basically a secret society formed by some of the ultra-elite... Also remember that in real life, intelligence is being gathered on each and every one of us and stored indefinitely (also sold) by billionaire companies like facebook, google, microsoft, apple, etc.The antagonist "Valentine" is a different side to the same coin... He wants to kill the majority of the people on Earth to save it from "climate change", but this is the ACTUAL STATED DESIRE/PLAN for the worlds ultra-elite including Gates, Turner, Buffet, Winfrey, Rockefellers, Rothschild, Soros, Kissenger, too many known to list. What's the elite's biggest stated concerns for the planet? 8 out of 10 will say "population" and "climate change"... And what is the only stated cure for "global warming" aka "climate change"? We need LESS PEOPLE, way less! "Or we're all going to be cooked..."This is exactly what Bill Gates said at the TED conference a few years back, except instead of using computers to kill people by sending them violent mind-control signals through their phones, they will use (in Gates' exact words) "healthcare, reproductive services, and vaccines" to LOWER THE POPULATION and save Earth from the man-made climate change FARCE! Ted Turner also says we need to lower global population by 80%... They are all globalists, they are all hell bent on depopulation. They will Keep clean seeds and meat for themselves, they are using our food and medicine supply to shorten our life spans, and more importantly sterilize us and our offspring incrementally. At the same time we are being drugged with fluoride in our water (gets in your pores when you shower, same dosage for infants or adults) and being hypnotized by our lying televisions.The Church Scene - This was one of the sickest and most Satanic scenes in movie history. Underlying message, kill all Christians... They went way out of their way to portray all Christians as hate mongers, racists, "anti-science", and dumb... Of course they also had to throw in a "hail Satan", but that's just for laughs, right? Nope. And I'm not laughing... In the coming New World Order, real Christians will be marked for extinction, that's a fact... And to you "Pre-Tribulation" people out there, you better take a closer look at Mathew 24:29 and so on, because we're going to be here for it...The mind-control aspect of it is also somewhat interesting, because real mind-control technology is EXTREMELY advanced these days. It's kind of a "kooky" subject to talk about, but if you ever examined real mind-control studies like MK-ULTRA, and mind-control studies done by universities, you'd see that the real stuff they were known to be doing 30+ years ago is downright scary! Now with advanced technologies involving ELF, it's weird and scary, but it's cool, because it's "science", and you don't ever want to be "anti-science" in the "new age".Too much wrong with this movie to mention in my allotted words... And btw, all propaganda aside, I honestly still thought the movie was terrible!I also cant believe how many idiots are outraged about the dog scenes, even in the story of the movie none of the dogs were killed! It's cool to portray Christians as hate mongers and then take out 100 of them, but don't you even joke about killing puppies! You people are as sick as those who made this movie! The notion that there's anything remotely "gentlemanly" about this movie is absolutely revolting!Fear not, for if you have faith in Jesus Christ, then you shall never taste death. And be of good cheer, for he has overcome the world! And for those who feel unwarranted hate of our Lord, I beg of thee to open your heart, then open a bible. Once you begin to understand it, you will see the truth, the way, the life. Jesus will return to gather his elect, though he comes not in peace, for this time he shall bring his sword! Fear God. Praise God! May God be with you all...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night i saw a press screening of Kingsman: the secret service and wow was i blown away! Another great night at the movies. I wasn't too sure what the movie would be about as i had only seen the trailer 2 times and i believe they were different trailers so it was the second one that sold me on the movie. The Action set pieces are very well done and it feels like a hybrid of James Bond, Sherlock Holmes, and John Wick. The movie is very self aware and doesn't take itself too seriously which is always nice :) the world that has been set up in this film really requires a sequel to explore it further however the movie wraps up as its own stand alone movie 1 minutes into the credits with the last scene. so if there is no sequel the movie will still be fantastic, but spending more time in that world will be fun! Now some of the jokes/humor was lost upon me because i speak/ have an ear for British insults/jokes but you noticed that it was a joke being made so still laughed along with the others in the theater. The movie has a lot more heart than i thought yet the comedy overpowers this Action Spy Film. See this movie and appreciate original films like this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman embraces its Bond influence- transcends its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman starts out like a fairly normal spy movie. In fact, almost routine-like. I started to have fears of director Matthew Vaughn's impressive action credentials being confined only within the X-men universe. But as the standard bond plot goes on; the more insane and crazy the action became. Statements were being made about the idea of violence- how much is too much- should we identify with our heroes reacting to violence with little to no emotion (if not sadistically enjoying it); and at the same time Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman were reveling in not only the crazy violence displayed on screen, but the potential reactions of the audiences. I saw one trailer of this marketed like a spy-version of one of the Young Adult novels; and the thought of teens expecting Stormbreaker 2 when watching this made me side with Vaughn and co. This is a film that embraces the bond tropes so hard that they almost burst. And that is a great thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer I thought I'd enjoy the first half cos of the 'joining the spy' bit and not so much the second half because of lots of action scenes, which I enjoy but not massively keen on - BUT I was very surprised that I enjoyed the entire film and the action scenes didn't override the film and were very good and had some very funny bits. Colin Firth was very good, he played Colin Firth (with extra added spyness) to a tee and was very enjoyable. I found Samuel L Jackson's lisp a little bit annoying but if he hadn't had it he would have been WAY more scary as a villain! He was very funny, too! The scenery was impressive and there were great swooping shots and you could actually see what was happening (not too fast).I really liked the whole 'knight' thing and that they had Arthurian code names. The Overall impression I had was a very good film, I would like to see it again, I was glad I saw this one at the cinema and, well, I'll be looking out for a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Defeating the bad guys is very important. So are manners. "Kingsman: The Secret Service" (R, 2:09) shows us how the two can go hand-in?umbrella. Foiling the plans of evil-doers and being a gentleman through it all are two goals to be accomplished at all costs. Buying into that presumption makes for a fun two hours at the movies. Unfortunately, this film also suggests that revered institutions are mostly worthy of our disdain and that human life is cheap and watching many lives end in a short period of time can also be a lot of fun ? and even funny. This film is a mixed bag that's hard to review, but I'm willing to give it that old college try.Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton) is a thug. He's in his early 20s, but is leading an aimless life of petty crime in a tough part of London. He's intelligent, resourceful and has moments of selflessness, but is doing nothing constructive with those positive qualities. Instead, he blames his surroundings, his upbringing, his family troubles? anything but himself for the way he lives his life. Enter Harry Hart (Colin Firth). Harry is a former colleague of Eggsy's father and seeks to repay a debt of gratitude by rescuing Eggsy from his latest scrape with the law and offering him an opportunity to become a "gentleman spy". Harry is actually better known as Galahad, one of a group of modern day knights called the Kingsmen, a secretive spy agency that operates "at the highest level of discretion". Eggsy doesn't really have anything else going on, so he agrees to give it a go.This is all part of a recruitment and selection process reminiscent of Tommy Lee Jones choosing Will Smith to join his group in the original "Men in Black". In "Kingsman: The Secret Service" (based on the 2012-2013 comic book series "The Secret Service"), Merlin (Mark Strong), the Kingsman who runs the testing and selection process, calls this "the most dangerous job interview in the world". Eggsy and several other potential Kingsmen are nearly drowned, forced to jump out of an airplane and then figure out what to do if one of them is without a functioning parachute, plus make very difficult choices designed to test their commitment and loyalty to the organization. As Eggsy's experience on London's mean streets keeps him in the game against his better educated and better bred competitors, he finds that some of his toughest competition comes from the group's sole remaining girl, Roxy (Sophie Cookson). Watching the recruits with great interest from the sidelines is Galahad and the head Kingsman, Arthur (Michael Caine).The attention of Galahad, Arthur and the others is understandably divided, however. One of their numbers has recently died attempting to rescue a kidnapped university professor (an unrecognizable Mark Hamill ? yes, "Star Wars" fans, THAT Mark Hamill). And that's only the beginning. Royalty, politicians and miscellaneous celebrities are disappearing all over the world. The man behind all this is billionaire tech magnate Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). But he's not planning to harm these important people whom he's gathering up. He's actually trying to save them. It's the rest of the world that has to worry. With the help of his lethal assistant, Gazelle (Sophia Boutella), a woman with knives for feet, he has a plan to "fix" what he considers earth's biggest problem ? overpopulation. The hour of his plan's execution is fast approaching and it's all hands on deck as the Kingsmen fight to prevent, what you might as well call Valentine's Day.Better than 90% of "Kingsman: The Secret Service" is a lot of fun, but it's that other 10% that taints the whole thing. Using a tailor shop as a front for an organization of gentlemen spies is clever and is used to maximum effect. The over-the-top take on James Bondian service to queen and country is quite entertaining. The challenges Eggsy and the others have to negotiate in the hopes of becoming a Kingsman are exciting and Valentine's extreme solution to overpopulation makes for a great tongue-in-cheek plot. Jackson is great as a villain with a lisp, a wannabe mass murder who hates killing and can't stand the sight of blood. Egerton is well cast and Firth is convincing as a proper, yet dangerous secret agent who can kick your ass with a beer mug and an umbrella. Caine is always a pleasure to watch and I'm very happy to see more and more of Mark Strong on the big screen.I liked this movie, but I would have liked it more if it weren't for the excessive violence and institution-bashing. The movie makes out as if the Kingsmen were the ONLY honorable government institution in the world. The story makes a sport out of bashing Christians (albeit very hateful Christians) and makes political leaders all over the world ? even President Obama ? complicit in Valentine's evil plan. Even more disturbing, extended and vicious fights are shown in gory detail, blood flows, heads explode and many of these scenes are filmed and scored in a whimsical tone. "Kingsman: The Secret Service" sullies a good story with an unnecessary amount of bile and blood. I'm giving this film a very weak recommendation, but be advised that the extremes to which this movie goes may ruin (or at least greatly diminish) an otherwise mostly entertaining movie for you too.

		<shortDescription>Who said Spies aren't Gentlemen...And we have CR7 in the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with every brand new Spy movie is as the tempo develops the movie ends.....So the first part is usually the boring part but still it is required to make a mark on the audience to keep following it... Spy movies these days are too much tech and too less action and a nice, gentleman spy is hard to find....an English Gentleman spy thats rare...but thats what we are talking about... Kingsman is just loosely based on the original novel so i didn't bother reading it...Movie started with ecstatic visuals and some hard core action...First half is just the routine a crazy villain wanting to save the world making his plans and sorts...and there is always time for some recruits to get scrutinized.... Second half as it unravels villain reveals his plans and it gets better and better..Movie has its moments and some dialogues just big LOL... Colin Firth as always is amazing.His role couldn't have been delivered more better.Samuel L. Jackson as his tagline is "Mankind is a Virus.And I am the Cure."is as bad ass as a villain can be...From his appearance to his plans he is as nasty as it can get,"Pick of the show." Well well well Taron Egerton,as much as i can get what he portrayed in the movie was all Christiano Ronaldo stuff from his facial features, rude look and gestures...I bet he is a big fan of CR7 and he knew similarity beforehand so he went forth with it but if he would only had acted better.Actor needs improvement and some facial expressions rather than being blank faced. Background music is OK...Storyline is the routine..Action sequences are excellent...But still if they make sequels it can only get better and better...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap Plot but a Classy Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it every spy movie will always have a cheap plot. It's how they execute their idea that's what should be the main criteria of judging the movie. And judging by the Kingsman: The Secret Service's execution, it's only fair to say that this film is anything but cheap. And although it's not as classy as James Bond, it has surely managed to entertain us in a "Gentleman's Way".The characters may seem like a bunch of stereotypes. But if you stick with it, you'll realize they are not exactly our regular stereotypes.There are some powerful actors. But the acting is kind of disappointing.The best part of this movie is the action scenes. And while they are the most amazing actions I've seen in a very long time, it felt like they lacked something else.Another clever thing about Kingsman is the subplots. What this film lacked in the main plot, partially made up with it's subplots. I'm not gonna spoil them by giving any example.Final verdict: 7.4/10, you have got to watch it. Whatever vibes it gives at first, trust me it ain't that kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poorly written, bloody, vile, tribute to violence and perversion. This film is a cross between the awful 1998 Avengers film ( the one with Sean Connery, Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman), Pulp Fiction, and South Park. Those who cannot build substantial characters and plots, substitute with profanity, vulgarity, and weak special effects. I am disappointed that Michael Caine, Colin Firth, and Samuel L. Jackson even gave this script a second glance. I was warned not to spend even $1.50 at the discount theater on this one, but I just have to see if I like a film for myself. I'm sorry I wasted a Netflix choice on this one. Trust me, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Movie To Start Off The Spy Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kingsman The Secret Service is based on a comic book, The Secret Service by Dave Gibbons and Mark Millar. I can't say how the movie compares to the comic, because I haven't read it. I'm told the story differs substantially. It's a fun return to the 60's spy movies where the emphasis was on style, gadgets and cars. It's also a very British movie, which will confuse the American audiences. It's still a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. Could've done with out the abundant CGI effects. The prologue has several spies hanging in from a helicopter as they wing into the compound of a middle eastern warlord. One of them is killed in the mission and it's up to agent Galahad (Colin Frith) to deliver the terrible news to his fallen comrade's wife and young child. He gives the widow a medallion. It has the letter "K" on it and he tells her to call them if they ever needs anything. When the widow refuses the medallion, he hands to the toddler,reminding him to take good care of his mother.Forward to the present. The toddler has grown up to be Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Taron Egerton) a talented young man with not much of a future. His mom has taken up with a thug and has another child. After getting tossed in a cell for stealing a car from a local tough, Eggsy remembers the medallion he wears, calls the number on the back and asks for help. Suddenly he's a free man and walks out to meet Agent Galahad, AKA Harry, the same man who brought the horrible news to him and his mother about his father's death. Harry is from the John Steed school of British secret agents and looks dapper in a suit with an umbrella. He tells Eggsy about the secret service organization his father and him belonged to. When some of the local hooligans show up looking for revenge over the car theft, Harry takes them all out with combined martial arts and his gadget- enhanced umbrella.At the same time, we are introduced to the criminal mastermind every good spy movie needs. In this instance its Richmond Valentine (Samuel L Jackson), an internet billionaire who dresses flamboyantly and speaks with a lisp. He's decided his private efforts to stop ecological disaster have been a waste of time. Now he's come up with a new plan: eliminate the source of the problem, i.e., most of the world's human population. But Harry's private secret service organization, the Kingsman, has Valentine in their sites. Will they be able to stop him before he realizes his sinister plan?Much of Kingsman The Secret Service concerns Eggsy's training. At the beginning of the film, one of the Kingsman operatives is taken out by a anchorwoman of Valentine. Since there are only 12 active field operatives at any given time, each of the other agents nominate a successor. Of course, Harry nominates Eggsy and he moves into the training compound with the other candidates. The training is rigorous and the trainees are informed by the their instructor, and Kingsman tech specialist, "Merlin", some of them may not survive. There's unexpected encounters with weapons, potential drowning and a particularly scary scene with a high altitude sky dive. Naturally, most of the other candidates are Cambridge and Oxford snobs, making fun of Eggsy's working class accent.The actual Kingsman organization is something of a mystery. In the comic the agents simply worked for a branch of the British government. Like Mr. Bond, it was a "ministry" always seems to be some shadowy government branch overseen by men in bowler hats. But the organization in Kingsman The Secret Service is an independent organization. Harry takes Eggsy to their headquarters early in the film and it turns out to be a high-end tailor shop, "The Kingsman", which has been making uniforms and suits for the British government for centuries. As Harry describes it, the firm was wealthy, but lacked heirs. Concerned if they did nothing, there might not be a British government to clothe, the company decided to put its vast money into toward a secret society designed to serve Britain and humanity. Although, like UNCLE HQ, the outside of the shop may look ordinary, it's the doorway into a vast organization with its own weapons, finances, and technology. Running the show is agent "Arthur", played by the venerable Michael Caine.Another topic Harry occasionally talks about is how gentleman are born, not made. The smart suit worn by a Kingsman is his suit of armor. It's also bullet proof. "Manners make the man", Harry proclaims just before he locks the door behind him to deal with some punks. Even when meeting in virtual, the 12 Kingsman agents sit at a table, not round, but rectangular. It's an amusing application of Thomas Malory to the modern world.Looks like 2015 is the year of the spy movie. Kingsman The Secret Service shows it's off to a good start. www.spysafehouse.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable spy spoof</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will say that what made the film rather enjoyable was despite the fact that it was a comical but more violent and bloody version of the James Bond series, but it doesn't take itself too seriously and manages to be a good escape. The film deals with Harry attempting to recruit a new kings men which is basically a new spy after one is killed on a rescue mission. Harry ends up reunited with an old recruit named Gary aka eggy who is the son of a fellow spy killed years earlier on a mission. I will say one of the most enjoyable highlights of the film was Sam Jackson who manages to make the villain valentine rather hilarious with his lisp and funny outlandish wardrobe. It is nice to also see mark us ill make a return to the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kingsman : The Secret Service is not a perfect action movie or deliver something new , but for sure it delivers a lot of fun "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a disaster start of Hollywood action movie of the past couple months for example Jupiter Ascending , Taken 3 or Blackhat , we're hoping that the director Matthew Vaughn who brought us a lot of great movies like Stardust , Kick-Ass or X- Men : First Class will come to change this bad flow of Hollywood Action movie .First thing first , this movie is pretty fun to watch and i love the decision of Matthew Vaughn to embrace that "Over the Top" of this movie and make the movie out kind of a mix between brutal bloody action scene and the black comedy stuff which makes this movie pretty unique.One other things that need to be talk is the Action Scene , it is really great and it proof that Matthew Vaughn can really directed the action scene well with his beautiful camera angle , camera movement and the flow of his characters movement just feels so alive that make the action scene always feels really cool.But i have to say that Kingsman : The Secret Service is not a perfect movie , with it's plot is pretty repetitive and predictable.The Characters them selves is also pretty repetitive and kind a boring with the same back story that has been used for like 100 times already , for example the mentor who wants to redeem his sin in the pass by taken the new crew , the bad guys that sees the human evil and try to "safe the world" in his way , the stepfather who always do bad things try to harm to the hero and his mom , a kid who lose something in the past and has to redeem himself and so on , these characters are so repetitive and also not set- up well enough to make me care about them that much.I also like the point of the movie that tries to satire the politics , class of society and Global Warming problems , unfortunately these point of the movie has not been dig deep enough to make it memorable or make me feels like these point of the movie are actually really really big deal in the real world , which is kind of a shame.Overall Kingsman : The Secret Service is not a perfect movie by any mean , it still have a repetitive plot , repetitive boring characters and sometimes the bad set-up of story by Matthew Vaughn , But even then it is still a fun movie to watch especially with it's amazing action scene and over the top black comedy style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the makers of James bond decided to make their movies a lot more funnier and kick-ass, they would have probably made Kingsman. The movie is a perfect amalgamation of fun, action and classy/rib-tickling dialogs. Colin firth was top notch in his role of gentleman, mr Spy who made action look so classy. The rest of the cast including Taron Egerton, Micheal Kane and Sofia Boutella were simply the right people chosen for the right characters. Perfectly blending in but Samuel L Jackson, took the calamitous-Mr-Comic-Villain to a new level but the ease with which he played mr Valentine. In a nutshell it was a perfect Valentines day, getaway provided for Mr Valentine and the spies. My verdict: Go watch it if you are the person who likes fun and action during and a laughing face, on yourself, after a two hour movie gets over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Secret that This Is A Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you think of Arthur, Lancelot, Merlin, and Galahad you most likely refer to the knights of the round table lore. Well this weekend, director Matthew Vaughn brings to the screen another variation of the classical names in the form of Kingsman: The Secret Service. After seeing the cardboard standees for months before the first trailer I pondered what was in store. So when the trailer came a calling this is what I, and maybe you, might expect: Insane Action, Samuel L Jackson being himself, Comedic dialog, and hopefully an engaging plot. Probably more, but I have a word limit. What you get:1. The team delivered on their promise of action, as Kingsman is loaded with high adrenaline scenes. From the get go things start off with a bang, and quickly transition into shootouts that are custom to the Bond film franchise. However, shootouts in this day and age can't be like the days of wild west, but require some extra edge. Again this movie succeeds, integrating both hand to hand and gunplay into well choreographed bouts of destruction where both villain and hero make their moves. Now you might be thinking, oh great another movie like the expendables, just what the world needs. Not the case my friends. You see, Kingsman does something that is rare these days in which there is a purpose for the action. All the exciting scenes have a purpose in this film and each one is pertinent to the plot instead of just there to add some boom to the mix. Even better is that the action is not restricted to just shoot outs as well. No you're not having an auditory hallucination, the action extends beyond the bullets and bombs. The first half of the film is all about the interview, detailing training without going too extreme. However, just because our recruits are training doesn't mean the world stops, and the rest of the agents are out progressing the story as they try to solve the crime at hand. Regardless, the action is well done and proof that you can still have a decent story with action to support. 2. Samuel L Jackson is still the same man we have always seen: dark and funny. Once again he steps into his bad boy role, only this time dropping the forlorn intimidation for a charismatic homeboy trying to change the world. His delivery of his explanations are hilarious, playful and straight to the point, yet still carrying that edge he is famous for. Adding the lisp to the lines was also a great move, and his role was one of the more enjoyable villains I've seen in a while. 3. Outside of Jackson though, the comedy was strong throughout the whole movie and performed in a variety of ways. The dialog is very clever and quick witted making fun of a variety of cultural trends and themes. Big macs, sex jokes, even clichéd spy movie references, nothing was left untouched by this film. Yet lines can only do so much. Fortunately with the cast they assembled the delivery of the screenplay was executed well. Colin Firth's sarcasm and prestige were excellent media to execute insults and observations. Taron Eggerton's bad boy, hard knocked life approach was perfect for the spy in training and carried a different type of edge that mixed well with the fray. Even the environmental comedy was fantastic, with multiple crashes, punches, and other acts of violence carrying a humor filled twist that had my roommate and I rolling in our chairs. However, the biggest laughs for me come from some of the darker jokes of the film, in particular one event that will have your head exploding with laughter. 4. This brings me to my next point of the movie; you get a lot of darkness to this tale. Audience members will be subjected to people being cut in half, bullets flying out of heads, extreme violence, and racist antics, and I'm still not covering everything. Now you might think this ruins a good movie, but it doesn't, as the darker nature of this film brought suspense into the movie. How you ask? Simple, they are not afraid to push their characters to the limit, even pulling a few surprises like the Walking Dead that may just have you saying "What the f&amp;(*". The darker aspects of this movie help round out the film and provide some valuable story plots and action, that a lighter hearted tone might have limited. Nevertheless, I caution for squeamish and younger audience members to check themselves before seeing this film, or they might become haunted or sickened by the inhumane (and sometimes ridiculous) moments. As my buddy said, Kingsman is a movie that has a lot of qualities and all blended together in a manner that is balanced. The story is laid out quite well, the plot itself engaging and organized to allow for action and comedy to take its place. All of the action had a purpose and was dynamic as opposed to other films of the genre. Comedy wise, again the dynamic nature of it allows lots of jokes and bashing on just about every culture. Vaughn and his team have made a great film that was well shot, well edited, and packed with enough excitement to make the two hours fly by. Yes, the darker themes were not quite expected, and the cursing/ cultural insults were a little much for me at times. However, both my buddy and I strongly recommend hitting this film in the theaters, especially with the dry spell coming up. My score for this film: Action/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had the opportunity to see a Thursday night advance premiere screening in King of Prussia of this movie accompanied by my unofficial fiancé. We both enjoyed it The story revolves around a spy who recruits and mentors a lower class young man for a spy agency called Kingsman. The movie contains references to several spy films and TV shows such as the Bond franchise and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. The tropes of such films and shows are discussed, spoofed, and at one point busted. The cast was excellent and seemed to enjoy their roles. Colin Firth was outstanding as the veteran secret agent who recruits and mentors the protagonist played by newcomer Taron Egerton. This movie has plenty of mayhem including an already famous church fight scene in which Colin Firth's character takes out about 80 people. If you enjoy spy films you will enjoy Kingsman:The Secret Service.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not believe how spectacular this movie was.Despite it's similarities to X-men first class, Mathew Vaughn crafted a amazing film with better action and special effects.Colin Firth plays a Bond-like distinguish gentlemen who recruits a new member to his club, Men in Black style, in order to face Samuel Jackson who plays a villain who made billions with technology and has a warp vision on how to use his money to "save the Earth"The movie pokes fun on old school style 007 movies while being heavily influence by it. Like Vaughn points out, too many movies are in the trend of trying too hard to be real and Grimm, so Vaughn comes at you with something a little more fun and playful. I thought it was going to suck cause they released it during the cold instead of waiting for warmer weather, but perhaps it was actually the R rating for words inappropriate for American languages.And the violence was superb. Well choreographed like it was coming straight out of Hong Kong. Vaughn does some interesting things with the camera movement while the action takes place. Combined with a great score that complements the fight scenes.Even though his act was more a parody, Samuel Jackson was up there with the best Bond villains, weaving a colorful archetype of a man who thinks he's doing what's best for the world in what turned out to be a very cleaver, over the top plot. Aided by a cool henchmen, with blades on her prosthetic limbs, it makes you wonder what would happen if he went heat-to-head with Roger Moore.This movie surprised me. The action was top notched, it had an awesome villain, and a cool plot, and it was a humorous parody worthy of Austin Powers. Vaughn took what he learned from X-Men first class, added it to this movie, than dialed it up to eleven. Good Show!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eggsy gets to train as a secret agent for the same ultra-top secret organisation which his father once worked for.This is James Bond at boot camp, featuring Colin Firth as Eggsy's mentor, Samuel L Jackson as the villain, Mark Strong as the training sergeant, Michael Caine as head of the organisation, and newcomer Taron Egerton plays Eggsy. Now let's take on board that it is directed by Matthew Vaughan, co-written with Jane Goldman, and based on a comic by Mark Millar, and we should be prepared for it to be original, full of (often outrageous) action, stupefyingly violent, overflowing with profanity, very funny, and vastly entertaining. Think Roger Moore-era Bond crossed with Kick-Ass and Wanted.Millar doesn't come across as likable when I see him interviewed but, by heavens, the films based on his stuff are entertaining. For me, everything in this film works ? the performances are all terrific, the action is great and often laugh out loud (it manages to be both funny and credibly visceral ? think the birdman at the start of Kick-Ass or the computer keyboard in Wanted). I could have done without quite so many F-words, but oh well.Recommended if you enjoyed Wanted or Kick-Ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world is starting to face the direct effects of global warming. Environmental changes are happening and everyone is starting to realize the real damage of using gasoline. This movie presents the people fighting against pollution as the rich bad people who wants people to fight with each other and die. Everybody knows that the reality is just the opposite of what is presented in this movie. First of all people fighting against pollution are hippies, not elitists. The real enemy is the gasoline giants who poison the planet and earn huge bank balance. Not the environmentalists or poor hippies. Environmentalists or the new age people are pro peace people.The oil giants create war and now they show pro-environmentalists as bad people. Any step towards reduction of the use of carbon fuels needs to be encouraged in this time. This movie discourages pro-environmentalists by presenting them as crazy rich people. This movie apparently serves the interests of countries that are creating wars to gain control over the oil assets all over the world. Their never ending hunger for power is going to destroy themselves one day.</fullReview>

It consists of a stupid, lazy, non-credible script combined with stupid, amateur, unconvincing acting and stupid, gratuitous, repetitive violence. To add insult to injury, in the last few scenes ,it objectifies women in such a tasteless and immoral way that it made me quite angry and really shouldn't have been allowed to be in the movie.There is NO way that the reviews for this movie are genuine, NO WAY! This film deserves -10 out of 10, it's soooo awful. I expected it to be bad going in as I had done some research, but my husband had wanted to see it so I said I would go. I expected the stereotypes and over- the-top violence, and I got that. But I also expected a plot, some laughs and decent action, but that was TOTALLY absent. Such a rubbish movie. With a title like 'Kingsman' you would expect a bit of class, but instead it deliberately stayed in the gutter and everyone in it was tainted by its awful stench. The writers, director, producer and actors should be ashamed to be associated with such garbage. I was certainly ashamed of myself for ever having seen it. Absolute crud. Yuk! Don't go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kingsman: The Secret Service</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh described this film as over the top, the clips and trailers I saw certainly looked that way, with good critic reviews as well I was definitely up for it, directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake, Stardust, Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class). Basically secret agent Harry Hart and "Galahad" (Colin Firth) is unable to prevent the death of fellow agent Lee (Jonno Davies), feeling guilty he personally delivers a bravery medal to the agent's widow Michelle Unwin (Samantha Womack) and his young son, Gary "Eggsy" Unwin (Alex Nikolov), saying that if they ever need help, they should call the phone number on the back of the medal and deliver a coded message. Seventeen year later, unknown assailants kidnap climate scientist Professor James Arnold (Mark Hamill), they are led by assassin Gazelle (Sofia Boutella), who has bladed prosthetic legs, and her employer, internet billionaire Richmond Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson), Hart's compatriot "Lancelot" (Jack Davenport) is killed in a failed rescue attempt, as a philanthropist Valentine meets various heads of state and VIPs, some who afterwards go missing, he also announces a giveaway of SIM cards, granting free cellular and Internet access. In London, unemployed young adult "Eggsy" (Taron Egerton) lives with his mother, infant half-sister and abusive stepfather Dean (Geoff Bell), despite his intelligence and capability he dropped out of Royal Marines training, he now lives aimlessly, he is arrested for joyriding a stolen car, and he decides to call the number on the medal and utter the code word. Hart releases him from prison, then introduces him to the world of the Kingsmen, a secret intelligence agency for which he works for, and which Eggsy's late father worked for, following Lancelot's death the agency are looking to recruit a new agent, Eggsy agrees to apply, he joins a group of other candidates, including Roxy (Sophie Cookson) who he quickly forms a friendship with, the candidates are overseen by senior Kingsman agent "Merlin" (Mark Strong), they will be eliminated one by one until the right person is found. Tests for the candidate include, without their knowledge, their room filling with water until they manage to escape, training a group of puppies, with Eggsy getting a small pug he names "JB" (after Jack Bauer from 24), and a jump from a plane where they are told in mid-air that one of them has no parachute, those who open their working chutes early are eliminated. Meanwhile the Kingsmen investigate Valentine and his connection with VIP disappearances, Hart tracks down Arnold to get information, but a chip is implanted in Arnold's head and causes an explosion, killing him and putting Hart into a coma for a short time, when he recovers he poses as a billionaire and meets with Valentine for dinner, it is there that Valentine compares the human race to a virus, with global warming being the fever caused, he intends to do something about the problem before it gets worse. Valentine is found to be a member of an obscure hate group church in Kentucky, there Hart finds him and Gazelle conducting a test, a signal is broadcast to his SIM cards, this causes everyone in the church, including Hart, to become uncontrollably violent, fighting a mass brawl breaks out with the people fighting each other to the death, but Hart comes out as the sole survivor, Eggsy, Merlin and Kingsmen leader "Arthur" (Sir Michael Caine) watch the chaos via video link. Hart is approached by Valentine, he explains his plan: the signal will broadcast worldwide, using his satellite network, so the human race will be culled, so the Earth will suffer no further damage, leaving only the select few deemed worthy of life, those who side with Valentine with protective microchips in their heads, with his planned revealed Valentine kills Hart with a bullet to the head. Eggsy failed the final test, refusing to shoot his dog, meaning that Roxy became the new Lancelot, but he returns to Kingsmen headquarters, where he discovers Arthur has a microchip and is his convert, he avoids a kill attempt and kills the leader, so he teams up with Roxy and Merlin to stop Valentine and his scheme. Roxy goes into the stratosphere in a high-altitude balloon vehicle to fire a missile towards Valentine's satellite network, while Eggsy and Merlin assault Valentine's mountain bunker directly, tackling the many armed guards. The signal is transmitted momentarily causing worldwide chaos, but the satellite is knocked out, Eggsy fights his way through the security forces, the security chips are detonated by Merlin, with all the heads of those part of Valentine's plan killed as their heads explode, Gazelle and Eggsy fight until she is defeated, and finally Valentine is killed and the world is saved. In the end Eggsy becomes a full Kingsman, he is able to reach out to his mother and offers her a nicer house and a chance to get away from her abusive partner, but he is willing to fight those who will stop him from doing so. Also starring Edward Holcroft as Charlie, Richard Brake as The Interrogator and Theo Barklem-Biggs as Ryan. Egerton is a great choice as the streetwise young agent to be, Firth is cool as the crisp agent, Jackson has a ball as the lisping megalomaniac who ironically heaves at violence, and supporting cast members Caine and Strong are great as well. The characters are all very good, the agents codenamed after the knights of the Round Table is good, the James Bond style gadgetry is fantastic, the outrageous violence does not disappoint, the moments of comedy are funny, and the fight sequences are well executed, it is a terrific fast-moving spy action thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This ain't that kind of movie, Bro."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll have to preface my review with an encouraging opening remark because I enjoyed the movie well enough for what it was. Others on this board seem to be of a general overall opinion that this was a James Bond genre spy film taken to an extreme level with over the top violence and excessively crude language. Oddly enough, I'm OK with all of that. There was a generous heaping of all the non-stop, violent action that one could ask for, even for Tarentino fans.So here's where my rant come into play. Sorry, but I just can't help myself when the film invites the kind of criticism I'm about to unleash. I have a big problem with liberal hypocrisy, and it's never been more evident than in this picture. We'll start with the major premise of the villain going in, Richard Valentine, portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson. No beef with Jackson here. But his main agenda has to do with solving the world's 'global warming' problem. To be up front about it, I don't believe global warming or climate change is a man made condition based on common sense backed up by eons of history in which the planet has gone through numerous ice ages and come out of them without human intervention.Valentine's prescription for global warming - wipe out a good portion of humanity who are contributing to it. But, but, but - only those who are not part of the elite class like the folks invited to his massive house party. Which is just about everyone on the planet. See, if liberals and progressives verbalized what they really believe, this would be part of their solution as well. We'll start with those pesky Conservatives and Republicans. They're too much of a problem to debate about this.Next - gun violence. While the entire liberal propaganda machine tries to control gun ownership, there's apparently no problem with making movies in which one of the film's heroes takes out what, twenty, thirty, heck make it a hundred people in a wild melee at a hate church. By the way, that was an exceptionally well choreographed and edited action sequence, one of the best ever. It'll be hard to top, though we know someone will try.OK, how about the War on Women. Gee, the Swedish Princess at the end of the story sure knew how to reward her 'savior' Eggsy (Taron Egerton). If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. I'm not squeamish but it's just too distasteful to describe it here.How about creating conflict? Valentine's hate-gizmo is just an extension of the mindset the current administration perpetrates every day - white vs black, rich vs poor, men vs women (War on Women, remember), old vs young and so on. So it was genuinely stunning to see the picture at least take a swipe at the current POTUS by having his head blown off when Merlin (Mark Strong) tampers with the controls! Folks, I think you better see this picture before the President has a North Korean reaction to it, know what I mean.So there you pretty much have it. Like I say, aside from my critical analysis, I enjoyed the picture. Biggest surprise was when Valentine blew away Harry (Colin Firth), almost as unexpected as George Clooney whacking Brad Pitt in "Burn After Reading". Tarentino would be proud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep your expectations low ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sadly I found Kingsman was not all it's hyped up to be but it does have some saving grace scenes. There was also a fair bit of fun, plenty of tongue in cheek, some really good action scenes too and only a few holes. The 'violence' never extended beyond being comically gruesome and stayed within its 15 rating limit.Colin Firth was excellent and apparently performed 80% of his own stunts - which were impressive. But the overriding thought I am left with is: "a film like that must surely have had enough in the budget to either cast a decent actor to play the lead role, or else to have paid for Taron Egerton to have had some acting lessons!" That guy's 'acting' was chronically painful! Get past that, leave any high expectations at home and I think most people would enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vaughn had a shot at a classy spy film, but overshot the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walking into the cinema... I was looking forward to this film. Kingsman looks to be a return to the old-style spy films, but is this film meant to be a farce, a fantasy or an attempt to get back to the traditional Bond style?Overall rating: 1.5 stars Cinematic value: 1.5 stars Family value: 0 stars"You are about to embark on the most dangerous job interview in the world." - MerlinFor those who are clued into the comic world, Kingsman: The Secret Service is an acclaimed series from Mark Millar and Dave Gibbons. The spy-recruitment story is not original, but seeing Colin Firth (The King's Speech) as a super-spy presents new possibilities to this familiar genre. Firth plays Harry Hart, who is a part of the Kingsmen, a super-secret spy agency that attempts to recruit Gary Unwin (Taron Egerton) to the spy world. Egsy is the typical misguided youth who does not see his potential until Harry Hart comes into his life. The recruit goes through an accelerated spy training that leads to his role in saving the world. Matthew Vaughn (X-men: First Class) seems to be attempting to go old-school and bring back tailored suits in the espionage world, but quickly shows that this is not going to be your father's spy film. Not to be considered too prudish, but this film pushes the edge of the envelope with language, violence and sexual situations and then keeps going. Gone are the days of subtle winks and innuendo, this visual experience smacks you in the face with twists on the traditional spy story and then kicks you while you are down for good measure. Vaughn seems to take from Quentin Tarantino's playbook, where nothing is too extreme. Tarantino has moved film making to a new level and his writing is unparallelled in the industry, but Vaughn is not Tarantino. Sometimes violence and language does add to the entertainment experience and the storyline, but this film merely is trying to shock the audience and hide the poorly executed story. The characters lack depth and as Harry says in the film, "Those films are only as good as their villain." Samuel L. Jackson as the villain, Valentine, is not convincing and is poorly written. Which can be said of the film, to Kingsman seems to be marketed to the teen market, but this film will make even the most discerning adult look away and blush at the closing scenes.In attempting to find redemptive qualities to Kingman was difficult, there is nothing to consider. The only recommendation is to choose another film. There is no redeeming value to this film and it would go against all sensibilities to recommend it. Leaving the cinema... Reality did not meet expectations with this film. The marketing is deceptive and the film is not for the audience they are targeting. Usually willing to allow for artistic license, this film is a film of extremes that does not deserve an audience. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is there a 'line' or discernment to film viewing? (John 7:24, Philippians 1:9-10) 2. Where does the notion of the sanctity of life come? (Genesis 1:27, Matthew 5: 21-22) Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is so bad and totally overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this last night with my wife in a screening and we both thought it was total tripe. It was a brainless movie with terrible acting, story and script. Even the special effects were done badly. The story was absolutely rubbish and it was also far too violent. The violence in this movie is so extreme it will make many people uncomfortable - I normally have no issues with violence in movies however this was totally and unnecessarily excessive. There was also sadly the usual brain-dead racial stereotyping, propaganda and ignorance in the movie as has become the norm for Hollywood movies and some of the acting was so bad it was beyond laughable. I have never seen acting as bad as Samuel L Jackson's acting in this movie and I also have no idea why people like Michael Caine agreed to be in this rubbish.This film has been totally overrated by the media and has had ridiculous blanket advertising in most UK cinemas. It's sad to see this kind of rubbish getting so much financial backing and being forced on people - there are so many good movies which get no advertising or support. This is seriously one to avoid.</fullReview>
