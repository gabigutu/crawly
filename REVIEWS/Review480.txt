		<shortDescription>Above average police-procedural noir shows MGM's skittish touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An off-duty Los Angeles police detective is shot and killed one night with an unexplained thousand dollars found in his pocket. It falls to his former partner (Van Johnson) to track down his killers and try to exonerate him. Scene of the Crime, which tells the story, stays a police procedural with a few twists and touches that raise it a notch or two above the routine.First of all, Johnson's wife (Arlene Dahl) has fallen prey to the dissatisfactions common to her lot. She's tired of their evenings, in and out, being ruined by yet another summons to duty (`Whenever the telephone rings, it cuts me,' she cries); she tired of rolling his dice rigged to come up seven, a ritual that supposedly bids him luck.On the job, he has his burdens, too. His new partner (John McIntyre) is getting on in years and his sight is failing. And under Johnson's wing is nestled rookie cop Tom Drake, learning the ropes. Outside the office there's an abrasive police reporter (Donald Woods) chasing the corruption angle; there's also the network of low-lifes who serve, if the pressure is right, as stoolies - most vivid of them is the young Norman Lloyd.Word filters up that the killing was the work of a couple of downstate `lobos' who have been knocking over bookie operations. Going undercover, Johnson starts romancing a stripper one of them used to date (Gloria De Haven, in the movie's sharpest performance). Even though he's working her, he finds his emotions in play - and even though it turns out that she's working him, too, she has no emotions.Under Roy Rowland's direction, Scene of the Crime keeps its plotting straightforward, though with some uncharacteristic bursts of violence. The movie's studio, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was celebrated for its lavish color musicals, not for the unsentimental style of film noir. That probably accounts for the final shot's being a reconciliatory kiss, in hopes that such a sweet image might expunge all the urban squalor that went before it. Luckily, it doesn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scene of a Good Action Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very entertaining look at big city cops and robbers with shades of film noir showing though. The standout performance in a potentially femme fatale role is Gloria DeHaven. I suspect the writers, John Bartlow Martin and Charles Schnee, along with director Roy Rowland, had experiences with untrustworthy women, for Lili (Gloria DeHaven) could turn any man's heart to putty, then fool him over and over. Van Johnson too turns in a subdued performance which is called for in the character (Mike Conovan) he plays. Conovan's very liberal wife, especially for 1949, is played by Arlene Dahl, who is fed up with the demands of her husband's job but who also trusts her husband to be with a vixen and still stay true to her. This is an effective counterbalance to the untrustworthiness of Lili. Great supporting roles abound filled with standout performances from John McIntire's "too old to cut the mustard" part all the way to the Sleeper, Norman Lloyd. Yuk, Yuk, it's great. There is a lot of realistic blood and guts thrown in complete with car chases that foretell things to come in action movies. Heat up some popcorn, get a cold one, then sit back and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cop Killing In Los Angeles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Van Johnson plays it a lot rougher than usual when cast as a hardboiled police detective in Scene Of The Crime. He's got reason to be hard in this case. A fellow detective has been murdered, shot down in the mean streets of Los Angeles. The victim had a thousand dollars in his pocket and may have been doing some off duty guard duty for some bookmakers. Which would make the cop and incidentally Van's friend a crooked cop.Which among other things is what Captain Leon Ames wants Van to find out as well as bring in the killer. What Van and his squad uncover is a gang of crooks who are robbing these illegal gambling establishments, be they bookmaking parlors, dice games, poker games, whatever. This case is the main concern of this film, but Johnson has a whole lot of other things on his plate. A partner, John McIntire, who is slowing up with age, a young detective Tom Drake who is learning the ropes as fast as Van can teach him, and his wife Arlene Dahl who would like very much for her husband to get out of the cop business.Two other performances really stand out in this film. First Gloria DeHaven as singer/gangster girl friend who's definitely the most hardboiled character in the film. Her reasons for her actions tread into adult areas that the Code frowned on, but are still implied. Secondly Norman Lloyd you will not forget as one of Van's stool pigeons who might just be missing a whole suit in his deck of cards. Lloyd will definitely make your skin crawl.Scene Of The Crime is a good cop drama, atypical for MGM at that time, but they would soon be doing more of these.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine cop drama...and which came first?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did, as some people think, "Scene of the Crime" invent the cop drama clichés that have been a mainstay of television and film for so long? Or were they already established and just copied by this film? Not being an expert in the genre, I don't know. I do know that despite attempts by some people to elevate this movie to film noir status, it's not that great. Dore Schary put this into production when he took over MGM. I guess he wanted MGM to be more like Warner Brothers. It stars Van Johnson, Arlene Dahl, John McIntyre, Leon Ames, and Gloria DeHaven.When a cop is killed with a roll of dough found on him, his fellow officers set out to investigate the crime and clear the man's name."Scene of the Crime" is similar in its way to "Dragnet" - it shows the daily grind of detectives as they put together a case. There are a couple of very good scenes, including one in which Mike (Van Johnson) arrests a suspect, and shooting starts when they get outside of the apartment building. Still handcuffed to Mike, the perp jumps into a building stairwell. There's also a good car chase.For some reason, Van Johnson did these baby-faced tough guys well - perhaps it was his New York accent, but he pulls off the role of the dedicated Mike. He was set to be Elliot Ness in the TV "Untouchables" when his wife Evie called Desi Arnaz the night before and held him up for more money. Arnaz called Robert Stack and told him to report to the set the next day. A friend of mine who has lived in LA for over 50 years and socialized with many stars said that Arlene Dahl was the most beautiful woman of everyone he had met. Seeing her in this, you can believe it. She is a spectacular beauty if her acting in some spots isn't the best. Gloria De Haven, usually a vibrant ingenue, plays against type as a tramp, which makes it interesting."Scene of the Crime" is gritty-looking enough but suffers from being slow in spots and loaded with clichés. There isn't anything to make it truly special. That could be because by now, we've seen it all before. Perhaps in 1949, it was fresh. But I have my doubts that even back then, it broke any new ground.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the lesson here is that you can take the crime drama out of MGM, but you can't take MGM out of the crime drama. With noirish location shots, the new Dore Schary regime changed the usual MGM look somewhat, yet the movie still boasts a string of stars and star power for which the studio was known. The trouble is that working Van Johnson, Arlene Dahl, Tom Drake, Gloria DeHaven, Donald Woods, and a string of "name" supporting players into the screenplay with sufficient screen time for each overstretches the results. Despite some effective moments (the hotel room fistfight, the fright screams from the burning car), the movie suffers from too much flab for overall effect. For example, the two rather lengthy scenes with Norrie Lorfield (Tom Helmore), the rival for Conovan's (Johnson) wife, are simply a needless distraction from the main plot, and work to dilute the overall effect. In fact, the entire marital subplot should have been dropped or at least minimized, but it seems that the studio was not satisfied with the kind of fast, efficient little crime drama that RKO, for one, routinely turned out. I'm tempted to say that just as movie spectaculars and historical epics depend on big budgets for optimal effect, crime dramas and noirs depend on the tight disciplining constraints of small ones. That way, production values don't interfere with the story line. Here it appears that MGM's celebrated production values over-produced the number of feature players, which, in turn, multiplied the various subplots, or vice-versa. In either case, it's too bad the script didn't eliminate a few of these in favor of giving Norman Lloyd's truly memorable character, Sleeper, more screen time. He's the kind of unique character that could have transformed this otherwise forgettable exercise into a memorable one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scene of the Crime is directed by Roy Rowland and adapted to screenplay by Charles Schnee from the story " Smashing the Bookie Gang Members" written by John Bartlow Martin. It stars Van Johnson, Arlene Dahl, Gloria DeHaven, Tom Drake, John McIntire and Leon Ames. Music is by André Previn and cinematography by Paul Vogel.When a fellow detective is gunned down in suspicious circumstances, Mike Conovan (Johnson) decided to dig a little deeper...Only fools bet horses - fools keep me prosperous. A rough and tough noir piece this one. It finds MGM jumping onto the noir bandwagon and putting golden boy Van Johnson forward as a hardboiled hero, and it works. In essence it's about a cop who is disillusioned with his job and faces static at home from his lovingly concerned wife (Dahl). Circumstance drags him into the fray, thus risking everything in life he holds dear, but hell bent on cracking the case and bringing to justice crooks and killers, he ploughs right on in to the frying pan.Yuk Yuk Yuk.Pic is in keeping with the Dragnet type of cop films that were so productive in the era. So we get plenty of dry conversations and verbal jousting, splendidly scripted by Schneee who gives thought to the various characterisations. Violence is never far away to add an edge to the standard plotting, while it's sexy and romantic in equal measure - poor Johnson has an adoring Dahl waiting at home for him, while sultry stripper Lili (DeHaven) is all over him when he goes incognito on the case.Dead Pigeon.Characters all have solitary nicknames, such as Piper (McIntire ace with a tongue as sharp as a knife), Sleeper, CC, Turk and Hippo. There's Bogart references to keep you tuned into the world the pic is operating out of, and the black and white photography, though short on thematic chiaroscuro, keeps the hardboiled atmosphere on the high heat. Cast are uniformly on song, delivering the spiky dialogue with a rich dryness beloved by fans of such fare, and the mystery element has a strong enough current to pull you in for the finale. Good stuff for the discerning fans. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LA detective Van Johnson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An LA police detective (Van Johnson) investigates the murder of another detective and gets involved with night club singer and stripper played by Gloria De Haven. The story has a neat double cross. A criminal organization from "down south" sends a couple of "lobos" to LA in order to take over a bookmaking syndicate. Corruption is at the center of the story as the dead detective was carrying a wad of cash. Johnson's out to prove that he (dead detective) wasn't on the take. His street contact Sleepy (Norman Lloyd) provides some of the films more vivid moments, and Jerome Cowan (Sam Spade's partner in Maltese Falcon) has a great part as "fixer" Arthur Webson. Johnson does very well in the part, combining breeziness that he honed in earlier films with sufficient grit to be believable as a tough detective. His wife played by Arlene Dahl looks great and they share some pretty good chemistry in their scenes. The film does a good job of capturing the story's different elements and cohesively combining them. The action doesn't always come, but when it does it is surprisingly sudden and brutal for the times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the nitty-gritty side of M-G-M...compact and well-written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two veteran Los Angeles police detectives and a well-meaning rookie set out to find the killer of an off-duty fellow officer who may have been on the take. This is an L.A. filled with dangerous broads, bookie joints, ex-bootleggers in on a new racket, and cops in natty suits and broad-billed hats. The pulpy, slangy dialogue is fun at times, as are the performances from Van Johnson and Gloria DeHaven (playing a chanteuse "with a figure like champagne and a heart like the cork"). Other, later crime-dramas would quickly up the ante on such a scenario, but this one is a fine example of the compact policer. M-G-M was downsizing their budgets at the time and trying their hand at different types of films--which provided the perfect opportunity for matinée idols like Johnson to stretch their acting muscles. The results here are not exactly noir, but more from an overtly-ordinary, overtly-jaded mold, with everyday people going about their business and getting the job done. If it isn't exciting, at least it's highly competent. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early version of Madigan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though not as good as the 1968 classic Madigan, which changed the way crime movies or is it cop movies were shot, this is way above average with a laconic performance by Van Johnson. Johnson is a cop on the trail of a killer. He has his way of doing things and he also has a wife who is tired of his being a cop and his missing important events propped up with the chance that one of those visits away will be his last. They always roll a dice that shows three three. Regulatory scenes where the boss chews them out, scenes interrogating the baddies move this police procedural as an earlier reviewer has noted. Also, I don't consider this a spoiler but if not, skip this and the next line, his partner gets killed as expected, and a tough shoot out which is shot and edited like a scene from the late sixties complete with exploding car, realistically done makes this movie a perfect three star applause. This movie is obviously the work of new MGM boss Dore Scary who preferred realistic movies with messages and flawed characters made at a reasonable budget. Louis B. Mayer despised these movies. To make everybody happy, it should be noted the movie was a hit, not a big hit but profitability wise, a big one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rather routine but interesting fanfare showcasing Van Johnson as a detective in hot pursuit of a policeman's killer and on the body, money was found to make it appear that the dead officer was on the take. The part where the dead officer's son sold his gun for $80.00 to the crooks was somewhat difficult to believe.Arlene Dahl plays Johnson's loving wife who begins to question their marriage as the Johnson character becomes obsessed with finding the killer. Real acting kudos must go here to Gloria De Haven, a moll who appears kind and you wonder how she got mixed up with such hoods. Her real persona shows by film's end as she is nothing more than a vicious broad whose complicity led to the death of several people.John McIntire represents the aging cop who refuses to retire due to failing eyesight. He literally goes out with a bang. Donald Woods briefly appears as a news reporter ready to write down any tidbit possible. Even in 1949, we are faced with low wages, lack of respect and a media ready to jump on the police even if one of them is a rotten apple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scene of the Crime (1949)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MGM is not a studio known for noir. This procedural is toothless and insincere, with a plot that's barely worth paying attention to (something about a dead cop and bookies, I dunno). Van Johnson in the lead comes up short, he doesn't handle the hard-boiled lingo very well. But some of the accoutrements are pretty hot stuff. This is my third Roy Rowland (fourth if you count his "Crime Does Not Pay" short) and as he proved in ROGUE COP and WITNESS TO MURDER he definitely has a good track record with the genre. The photography is excellent (though some of the sets look pretty cheap), the dialogue crackles, there's some nice touches like the diegetic music during a big fight scene, and the film has some awesome supporting performances. Norman Lloyd (so great), Gloria DeHaven ("A figure like champagne and a heart like the cork"), and Robert Gist really shine, and John McIntyre is always terrific. There's a lot to love in this movie and at first I was thrilled to be watching it. After a while, however, the ho-hum story becomes harder to care about. I really wanted to like this more, but despite its flaws there's definitely some worthwhile elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sleeper was my favorite character in this film. They shouldn't have knocked him off. He was worth lots of yuks and had the best dialog. I must confess I did doze off just before Van resigned from the force, so maybe I'm a little partial to the character of Sleeper.When Van was having his shoes shined and seeking info from the shoe shine guy I almost expected Leslie Nielsen to wander into the scene. It was straight out of Police Squad. Scene Of The Crime thrived at getting in every cop movie cliché. Many elements weren't even established clichés yet, but it was like the movie had an instinctive sense of what would become a cliché.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally entertaining film noir detective film, not private eyes but "Dragnet" like plainclothes police. The Sgt. Friday character is Lieutenant Mike Conovan (Van Johnson) who leads a very complicated life, simultaneously trying to solve the murder of an off-duty police detective while breaking in rookie detective C.C. Gordon (Tom Drake). Despite all this he still has time to listen to his wife Gloria (Arlene Dahl) whine about his job and to have a tame in the line of duty fling with sexy Lili (Gloria de Haven).The rookie detective character is basically just a excuse to throw a lot of late 40's police jargon into the script and to showcase "Dragnet" style back room police activities. Otherwise the story is nicely paced although little suspense is generated because everything is shown from the point of view of Conovan. So little is revealed about the other characters that the resolution is rather unsatisfying. "Scene of the Crime" was a transitional film as the genre moved from gangsters and private eyes to actual police departments. The police are portrayed in a very sympathetic light; contending with low pay, disillusionment, pressures from home, and a feeling of not being appreciated.Although Van Johnson does a decent job in the lead role, he was a poor choice (from both a physical and a acting style perspective) for the role of a cynical and conflicted tough cop. Johnson is much better suited to nice guy roles. Dahl soon gets on your nerves but you never tire of de Haven's Lili.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious Patter but This MGM Noir Wannabe is Worth a Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There they Go Again. MGM Trying to Capitalize on the Popular Films from RKO and WB that came to be Known as Film-Noir. The Descriptive Term was Only Coined in Retrospect. This is a Movie that has some Good Stuff and some Pretty Bad Stuff. It Seemed the Studio couldn't get it Quite Right. The Best Example is the Dialog. The Peppering Street and Gangster Slang is so Ripe that it Sounds Like some Really Trashy, Second Rate, Paperback and when it comes out of the Mouth of Van Johnson and Crew it is just Pretentious, Clunky, and Silly.There may be More Dated and Dumb Exclamatory Euphemisms used in this Crime-Cop-Noir than in any other Movie. But it all Sounds Rattled Off and Page Written and is Anything but Naturalistic. Even when Uttered by a Lamp Post Leaner Called the Sleeper (Norman Lloyd). That's the Weakest Part of this Slightly Entertaining Excursion into the Shadows. Speaking of Shadows, by the End of the Decade Studios, even those Under the Bright Lights of MGM, had Discovered the Artisticism and Power of those Noir Icons and in this One there are So Many that Even the Shadows have Shadows.Overall, it is a Curious Film, and One Worth a Watch for there are Some Things of Interest. Like a Couple of Beautiful Dames, Arlene Dahl and Gloria De Haven that Brighten Up the Screen, and a Workmanlike Supporting Cast with John McEntire as a Veteran Cop Delaying His Put Out to Pasture, the Best.Not Quite Film-Noir, Not Quite Hard-Boiled, Not Quite Suspenseful Police-Procedural, this Film In Fact, is an Example of MGM's Track Record with this Type of Thing, Mostly a Good Try, but Not-Quite.</fullReview>

It's all there--the corny dialogue, the shoe shine informant, the driving scenes inside the car, the lab boys...Hollywood has never really been good at portraying real-life police. They do, after all, deal in fiction, don't they?They do the same thing with war movies...always trying to make a point, instead of telling a simple story.Anyway, Scene of the Crime is an attempt at real-life police work, but, as do all police movies, this one falls woefully short.

		<fullReview>SCENE OF THE CRIME has a miscast VAN JOHNSON as a tough L.A. cop assigned to find out who killed his partner on the beat. The mild-mannered Johnson manages to do a capable enough job but he's clearly miscast in the role and seems to know it.Equally miscast is GLORIA DeHAVEN as Lilli, a tramp nightclub singer, but she manages to cope with her role in a better than average way. ARLENE DAHL is beautiful as Van's increasingly bitter wife who wishes he had the kind of job that wouldn't need her to pray for his safety every time the phone rings.It's obvious that James Ellroy never got his inspiration for LA. CONFIDENTIAL from this tepid MGM crime thriller. There's only an occasional burst of violence to remind viewers they're watching a police drama and one of the killings is effectively done in a startling way. But the characters are no more than pawns in a story that moves at a snail's pace and never rises above its crime story clichés.MGM must have been looking for a "new look", so they gave this one a gritty enough atmosphere of city streets at night and filled the cast with some convincing supporting players, particularly NORMAN LLOYD with his "Yuk, yuk" routine as a slightly crazy and sleazy suspect. TOM DRAKE is ill used as a rookie cop, but DONALD WOODS is surprisingly effective as a cynical journalist who writes about crooked cops.Not memorable, it's the kind of film you see once and then promptly forget within a short passage of time. Nice try but it fails to deliver the required punch.</fullReview>

Mike Conovan, Van Johnson, responsible for his death didn't make things any easier for him with his wife Glory, Arlene Dahl, just about having enough of him breaking a date for a night out or at home with the phone ringing telling him to report to duty on another murder or robbery case. It was Conovan who had Det. Monigan put back on the streets even though he was well over the hill to do that kind of work and at the same time too gong-ho to want to sit behind a desk.Feeling that he had to solve his former partners murder to clear his conscience Conovan goes to such lengths as getting romantically involved with the Turk's (Richard Benedick), who the prime suspect in Monigan's murder, gun moll nightclub singer Lili, Gloria DeHaven, who's secretly setting him up for a hit by the Turk and his goons.Conovan given a new partner Det. Fred Piper, John McIntire, is unaware that he's also over the hill and unable to do his job as a street cop, Piper is almost as blind as a bat. This leads him to unintentionally screw his partner by not recognizing a hood who was later picked up for his involvement in Monigan's murder.Turk &amp; Co. have been involved in knocking off the city's bookie joints but then stupidly giving the money back by losing it to the very same bookies that that ripped off by placing their bets with them. Conovan now having even more reason to find Monigan's killers with his new partner Piper also being murdered by Turk men tries to get Lili to open up on her boyfriend Turk but to no avail, she's just loves the two-timing lug too much to rat him out. Conovon does get hoodlum Authur Webson, Jerome Cowan,to sequel in order to save his butt by not having his name splashed across the front pages reporting, falsely, that he fingered the Turk's gang. This leads to the shoot-out at the end of the movie with the Turk and his boys being put out of action and behind bars.In the end the murdered Det. Monigan is exonerated of any dirty-doings with the mobsters with the Turk giving a death-dead confession to him being Monigan's killer and planting $1,000.00 of stolen bookie cash on him in order to make it look like he was dirty and and have the police think his death was the result of a disagreement with those hoodlums who were controlling him. That more then anything else helped ease young Ed's, as well as Det. Conavon, pain about his father's tragic death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dore Schary's crime against MGM... and humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, now I know where all those boring cop/homicide TV shows came from. I do believe they can be traced back to this movie. "Scene Of The Crime" feels more like a TV episode, or an episode of a serial. Complete with stock characters and situations - the hotshot cop who clashes with his superiors... the aging cop who doesn't want a desk job, despite failing eyesight... the reckless rookie... the double-crossing dame, etc.I like many of the actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this movie dull as I'm not a fan of the genre. I kept tuning out when they were discussing the case ...something about bookies and informers. And oh yeah, there was a stripper, played by the previously wholesome Gloria DeHaven. What I want to know is: Why did she keep calling Van Johnson "Uncle Wiggly"? Wasn't Uncle Wiggly a rabbit? A character from a children's book? What the heck does that have to do with anything? I guess I just don't get tough-guy Film Noir-ish kinda jargon.In fact, much of the dialogue made me mutter "nobody talks like that!" However, I could relate to one scene where the cop's wife (Arlene Dahl), who worries every time he goes to work, realizes that maybe she shouldn't have made her husband the center of her life. Yeah, I know that feeling of loving someone so much, being so dependent on them, that there's a constant fear for their safety. So there are moments of truth in this film, underneath the stylized dialogue and atmosphere which is trying so self-consciously to be gritty and REAL, that it actually seems unreal to me.A little background: this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began to put an end to the wholesome musicals that made MGM so great. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to movies. I kinda hate Dore Schary. Maybe we can blame him for all the pretentious, bleak movies being made today, wallowing in the ugly "truths" about life, focusing on (and, in my opinion, helping to perpetuate) the worst of humanity rather than the best. No longer uplifting us the way classic movies were designed to do - providing a necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II.Well, damn it, we still need that kind of distraction today! There's still plenty of depression and plenty of war. And what are people turning to nowadays when they want to escape? Trashy, brain-deadening Reality TV. Thanks a lot, Dore!</fullReview>

Dating from 1949, Scene of the Crime often plays more like a Coen Bros. movie set in the 1940's and filmed in black and white, except that the writer's ear for pastiche here isn't quite so well-tuned -- maybe this can be seen instead as the forerunner to Oscar-baiting schlock like Road to Perdition. Frankly, it's a wonder that this film isn't considered a classic by film professors and critics everywhere, considering how much it offers in term of overly articulated mannerist thrills cloaked in false significance ( much like the grandaddy of all such "fake art" films, Citizen Kane, or anything by Murnau. ) MGM is usually a studio that can do no wrong in my eyes, and I think any story, any atmosphere, even "gritty realism," can only benefit from grotesque overaestheticization. You could say I'm a disciple of the Minnelli school. But it takes a certain light touch to write mannered tough-guy dialogue of the Dashiell Hammett stripe, a willingness, perhaps, to let maybe one or two scenes pass without a line like "Careful, Mr. Wiggly, or you'll have thirteen fish to fry and no little wormies to catch them with." I made most of that up -- "Mr. Wiggly," unfortunately, made the cut -- but believe me, the dialogue is just that loonily inflated and riddled with non sequiturs. Even the lead cop's wife played by Arlene Dahl speaks like she has a moon-shaped scar under one eye and the Christian name Rocco. By the time Van Johnson turns in his badge with the line, "I'm sick to death of death and homicide," you'll wonder how the writer's fixation with ornate literary devices -- in this case, zeugma -- could ever have been misconstrued as "street." For those who have outgrown The Naked Gun series, this is the funniest cops-n-robbers film going.</fullReview>
