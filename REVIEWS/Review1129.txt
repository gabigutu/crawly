		<shortDescription>I FREAKING LOVED this movie!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is a spin on the horror genre from writer's Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot, I'll simply say that it involves 5 friends who fit the horror movie stereotypes (Jock, Slut, Party-Guy, Nerd, Virgin) who go to a cabin in the woods to party and get away from it all. Trouble is, its never really safe to go to a cabin in the woods is it?To be honest, the less you know about this film, the more awesome it will be. I felt that the trailer gave away a bit too much of the twists and turns one can expect from the film, but at the same time the image of a bird flying into a giant forcefield is what will set this film apart from the generic horror films that hit the theatres today. The Cabin In The Woods tells you upfront "You think you know the story..." but of course you don't. This is Joss Whedon after all. Fans of Buffy and Angel will get a kick out of this, as actors from that universe make their way into this film.It's been a long time since I've had a lot of fun at the movies and the Cabin in the Woods was a lot of fun. It's an odd movie to sell, because a lot of it has to be kept secret to make the second half of the movie exciting and fresh. It blends a few genres together, the two main ones being horror and comedy and it works perfectly. Both Whedon and Goddard worked on Buffy and Angel, which was a balancing act of genres, so they knew the right tone to get here and they nailed it. They take the clichéd aspects of every horror film and put it in here, to brilliant use. We actually get to see reasons for stupid character mistakes, which made that whole aspect of the film fun. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford have great chemistry together and stole every scene they're in. I would love to see these two character actors work together again, they made this film really fun and they are a joy to watch on the screen. The young actors, including Thor himself Chris Hemsworth, sell the clichéd horror characters very well. In most horror flicks I can't stand any of the characters, here I was rooting for all of them.There are some truly hilarious moments, I am dying to talk about them, but doing so would ruin the surprises. All I can say is that I was laughing throughout the entire film, I cheered, I clapped and I enjoyed myself. There are a lot of horror references, most notably The Evil Dead, so it's fun to spot things here and there. Horror fans I think will really get a kick of of this flick and I pray it does well, cause it's the most fun I've had in a long time. Drew Goddard's first directorial gig, he had a lot on his plate and he managed to pull off one hell of a film. It helps when you have someone like Joss Whedon in your corner, but I applaud him for being able to pull off the tone perfectly, I imagine the script to screen process was identical. This is a very clever script, with laughs, gore and surprises at every corner. When you have Goddard, whose worked on Buffy, Angel, Lost and wrote Cloverfield, teamed up with partner Joss Whedon who is one of the best writers working today, then you know you're walking into something special. I can't recommend this flick enough. When it comes out, you must go see it. Just makes sure you don't know much about it beforehand, or it might ruin the awesome factor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I missing something?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the premiere of The Cabin In The Woods last Friday. Not having read any of the reviews going around prior to watching it I must say it is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. The thing is, am I missing something? I get the fact that it is a parody or an anti-horror film or perhaps even a nod (whether positive or negative) to horror films generally, but I still don't like it.It was predictable from the start (why did that eagle have to hit the invisible boundary to the cabin? It made the later scene with the motor bike jump completely redundant). The acting was poor and even though the film may be satirical it is still painful to watch.The only thing I do like is perhaps the idea of an ode to all horror films and horror characters, but if it is a parody than that wouldn't make sense.I am just so surprised that this film currently has 7.9 / 10. Am I missing something here???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big Horror Fan. I have been since I was a young child. I've never seen anything like this movie before. It's a combination of everything. It's taken everything from every other Horror Movie and thrown it all into this movie. But what is really impressive is the fact that the movie has it's own (original) plot.What people seem to get confused about is that this is also a comedy. If you haven't laughed within the first 10 mins, then you better walk out right now, because the movie is exactly the same all through out. I was laughing all the way through it. This movie is just bizarre. One of the most bizarre Horror/Comedies i've ever watched in my life, is fact, the most bizarre Horror/Comedy i've watched in my life.Don't be expecting any scary scenes or anything suspenseful, because this is the wrong movie for you.The acting was great, well written, well directed and excellent comedy one-liners and with the best twist i've ever seen! This movie is exactly where it needs to be, it's a cult movie. It's "EXACTLY" what it should be. I'm part of the cult following! A cult classic and the best movie i've seen of 2012! If you are a Horror (over the top violence) mixed in with comedy fan, I 110% recommend this one! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is this some kind of a joke? Are there cameras that filming people's reactions and laughing at them or what?It was AFWUL! It was neither scary nor funny. I hated myself that I didn't leave the theater after the first 15 minutes. The only scary and the best scene of the movie was the guy appeared suddenly at the old gas station. The movie is that bad...Too bad I can't rate it less than 1.Unless you are from the new generation who loves nonsense bloody scenes and find them funny and somehow scary; STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!My rating : -10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why people are saying that this film was an abomination and advising others not to see it, because it has all if the element required in a fantastic horror.For me it re-ignited the flame in what was a dying genre, being poisoned by numerous of extremely bad films. Not only did it make it's way into my favorite horrors of all time, but it makes me have faith that people can once again create a true horror. Now there are only remakes of horrors, ( Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street ....) or prequels, ( Prometheus ).This movie is full of twists and turns you don't know what way it's going to go. It's smart, funny, gory and sexy with fantastic acting by all the cast. I was on the edge of my seat hungry for more.Overall, I rated this movie a 10 because it deserved it. This was one of the best films I've seen in a very long time and is one that I'll be watching over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember when Scream came out? People loved it - and not because it was the most horrifying and controversial scary flick ever released. It was a huge success because it gave fans of the horror genre something new. It made them laugh because it lovingly poked fun at a genre the fans knew by heart. Cabin in the woods takes a slightly different approach. Where Scream chose to laugh about dumb things people do in horror movies, Cabin decides instead to respectfully explain...well, everything - and making you laugh/scream while it does. I absolutely loved this film. If you've looked at a few reviews, you'll see this film has three acts. I like to compare them to the three acts of a magic trick - something I learned from The Prestige:1) The Pledge - Something ordinary is introduced to the audience. Five average college students go to a remote cabin in the woods where they'll spend the weekend partying it up! This is where we say to ourselves that because this is a horror movie, everyone will die, and thus we already know the ending. Am I right?2) The Turn - There's something else happening here. It's not what we thought. This is the part where we scratch our head and say "Wait a sec...what's going on?" This story isn't keeping to the rails we set it on. It's taking a weird turn and only getting weirder. This is also the part where people give up and decide they hate it because it's different. It's also the part where your standard horror flick ends...but wait!3) The Prestige - The resolution. The end. The explanation to everything that's been going on, and also possibly the greatest 20 minutes ever shown in horror movie history. This is the part where the audience is silent and speechless as every die-hard horror fan's dream is realized on screen. All your dedication, love, and sacrifice for this genre is justified. The credits roll, you walk out of the theater saying to yourself, "Did that just happen?" - and then you buy another ticket and watch it again.I'm trying not to reveal anything too big, and I think everyone else will tell you the same; you want to know as little as possible about it before you watch. The movie is funny, scary, and unbelievably entertaining. If you don't like it, you're one of the people that took a turn in act two and stopped following along. I feel so sorry for those guys. Have a good time at the theater!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for anyone who has ever complained that they don't make good, original horror films anymore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would normally be leery of giving out a perfect 10 rating, but if ever there was a modern horror movie that was worthy of a 10, it's this one. "Cabin in the Woods" has done what I no longer thought was possible for a horror movie, it blew my mind and showed me something I never expected. When I first saw a trailer for this on television I thought "Oh great, another recycled, clichéd horror flick. Can't they think of anything other than putting a group of young people in a stale setting and kill them off one by one?" Well it would appear that they can. This is a film that is nearly impossible to market effectively without giving anything away. Some of the more recent trailers have included much more footage that gives a glimpse into what this movie REALLY is about. Word of mouth should be the biggest factor that helps make this movie popular. I just hope for your sake that no one spoils this brilliant gem for you. It's best to go into it with as little information as possible. I really enjoyed the pacing of this movie. They could've taken this in an entirely different direction if they simply wanted to shock you at the end. Instead, they treat the film like a slow, steady reveal. In fact, the opening scene does not even feature the group of kids that we follow on their horrific trip to the cabin. Instead, it opens with the "other" side of this story and the characters who get about as much screen time as our heroine and her pals. The result is a cinematic experience like none other. The audience is fed bits of information little by little throughout the entire film, so you're always hot on the trail of this story's secrets. You won't know exactly what's going on but you'll feel like you have a pretty good grasp on things the further you advance into it. In reality, every time this plot reveals a twist, it also introduces more brand new questions into your mind. So the twists don't just come completely out of left field and shock you, but they guide you through a very intriguing story that manages to keep expanding into something bigger and bigger. I'm so glad they wrote the script this way. I feel like 9 times out of 10 the writers of today would be too tempted to create a story that hides everything behind the curtain and focuses solely on the kids at this cabin. That way they can build up to a final payoff that no one would ever see coming. This payoff is too big to simply catch you off guard with. They got this right, a movie that isn't only original for the end of the third act, but a refreshing journey from start to finish. Go experience this film before you overhear people talking about it at the water cooler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just can't get enough of this film. This year alone I have already watched it 4 times (and the year isn't even done yet). It works on so many levels and is so much fun; the way the conventions of the 'Horror' genre are turned upside down, while at the same time the story transcends the mere spoof and satire and becomes something new, entirely original ? just: Wow!It's clear this film was a labour of love; every tiny little detail was cared for and the writing is just phenomenal. The dialogues between the 'office clerks' alone are beyond priceless and offer such great, apparently effortless performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford (two absolutely fantastic character actors, by the way) ? this movie has simply everything. And the last 20 minutes offer the biggest payoff I have ever seen in a film. A rare treat and a true pleasure for film geeks like me. Thank you Joss and Drew! 10 stars out of 10.Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best, most original horror films in years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre for me has been pretty mediocre for the past several years, and so I have pretty much ignored a lot of horror movies that have come out, with the exception of a few. However, after the buzz surrounding Cabin, I knew it was something I had to see. And sure enough, Cabin delivers in spades. It has everything a horror fan could want, from our favorite clichés to some fantastic surprises. Suffice to say, every horror fan should go see this.I won't spoil the story, but to get into things a little, we focus on the age old tale of horror films: friends go to a remote cabin for some RnR and then the **** hits the fan. And when it does, it does so gleefully. It would be easy to blow this off as a simple parody, but it's not. I won't say how, but this is essentially a horror movie within a horror movie, and it's mostly dead serious. There's plenty of humor throughout, mostly due to Fran Krantz stoner character. And in fact, pretty much all the actors play there parts well. They are likable characters, even if they are cliché, but the clichés are part of the entire point. And in such areas, these characters are great. If you're worried about the horror aspect of the film, fear not, it delivers immensely. There are plenty of chilling scenes, though I wouldn't necessarily call them scary, and there is plenty of gore for the gorehounds, particularly at the end.To say much more would be to give away too much. I certainly had a few qualms about the film, but they were few and far between. And the less you know the better. I will only say that if you've been looking for good horror film, this is it. Whedon and Goddard have delivered in every way and their film will be remembered for some time in the same way Scream was remembered for shaking up the genre. This is similar, but different in oh so many ways. Go see this movie. It's the kind of film that comes out once in a blue moon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joss Wheddon dared to be different...and different he gave us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the opening title, we are thrown into the social standard of the guts and glory horror we all know and love. Five friends decide to drive their van out to an abandoned cabin in the woods and along the way they come across a creepy old man at a run down petrol station; nothing could go wrong right? And what would a stereotypical horror scenario be without with out it's cliché's characters; the stoner; the jock; the nerd; the popular girl and the virgin - well, sort of. Much to the hilarity of the film the group do just about everything you shouldn't do when in a creepy cabin; which results in them fighting for there lives when suddenly under attack from bombarding creatures of the night.As for the rest of the plot, it's pleasantly far from what you would normally expect; and balances out stunningly between a well mixed cocktail of classic horror and laugh out loud humor. Seeing how I'm still traumatised from when people told me the ending from The Sixth Sense, don't expect me to tell you what happens in the rest of the movie - of course, aside from the killer unicorn.If you look around on the internet really closely, you will notice it's the highest rated Horror Movie for the past 7 years since The Descent. You will never see another Horror Movie like this...EVER...PERIOD! In the large array of god-awful horror films to be recently brought out onto the big screen and direct to DVD/Blu Ray, The Cabin In The Woods is a refreshingly needed milestone to the long drying out horror genre. Aside from the somewhat awkward and pretentious cameo from Sigourney Weaver, The Cabin In The Woods is a deliciously bloody, funny, well acted, all round brilliantly written and directed satire of the horror genre. This is the Casablanca of movie spoofs and whether you are a fan of horror or not, this is not to be missed.10/10</fullReview>

Full of clichés and the most ridiculous twist that, quite frankly, ruins anything good that happened in this train-wreck of a movie in the first place. Is this really what passes for good horror today?SPOILER TO FOLLOW Are you ready? This is all a high-tech way to sacrifice humans for Gods that live underground on an earth that is obviously not ours. Once you know the big "secret" you really don't give a damn. Of course the victims that live in this alternate earth don't even have a clue that they may be part of the high-tech sacrifices that have been going on forever. Put that together with a bunch of overused horror and slasher clichés (and some awful comedy that was done far better in truly original movies like "Scream") and you have this garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This latest critical darling comes from Drew Goddard and Josh Whedon. A writer/director team with an extensive background in?television. This review is now sufficient enough to end right here, but I'll soldier on anyway. With about a jillion comparisons to Wes Cravens criminally overrated Scream, there was no reason to have high expectations for The Cabin in the Woods. Still, I at least expected a mindlessly entertaining carnival ride of gruesomeness a la Demon Knight or Planet Terror. My expectations were too high. The reason for the Scream comparison stems from the fact that both films exhibit a self awareness of the clichés and conventions of the horror genre. This comparison however is not entirely accurate. As lame a film to ever masquerade as a horror film as Scream is, The Cabin in the Woods' brand of stupidity has more in common with tripe such as Mars Attacks or even The Brady Bunch Movie. This is a film that looks and feels like a slightly sinister entry to the abysmal Scary Movie franchise. Another horror comedy that's never scary, and never really funny. To call it convoluted or contrived would be a massive understatement. It's flimsy excuse for a premise is like a house of urine soaked cards. The 1st act set up plays every bit as clichéd and predictable as any cut rate teen slasher movie of the past 30+ years. The only difference is the inclusion of a vast network of "puppeteers," two of which offer constant explanations (excuses) for said predictability. Basically it's all a charade. The kids are being lured into the cabin as part of some laughable ritual of human sacrifice to appease some angry ancient gods. This charade of trite horror genre mediocrity is the only thing that keeps them from rising up and destroying the world. In other words, the story is rotten because the "Ancient Ones" have wretched taste. For reasons far too ridiculous to bother getting into, things don't quite go as planned. Two of the kids figure everything out, and to make a very dumb, bloated story short, the world ends. There's a bloody finale involving about 20 or more simultaneous references to horror icons of the past several decades, but don't think for a second that any of it's worthwhile. "Lord Fornicus," the obvious reference to Hellraiser's Pinhead, looks like something out of a SNL sketch. Come to think of it the whole thing feels like some cut-rate comedy sketch show rather than a horror film or even a horror comedy. Watching this thing one get's the impression that everyone involved was striving for mediocrity. The acting is soap opera level. The direction uninspired. The writing an avalanche of sloppy expository dialog and dumb forced humor (people still think stoners are funny?). The camera work typical "lets film each scene from every conceivable angle and hope it all cuts together well. The Special effects barely a step above what you'd see in an Uwe Boll film. The self-referential conceit is just an excuse to unleash a torrent of awkward, distracting exposition through each and every character's dialog. You half expect someone to look directly into the camera at any moment, throw up the sign of the horns and proclaim "Dude! It's a freakin horror movie!" This brand of lazy storytelling is no different from what the storytellers proclaim to be ridiculing. The people who defend this technique by saying "that was the point" are simply defending mediocrity. Clichés, ineptitude and lack of imagination cannot negate clichés, ineptitude and lack of imagination. Nor can they be excused. Consider films like Kill Bill and Grindhouse, which manage to pay homage to trash cinema yet still be incredibly entertaining, and original. The Cabin in the Woods is still the same boring same old same old, even with the reality-TV-show-of-the-gods slant. All in all, the whole thing is about as clever, funny and scary as a fart joke. Some have surmised that the story is actually a kind of metaphor for the horror film industry, or horror fans expectations or whatever. If that's the case then The Cabin in the Woods isn't just lame, it's insufferably pretentious. Merman, this single star is for you and only you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it. Most disappointed I've been in awhile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not been this disappointed in a long time. Had I known I was coming to watch a movie that was making fun of horror movies, I wouldn't have wasted my time or money. Original as it was, it lacked three major things I expected: 1. Horror (which was replaced with comedy) 2. Good Acting (I was sorely disappointed, the characters didn't seem that into their roles) 3. some sort of intelligent story (based on hype and previews)I felt bad for none of the characters that died. None of the characters really developed throughout the movie. The story was just terrible with too many unanswered questions and the film makers chastised the review groups prior to releasing the film for asking about a sequel.Some more about the reason that they needed a virgin, jock, whore, fool and scholar would have been nice to know. Why they were sacrificing to the gods could have been more clear. Why they were involving all the other countries would have been nice, but mostly, explain this to me:Which one of the Asian children in the classroom was the whore? the jock? the fool? I'm assuming at that stage in their lives they were virgins and scholars...I never found myself startled during the movie, not one jump. I feel cheated that I went to a horror movie to realize it was a poorly done comedy. I don't get it. I must be wrong. Everybody else seems to disagree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Literally a waste of time, if the movie has any redeeming qualities it would be the slight humour in the film. It's advertised as having a crazy twist and 'you think you know the story' etc... Basically if you've seen the advert you'll know what's going on.They are in a cabin in the woods, their actions are influenced by some government people. But everyone got that from the advert when the two guys in shirts said "Target acquired" right?(spoilers) The 'twist' which has nothing to do with the entire movie until the very end and is shamelessly explained by a new character in the last 5 minutes is that they're doing the whole thing to stop Gods from destroying the whole world. Would never suggest this film to anyone (however it does have slight elements of humour). Was embarrassed walking out of the cinema after suggesting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin In The Woods starts off as, what seemed to be a horror comedy - the cliché college students (a jock, a blonde girl, a stoner, a nerd and a virgin) meet up to spend the weekend in a cabin together. 'Fair enough', I thought. But that thought didn't last long. Here is a list of things that bugged me about this film:1) The acting ranged from bad right down to laughable.2) The characters were annoying and 2 dimensional. I could not wait for them to be killed and was actually rooting for the zombie family, which had more of a background story than any of the main characters.3) The big red button that releases every monster. WHY WOULD YOU INVENT THIS BUTTON?! In what possible scenario would you need this button?! The mere existence of this button was the best plot twist in the movie.4) During the entire time of me watching this movie, I was not sure whether the movie was parodying the horror genre or actually wanted to be taken seriously. Either way it failed.A brainless movie with no good storyline whatsoever. I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anti-horror horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a horror movie that is poking fun at horror movies and movies in general. So if you're looking for a film that you can cradle a scared lady-friend to, this is not the one. To anyone who has watched Southpark's Britney Spears episode you will know the parallel that Matt Stone &amp; Trey Parker drew between our modern culture glorifying and then using celebrities up as an ancient sacrifice to the gods to ensure a good harvest. This movie does the same- by creating a reality TV type scenario that the main characters walk into. But it takes it a step further, in showing how the horror movie clichés (joker, jock, slut, nerd and virgin) can be seen as a more elaborate version of this kind of sacrifice ; and horror is the genre that supplies an endless stream of blood to satisfy this ancient need. But the characters are so much more than clichés- in the movie they actually are noticing how they are falling/being cast into these roles and being less and less human, less and less themselves. That in itself has me tipping my hat to the writers. Joss Whedon you clever beast!As to it not being pure horror- that's the point of the movie. I was enjoying the commentary that the narrative made while it developed and because i didn't know where it was heading and why things were happening, it kept me on edge and interested to the very end. At one point I was sitting there thinking - wow this movie must have been so much fun to make! It was definitely fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The writers of this film stated that they didn't like how the horror genre has become. Full of unlikable characters that we don't care if they live or die. Cabin in the Woods sounds like a generic horror film with a generic premise and generic horror characters. When you see it closely, it's an intriguing high concept satirical horror film. It may look absurd but it's actually brilliant and smart. It has campy scares and some good laughs. Cabin in the Woods is an enjoyable horror film with an unlikely twist.Horror movies have lost its suspense because we don't care about the characters and the characters are particularly dumb to make decisions to survive. It make sense in this film. The actors did a great portraying these clichéd characters. Chris Hemsworth and his body already makes a good jock character. Kristen Connolly is pretty likable. Fran Kranz steals the show as the pot headed dude.Some will say it's generic but it's actually intriguing. I'm not gonna give everything away but I'm gonna say it's a bit absurd but it's smart and inspired. It's also a bit scary, though some of the jump scares didn't work but it's much better when the scares goes campy. I'm not gonna reveal the monsters either. There are ridiculously hilarious moments which lightens the grimness. The thrills and suspense are always there.At first, you thought it's just another horror film but when you pass through the rest of the film, you will realize that this would be a remarkable experience. I have to agree with one of the critics, "The less you know about Cabin in the Woods, the better". It looks absurd but it's smart and creative. It gave substance to all generic horror movie nonsense. It's Campy, Hilarious, and Fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the absolute worst movie that I have ever seen in my life. The acting and the plot were absolutely awful. The people who gave it an 8.1 rating out of 10 are completely insane. Don't waste your time and money on this outrageously stupid and awful movie. The movie is basically about a bunch of stupid teenagers who decide to go on a camping trip to a friends cousins camp when randomly a bunch of zombies begin to attack everyone. The only thing that is truly keeping my attention while watching this movie was the fact that Chris Hemsworth was in it. This movie is the most pointless thing I have ever seen in my entire life. Snakes On A Plane was a much better movie than this.SERIOUSLY DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Loving Hate Letter to Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I love being scared." So said Joss Whedon in an interview with Total Film regarding "The Cabin in the Woods," which he produced and co-wrote with director Drew Goddard. "The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into torture porn and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances. Drew and I both felt that the pendulum had sung a little too far in that direction." When I first read that quote a few weeks ago, I wished Whedon had been there with me, for I wanted to shake him by the hand and thank him for publicly reaffirming what I've felt about horror movies for quite some time. But then I actually saw "The Cabin in the Woods," and I couldn't help but wonder why I wasn't seeing things as he saw them. Something wasn't quite right.The film, promoted by Whedon himself as a "very loving hate letter" and "a serious critique of what we love and what we don't about horror movies," is nowhere near as clever or insightful as it has been made to seem. Whedon and Goddard clearly have fun with a number of threadbare horror clichés, but never once do they actually say anything relevant about them. All these men really do is confirm that they exist, which is shortsighted considering the fact that most horror audiences are already well aware of this. They think they're letting us in on the joke when in fact we were in on it all along. What I was promised was satire; what I got was a confusing, ridiculous, and surprisingly depressing film in which archetypes and conventions are addressed but barely improved.Central to the story are five college kids who were clearly intended to be one-dimensional caricatures. But pointing out their shallowness and actually commenting on it are two entirely different matters, and frankly, I would have preferred the filmmakers to go in the latter direction. There's Dana, the reluctant virgin (Kristen Connolly). There's her best friend, Jules, the perpetually horny sexpot (Anna Hutchison), who just dyed her hair blonde; although she can't pronounce one of the words on Dana's math book, it's declared that she's premed. There's Jules' boyfriend, Curt, the hunky jock (Chris Hemsworth). There's Holden, the scholarly gentleman (Jesse Williams), who will inevitably fall for Dana. Finally, there's Marty, the goofy pothead (Fran Kranz), who sounds like he knows more than he initially lets on.They leave campus and take an RV to a remote part of the woods, where they vacation in a strangely decorated and certifiably creepy cabin. Little do they know that beneath the cabin lies a subterranean office superstructure, where a bureaucratic team of workers in suits, ties, and lab coats watch their every move via surveillance cameras. Two scientists, Hadley (Richard Jenkins) and Sitterson (Bradley Whitford), use a force field to seal the college kids into the wooded area and subject them to a scenario of their own design. They manipulate the circumstances as much as possible, mostly by the release of airborne chemicals that can change a person's ability to think. They eventually open the cellar, where, amidst an eclectic mix of creepy Victorian paraphernalia, Dana finds an old diary. Upon reading a Latin incantation, zombies emerge from the ground and descend on the cabin.At this point, I'm going to stop describing the plot in detail, as there are numerous twists and turns that most will not want spoiled. I will say that the film is intended to be both frightening and funny, and to an extent, it succeeds at both. In the humor department, we have more than the antics of the college kids; we have the working environment of the subterranean office. Just as it would be in an urban skyrise, we see division of labor and the formation of cliques. We see money pools and office partying, and there's even enough time to work in the playful ribbing of the nerdy intern. When they're not working, the scientists will gab about their personal lives; in the opening scene, Sitterson spends a great deal of time complain about his wife and her new cabinets.There's an extremely bloody confrontation involving every imaginable monster from the annals of horror, from wispy spirits to werewolves to giant cobras to robotic slicing machines to zombies to carnivorous mermen. All leads to a Lovecraftian ending that was not only lame-brained and inappropriate but also needlessly upsetting. Was that the point of "The Cabin in the Woods"? To espouse a nihilistic viewpoint of humanity? If this is Whedon's idea of sticking it to the makers of slasher films and gore fests, he might want to steer clear of the horror genre altogether. I hate to think that there are other genres he feels have been corrupted. If he were to write another very loving hate letter, say for a romantic comedy or a musical, would it too end in the same way?-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not utter crap, but it's not a work of genius either. It's far-fetched, and I don't mean it in the way that it features supernatural beings, no, but in the way that its unpredictability is so predictable. It's as if the creators of the movie couldn't really decide what to do with it except to make it as ludicrous as possible. Furthermore, while I am aware of Whedon's commentary, explicitly stated ideas of the movie, I consider it not important. Because, frankly, this movie couldn't function as a satire even if it got to the top of Mount Everest and shouted angrily at the world for not being what it was supposed to be.I mean, the big red button? Convenient but completely needless. The machinery and the scenery was obviously just built to be destroyed. So expect the expected here. I mean, conditioning people to do what is necessary so that the show goes on? I mean, Sigourney Weaver telling us it's the end of times? I mean, appeasing the gods by means of an ancient ritual, okay, okay, but then what the hell are them all people doing there? How did they get there? They just gathered to save the world? It's incomplete, the movie, littered with inconsistencies that can hardly be called intentional. No explanations are offered, no delving into the matter. All in all, very superficial in nature. Also, the movie funny? Seriously, if this is considered to funny I really. Eh. Not even going to deign to finish that sentence. It has its moments to be sure, but then again watching wallpapers crumpling has its moments too.It starts out promising, though, as promising a cabin movie can seem. But the more you see it, the less you like it. And I wouldn't agree with whoever said that the characters were likable. The plot does not allow for that. In fact, the plot forbids it. It manages to ruin their potential with clichés and clichéd anti-clichés, be it intentionally or unintentionally. At the very end, when they are about to die, my reactions were poker face. No feeling of sorrow or compassion. Oh Hollywood, why such lack of original originality I'll never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a horror fan. Although, films pertaining to demonic possession scare me into a four year old, it's just not my taste. I'm also pretty late in watching this movie. I found it online and decided to watch since I had nothing else to do. I was kind of intrigued after seeing Joss Whedon's name in the credits for producing and writing. Overall, I loved this movie. It started off as your typical horror film, but turn into something much bigger and more authentic. Every horror in the past twenty years has been predictable. You know who is going to die, you know who the killer is, you know if the dumb blonde runs off screaming into a dark hallway she's more than likely going to have her head get cut off. But this movie was the exact opposite because I had absolutely no clue what was going to happen next. I'm sure a high percentage of people will not appreciate the sci-fi twist to the movie but I loved and thought it was an awesome idea. All horror movies are kind of science fiction anyways. It seems like all the killers are super human anyway because they don't seem to ever die no matter how many times you shoot them, stab them or hit them with a truck. This movie just did it on a larger scale.The script was solid as well. Joss Whedon writes the best dialogue and knows how to play off of cliché's and those corny predictable monologues and speeches. To everyone saying they hated this movie, it's obvious that they don't like change and are probably upset because the originality of this film pretty much slays all their favorite horror movies to dust. It's not Oscar worthy but it's a great Friday night movie with your friends that will keep everyone on the edge of their seat, anticipating what's going to happen next.I have to hand it to the filmmakers. They definitely made a film that no one would have ever thought it. Just like my title says, you either love it or you hate it. You can't please everyone but this customer was satisfied from beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What you you been smokin? Is there a zero rating available?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, the trailers tempt you to go watch this flick and they do a pretty darn good job of attracting people and raise curiosity. But my question to the writer and director of this movie is guys, what have you been smokin? The movie definitely kicks off with a great start and develops the momentum but rapidly breaks it apart. Who set these people up? What's the reason for the profiles? Who runs these operations? Who watches the show? What is at stake (as the lab scientist mentions)? The motive? I get it, these guys are in horror business but they could have made it an interesting concept by following it through. All you see is series of deaths and the most weirdest climax you could imagine. Even at last, the lead heroine and her friend are able to survive thousands of most terrible creatures and find their way to ritual place. There is no law, no police, no backup plans (considering they are running such a scary business). Just like the cabin is a setup, I think the hype and the publicity and the high ratings may be a setup too to pull the audience. Do me a favor, save few bucks..not only what you are gonna spend on the movie but also what you are going to lose for your time going to this useless flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most frightening thing about this film is its absurdly high IMDb rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear! Cabin in the Woods is so bad I hardly know where to begin. The film combines elements of other films such as Night of the Living Dead (the zombies), Saw 2 (cameras hidden in the house). Unfortunately, the execution of this film is nowhere near as good as other films in the same genre.The biggest issue for me was that the whole film was completely predictable. The use of cheap jump tricks throughout - there wasn't one occasion when I was shocked/scared throughout the entire 95 minutes of the film. This film has clearly just gone for shock value to try and get cheap scares rather than focusing on a well constructed and creepy story.The dialogue was painfully bad for the majority of the film (particularly the first 15 minutes) which consisted of mostly inane and meaningless conversations between 3 of the protagonists.Speaking of the protagonists we have 5 walking clichéd 1 dimensional cardboard cut outs Dana (the goody goody virgin) Curt (the jock) Jules (the whore) Holden (the intellectual) and Marty (the stoner/fool). That's about as much as I can say about them as we learn nothing else about them through the rest of the film. This didn't bother me that much as they were all uninteresting characters anyway.Once our 5 protagonists arrive at the Cabin, we learn that 4 out of the 5 have been marked for death. Jules (the whore) must die first as she is corrupted and the others die by whatever method they have selected for their death. The only one that has the option to live or die is the Virgin, but the director wants the Virgin to live and for the other 4 protagonists to die as part of a ritual sacrifice in order to appease the Gods beneath. The director (in a brief appearance by Sigourney Weaver) tells us that the reason that the protagonists are selected for death is because they are young. I found this to be a bit preposterous and lacking in sense, but I suppose it was at least somewhat original.As I said in my summary, the most frightening aspect about this film is its current IMDb rating of 7.5. It is a mystery to me why so many people liked this film so much - it has every horror cliché in the book, zero scares, dreadful dialogue. The film seemed to get worse as it went along and the final 15 minutes were just embarrassing. What a waste of 95 minutes!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband turned to me as the end credits started rolling and said "That was the worst movie I ever saw." And I agree with him. It starts off OK as any cabin in the woods movie would. But it goes somewhere incomprehensible shortly thereafter. Whatever unfolds is without explanation. And if it's supposed to be a spoof of all previous horror films ever made (as some have said in other reviews) it is still a miss. Spoiler Alert: it's not scary at all! There is slasher blood, lot's of it. And zombies (I am so over zombies). I either missed or didn't understand what the big twist is many talk about. You know from the first scene of the movie there are people in charge of overseeing the cabin and all that goes on there. There was no twist. Period. It's just a stupid movie with no plot and no horror. And I'm sorry, but if you either love, like, or recommend this movie you are smoking way too much of that stuff Marty smokes. Do not go to see this movie if you are over 20. I give it a 3 because I did LOL a few times, so I guess I was mildly entertained once or twice. PS... The cameo appearance at the end is NOT by "a horror movie icon" as several have stated. Those are 2 completely different genres of movies.</fullReview>

The story was really bad, although it was original( i must say.) This movie shouldn't be considered a horror movie but actually a comedy.If you are looking for a good laugh this movie is the one to watch, But if you got the impression this movie in fact was going to be a horror movie (as many of us thought)expect a huge disappointment; therefore , do not go and pay for this film, it is not worth your money. Perhaps if this movie was displayed as the typical Scary movie series, then this movie would with no doubt receive ten stars. Save your self ten bucks, or watch another movie!</fullReview>

This is your typical horror/slasher movie, right down to who gets killed first. The movie didn't really make any sense other than to watch people die. The characters were put together fairly sloppily. No reason as to why there were going where they were going, why they took an RV to a cabin. Just whole parts of the movie didn't make sense. The writers refused to change and do something different. It was pretty typical, you know who's gonna get it and no real scary parts some shocking, surprise ya scenes. There were some funny parts, but the script never got into it, just a simple,who's gonna get it and how. The ending made no sense and didn't close up loose ends. Did the world come to an end? Was this all a dream? etc.If you want a brainless slasher movie, go see it but if you want to be entertained go see Three Stooges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this movie was shot in 2009 but not released until 2012, I can only imagine that the only it was released at all was to capitalize on the success of Thor, starring Chris Hemsworth, and the impending release of The Avengers. It can't be a coincidence that both movies were directed by Mr. Whedon. Cabin In The Woods is a hodgepodge of clichéd imperiled teens stuck in a remote location getting knocked off one by one and seemingly science fiction elements. The movie tries, and fails, to duplicate the successful combination of snark and fright that Scream pulled off so well, but the script is so poor that near the end when a slumming Sigourney Weaver makes an appearance, she utters a line so ridiculous that it's amazing she could say it with a straight face. As bad as most of the movie is, the ending is worse than anything came before. Amazingly, this movie has been receiving fairly decent reviews.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall this film is not anything to jump about at. The story line seems unique and almost engaging when you hear about it, but when you watch it, it becomes a different matter. Joss Whedon has tried to mix Comedy and Horror in a way that just does not work, although there are some comedic moments, the film is still not quite a 10 out of 10. However the start was intriguing as you thought of the predictable story, there was a twist. Although this twist was something different, putting it at the start of the Film spoilt the sense of anticipation of what was going to happen, because it was all fairly predictable. As the film went on the outcome became more and more predictable, until the end when there was a twist which was so unrealistic that it made the film look stupid. In summary,the film was not anything special and in fact I wanted it to end as quick as possible, the acting it self wasn't that bad but the story line prevented it from being anything special.</fullReview>

I went to this film with my niece and fell asleep. That didn't happen in Shrek or Shrek 2 (which were both funny and entertaining, unlike this junk). Apart from some first rate art direction and costuming, both of which employ a pleasing primary-colored palette, this misbegotten and utterly unnecessary sequel offers virtually nothing of value for either fans of the original cartoon or newcomers to the scene dragged to the experience by well-intentioned but misguided youngsters. It's a shame that Hollywood feels compelled to foist dopey, lame brained movies such as this one onto innocent, unsuspecting children, and one shudders to think what the future movie going audience will be like having been nurtured in their formative years on cinematic dreck like the "The Cabin in the Woods" franchise. Even the Shaggy-figure, who was the one bright element in the original cartoons, becomes simply annoying in this installment. And Scooby himself has to rank as one of the least beguiling and charming figures in the history of children's animation - but the filmmakers decided to drop that particular element...(?) 0/10</fullReview>

All it does is create confusion and it shows no original thought which is not grounded in history or today's reality. 90% of the demographics that would watch this movie have no context of history, nor do they care. All they care about is entertainment, which accounts for the high ratings. Unfortunately, when the audience sees the same stereotype played out over and over again in the same type of movies, it becomes reality. The filmmaker has a larger responsibility to its audience. I hope the people that worked on this movie weren't duped into thinking that they were producing a quality film.Don't attempt to be intelligent or ground-breaking when you're clearly not.

		<fullReview>How this film has managed to garner an aggregate score of 8.0 reflects more on the current state of films and their audiences than it does the state of the actual film. Where to start with what is wrong with this film? I could say "everything", but that would be too easy. This movie is what happens when somebody has the crazy idea that you can cross the Evil Dead with the Truman Show, which was not that bad of an idea in itself, BUT that same person/persons decided that maybe they could spice it up if they added a Lovecraftian twist to it, and what we end up with is an utter mish mash of nonsense that becomes almost unwatchable in its final thirty minutes or so. Once you see the the real horrors in all their CGI glory (and its BAD CGI) then you lose all hope that this film was ever going to be any good...its just junk.To put this into context with regards to this sites scoring system, The Exorcist, arguably one of the finest horror films ever made gets a score of 8.1, only 0.1 better than this utter rubbish! The Truman Show gets 8.0 and The Evil Dead gets 7.6...a true score for this movie would be the result of deducting the result of the latter from the former.Cabin In The Woods 0.4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the worst movie EVER. Seriously. I never wrote a review for ANY movie in my life, and if I take so much effort to register in IMDb and post this review, you can clearly understand how frustrated I am after watching this stupid movie. I believe these movie makers have found a way to tweak the system by posting bunch of positive reviews and make a really pathetic movie look like an amazing one. If you have lot of money to waste, try to throw it in dust bin. I believe there is much greater good accomplished with your money that way than paying to watch this movie or watch it in any other way. More importantly, you don't support an idiotic movie company to make even more pathetic movies like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Might contain spoilers*This movie was awful. I expected a horror film and I got some sort of comedy. I love horror films, but this one was down the drain. This was no horror film in any shape or form. At the end of this film, I was literally saying, "what the actual f*ckery??" and not in a good way where your mind is blown like after watching Inception. The only reason why I gave this movie a higher rating than a 1 is because I give it credit for the sarcastic uses (satire), creativity and it's mockery for day to day horror films even though I expected horror. If you're expecting a real hard core scary movie, do not waste your time on this film. Unless you're fond of surprises, watch it.Personally, I thought the unicorn scene was extremely ridiculous. Was I supposed to be afraid? Oh of course, it's a sarcastic "horror" film.</fullReview>

It sure was different but it was not good different. If you haven't watched this movie, then do not i repeat DO NOT watch it. Why? because it sucks.

		<fullReview>this film contains pretty much everyone's fear and portrays them in a very dark comedic way. The plot is about 5 teens who go camping in a forest in a cabin. one by one this company used these elevators to 'deliver' these monsters and beasts to this cabin to kill all of them. The film was very creative in how the monsters were portrayed and how real they looked; and the scene with all the elevators was very original. However it was pretty much a typical horror film as it was predictable in the fact of when the people would die but it was original with the creativity of how the people died. Overall I did not enjoy this film as I found it boring and I would not recommend this film to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never been so disappointed by a horror movie. Usually you know first hand what you're getting- cheesy, gory, traumatizing. I thought that because of the reviews of the movie, and of course friends telling me to see it, that it would be decent. It's beyond cliché. Everything in it has been done. There are thoughtless "plot twists". And the ending is pretty much resolved by deus ex machina. Literally. The graphics are neat but not up to the standards of a true horror film. The suspense is contrived. I suppose if you're 12 and you've never seen a horror movie before you might enjoy it. But I'm 27 and I have no time for such useless movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did i just watch??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i first saw the trailer for this movie, i was in such a hype to see it that i knew something must be wrong. I totally fell for the techy-residentevilish music and after all, the cabin itself, and was willing to deal with the cliché friends-in-a-remote-place-get-in-a-life- threatening-situation-from-which-only-one-couple-manages-to-get-out- alive thing. So i, foolish enough, sat down with my optimism and played this movie. Boy, was i wrong. First of all, the thing that got me 'what the hell' was the comedy- horror/thriller thing. This movie just can't decide if it's a parody of some sort, or a real horror/thriller which it claims to be. In the first half of the movie we've got some 'scary' scenes in and around (and on the way to) the cabin, which aren't really anything more than something- ugly-pops-out , obliterated by absurd scenes from the second half of the movie, in which we get to see a royal rumble of mostly nonsense and absurdity, mixed with some short script fillings, since the script seems to be written by an 80-year old granny who suffers from alzheimer's. The script itself consists mostly of holes and the story was not clear enough, so the main plot is that you don't really understand anything till the end, but it doesn't feel like you shouldn't, it feels like whoever made the script did it by mistake. The techy-residentevilish atmosphere and music remained on the trailer only, so i suffered from major disappointment when i realized that, since it was a great turn on for me (i'm a great fan of RE franchise). The acting wasn't bad at all, all of the characters did what they were supposed to, to be casual cliché adolescents. For the end, a comment on the ending: Sigourney Weaver really contributed to this movie. It sucks even more. It felt like a desperate measure to include her, and it didn't work out. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The athletic Curt (Chris Hemsworth) invites his girlfriend, the slut Jules (Anna Hutchison), and his friends Dana (Kristen Connolly) that has a few sex experiences; the fool pothead Marty (Fran Kranz); and Holden (Jesse Williams), to spend the weekend in his cousin's cabin in the woods. They travel in a trailer and find that the place is not located in the GPS and cell phones do not work.Soon they find an open cellar door and see weird objects in the basement. Dana reads a journal from the beginning of the Twentieth Century and when she reads words in Latin, she awakes zombie killers. Meanwhile they are observed by a team in a control room that manipulates the environment. What is the secret of the cabin in the woods?"The Cabin in the Woods" is a patchwork of recycled story lines with a silly story. The formula is basically the following: (a) it begins like most of the teen horror movies, with a group of friends traveling to an isolated location in the woods without means of communication. (b) Then there is the "Evil Dead" rip-off, with five friends in a cabin reading a book and unleashing "The Walking Dead". (c) Then there is "The Truman Show" environment, with their deaths monitored by a team on televisions. (d) Last, there are moments of "Cube" and "Resident Evil", when Dana and Marty learn what is happening.The lame conclusion with ancient gods in the underground is ridiculous and without a reasonable explanation. If they need to be killed in that spot in a sequence, why not sending the army hidden in the underground to kill each of them the way it is necessary? Do the ancient gods like to watch reality shows? My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "O Segredo da Cabana" ("The Secret of the Cabin")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** I was surprised to find that 'twist' is a misnomer when applied to this movie, as the 'unconventional' concept is revealed from the outset: 5 American college students in what appears to be a traditional horror scenario turn out to have been unknowingly manipulated for the purposes of what may be a kind of extreme reality TV show. (Perhaps the real purpose of the "TV show" is meant to be the twist?) I am a fan of the ultimate "Cabin in the Woods" movie, The Evil Dead, and unfortunately the first part of this movie is like a watered down, lukewarm version of that- call it a homage if you like. Unfortunately the "Reality TV" aspect of the movie distanced me even more from the action: because the horror was "manipulated" and "fake" I didn't care about it. I was very bored by this and waited for it to be over with so we could get to the part where the characters inevitably find out what's going on and get behind the scenes...When we finally get there, the action-packed finale is quite amusing, but at the same time pretty cheap. Little or no attempt seemed to be made to make those "cells" realistic, and it really depends on how you view CGI creatures: for me it became cartoon time.Finally, I'd say that it is a big mistake for any movie maker to present us with a hero who is basically a Scoobless version of "Shaggy" yet with less depth.Yup, perhaps the buzz about the movie made me expect something with more depth, and I'd probably have been more satisfied if I'd been geared up for what it was: a silly horror-comedy-homage.</fullReview>

I was really expecting a lot more, guess you have to go see this movie not really expecting anything to actually feel good about it when you come out of the cinema.I guess it is entertaining but not for horror fans.</fullReview>

Certain lines have an element of comedy, but for the most part those same attempts at humour seem to fall far from the mark and just... aren't funny.I watched "The Cabin in the Woods" expecting a movie about a cabin in the woods. Especially when I had read a synopsis. So why it ended up being about evil scientists and killer "evil giant gods" is beyond me! Some good acting seemed to salvage the first half hour. Once they'd reached the tunnel things got stupid, and I'd rather I'd not bothered watching.Just my opinion. Feel free to disagree.</fullReview>

There was zero gore (except for the guy in the elevator scene), the movie kept making references to other movies but never kept up with the promises in terms of violence or blood. I found it extremely annoying, it's like pointing a finger at "Evil Dead" and then ...simply not delivering (the hellraiser clone looked like an idiot).It was an extremely polished "satire" that tried to stay on a serious enough level to attract horror movie fans, but really I cannot imagine any horror movie fan finding it interesting, it just does not have anything to offer.

		<shortDescription>Too predictable at times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main problems I have with this film is:1. It had the longest scene in it I ever watched in a film, that I could predict entirely. The culprit is an entirely redundant shot with a CGI eagle at the start of the film. Who thought it would be a good idea to put that in?2. There are many other scenes that gave me a similar feeling of wasted time by making me think: "yes, I get the point, this refers to a famous horror movie, please move on to the rest of the story."3. The actual premise of the film, the stuff that could make it interesting, is compressed into the quite short ending and was mostly predictable from the start.'The Cabin in the Woods' gives away too many hints from the start on. Drop those hints and it would become more interesting, at the condition that the viewer didn't already pick up the hints elsewhere like in the trailer, a short summary, or reviews. If you don't know anything yet about the film and this is the first review you read, stop reading if you plan to watch it. The less you know about it, the higher the chance that it will be interesting.Overall, the film was entertaining enough that I would give it a 6/10, but it was far from the great and original experience I expected it to be from other reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pull apart your cheeks, insert your head, and you will know "The Cabin in the Woods"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who has spent the majority of his childhood watching horror movies, I am aware that the genre can get a little plodding at times. There are only so many tropes to follow out, and the genre is in constant need of new angles to approach. For every new idea in horror, the drill is that many movies after will borrow and pinch little pieces here and there from the last hot concept, mixed with parts of great flicks that came before. Such is horror; a genre not so much steeped in originality, but in the audacity of individual filmmakers to either one-up each other in craziness, or give a new twist to a concept by approaching it with a left-field idea or humor. Rarely does an original idea come along.But if you were expecting me to say anything positive about "The Cabin in the Woods" in regards to this observation, go ahead and stop reading right now. I have been very open to many interpretations of horror, but this movie just plain arouses my hatred.TCITW comes from the school of movies like Scream, a movie I disliked as a teenager in the 90's. The concept is to use the vehicle of the slasher movie(several teens are gradually reduced to one survivor) to poke fun at the horror genre and reveal a few details about its basic concepts and inner workings. Also, there is a plot-changing twist midway through that changes the entire tone of this movie from a slasher to a much broader critique of horror in general. While Scream has a decidedly slasher-centric view, this movie further funnels the entire horror genre into a larger concept that is supposed to serve as an observation about why we watch horror.This movie is self-referential to the point of self-destruction. It so blatantly flaunts its "breaking the fourth wall" ethos that it forgets to build a first, second, or third wall. The basic plot would probably be a pretty decent idea if it wasn't so laden with the obsession with dissecting the horror genre. It mugs and winks so hard at you that it has the flavor of a YouTube video where someone just goes "I'm so cute" into the camera over and over. Even a fairly good action sequence for about 20 minutes toward the end can't save this turd.I think the makers of this movie are out of touch. This movie smecks of contempt. It is as decidedly ersatz as a person wearing eyeglasses without lenses, who winks at you and repeatedly says, "Guess what, these glasses have no lenses". It seems to lecture you that you should know better, as if you didn't know all this about horror before this shitty movie came out.I think the thing that kills me the most about TCITW is that it shows a complete lack of sincerity. I don't particularly like Scream either, but it was made with a good amount of tongue-in- cheek humor by a director who actually defined some of the greatest tropes in horror. TCITW is like a jealous douche who looks down their nose and says "it's all been done", but never really has a clue what's to be done next. I would much prefer a genre romp with a few flaws than a movie that just derides horror for tools to cackle at.</fullReview>

If you're looking for a good, plausible and truly frightening film, look elsewhere. This is meant to be satirical horror - unfortunately, all that it manages to be is a big joke, and a bad one at that. I kept waiting for an explanation of what was meant to be scary and what the point of it all was, but this never came. At the end, one is left with more questions than answers, and the most burning question is how to get one's 94 minutes back to watch something of better quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All horror film story lines are the same these days; a few teenagers go out to a remote holiday cabin with no communication with the outside world and decide that they have to fight whatever it is that's trying to kill them all until they die one by one. What made this film worse than all the others is the fact that it concentrated so hard on having a terrible, cliché story line.This film is a disgrace, and it is an insult to all good horror movies that "The Cabin In The Woods" was even advertised as a scary film. It wasn't even remotely scary, in fact the only time it made me jump was when the credits started rolling and I jumped out of my seat to be the first to leave the cinema. To summarise, the story line made literally no sense, the acting was weak and I'm still laughing at the fact that this film was categorised as a "horror". Thoroughly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I EXpected So Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down and watched what was supposed to be one of the best movies of the year, and it's a horror film. Needles to say, "Cabin in The Woods" was terribly disappointing. It is a horror movie and I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be. It was a horror movie that makes fun of the horror genre as a whole. I didn't like that and I felt like I was watching "Scream" all over again. There were many problems with this movie so let's get started.The movie starts with your standard college kids going into a secluded place to party. However, this time is different. They are going into a controlled environment where a company controls how and when the die. This is the basic premise of the movie and it leaves the audience wondering why this company is doing this. Personally, I didn't like that. The idea was good but the ending to the movie became sort of obvious. This movie could have been a lot better if a few scenes were switched around. The company in control should have been the kicker and the huge surprise, instead the first scene shows them starting and telling you what is going to happen. This movie was supposed to be surprising and different with a mind blowing concept. Instead it became somewhat predictable and the "shock" at the end was just ridiculous.This starts out as a basic and standard horror movie with Chris Hemsworth leading a group of mindless idiots into the woods. It was the typical jock, slut, genius, idiot stoner, and the innocent virgin. It is obvious who is going to die and when, and it is exactly what you would expect from a horror movie. The slut dies while having sex, which has been done so many times. The acting was just disturbing. Hemsworth plays the thunder god Thor in the movie "Thor." He did a good job in that movie and now he is seen with his terrible one-liners and bad acting. The slut does her job as the hot girl in the movie to draw teenage boys and perverted old men towards ticket sales. The only character I actually liked was Marty.Marty was the stoner idiot who kind of saw what was coming. His character was actually interesting and had meaning. He wasn't just a filler character to get killed. He noticed something was wrong with the house and hoe everybody was acting differently. He basically pointed out how he was in a horror movie and everybody was in trouble. The movie throws in a lame twist as to how the company cannot control him as a character and it was just stupid. It was something I did not see coming but I still was not impressed.I was also hoping the movie would focus more on the cabin itself. The movie is called a cabin in the woods and the characters spend very little time in the actual cabin. In the beginning the cabin is eerie and different and hints towards some importance. It turns into being just a simple cabin and is really disappointing. The two way mirror was cool and the elaborate paintings were interesting but after they were shown in their one scene, they were never seen again. There was so much potential wasted, and it is really a shame.This movie takes a complete turn in a few ways I did not see coming. The company control monsters in which to kill people but what was basically going to happen was totally obvious. The ending to this movie was far-fetched and definitely entertaining. Actually, I need to say this, the movie was entertaining. I was generally entertained, and I even found myself laughing a lot, and I didn't like that either. I wanted to be scared and wondering what was going to happen. An interesting story simply turned into mindless violence with a poor reason.Overall, "Cabin in The Woods" was generally entertaining with wasted potential and a disappointing chain of events in the end. Acting was pathetic, which is expected from a horror movie, but I honestly expected better because I heard so many positives from this movie. I did like how Marty touched upon how he felt like he was in a horror movie and the film touched on the structure of horror movies in general, but the poor structure of this movie was just disappointing. I wanted to enjoy this movie but I did not get what I wanted. "Cabin in The Woods" gets a WillyT A for Effort. I suggest you rent or borrow this movie and see it at least once, but only once.</fullReview>

And for people out there that think i don't "GET" this film i'll have to point out your wrong because i did "GET" this film i understood everything that was happening but just because you understand something it doesn't mean you have to like it!. there are allot of films i "understand" i understood the Blair witch project film but i didn't like it! i thought it was Boring.Yes i got the "point" but it still sucked and its the same with this film,i didn't find it funny or scary i found it boring most of the time and the people that were watching from underground were idiots and the story was idiotic too,its about all these people that set all of these monsters onto the people at the cabin because they wan't the kids dead and we find out later in the film that they need a bunch of sacrifices in order to APPeace these so called Gods! otherwise they will destroy the whole world! and apparently in order for it to work they needed five specific people one category for each of them and oh how (convenient) these people just "happen" to be the ones they needed! so they try and kill them with a bunch of monsters that they have locked up underground and the students have to try and survive and escape.I will admit you get some good blood and gore in this movie but it takes more than lots of blood to save a movie! and to me this movie was just a mess!. what started out well just went down hill and spiralled out of control!. you get this one ridiculous scene in the film where this guy is on a motorbike and he drives over the edge of a cliff,slams into a forcefield and then falls in a crappy landing and he dies in such a stupid way and some people say that was suppose to be funny! well i'm sorry but i don't buy that i don't think that was supposed to be funny at all,how can a guy dying be funny?? it wasn't! and i don't care if he fell in a way that looked silly that doesn't make it funny! that makes it Dumb! and allot of the people were dumb too because one weird guy was staring at this creature in the water at one point in the film and when the creature swims away do you know what he says?.oh man! i didn't get to see my merman! get it merman? so instead of a mermaid its a merman!. Huh? what the hell was that? was that supposed to be funny? i didn't think it was i thought that was one of the dumbest things i'd ever heard!.that man must have been some kind of freak if he fancied a creature!, here's an idea pal get a girlfriend! and stop obsessing over ugly looking monsters! its weird!. At the end of the film we get a lame fight in a cave between Sigourney weaver and our surviving Characters and they kill her and then do you know what they do after that? they sit down and have a smoke! then a giant hand comes out of the ground and hits the camera! and the world is destroyed! and that's supposed to be the big brilliant ending?. I hate to break it to people but that wasn't a good ending that's what you call a Bad ending! not to mention it was a Cliché ending! which made the rest of the film seem completely pointless! because the teenagers went through all of that stuff and fought all those monsters just for the world to be destroyed in the end anyway!.what a waste of time! if the world was going to be destroyed in the end then you may as well have done that in the first ten minutes of the movie and ended it there because they all die in the end anyway so what difference did it make?. people say the ending is "Clever" well i disagree i thought the ending was a (Cheap Shot) and very Deppressing!. the ending is NOT clever at all its disguised to look like its "clever" when really there was nothing clever about it,its the same rubbish we've seen in every horror film (everyone dying at the end). so once again for people out there that think i didn't "Get It" i obviously did "Get it" because i just explained it and my opinion still hasn't changed i still thought the movie Sucked!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst "Horror" Movie I Have Ever Seen....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of horror movies, any movies really, i watch whatever, but this was just terrible. I gave it a 2 only because the beginning was alright, but once the "zombies" were coming out of their graves from underground,I kind of started to worry. But even that would've been better than what this movie turned out to be. At first i didn't really understand what was going on, but once i knew, i wish i hadn't found out- evil gods? really?! What a letdown!!!!!! No idea how this got so many good reviews. I honestly think "The Devil Inside" was better than this and I was even bored to death through that! I'd rather watch that like 10 more times than watch this again</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okey, i had actually pretty high expectations before i saw this mess of a good idea gone bad. Everything i heard and read about it was that it will flip the howl horror genre upside down. Well did it? Yes it did, but not in a good way. Some teenagers going to a cabin in the woods (there was no lake however...hm pity) to party and have a good time and as always something happens that change all that. I knew the acting wouldn't be good, but the characters had no personality at all...i didn't cheer for anyone of them i just wanted to see them all die in awesome ways...and did they? No! It was boring...and i thought they just rushed threw everything all the time. And some of the characters felt like they came right out a bad sit-com, no one felt serious. There was some cool scenes at the end and i liked that they used similar creatures from other movies (the pinhead but with blades in his head in stead of spikes) that's why i give it a 3 out 10 rating. The only thing i was curious about was why they did as they did...and i couldn't been more disappointed. Sacrifice some teenagers to ancient gods so that they wouldn't take over the world again?! Seriously? But what to expect from the guy who brought us Buffy the vampire slayer...enough said. Joss Whedon did a great job with the avengers but that just proves he's a good director but bad screen writer. After reading this threw i change my mind and change my 3 to a 2 in rating, this is a real disappointment and should never have been made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a disastrous crap movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am very sorry I really looked forward to see this movie today, however whatever the director there had in mind is just shocking and doesn't even have to do the slightest with a "good" horror movie. The setting basically is like in many horror movies, the one dies behind the other in the survival chain of the characters. There was no special ideas behind their deaths, just pure slaughter in the darkness. Any old school Nightmare on Elm Streets movie was more inspiring. Even the acting wasn't good at all. (until now this movie would get a 4 from me) What makes it even worse is the end. To have a total chaos with a variety of creatures below the house next to the end of the world scenario is just plain uninspiring. To have a ritual to stop the gods coming while having a whole army already killed during this doesn't make sense either. I am very sorry but it was the worst movie I have seen 2013. Maybe even the actors cannot do much for this, however really don't want to see more. How can it be rated with 7,1??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not see the trailer or did not hear anything about this movie. I gave it a chance and was expecting it to be something like The Strangers or something like that.I was disappointed and surprised as to what the plot was. If you like horror movies, this is NOT what you're looking for. It started off pretty decent and then only got worse. It turned out to be completely weird and out of my style of movies I like. If you like zombies, you may like this one. This is honestly lucky enough for me to even give it 2 stars. I absolutely cannot see or believe why this was rated so high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overly ambitious Horror homage that is an overkill of ideas and is amazingly not entertaining considering that the Writer was the talent behind the excellent TV show Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It seems the idea man is much more creative when he has the screen time to let the juices flow over a long period of time. However, this seems cramped and claustrophobic with an overflow of images and too much mayhem to be anything more than a self-satisfying silly statement on the modern Horror film. It is done with such heaviness that the "Black Comedy" is drowned in a deluge of half-realized parodies and screen references obliterated by gallons of blood.It's all here in a bloated belief that the makeup, CGI, and a parade of "monster icons" could have fans salivating with glee as they impress each other with a checklist of terror trivia. There is an abundance of audience pleasing references but the whole template of ancient rituals combined with a modern technological setup is never really convincing and the final image is a giant metaphor for bigger is not always better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen some bad horror films in my day, but this piece of $hit takes the cake. It is totally nonsensical, utterly ridiculous, grossly exaggerated, completely absurd and a blood fest, no, a blood orgy is more like it. And those are its good points. The premise is so tired and worn. As I watched the girl descend into the dark basement alone I knew then it was schlock. What woman in her right mind would do that in such a creepy old, dark house in the middle of the woods? But alas our brave heroine whom earlier was so grossed out by a piece of art that she had to put a blanket over it, now has grown a pair of balls. There is no way any review can spoil this movie as it has spoiled itself.I feel like suing the producers to get the 95 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this crap.And that Signourey Weaver and Bradford Whitley would even lend their names to this made me lose all respect for them as actors. Times must really be hard for them to sink this low.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horrible horror movie or absurd boring comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure if Cabin in the Woods was supposed to be an horror movie or an comedy/satire movie. Yet, it fails both ways. As an movie expert, i must say that, in this film, the only derivation from horror it's the word to describe it: horrible. Unless you're a 13 year boy with a lot of SWAG and YOLO, this picture won't mean anything to you. In spite of having an original, different plot from the other horror movies, it just "goes bananas". And i'm just assuming that this was not supposed to be a comedy, because if it was, the word horrible isn't enough. The zombies, the unicorns, clowns, wolves... it's more cheesy than the cheesecake factory. The good thing about this movie is the runtime. If you don't want to see a movie that will take you 2 hours in front of the screen and make you think or discuss ideas after it, this is the movie for you. Pure lame, cheesy Hollywood entertainment right in your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I must say that the trailer really made me want to watch this. It looked like something new, never seen. I was waiting for it to finally be released. It's not even out here (Germany) yet! 4 months after being released in many countries. That is happening to a lot of "expected to be great" movies here I'd like to see before everyone is talking about it on the internet. Mostly happening to Horror. Of course this has nothing to do with the movie but I'm sure everyone can understand how upsetting and frustrating that is. Anyway I'm so glad I got to watch this before actually going to the movies because I would've been really disappointed. Kudos for the things like the originality, no question. That was really something different. Other than that the movie was just strange and random. To me they started totally wrong. I really thought I was watching the wrong film! Showing that there's something or someone behind the happenings right at the beginning was bad. Things should be revealed, discovered by the viewers imagination, not handed to them, chopped and ready to be fed. Once it looked like it was the right movie and the characters were introduced it got better. But then, towards the end, it got back to bad. The very end was just as bad as the beginning. Endings tend to be bad most of the time so I'm not pushing on that.As I read some reviews I came to the conclusion that you either hate or love this movie. Hate might be a harsh expression to what I thought but if I had to chose that would be my answer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well I have just returned from watching this film and boy was I disappointed. First off, just the opening title was so low budget, I think TV advertisement pays out more. I love nothing more that a good Horror and especially nothing more better than a slasher / spoof /black comedy horror, but this was just plain Bloody awful. The twistwas ...your left waiting for one. The whole 5 teenage going to a cabin for Sex, Drugs, drink and just plain goofing off is starting to wear thin and this bunch really do not cut the mustard. First off we have the "whore" well I have seen worse behaved nun!! The druggie is getting high on weed yet the munchies just never happen. The Jock is just not tough enough and the 2 goodie two shoes are just plain boring. The whole Gotta have sex, boobs and a wager on the whole thing was not believable and the two goofballs in charge of the whole operation were just creepy in the sense of perverted rather than horror creepy. It all got too predictable and there was not one decent jumpy scene, the only time I sat up in my chair was the purge part and then that ended before it began, and before you knew it we were at a part where the most famous actress in the movie was on screen then killed straight off. The we came to the very lame ending where we were greeted yet again with a very cheap final credit "Cabin in the Woods" looking like it had beenscribbled on the screen.All in all i am gad I went to a Cheap night viewing where seats were ?3.95 as anymore and I would have asked for my money back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leaves you going, "Really?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read great reviews of Cabin in the Woods and heard even better things about writer Joss Whedon. When some people said this was an original look at horror and kept the viewer guessing I was so excited to see it! Unfortunately, it left me disappointed. I think where the writers went wrong was that they wanted to be too original. Without giving away what happens, I'll just say that I think the story could have been better by making the twist simpler. I had an idea in my head during the first half of the movie for what was going on, and I like that predictable idea better than what really happened! As far as the good things about the movie: it was well-acted and visually done well. I love Chris Hemsworth and he showed again how can be the likable tough guy. The rest of the actors who played the teens also did a good job. The movie also had some funny moments, but not enough to make it comedy. Most of the comedy the movie had was making fun of other horror movies--but it wasn't funny until the movie was over and you thought about it. It had some things jump out at you, but not enough to make it scary. There was blood, but not on the level of other slasher films. There was a plot twist, but it wasn't compelling enough to make this a thriller. Basically, if you're going expecting ANY certain genre you're going to be disappointed.</fullReview>

First thing my daughter said after the movie was, "How could anyone pay for this movie to be made?". That's a good question. It's amusing that I couldn't add a spoiler if I wanted because there's nothing to spoil. Shame that people go by the numerical rating. What an upside down world this is when a piece of junk like this actually gets a rating similar to movies like Titanic, The Departed, or Lord of the Rings. The only reason I gave this above a "1" is the scene in which they realize where they really are...and did we really need that thing she did with the wolf? Well, I'm going to a good movie tomorrow night to get this bad taste out of my mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading several reviews and very high ratings, I rented this on demand for $4. This was nothing short of a ridiculous teen horror flick. I'm still perplexed why some reviewers called it intelligent. Were they referring to the almost non-stop absurd attempts at horror, or were they referring to the "intelligent" dialog from the horrid attempts at humor? Whatever the case, they were wrong in all cases.My advice is to skip this one unless you enjoy loud silly creatures that are supposed to be scary, or watching less bright people smoke MJ excessively and act like this is actually funny. It's embarrassing just to watch. You can't even fast forward through the bad parts because it seemed like the bad parts occurred more frequently than every 5 minutes.</fullReview>

You start with bloody killings and suddenly you are watching jokes that are not funny and you are lead to scenes that you don't even watch in home made movies. And then the ending was what gave the final strike though. I understand that this was not going for the same old thriller in the woods but where on earth did that come from... Just no... Save your time and money for another one. I just don't understand why there is this high score in IMDb, lots of people are saying that its the best movies they have seen.

		<fullReview>Argh! What is the deal with this movie? It was shelved for a couple of years because of the trouble MGM had hit it, and has just now been realised because it stars Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and has been met with critical acclaim. In fact, everyone who's seen it seems to be raving about it, so I thought "I want to see this so I can be one of the ones to spread the word on how great it is." Well sorry, but I'm going to be one off the apparent few to let people know how un-great it is! What drew me to "The Cabin in the woods" the most, was that people were calling it something "different." A "game-changer!" Well I will agree that it is different. It's different to a point of stupidity! I will say that there are a lot of ideas in this flick. But these ideas seem small compared to what let's it down. I suppose it is good that the film goes in a totally different direction from what I expected. But for all those who think this is a good thing, I'm sure there will be just as many people (like me) disappointed with where it ends up.I can understand where the praise for this film is coming from (a little) but no amount off being unpredictable can hide the fact that "The Cabin in the woods" is overall dumb, poorly written, and full of plot holes. It's also suppose to be a scary movie too if anyone remembers. But the way it goes makes it more off a laughable attempt at making us jump. I'm a bit more sold on the idea off this being a comedy, because in it's own way it's one of those "So bad it's good" films. But as a horror film, it's a fail. Even it's "uniqueness" isn't all that new. An over-hyped mess this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I registered here just to write this review seeing the high ratings this movie received, I was once a movie critic of sorts many moons ago so feel I can raise some valid points.Whether a movie be a comedy, Horror or Drama they all must have one thing in common, they must retain the attention for the duration of the movie, thankfully this movie is only a shade over the 90 minute mark as any longer would have resulted in an ever lower rating, during the course of the movie the viewer should be treated to some pleasurable moments, whether this be witty dialog, a clever plot, amazing visual effects or tear jerking moments, but unfortunately this movie has no such moments, none at all, it is very flat in that respect.The above, with acting is mediocre acting (what acting they had to do) and a decent budget result in this movie being watchable at best, the plot it did not hold my attention in the slightest and I found it very the plot very childish, (something I really didn't expect) the movie is neither funny ha, ha or funny bad either, I found no irony or satire in the plot as many found either, it is just an round a bad movie made on a decent budget.</fullReview>

That made me go see it at the cinema and what a disappointment. It's a good film, but totally different genre, and is more like Scream meets Friday the 13th. Must admit that it started with promise, but as soon as the zombies appeared, I realized it was going to go downhill from there, and it sure did. There is some clever ideas, and it is not something that should be written here as it gives away the premise of the film, but the whole thing was unbelievable and, in places, unbelievably bad. The acting is acceptable, but not great, and the story ends up being quite ridiculous. All in all, something worth watching on cable but not worthy of the cinema ticket price.</fullReview>

Then the world comes to an end because the two remaining characters didn't get sacrificed(really are you kidding me).This movie is just all around bad.

I don't suggest anyone should watch this it's completely a waste of time. I feel like it stole time from my life that I will never get back and I regret it. I should've listened to my sisters. Any ways please listen to my advice and don't watch it. Even if you're just curious. Just remember 'curiosity killed the cat'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can I give a negative rate? Please? I honestly don't know what the HELL is going on with these people giving 9 and 10 rates to this movie because it is absolutely awful! The storyline is ridiculous and the characters are so cliché... Fortunately I didn't pay to see this movie, otherwise I'd be even more chocked! And I honestly don't understand how this "thing" is rated almost with 8! How is that possible? If the viewers continue rating this as a good movie, we will see it in the TOP 250 of IMDb. Do you think it is that good? The film could've been better if the writer/director explored more the concept of the human sacrifice and the sources of that religion... but they didn't! I really have no idea why people like this kind of bad cinema. IMDb is losing its credibility, clearly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original??? It's a remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've looked at several reviews here and a common theme is that this is an original film, it's not. It is essentially a remake of Waxworks, a film from the 80's with that guy from gremlins in it. It's not a terrible film, but nothing worth watching a second time. And the final reason for why everything is happening is just dumb, lazy writing, it would have been a better movie if the core reason for everything that was happening was slightly clever.You can go see this film, but prepare to be disappointed if you are halfway intelligent. And yes, that is my way of insulting you people who will sing praises for this film just because of the firefly guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>stupid and pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the only scary thing about this movie is the fact that there are people out there who like this kind of movie.the story is really dumb. the elements do not have any connection. instead they are throwing 'cool looking' stuff in your face every few minutes. without explaining anything. you might enjoy this if you are used to turn off your brain when watching movies. otherwise it's just confusing. some say this is supposed to be a parody but i didn't see that. mostly because it just wasn't funny for me. also the plot is unbelievable in many ways. they could have got away with it if they cared to explain some basic elements. but they didn't. acting was OK. special effects were fine too. same for camera work.but it's really a mess. and your head would probably be a mess too if you tried to actually put together what you are seeing. it's impossible. i don't know who thinks of a plot like this but they must've been on some really shitty drugs.so i guess you can enjoy this movie if you like pointless horror-movies that forget about the plot and just try to impress with images and violence. but for me this does not work. i just get bored and offended by that kind of movies. it will also help if your attention span is no longer than 3 minutes. because then you won't notice how stupid the whole thing really is.you really have to read the 'hated it'-reviews first nowadays. with all the 'stealth marketing' going on it seems that IMDb ratings aren't as reliable as they used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the woods was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I found it very difficult to stay awake. After waking up for the third time I realized the movie wasn't going to get any better. Each time I woke up I was watching a completely different movie. I wasn't impressed with the typical zombie horror film to begin with. I've seen movies like this millions of times with the same outcome. Everyone dies. I started to wonder how this movies was jammed together when I saw the college kids drive through a bridge that somehow put them in another realm with a forcefield? That combined with a lot of random monsters,weed as an inluential part of the movie,a swat team,and some form of earth god who destroys the world because some girl doesn't die makes the perfect, senseless movie. After watching I felt that someone had put "Aliens" "The Even Stephens Movie" and "SAW" in a blender. Worst movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two stars because I did finish it (regrettably). I understood "the point" loud and clear, but to regard this film as some kind of intricate, genre-straddling masterpiece of cinematic renaissance is insulting on so many levels. The Cabin In The Woods is pure convoluted junk. It's as if they couldn't come up with one good solid plot with which to drive the movie. So they utilize a caterwaul of plots which are half-baked and mostly stolen. Worse yet, the subplots that they actually came up with on their own reach a level of cheesiness that surpasses all but the guiltiest of cheesy 80's horror. Aside from the story, the script is fundamentally generic and blatantly melodramatic. The special effects look great, but everything else about this film is a God-awful mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another masterpiece by Ed Wood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's mildly tempting to give this absurdest, incoherent, pretender-to-mythic-significance of a film the brutal review it fully deserves. The mythic material that serves as a major part of the foundation for this movie is treated with ignorance and contempt. This is one of the worst movies ever. But my experience on this site is that the cotton-candy-brained typical audience member viewing films these days would barely or never understand any references providing meaningful evaluation. Very sadly, that's about 95% of average viewers.Spoiler-- It's a statistical fact that less than 3% of American are unique subscribers to Newsweek, Time, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, or similar publications, based on Pew data seven years ago. We have become a nation of anti-intellectuals, with no capacities for critical thinking at all; actually, according to Richard Hofstadter's great book, we always have been. Even today's college graduates frequently know very little about the arts and sciences; we are a culture in rapid decline.This film's "success" is based on the premise that Hollywood can regularly count on national stupidity, represented recently by Tea Partiers--individuals consistently clueless regarding 17th-century America and its Boston tea.Apologies to the masterful Tim Burton for the "summary." "Ed Wood" will always be a classic worth seeing over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the previews for this I thought that good horror movies were finally being made again! But I stand corrected. This movie was horrible. I went to see this for my birthday and was not impressed. The story plot sounds good while reading it, but when you see it, the movie plain out sucks. It was a waste of money and time. Everything was very cheesy, from the cabin just mysteriously having a underground laboratory to the cheesy zombies. This movie would have been a lot better if it weren't for the laboratory doctors making it seem so ridiculous as a "sacrafice" for the demons. There was only one good part of the whole movie, and that was when they were in the elevator looking at the 4 different monsters. All the rest of the "nightmare" creatures were baloney. From a man-mermaid to a unicorn. And when you think it can't get any worse it does. There was way more blood in the scene while they were waiting in the lab while the creatures attacked than there was in the whole movie. In other words Don't Waste Your Time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror is my favorite genre. I LOVE good horror, even if it's a bad B-movie. Let me say that first.Rarely do I write one of these, but I felt compelled to give my two cents on this turd. The kills are so-so. The suspense is frequently interrupted by the cut-scenes to the wraparound story, but the humor was pretty funny. I had no intention of seeing this movie today (Friday, the 13th) as I had already been sucked in to seeing a 3D re-release of a classic with my wife. I wish I would have done so. At the last minute, the hype bug bit me and I had to go see this movie. . . Mistake.The most enjoyment I received from this film was the chaos near the end. That was cool seeing everything at once (you'll get what I mean if you see it). Overall, what a turd. Save your $30 and get this out of one of those red boxes in a few months.I gave this 3 stars for it's humor, the use of the token stoner and the somewhat entertaining twist.

		<fullReview>That could almost be the end of the review it was that bad! Rating it a 1 is too high, but negative numbers is not an option. It started out different and seemed like it could have potential, but all of that "potential" quickly was replaced with unrealistic bull! From the ginormous growling completely CGI snake to the strange guest appearance by Sigourney Weaver explaining that they need to sacrifice a virgin to satisfy the Gods or the world is going to end it just kept getting worse. Movie was stupid, fake, unrealistic, and just god awful. I actually fell asleep twice in my seat and only woke due to the loud parts in the movie. I was really excited to see this movie, but after seeing it I would have had a much better night counting grains of sand. If I could go back I would stop myself from seeing this awful piece of crap poor excuse for a movie! I also want to point out that I was not expecting a cliché horror movie about some masked psycho picking people off one by one. I think that the storyline had some real promise, but they just took it too far to be even remotely believable. For a movie release in 2012 there was far too much fake looking scenes and characters. The whole feel and vibe of the film for me was just lost very early on. I was extremely disappointed.Hope this helps someone else not waste 2 hours of their life that they will definitely want back!</fullReview>

You can't just drop in characters like that. I learned that in 6th grade English. It bad story telling. And what was with the clown, white mask people, and unicorn. That was kind of lame. There really isn't much more to say. It was different, entertaining, but not mind blowing or revolutionary. It just makes me wonder where all these high rating come from. They could be fake.

		<fullReview>Let me start of by saying "I get it". I knew something of the premise and I couldn't wait to love the film and see what original and satirical road it was going to take. In the end I wasted an hour and a half of my life and became angry having handed over my hard earned cash over to this excuse for a film. Put it this way, if Joss Whedon's name wasn't on this film it would have gone direct to DVD! *SPOILERS BELOW*As I watched the film I began putting it together. I knew from the trailer that some "Truman Show" kind of vibe was going on. Even if it ended up being Truman Show meets Cabin in the Woods it would of been vaguely interesting. Then I got the idea that an audience of some description was watching this big brother style and demanding blood. Cool, I though a Battle Royale / Hunger Games vibe was creeping in. Interesting. I was prepared to forgive the complete lack of tension knowing the scenario was being controlled by people with power to kill the characters at any moment and change their thoughts via various gases (?). I also disliked most of the characters. You can't mock horror clichés with clichés, they are still clichés - and boring one dimensional ones at that. Nevertheless I went along with it. Then the zombies arrived. I thought maybe they were actors pretending to be zombies in this "Running Man" kind of environment. But then I realized the WERE actual zombies. I began to loose grip on the genre I thought I was in. I thought I was in "the real world" so to speak. Then a Japanese Ringu-like spirit on a TV screen... WTF, I thought - spirits too!? When they went down in the elevator into the chamber of horrors, I lost all interest. "The ancient gods demand sacrifice"? Give me a break. What has an evil clown got to do with ancient Gods? I had lost all interest and I couldn't care less who lived or died. "Oh but it represents us, the audience" no it's just lazy writing! A story should work and be utterly engaging first and foremost, any analogy or subtext should be icing on the cake - not the reason to validate the supposed "entertainment". A great, great pity. Wanted to love this but wasted my time. Don't waste your time! Avoid.</fullReview>

If it was free I would have walked out. To be honest, I'm still not sure how this movie got backing, because it feels like it was made up during filming.I'm not going to go into details because it's not worth that; but really, don't waste your time.

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in the Woods is a absolutely thrilling ride into the minds of all things terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It rarely happens to leave a screening room on a brisk weekday afternoon with an air of pure excitement for what we have just seen.Joss Whedon, best known for being the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the equally brilliant Firefly, had just introduced his brand new film to a crowd of roughly fifty film critics and lucky fans. Written and directed by Cloverfield creator Drew Goddard, the film follows a group of hapless teenagers ready to get away from the city and enjoy a weekend in the forest. After finding their destination, albeit "the cabin in the woods", they start to explore, leading to a discovery that none of them could ever of imagined.Goddard has worked with Whedon in the past on a few episodes of Buffy and, thankfully, their relationship looks as though it has survived as they have created, most probably, a genre-defining film. The jokes (yes, there are jokes in the film) come thick and fast and - without giving too much away ? create some fantastic scenes between Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, who play colleagues Steve and Richard respectively.As the layers of the film are peeled away, more and more is discovered about the cabin and the fate of the unlucky five-some which only keeps you more enthralled as Whedon manically shows what he can REALLY do with a few dollars and some special effects.All this ultimately comes to a thrilling climax as the last twenty minutes reveals everything that we could have hoped for. And, most importantly, who those men in the trailer are? Encapsulating everything that the horror genre has delivered in its entire history and probably one of the few films that can say they have a Merman and Nosferatu appearing in the same sequence, The Cabin in the Woods is a absolutely thrilling ride into the minds of all things terrible. It delivers some astounding special effects and, at the same time, brings out the best in a fairly young cast, especially Chris Thor Hemsworth who shows a sold performance as boyfriend Curt. Oh, and not to mention a very special guest appearance that received an applause when they appeared on screen.Joss Whedon has scored yet again and shows no signs of slowing down with superhero movie to end all superhero movies, The Avengers (penned by Whedon) being released later this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...which kind of defeats the purpose. The movie ends up sounding patronizing and honestly a little pretentious.Spoilers Ahead.The deconstruction of the horror genre is done in a very accusatory fashion. Deconstruction is my favorite thing in fiction, I'm a huge fan of a Song of Ice and Fire, so it's not just that it's not my type of movie. It's exactly my type of movie. But when Martin deconstructs fantasy in ASOIAF, he does it with clear respect. You can tell all the way that he's one of us, that he understands why we like fantasy, and that his work is an extension of fantasy, as opposed to someone watching fantasy from a high ground and telling us what sucks about it. In this movie however, the distance is clear. The audience of the movie is represented by angry, ancient gods, who demand sacrifices and blood. There has to be a sexy scene, because that's what the Gods want. The characters have to be stupid and stereotypical, because that's what the Gods want. We're also sadists, because we want to see the main girl suffer and in the end we don't care if she lives or dies... We're supposed to take a hard look on ourselves and realize that our expectations in watching these kinds of movies are somehow problematic... And the movie makers are looking at us from their moral high ground and ready to display everything that's wrong with the picture.I'm not saying there is zero merit to the argument itself; and I also know that "horror" isn't a block, the movie can criticize things like Saw and stand for the traditional horror movies. But that's very different from a simple deconstruction, that's an attack. In the end the movie is saying that there's something wrong with liking movies like this. Even as masterfully as it's done here, I can't say that I enjoy the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A misguided opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joss Whedon is one of those talented screenwriters and directors many people consider to be a Hollywood name. Whether after working on several productions that redefined how people see movies or creating new characters and the universes they live in, Whedon has had wide success in the film industry. Most notably, the latest work that most people think of is Marvel's The Avengers (2012). Second in line was this little creature feature which gained a cult following for a very subtle reason. If anyone has seen it, all that they will say is "See it for the ending". Sadly, this reason alone should not exactly be it's best selling point, but this is how the filmed gained its momentum in popularity. Sadly, this film did have some promise but most of it was used in the wrong manner.The premise is the first thing audiences have to accept. The beginning starts off like many other isolation horror films where a group of young teenagers go out to a secluded area away from home for fun. As cliché as it is, Whedon and writer/director Drew Goddard turn the horror genre on its head in its early head start on why various horrific things happen. In spite of that once the ball starts rolling, the screenplay begins to collapse on itself for being so convoluted. The idea is just very foolish and may in fact annoy people to think this kind of story line is anyway beyond the writing of a goofy college student. It is because of its self-destruction that there is barely a build up at all and once it occurs, it may not feel like it was worth it. The only other notable component to the writing are the multiple references made to the horror fans. Night of the Living Dead (1968) is definitely one. Then there's The Ring (2002), The Evil Dead (1981), Hellraiser (1987) and even a Jurassic Park (1993) reference.Even with all the inside nods to the audience and fans, the writing continues to miss. A big flaw is the focus on characters, mainly in comedy. There are numerous scenes where it is supposed to be funny but is viewed at from the wrong angle and therefor the viewer won't feel like laughing. It's like watching Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and rooting for Leatherface and his family to kill everyone they come in contact with. It feels wrong and somewhat uncleanly. Delightfully although it too is a horror genre cliché, our main characters played by Kristen Connolly, Fran Kranz, Chris Hemsworth, Jesse Williams and Anna Hutchison do combat there opponents. Not much needed to say after that because this is a horror movie so people will die. Obviously. Speaking of which there is plenty of gore to behold. It's not consistent in its frequency of delivery but when it begins, it just keeps getting messier.This, the special and practical effects for various creatures also mesh in nicely with their surroundings. This is also most likely credited to the cinematographer for getting some nice shots of the woodsy exterior around the cabin and various other places throughout the movie, especially later on. If there's anything else to talk about it is the music composed by David Julyan. The audio sounds like a horror score but it never engages the viewer to feel like they're in one. This is partially because the writing and tone don't assist it in its cause. Instead, it goes for the usual string stings and creeping tunes but it never works. This isn't Julyan's first horror score either. Most likely it would have been much more effective if the script had the correct tone and used it the right way. So sadly it did not and instead, we get this weird stew of a soup.It has decent special/practical effects, the appropriate horror, praiseworthy nods to other horror movies and even acceptable acting. But that's it, the screenplay messes it up entirely with a tone that was either unnecessary or directed to focus on the wrong characters. Plus when it's all over, it almost felt like a waste of time more than a proper buildup.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most worthless things to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not get the idea why people would make a movie so worthless. Its story is senseless and extremely lame to say the least. Its primary purpose is to show gore, gore that is done by non-humans; "monsters" if you will. Like your usual mediocre gory horror movies, the cast is all enticing with youthful good-looking actors and actresses. In this movie though, the acting was fair enough. The movie writers wanted to make a movie that combines technology with old-fashioned backwoods zombies. They thought it was a brilliant idea. All it did was an utter waste of resources. Maybe that's what they wanted after all, since the movie was all about that; futility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start? OK, I'm a pretty big fan of Horror movies. Anything from old classics like Psycho, Poltergheist, Amytiville to more recent movies like Saw, Let The Right One In, The Conjuring, etc. What I like in horror is the storyline, the acting, the suspense, the scary moments, etc.I found this movie a complete joke and I wondered if I was watching some kind of parody of the genre. The storyline is very cheesy and full of "cliches". The worst is mixing all this with some kind of reality show. Really?If you like "real" horror flicks, here's my little piece of advise: Don't watch it!</fullReview>

I was just waiting for this whole crap to end. And then there is a change. But then it becomes more ridiculous. I suspect some CGI stuff.

		<shortDescription>Did I just watch a movie made out of a Charlton horror comic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1970s there was a low-budget comic book publisher called Charlton which put out a line of horror comics that borrowed ideas from all over the place and sometimes ran them together. Occasionally instead of 3 stories in an issue, you'd get a book-length story that took a cast of characters through various sorts of trials and catacombs all the way to the dark dimension of the ancient Cthulhu-type gods of the H. P. Lovecraft mythology, and they'd all get sucked into a big pit by something with giant tentacles. The end.For a 25c comic book in 1975, OK, you can get away with that sort of crap. For a full-length feature film in the 21st century, people expect better.Actually what you get here is something like the 3 stories in the Charlton comic all run together -- the beginning of the film is a straight kids-in-the-cabin setup, the second part more heavily involves the people behind the scenes apparently manipulating the setup (and that's not a spoiler, it's clear early on that this is going on), and the third part is the supposedly big surprise ending which I won't reveal.Part 1, or I should say Story 1, is the most formulaic bit but also the most interesting. An old diary and some acceptably scary creatures in the woods start picking people off, in typical horror movie fashion. Which works well enough. Too bad we'll never see this story resolved. Story 2 is not very believable but would have been acceptable had it not been revealed so early on and turned out to be all a show arranged for evil filthy rich people who liked seeing people get killed, which is what appears to be going on, or at any rate would be the only thing that would make sense. But that is not the case here. Unfortunately. The big secret, Story 3, comes way out someplace beyond left field, and doesn't make a whit of sense, and neither does the scene of its revelation, and that makes the concluding portion of this movie stink to high heaven. This 2nd "big surprise" is too much; it just wasn't necessary and just plain doesn't work, which is probably why most people who say they do hate the movie.AVENGERS and other Whedon projects have also attempted to try and let over-the-topness replace coherence but that just doesn't work. AVENGERS didn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense and neither does this. Its just random and all over the place; the product of a writer who does not write from life but reworks content he's already seen in other movies. Ugh. I will say this for the film, tho. There is one fantastic crowd-pleasing scene after Story 1 has been dumped and just before Story 2 is turned into Story 3 which in its over-the-topness will wow anyone watching. It's a wonderful "hooooly s--t!" moment But it only lasts a minute or so before you think, OK, enough already. I get it. Move on. Honestly tho I'd rather have done without the whole LOGAN'S RUN-type "Story 2" as well as the lousy ending, which negates any meaning that Story 1 might have had, and just seen Story 1 worked out more creatively. I got the feeling that the "watchers" were simply the writers/director of the film injecting themselves into this so they could mess with the story. Which is exactly what those writers/director(s) did with this movie. It's so heavily messed with that it ends in a complete train wreck, not in any sort of satisfying way. And it is not a spoof; it's fairly nasty sometimes and absolutely never funny -- I don't know where that idea is supposed to come from. CABIN IN THE WOODS is not really creative, it's inbred and backwards. And therefore is not really recommended unless you just want to see that one amazing over-the-top scene, or really really loved book-length issues of Charlton horror comics a lot, even when they were really derivative, random, incoherent, and just plain bad.</fullReview>

I'll admit, this movie started off pretty good, had my attention, had an unique story/plot going on, then out of no where I completely lost interest. It had nothing to do with the actors, as I thought they all played their roles to the best of their abilities, other than one very annoying voice. Another thing this movie had going OK was the special effects/graphics. The problem is how the movie ended. That seems to be very common now days, especially in the horror genre. Directors/writers get going and going and totally wind up off the deep end. I give this movie 4 out of 10-RENT IT</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well after such an extended and unnecessary build up I finally saw this film. It has come and gone without a whimper and I've watched many far superior films since. So where to start?? Remember the twist in 'The Crying Game?' And thinking hang on where's the twist??, I knew that girls a guy!! Or hearing how you should not read or watch anything to do with this film??? There's good reason for that... This film started in a predictable manner, struck something partly interesting along the way (by accident??) and finished as a film that has lost plot normally does. Remember Lost?? So similar. So no huge story, usual antics and only 1 creative scene. The rest is filler, loose ideas and dead ends. Really quite a terrible mess of a film, given 5/10 only for people who have lived in a cave and found a video, TV and a chair. See it only to say I've seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this DVD, not to be scared, but for gore. I was very disappointed. The DVD case had 3 different reviews, each giving 5 stars, so I got my hopes up. Although there was a lot of blood, it didn't feel like there was a lot of gore. Unfortunately it was basically a cross between The Hunger Games, Final destiantion and Friday 13th. Don't get me wrong, they're all great films but the combination isn't. It all seemed a bit too cheesy for my liking and whilst the storyline had the potential to be great, it wasn't told in the best way. In my opinion, the best thing about it was Chris Hemsworth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be upfront the only thing I did not like about this movie is the last 5 minutes. It's got good suspense, action, thrills etc. If the movie would have just been the people taking bets about who survives that'ed been cool. But instead they had to throw in the ancient god stuff and that just ruined it for me. I do like how what "monster" they face is decided by what they pick up first in the basement. Some pros are: good storyline (until the end), quite suspenseful, the high guy really is funny, pretty girls. The cons: the only one to me is the ending. I have not bought this movie since its release nor do I plan to. I would watch it again but only if it came on TV (basically if it didn't cost me anything). The movie had a lot of potential but they just didn't deliver the ending I was hoping for. I guess in the end its all up to personal preference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed- up Parody of several Genres/ Bad Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will go through my stages to experience the Movie.The Trailer: You get the misleading impression the Movie is a sadistic variety of the "Truman Show" where some teenagers are lured into a "Cabin in the Woods", where they get slaughtered brutal one by one. There is some Kind of Hidden organization who is in total control of the area in these woods, who starts killing them one by one, while observing the whole spectacle through a hidden base with cameras.This was getting me curious, so i watched the Movie.The Movie: Several Stages of the Movie,starting with Teenie-Horror-Splatter, going over to Teenie-Horror-Splatter-PARODY, going over to complete Splatter-Trash, turning out in the end as a Apocalypse-Horror-Movie.My personal opinion: Unfortunately the Trailer does not keep what he promises, he even makes the Viewer expect a different kind of Movie.The Movie is nearly a Horror-Movie-Parody, following the footsteps of Movies like "Scream", not as good as it though. But its also full of Splatter and Gore, like you see in this Splatter-Trash-Movies.The Acting is poor, some of the actors played in movies like in "Power Rangers Jungle Fury", also Sigourney Weaver looks with her short Scene in the end as she was desperate for some money.The Storyline is boring, makes no sense and takes itself not serious, in my opinion that makes every movie not even worth a watch, and the Final is massively exaggerated, if you see the movie as a whole from how it started as when 5 teens startet a trip into the woods, and now the world will end. Seriously? That sounds maybe like a good idea when your stoned for 2 days.The Special effects have been not so bad though, but if you want to see splatter, its not better than in other movies.So i don't recommend to watch this movie at all, since its clearly falling under the category Trash for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing the score and reviews I thought I'm in for quite a ride. After the movie for the first time I felt that I wasted my time with a movie. This movie is a parody on horror movies,not a horror movie,it's a comedy,not a thriller. Maybe it was intentional to label the movie horror,but if I wanted to watch a horror movie parody I would go and watch it,not when I choose to watch horror movie. I like to judge movies when I watch them,I don't like to watch trailers,so I really was unaware of what I was in for. Even when I look at the movie from parodying point of view it's just bad.I got a few laughs and that's why it got a 2.I suspect rating is so high for 2 reasons,first is that people expect such low standard of cinematography that they consider this an achievement(saw some reviews that explain 10/10 rating with lines like "Best horror movie",and the second is from people who recognized that this movie is a parody and feeling smart are giving this movie 10-star rating because movie made them feel superior to the 1st reason crowd so now the movie is genius in its anti-horror undertaking.If this was labeled parody then we could see realistic ratings.Sorry for bad English</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really this is a very boring film. The only reason why I watched it through to the end was because I was thinking maybe there was going to be some clever twist but in fact there are no surprises. Once the situation of the film is set up within the first 30 mins all the rest is fairly predictable.The basic idea is actually very uninteresting. So, it satirises a few genres of horror films and does so within a greater plan, but the satire is not very clever. I didn't laugh once in this film and I do have a sense of humour, honest.If you have sat through 30 mins of this and you are bored don't make the mistake I did and keep watching in case something interesting happens, it won't.</fullReview>

I also feel bad, a lit bit, for writing my first review here on IMDb like this but hey! I don't want other users to watch this movie and regret for doing so. I therefore decide to be a good human being in making other people not go through the 90 minutes of Bull**** I went through. That says enough right? No? Alright here goes... I don't really know what the writers thought when they wrote this script. It doesn't make sense to me at all, anywhere at all!It is plain boring especially for a horror fan like me this movie is the biggest disappointment ever. I've seen many boring movies but at least there'd be some fun moments here and there but this is the first movie I really felt like breaking my monitor. I was watching this movie till the end just to know what those freaks were trying to do but they ended up dying I don't know why. I also don't want to write more about the movie because there is nothing much to write about.Anyway, I've planned to write more reviews from now, not because I want to write, but because I don't want any more users to go by the star ratings. I don't know if you can follow reviewers in IMDb but if you can, then start following me because my reviews will be genuine and I write only when I think I'm either disappointed or exalted! PS: This movie review is my personal opinion and definitely many people would agree with me on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the starters, there's nothing new in the movie. This may seem contrary to many critics and movie fans but its the naked truth. It has the same thing again and again. More gore, more violence and more cheap thrills. I waited throughout the movie to see what's new in it but failed miserably. The only good thing happened for it was Fran Kranz performance. He steals the show with his dialog delivery and funny accent. Others are as dumb as Asses.The story starts with a trip to the woods with five friends that ended horribly in the end. There's a Petrol Station run by a zombie like creature (as in Wrong Turn) who talks cheap. Hey ! but here they don't take a wrong turn instead they go by their plan.The Cabin is controlled by an underground laboratory which is full of creeps and freaks. No, the freaks don't control the cabin just for fun. In fact, it is later revealed to be a part of some creepy ritual. I simply cannot swallow the whole logic here.And everybody dies in the end. The End.Note: If you want to watch a Grade C+ movie, its great. Don't expect anything unusual or horror in it. You may even want to laugh at several occasions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately folks, it is not good news. I was thoroughly excited about watching this one, especially since it had an average rating of 7.3/10 on IMDb, which is usually a good cross-reference for me when choosing a movie to watch.I am a horror movie fan, have been since I was a child. In a way, everybody forgets about the real world when endeavouring to watch a horror movie; to get lost in the experience. The movie starts out as your average teenager-slashing movie does - quite boringly. Quite slow. By the time something happens, the special effects annoyed me. The plot was extremely predictable up until nearing the end, when things became utterly bizarre and downright silly. Again, special effects make you question whether or not you are watching a Looney Tunes episode as opposed to a horror film. As you have probably gathered, I am not a fan of special effects. I take my hat off to every film maker who stages everything manually. Look at The Exorcist - thought of as some of the most creative and effective scenes in film making, even to this day.All in all, I give this film a 2/10. Mediocre acting, silly concepts, awful special effects, a pretty awful ending, a slow start, an underwhelming middle, I struggle to say anything positive about this movie. It was really poor and really disappointing; really surprised to be writing this review considering the good IMDb rating and critical reviews on the film - most of which I usually agree with. Not this time, for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in Cuckoo Land!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most overrated horror/comedy movies to come out in the past decade, 'The Cabin in the Woods' is a mentally insane, senseless feature length film.Director and joint writer Drew Goddard managed to stitch together a script which lacks any cohesive features and the lack of intellectual presence within the making of this film make me wonder if a bunch of low life school children were behind its production. At points in the story, you will think you have switched films, and then switched again...and again. Imagine a man going to work in an office. The man in the office is eaten by a cow.The cow flies to Mexico and becomes an assassin. He works for a sheep who builds a bomb and blows up planet Earth. This epitomises how utterly ridiculous and senseless 'The Cabin in the Woods' is.To briefly explain the synopsis for the first twenty minutes, five teenage friends - including 'Thor' star Chris Hemsworth - head off to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. After some apparent humour, Dana (Kristen Connolly) reads a passage from a book which prompts the release of herds of flesh eating zombies.The film doesn't completely fail as some moments genuinely raise a brief chuckle or two (as they intend to) and the finale, if utterly ridiculous - is engaging and there is good use of CGI in the build up to it.Ultimately though, it depends on your view. You will either love this film for its willingness to be strangely original and daring, or you will hate it as it makes little sense and its humour is strictly for immature teens. I am the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, it's not often that you see a horror movie with such a high rating on IMDb. And that is what got me so excited to see it. Even the best horror movies I have ever seen usually get an average rating of around 5 or 6 here, so this one with a 7+ rating HAD to be simply amazing, right?WRONG...I consider myself a horror buff, having seen countless movies in the past 25 years. But this movie flat out sucked. I don't care if it's supposed to be some "intelligent" satire, or a "spoof on the horror genre". It fails at being a satire, and it fails at being horror. If anything, this is more of an action movie with effects. Not a horror movie!There are a couple of gory scenes, and the make-up and effects are good. I imagine a large portion of the budget went into making the CGI effects. And I'm all for good effects and gore. But when the movie - as a movie, doesn't hold up at all, then it's all a waste. Most movies with an effects / gore budget lower than this one are also way better movies - because they do what a horror movie is supposed to do; That is, keep you on your toes, feel unpredictable, feel scary, feel tense. And the less you know about why and what is happening to the main characters, generally the better!The Cabin in the Woods does NONE of that. From pretty much the very beginning, you know what is going on - and it ruins the movie from then on. 7+ star rating? Seriously people? People rating this movie high cannot possibly have seen many TRUE horror movies. Satire, real, or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really looked forward to this one and it started quite interestingly. That was mainly because you could see what was going on. I like films where you can see what is happening, sort of helps you understand the plot. However I had to switch off after about an hour, not caring how it would end, I just wanted out. All vital, supposedly scary scenes are all in darkness. Like two black cats fighting in your garden at night. Sometimes you see an eye or a head or a shirt, a lot of screaming and shuffling, hey something is happening, is that blood or what? You can't tell because you can't frigging see it. The main actress also had only two faces in her repertoire, "no expression" and "worried", but I didn't mind, at least it meant I could see something. One of my pet hates is films that are too dark, if you have the same problem avoid this as you might as well close your eyes and listen to the radio where they at least describe what's happening. I reckon that if someone could have put up a little more light, this film might actually not be too bad but I could not cope with it any longer. Do give it a try though and decide for yourself after all a lot of people liked it maybe they have better eyesight or can't stand gore and feel safer if they have to guess what is going on. Probably a good film but I won't try finding out.</fullReview>

The way the climax was shot made be feel that even 10th grade students would film a better movie.I personally feel, this movie does not deserve anything more than 0.5/10.If you want to spend 90 minutes of your life without doing anything useful, then watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comprehensive shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Cabin in the Woods, five college types and their RV visit a remote cabin for a vacation of freedom and relaxation. They are stock characters: Jules (Anna Hutchinson) the promiscuous coed; Kurt (Chris Hemsworth), the athlete; Marty (an outstanding Fran Kranz), the stoner; and Dana (Kristen Connolly), the good girl. After Dana reads an old diary, the red-neck Zombies descend and with them the clichés.Because you've seen The Friday the 13th franchise and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you might think you know what happens in this parody of the horror genre, but you really don't. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon test your knowledge of the classic tropes and twist enough to create almost a sub-genre?the intelligent spoof that can satisfy a geek's desire to ferret out the most arcane allusions and the regular film goer who likes to enjoy a good scare without deconstructing it.Starting out in Deliverance country as they gas up and get verbally abused by tobacco-spitting gas-station owner, Mordecai (Tim De Zarn as a terrifically stereotyped local), when they get to the abandoned cabin the zombies, et al., descend. If the film had held off the big twist till later, I would have been happier to be scared a few more minutes. But, then, we can enjoy the spoof from early on.Beyond this point, I can only recommend the film because further analysis would disclose too many plot twists. Let's just say, the film ingeniously allows us to be scared while its tongue is firmly planted in it cheek (think Scream). The denouement, with a surprise visit from a horror movie icon, is as absurd as anything previously if not more so. Yet, it seems a right conclusion as it doubles back to first images and explains its bloodbath.By the way, that conclusion is an amalgam of the prominent elements of the genre, masterfully satirized, and fused in mirth-inducing mayhem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bloody fun twist on the isolated cabin sub-genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone knows how to have fun with pop culture horror conventions, it's Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, The Avengers) and he and Director Drew Goddard craft a funhouse of a horror movie by doing just that. And we are happily along for the bloody fun ride. Cabin is a movie where the less you know going in, the better. So, I'll simply say that it starts out with the classic young partiers heading up to an isolated cabin scenario and then turns this horror sub-genre into something quite different and deviously fun. Aside from a really clever script and the fact that Drew Goddard knows how to craft suspense and scares, despite letting us in early on what is going on, we also get a bunch of likable characters (including Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth) to root and care for. This is very important to make a horror flick work and so many films today makes their leads unlikable jerks who we could care less about. We are only scared when we care what happens to the antagonists and here we do. We like this bunch of characters and it adds to the film's effect that we don't want to see them suffer the fate that has befallen them. And what a clever and cruel fate Whedon and Goddard have in store for their victims. And, in turn, providing a clever and inventive blood soaked horror for us. The FX are top notch and the performances from his cast, especially leading heroine Kristen Connolly, are good and help make the scenario work. The script provides plenty of scares and gore but, also gives us some tension-relieving laughs with Whedon's trademark sly humor. Everything is blended together well by director Goddard, who gets us primed and ready for the 'all hell breaks loose' final act. A real horror movie blast!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no words to express how amazing this movie was. What one would assume would be a typical horror cliché is actually treated to one of the most creative movies I've ever seen. Although most people could expect what the movie contained from the previews, as I did, they will still be blow away by this movie. Not from the acting or directing or anything like that, but from the pure originality of the movie. The last horror movie I remember seeing that was this original, inventive, and down right badass was Scream, and with a equally satisfying deliverance of it's gritty, gory, grisly, and tongue in cheek attitude. Anyone who goes to see this movie will surely get their money's worth and then some.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen. The jumpscares were so obvious and does not really classify as a horror movie to me. Everything in this movie was predictable and had absolutely no originality. I was pretty much bored throughout the whole entire movie. Nothing actually made sense. Where some characters should have died they didn't and when some of them should be OK they instantly died. It just seemed like they were trying to make fun of another movie. Also the they should have named the movie something else. This movie was a waste of my time and I'm so glad I didn't spend money to watch this in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When five college friends (Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams) arrive at a remote forest cabin for a little vacation, little do they expect the horrors that await them. One by one, the youths fall victim to backwoods zombies, but there is another factor at play. Two scientists (Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford) are manipulating the ghoulish goings-on, but even as the body count rises, there is yet more at work than meets the eye.Um......just wow. The acting is kind of cheesy, but those elevators doe. This movie completely did a 180 and shocked me. Even if you think you know what's gonna happen.....you still aren't even close. This movie is so unconventional and I absolutely love it for this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was not perfect but really? This was a good movie, engaging and interesting! I always read reviews while I watch movies, because I'm not scared of spoilers, I actually kind of welcome them because if there is something in the movie that I will not enjoy, spoilers usually point that out.Anyway! I thought the acting was good! What is everyone saying? I didn't think it was cliché at all. I also thought the plot was crazy original to be a spoof kind of thing. Sure we have seen some aspects of this movie before but they did a great job making it feel new to me. I have been on a horror movie binge over the last few years because I used to be too scared to watch and even with 2 or 3 years of horror in my head I still found this creative and well done.Spoiler alert!! My favorite part was when Marty came back! He was awesome!! Good for all the Marty's in the horror genre. I love how some of the roles were challenged and I died laughing when the jock ran into that invisible wall. lol. Great stuff. I also missed this bird thing someone mentioned, which apparently ruined the motorcycle stunt for them... so I came out on top! The only thing I didn't like was how short it was. There could have definitely been a little more back story for the plot. I didn't need more info about the characters but just the idea of the sacrifices, why they choose to do it that way instead of just kidnap and do a ritual, why did it have to be a big show, why did the kids have to pick how they died, was all of that important or valid to the sacrifice? Even if it wasn't valid, I'd like to know why they were doing it that way. 10 or 15 extra minutes of control room talk would have helped get those points across. Either way, I don't know what people were expecting but this movie was very satisfying. I watched it on TV so I'd like to watch it again, straight through with no commercial interruptions so I can get a real feel for it... and I missed the very beginning with the creepy gas station guy... So, more to explore!I would recommend it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of five friends going to a remote cabin for a holiday. Little do they know that there is something very sinister going on in the cabin, and soon they find themselves fighting for their dear lives."The Cabin in the Woods" looks a bit like a low budget film because of the harsh lighting and the way visuals are presented. However, it has Chris Hemsworth and Richard Jenkins in it, so it can't be a low budget film. Sigourney Weaver appears right in the end too, which is quite a pleasant surprise for me! As for the story, it is interesting and entertaining. The gory horror scenes are so over the top that they are comedic at times. It is a bit wrong to chuckle at these scenes but I cannot help it. Overall, the film is certainly different from other horror films, and is quite entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the life of me I have no idea why so many people liked this movie. This movie is just stupid, plain stupid, very stupid and even more stupid. Watched this movie because of decent rating on IMDb and was shocked! Now to describe the movie, first part of movie is the typical Friday the 13 type where good looking teens or college students spend their holiday in secluded godforsaken lakeside location that does not seem hospitable what so ever or a place where anyone will go to spend their holidays. Then death, gore and mayhem starts, right after some nudity to keep the audience interested??..Second part of the movie (with a hint of it in the first part) seems like something from Condemned where people are watching those people kill each other, in this case the kids at the lake side location. Its also kind of like that crappy TV show Ascension. Meanwhile those kids are terrified and running away from all the pointless killing.Third part of the movie (which is basically coming to an end) is combination of all the bad guys from Buffy the vampire slayer, Angel and some other horror flicks wreaking havoc on (yes you guessed it) the people who were watching the kids get killed. The movie is very predictable except for the reason they unleashed all that torment and misery on those kids which I guess was something new. I have to admit I did like the idea of why they were getting those kids killed that is the concept but still it was such a stupid movie. Could have made it so much better so it is quite unfortunate that the movie was so stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of horror movies other than the classics. I went to go see this movie with my film class for a field trip. I was curious because my professor was not one to recommend okay movies and I didn't hear much about this film prior to seeing it. I went in with no knowledge of what I was going to view. And I was pleasantly surprised. I had a great time and thought it was a great concept that was excellently executed. It played on a lot of the classic horror films but made its own statement. It turned the movie on its head reminiscent of how Scream had its character discussing horror films and situations in its movie. Cabin in the Woods is about five college friends who take a vacation at a remote cabin in the woods. What they discover is the events that unfold are the making of someone setting them up for a trap. You see both sides of the coin and it makes for a very entertaining watch. While the movie is a horror film there are plenty of laughs throughout. Even though you are aware of everything going on you still feel for the character's plight. This movie is a very intelligent film that wouldn't appear so on the surface. It is a great movie to watch with your friends. You will definitely be thinking and talking about it after it's done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having to watch this movie for a project I'm working on, I was curious about the reviews, love it or hate it. Or sorta like it and kinda don't mind it.It was disappointing to me, sorry for the rabid fans, I liked the setup and was curious about the two levels, one with the group that went to the classic cabin in the hills, etc. and what the reality is. I have to say it let me down, and if you rabids want to see a really good "science goes wild", watch Westworld, which has a smarter setup and payoff, similar to what they do here. In a way, the spoiler is very much a spoiler even when you see what's really going on. And then the finale with the you-know-who cameo is a cheap shot, really.All in all, it's a collection of all the past horror movies since Halloween,which changed it all way back and which stands miles above this movie with it's zombies, creatures, basements, etc. Simply put it's a collection of clichés all spun together and to me, a disappointing end. It could have been a lot better if the creators were a little bit older.What I really didn't like is the ending, there was obviously no real ending after using all the clichés so when you're stuck without an ending, use something that doesn't have anything to do with the original characters.It did $70 million plus $12 million in other venues so it did okay. But I just wished they came up with some real ideas than just tired old clichés that didn't really work all that well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came in expecting to see a horror movie, but it turned out pretty quickly that that's not what this movie is at all.The whole premise of the kids being watched and killed off for entertainment was interesting and mildly funny, but somewhere along the way, it just turned to a big dump. Imo, it doesn't work as a satire, it's not subtle or smart, even though it tries hard to be. As a comedy, it doesn't really work either, because it's simply not funny.What irks me the most about this movie is the way everything is spoon-fed to you. All attempts at satire are practically shoved in your face. "Look at this! So ironic!" The worst part was the ending, had things gone differently after they broke into the control room, it might've been salvageable.Everything was just really half-done and kind of shitty, despite some good ideas. Disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin In The Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>39 years ago, the slasher genre was born with a Canadian film by the name of Black Christmas. What would follow would be a wave of slasher films such as A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, Friday The 13th and Child's Play. Most of these movies had an onslaught of sequels and you began to see clichés over and over and over. Then a slasher movie satire was made with Scream and Scary Movie. This movie was supposed to be an addition to the satire's by attacking every horror movie cliché in the book for a modern audience. Is it good? Lets see.The plot starts off pretty basic for one of these things; A group of teenagers go up to this deserted cabin in the woods, they awaken something (reminiscent of The Evil Dead) and they start killing them off one by one. We are also shown that this is supposed to be a ritual for some Ancient God that needs sacrifices to be restrained or the world ends because every other country has one of these Gods and all others have outsmarted the creatures sent.Okay I'll start off with the things I liked. The acting is actually pretty good from all players however nothing that really stuck with me. The CGI is also fit into this description and in terms of slasher films, this would be one of the better ones. The horror aspect of these killers is quite well done in spite of them just being cut outs from The Evil Dead and the humor in this film is actually pretty funny on its own. So what made it bad? The villains (the people who are "the puppet masters"). I'm sorry but these villains need to be talked about in great detail.First of all, every country has one of these things? Every country has a group of people die and people either don't notice that this goes on. Next, the climax of the film contains a button that unleashes all the monsters they have on standby pressed by the heroes, why would that be so easily accessible if that happened. Thirdly, who the hell finances this? Who the hell would look at this act of killing innocents and say "okay, thats justified."? Fourthly, they consistently use these toxins to implant suggestions and the one guy who avoids it is a stoner, how do those toxins work and why is weed the only way to avoid them? Fifthly one part of the climax includes 3 of the people that pull the strings dying and one shows empathy when they just did the same thing to 4 other people. Really? Sixthly why do these powerful Gods want these sacrifices specifically to happen in generic horror movie order (because they literally explain it like this).Overall this movie is a mixed bag. While its not the worst I've seen from Joss Whedon, it still has the flaws of the villains which are literally all thats wrong with the film warped into one easy statement. Its because of them that this film doesn't get say a 6 or a 7 from me. It passes off as semi decent on its own but still with huge problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin the 13th</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignoring the obligatory hick at a gas station that they are in danger, a group of supremely stereotypical college aged people go on a road trip to a relative's cabin in the woods, unaware that they are being monitored by, and in fact, almost guided by, a vary vague, nebulous organisation located in underground facilities somewhere. As they read from some Necronomicon-like book, they resurrect the dead nearby, who then proceed to wreak bloody havoc, much to the delight of this unnamed underground organisation watching them, and several others like them all across the world.Is the film a joke about reality television? It is alleged that this organisation rigs things like this to happen every year, in various countries across the world, to appease the "gods," and by that I mean us, the audiences who watch these horrors. If these so-called "sacrifices" are not made every year, the gods are angry, which would cause the world to end. Which indeed, weirdly, does happen in the final seconds, as the gods return to earth to ..... kill everyone? Then what? I cannot give this film a rating, because I cannot decide if I liked it or not. It is either a brilliant satire of horror movie clichés and the audiences who watch clichéd horror movies, or two disparate ideas duct-taped together into one of the strangest films ever made. Either way, it is certainly memorable, but I can't imagine that it would work well on DVD. This is one of those times when this must be seen in a cinema to get the full effect. I actually thought I had walked into the wrong cinema, when the film began with a pair of what appeared to be Homer Simpson-like workers walking through a plant. When the title appeared, in a rather inane font, at least I was certain I was in the correct theatre, but I was still a bit puzzled by it. And I still am.</fullReview>

It's impossible to like a film that has such a bad script with hollow unlikeable characters. The plot starts to stink from the very beginning when everything is told straight away. There's hardly any surprises for the viewer as all is given away too early. Everything goes as expected and it gets quite boring.The movie's also very unstylish that i have to question the vision of the creators. What might have crossed their minds or were they just making a fusion of Evil dead and The truman show and calling that original. Little bit of this and little bit of that movie here and there just seems to make a film these days.This movie put me off watching new movies for awhile.

		<fullReview>"The Cabin in the Woods" is not clever enough to be satire and not scary enough to be a horror film. I think that, to make this a properly satirical movie, it should have been presented as a normal horror movie until stoner boy discovers the camera. The opening scene with Richard Jenkins can say there, but all the inter-cutting between the cabin and HQ removes what little tension the movie has. The way it's currently presented, you know how it's going to end, or at least I did. Now don't get me wrong, it's pretty original, but that doesn't mean it's a masterpiece. It's a joke. Richard Jenkins and co. were the only worthwhile part of the movie. (Seeing people, whose job is to kill others, make the most of their duties was very reminiscent of "The Hunger Games".) But I will say that at least they tried to have some funny parts. My favorite was the death of Chris Hemsworth, obviously. But yeah, hugely overrated movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Been a horror fan for a few decades and have a sense of humor? SEE IT!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start? This is one of the most excellent flicks I've seen in a while. It kind of rub shoulders with the dark humor of Braindamage but with somewhat more elegance. The whole movie is packed with clichés but not to the brink of goofiness. Referenses can be found to an array of horror movies; the very concept of what lies behind all is more or less based on it (no I won't explain it any further). A horror fan since Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday and Hellraiser series, I am delighted over the homage, and sometimes parody, over old horror films. Now don't get me wrong. It's NOT Scary movie. The cabin in the woods IS an excellent horror feature in its own right. As you probably have guessed it starts of in a typical fashion with a team of teens going to a desolate cabin in the woods were the only civilization is a A- class redneck; only the banjo is missing. Before late evil things starts to happen and the youngsters find them self fighting for their life. At this point however the story takes a completely new turn and it's hard to say more without revealing too much. Suffice it to say the rest of the story is anything but common and the finale is quite something special. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just throw away all the action leading up to the movie's true focus, the last act. In general, the movie until the end part is either boring and repetitive formula for some while others may find that same formula satisfying to the umpteenth time. It's completely unoriginal if not for the twist, which could've been more effective if shrouded until the end, but the makers of this art decided to construe a sitcom to compliment the horror side of the film. I refer to the scenes where the antagonists who ran the operation impersonate contemporary sitcom. So it's purposely campy but loses its integrity as a horror movie because of that.The plot twist, namely the last act, is the movie's identity. It makes or breaks the film and apparently, success came because of it. The movie performed well at the box office and a lot of the public seemed to approve. I found the last act to be mildly entertaining solely because of all the monster appearances and the carnage that came with them. However, it is a total rush job so little effort of generating scares or thrills comes forth. Other than that, the whole plot conclusion may work on an entertainment level but fails to do so on a cerebral one. The film severely lacks cinematic ingenuity, narration depth, and likable characters. Unless you can enjoy a movie solely on genre and concept, this one is just too silly to deserve any serious praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how does it movie have 7/10 rating. And the other reviews which i read..how can people like this and give it a 10??Story Well i decided to watch this movie by seeing its rating and genre Horror, Mystery ,thriller and expected it to be something like Disturbia. Instead is nothing good in it no logic involved whatsoever.The story is a mixture of Drag me to hell , I spit on you grave , See no evil , Final Destination and Zombieland and Saw.If you have already scene any of these movie you can get an easy idea. Different aspects for each movies have been combined to make The Cabin in the Wood there is no originality and has a lame star cast.You can only watch this movie when you keep you brains aside,and just watch it for the sake of entertainment.My recommendation Save you time skip this movie too many movies of the same type have been made before and I'm sure you must have seen plenty of them, its just that the rating is somehow good which might compel you to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The special effects and blood were good in this movie. The makeup was impressive and the scenery was great... at the cabin. As for the rest of the film...Boring and lame delivery of Pop language. If you like people speaking pop while not showing emotion, you'll like this movie. The better actors are wasted as we have to watch them watch a bunch of lame millennials speak whedon. The camera work was decisive, but it didn't matter. The end's cluster 'F' was lame. The message was, humanity sucks, let's die.To be honest, you can get a better laugh from movies like Dead Alive, Army of Darkness, Shaun of the Dead, The Hills Run Red (that one wasn't good BTW), Bad Taste, and Scream. This movie didn't have the actors to make the film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start with the obvious--as anyone can tell from the commercials, there is a cabin in the woods, some teens go there, stuff happens, but it seems that there are people controlling what sort of stuff happens. And that part is good--it is an original twist. But from there, the much awaited premier was a poorly acted, poorly lit festival of boredom and clichés. I hoped that towards the end, something might change, and it did--there was an interesting twist for close to 15 seconds before it, too, became boring and predictable. Don't waste your time with this one. And I say this as a big fan of Joss Whedon's other work. But if I had been in the theater with him while watching this, I would have taken my DVD of Firefly and beat him to death with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh, man...this was bad. I'm not even sure why I gave it a 2 - that was generous! I know horror movies can tend to be lame. But some can be good (the "Paranormal Activity" series, The Exorcist, The Rite). But this one was just awful. I saw it only as a slam to the "corporate world" - such a typical view from Hollywood. But come on, a bunch of guys in white shirts and black ties killing people for - what? - That is never really made clear other than a bunch of other "corporations" worldwide "compete" for some unknown prize. While celebrating deaths etc with "office pools", etc. I don't know. Didn't make it to the end of this one. All I saw in this movie was the political message and it ticked me off. I don't want politics either left or right when I watch a movie. I just want to be entertained. And the only scary part in this movie - I agree with another reviewer - was the creepy guy at the gas station. Pass on this one folks, even if you are an anarchist. It's still bad LOL!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i get it, but it still doesn't mean it's a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>so here goes...i get it! the concept, the whole story within the story, the horror movie clichés, the play and pretty much minor parody of 80's horror/slasher movies (most notably Friday the 13th). that being what it was i was perfectly fine with it. the jokes with mordecai being on speaker phone, the pothead referencing that the jock has never been the alpha male, that was good and funny. now with that being said the ending was a total miss. the movie is going in the right direction, even with the workers working the cabin and the whole "monsters" angle. after that the end veers off into a whole different direction, very unnecessary. i mean OK, basic horror flick pays homage to the 80's slasher film and other films and then WHAM!! the random sacrifice and appease the gods angle. it just doesn't fit, it doesn't work...if it was a test on human adaption and survival amid disastrous and traumatizing consequences and situations, i would have bought that more than i bought this. that's what made cube work. granted, this isn't cube and if the writers went that angle there would still be haters. hey! they bit off cube!! either way that would have been a 10 times better film and STILL different in it's own right for the BETTER. not different for the WORSE like this ending concept that seemed thrown together and without any real meaning or purpose. the writer's had a good thing going and threw it out the window. it's OK though, i'm used to it in 21st century cinema.</fullReview>

Me personally, I would prefer washing two days worth of dishes than wasting 90mins of my time on this. Why did i even rate it a 6 I asked myself...... EFFORT......Although an unsuccessful effort. This is the type of movie you naively carry your girlfriend to watch and afterwards feel totally embarrassed by your poor choice in movies. In fact, when i first watched this i fell asleep...leaving my girlfriend to bear the horror. I bet she would like to suck my toes rather than watch this again. So i awoke to my girlfriend's terrible reviews. I Watched it again so that i could give it a fair chance and came to one conclusion. "Only a complete nincompoop or someone who is being paid will rate this a 7 or above." I felt guilty even rating this a 6.</fullReview>

Cause it's not scary at all.It's a pity because the beginning of the movie makes you feel that it is a smart combination of sci-fi &amp; horror movie. But once after that it makes no sense.

This movie will make you think, they said. No. Absolutely none of the above. In all, there are several hilarious scenes in this movie simply because of the awful makeup, CGI, or unbelievable nature of the plot. There are a few times where you'll loudly remark "Oh, come on! There isn't even that much blood in the human body!" You'll know what I mean IF you watch this film, and I don't recommend that at all.

And the movie seems that way, that is until right when its about to actually get scary, the movie is interrupted with a cheesy subplot that destroys everything scary about it. If the ending is ignored this could be an actually great scary movie to watch with your friends, but all of that is thrown away with a downward slide of corny, cheesy stupidly planned garbage that fails to horrify anyone. The end of this movie is so frustratingly corny the whole movie is thrown away and you find yourself sitting on the couch thinking: Well that was a wast of my time. If you enjoy corny movies featuring the monsters of your childhood nightmares, then this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't left any comment here for a while but I was so irritated by a very high IMDb rate for this movie that I had to leave my own mark. First of all, the the movie genre is like searching itself through the whole movie. The director wasn't sure is he going to make a horror, thriller, SF or comedy so it looks like he is experimenting with the genre through the movie phases never achieving one whole. Then, the idea of a horror in a controlled environment is kind of eliminating the horror atmosphere and it is very poorly executed. Also, I found the acting of the five pretty pale. Worst thing from my point of view in this movie is that all this is connected into the very boring melting pot where no real plot and no movie dynamics leads you until the end of the movie which I couldn't wait to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This episode of seemingly a live Scooby-Doo ripoff adventure is a little better than it first may appear. Probably because the story isn't burdened with the whole soap-opera sub-plot. Also, it sticks to the approach of the original cartoon series as well: Team finds monsters, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, team seeks clues, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, Velma discovers the solution, trap set up for monsters, monsters chase Scooby and gang, get caught in trap, true identity of monsters unmasked.The story rolls right along, with a pretty decent conclusion (if this were a kid's movie.)

		<shortDescription>So much potential...wasted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will preface with the statement that I am not a Whedon fanboy nor am I heavy into the sci-fi/fantasy genres that he tends to delve into regularly. That being said I LOVE a good sci-fi or fantasy film. Some things Whedon has done I like others, such as Buffy are horrid. Buffy was the Twilight of its day. This film had a lot of buzz for quite some time. The trailer was promising. Everything I heard was that it was going to be an awesome trip. Sadly I dragged my wife along, putting stock in the, usually right, metacritic rating of 73. Apparently the critics have drank the kool aid just like the fanboys. This movie was borderline awful. There are several key elements that hurt it for me. First of all it thinks it's winking throughout the film to the audience and being coy and tongue and cheek. I found this to come off as generally just dumb and unoriginal. A film that does that ten times better is Tucker and Dale vs. Evil. That was a much better horror film with it's bag of parody and humor added in. Aside from some of the humor not working, some of it did, some of it just felt ill timed. I found the humor to be more appropriate in the settings with the control guys overlooking things and the office pool and all of that set against the backdrop of horror. That was some nice levity. Plus, who doesn't love Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford?Failed attempts at humor aside I just didn't feel like it really pulled off any of it's unique elements well. It had this great idea. Take the horror movie, turn it on it's head. You have this company who controls things. This with another twist of they all do this in fear so they can please some ancient beings. All rather original concepts and all framed in an interesting way. Yet the cohesion between these elements felt not only somewhat forced at times but would completely go off the rails at points. Once the purge button was hit I felt like it had metaphorically purged what hope I had left for the film. It's too bad such an opportunity was squandered. What I would have changed is have a lot less build up of the -wink, wink- horror clichés. And once the two get in the "building" or whatever, that should have been where it got really good. For a few moments it did. I liked the part where they saw the various creatures and then it zooms out. Loved it. Then they should've had to figure out how to get out of the labyrinth with the Staples "That was easy." button right in front of them. That could have been much more interesting and a better way to keep things thrilling. There would have been plenty of time to do so if the tongue and cheek beginning had been cut down. And lastly I'm glad they let the ancient beings out. But it should've ended with some The Fog-esque idea where it zooms out and shows these beings coming out and overtaking the world. A nice few minute prologue showing the overcoming of the Earth. But like I said, this opportunity was squandered. Too bad...too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of people are saying that it isn't original, but it hasn't been done before. And I'm not a Joss Whedon fanboy, so that's not why I like it. But the real reason I'm writing this is because of the other reviewers. I read so many that said the good reviews were written by the writer/director, and people that love everything Whedon puts his name on. To me, people that write things like that wouldn't know a decent movie if it bit them in the rear. Just because people don't agree with you doesn't mean they're being paid to say the things they do. And if you're disappointed by the reviews posted on IMDb by users, you deserve to be so. There are so many different people on this planet, you can't trust what the majority says. Get over it. In closing, if you want to watch an interesting film like none you've ever seen, watch this one. Or, if you want to listen to the nay-sayers, I feel bad for you that you won't take a risk because some strangers told you not to.</fullReview>

Watching this movie made me feel like watching a Bollywood movie, where everything feels right till the first half. Bollywood movies are expert at screwing the second half of any movie, this movie was one step ahead of that.The first half of this movie has everything that a Young audience demands: funny college students going out for a vacation at a secluded cabin in a forest with an awesome lake by side. There's one dopy dude who's character is awesome, dumb and funny. The movie does produce some horror and suspense, but what really turns you off is the whole plot, which you will realize at the end is a really really crappy one.My suggestion: Not worth watching this in your dreams either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been an avid horror fan since the late 70's. This is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. Cabin in the Woods is only a compilation of many horror films jumbled into one with subtle changes that only someone unfamiliar with horror films can not detect. This movie was all over the place and utterly ridiculous. I tend to wonder if the laughter in the theater was because people actually thought the lines were funny or they thought they were so stupid and should not have been added. I found no humor at all, no thrill but I did find I wasted my money hoping someone could produce something that might actually scare me. Think of every horror movie you have seen, mix it up and you have this movie. It is time for a little more originality and much less grabbing for previous movie straws and sucking on them as if they are your own. I give it two stars since I didn't walk out of the theater as I was hoping it would get better.</fullReview>

Bad acting, cheesy story, JUST PLAIN FAKE and that's the facts!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know how it can have a 8.0 rating??The film is to predictable. The start of the film was bad. While I was watching the film, I was trying to figure out the story. It had no story until the end of the it, then made zero sense. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen; when something was happening. The killing scenes didn't even seem like they were killing scenes.Lets talk about the killing scenes. When you are stabbed in the back, you are not going to get up like nothing has happened. There is a fat chance you will even get up. It just didn't seem like a film that was put together correctly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This got such uniform good reviews, I knew I had to see it fast, before the buzz turned it into an over-hyped beast. No such luck. It IS an over-hyped beast. I should have known better. All the reviews I skimmed suggested a boffo trick ending or reveal... and I hate those movies. The script is not clever. If I had walked out as I was inclined in the middle of the tiresome set-up, I'd have missed nothing.The plot of this stinker involves slowly disclosing several nested narrative devices, and invokes higher and higher scales of society, until you know the ending will just HAVE to be the piece of full-scale idiocy that they came up with. But the writers offer not not a peep of explanation for why the sacrifice has to take the form of a clichéd, glacially slow, horror movie; which makes the movie convoluted, and the entire premise quite costly. Couldn't you just kill the 5 types in their homes, or better still in a way that introduce a new type of horror movie? But no, the writers paint themselves into a corner, thinking (as TV talent does) that sensation is even better than thought, and will save this overextended premise in the end. There has never been a movie that builds to a CGI monster that is worth a damn. The movie got some kudos for its references to previous movies (The Shining, Alien 3, The Ring), but it's also so dumb it just lazily rips most of them off: The Truman Show, And then there were None, Army of Darkness, Halloween 3, Cube, 13 ghosts, Rosemary's Baby, Hellraiser, etc. No matter how you mash 20 old movies together, it will not produce "new.The movie poster (a house exterior turned into a rubik's cube) rips off the poster for Deathtrap; another bit of drivel - with a terrible, terrible twist ending - that received scads of undeserved rave reviews. If you've exhausted yourself today sitting at home watching vapid TV, and you need a break, Cabin in the Woods will take your tired thoughtless mind even dumber places. But there is zero purpose in seeing it. This movie will be forgotten in 5 years (see also: Identity).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was totally surprised by this movie even though I had watched some of the promos. In a way, this is not a typical Josh film and yet in a way it is - a simple film portraying a simple story.five friends arrive at a secluded cabin with clear instructions for their anticipated mountain getaway. But when the rigid rules are broken, punishment is swift -- and everyone will pay. Kristen Connolly, Jesse Williams, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Chris Hemsworth and Brian J. White star with Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford in this surprising spin on a classic horror setup.This movie, to an extent, has the echoes of "Baghban" where family drama is concerned and is a good comedy where the friendship between the teen cast, as well as the guys behind the scenes are concerned. Besides the director, Drew Godard, roping in two of the most popular Hollywood stars, in his directorial debut, what is really interesting the family drama angle of the story - its not just for children as some have suggested or as some think, its also for adults.The music is quite melodious and worth listening.Conclusion: This is one movie that is worth while watching with family, including children. But if a violent drama does make you blanch, then I suggest you take some reading materials with you and wait in the lobby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the ratings for this film... this film is a waste...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a joke. I think it's too far fetched on a number of levels. The CGI is good, as are the characters who form the horror element, however, they would have been better utilised with another script.You are left hanging, pondering.... thinking... how could that; was is occurring by those who sanction it - be so acceptable? (you'll know what I mean when you see the film)..And by the end of the film, the storyline comes together - and I think the reason this film has been rated so highly is due to the element of originality given to any revelations/explanations offered to tie it all together. That's all well and good, but really, I think the system devised to deliver the goods in the film was too complicated for mankind to realise, manage or control on any level whatsoever and what was delivered was so under par considering the script that you'r e left thinking... man, with the what was available (especially in the lifts) could have been so much better utilised!Additionally: *I didn't get the feeling that I was gripped by this film. *I felt no connection with the characters. *You didn't really have to think too much. You just sat there and consumed information... ..and before you knew it, there was 10 minutes of absolute madness! (which was somewhat satisfying!) and then it was over with more a puff, than a bang!I just left the cinema a bit miffed by it all for the reasons:a) Was it really deserving of these high ratings? (I think not) b) Just because the idea has not been used before in any other film that I know of, doesn't mean, it's a great idea and this film is amazing. Different != wonderful. c) Such a let down with characters shown but not utilised.Try again Lionsgate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I saw the ad for this movie on TV, and got all excited I also saw that it's rated 7.9 here!!! and thought yes 100% this is gonna be off the hook. Took my whole family to see it, thinking oh yeah I've got something real good lined up for you...REALITY...The movie is an absolute joke, people get stabbed in the back with hooks and knives n stuff and literally feel no pain (NORMAL PEOPLE) not to mention there are zombies in the movie: when I saw the zombies for the first time I thought OMG what have I done... But I let that slip thinking OK this is gonna get better...I didn't jump or get scared or get that scared feeling NOT ONCE! no fear factor whatsoever. The only part I thought was interesting in the slightest is the ending idea which was probably the last 10 minutes of it...No engaging storyline, it also fools you; a black guy in the movie is a little concerned about the kids in the cabin talking about free will etc, which kinda makes you think oh he may be a good guy...wrong - turned out he was useless and just there to fill a gap that wasn't there in the first place - if you know what i mean ;) My whole family thought I was a retarded to take them to this movie...I'm not even joking, they thought I was the dumbest guy ever, they literally hated me for it, because it's pretty much my fault they sat there for what...2 hours looking at ****. What gets me is, how on earth people in this world gave this movie a 7.9 I will never understand, are you all that thick and messed up? Cabin Fever is better than this ******* piece of **** movie and Cabin Fever weren't that good (I gave it a 6/10) TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS - THIS MOVIE IS FOR PEOPLE THAT FIND "THE KINGS SPEECH" AMAZING.

		<fullReview>Since I saw the first preview I had been anticipating this movie. The idea of mixing a traditional horror concept with a modern scifi was just intriguing beyond belief.My girlfriend and I went to see this movie and were just dumbfounded by how disappointing it was. The acting was beyond bad, the story was somewhat original but poorly portrayed, and there is a degree of drug use in it that is simply unacceptable.Now there is drug use in a majority of modern movies, but rarely is it portrayed as being an okay thing to do. In this movie, it is not only okay, it is actually portrayed as helpful! Ultimately this movie was nothing more than a few ideas strung together by bad acting, poor plot choices, and a lot of drug use without any real purpose or message.Strongly advice anyone who values their morals to stay away from this movie, it is closer to a pot-heads comedy than a horror film by leaps and bounds.</fullReview>

But Josh Wheadon has ensured that, that shall not come to pass. A movie that starts with a promising premise and treatment, but ends with such a farce that it gladdened my heart. I can now rest assured that I'm not missing anything of value next time I skip an American movie.The director could have done a better job.

		<fullReview>A Joss Whedon co-script credit state-of-the-genre teen horror/comedy, with just a hint of conspiracy theory, delivers on the laughs and a few thrills, but not the chills ? unless you're of such a nervous disposition that you shouldn't be watching horror in the first place. A very acceptable alternative to the occasional pretension and over seriousness of even such self-conscious ventures as Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity and Insidious. The title gives the game away ? this is horror as cliché, parodying itself, but thankfully at a much higher than Not-Just-Another-Teen-Movie level, scaling the same heights of postmodern genre-bending meta-horror as Scream and Jason X, in this case, a pleasant buzz and head-high blend of The Truman show, Bruce Campbell ... and Scooby Doo.***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** Keeping Earth's ancient evil giant gods happy has gone super hi-tech (with modern high priests not unlike movie moguls and control-freak directors using the stock-in-trade devices of the horror genre as its tools, including in this case the ghosts, ghouls and monsters ). It's a secret global industry, with rules/rituals not dissimilar to the postmodern horror guideline laid down in Scream, the number of victims, the order in which they die, the role of the virgin, etc., etc.. The gods are getting angry and they must be appeased. Various appeasement projects around the world fail and it's up to the US to save the day (which for some reason I'm sure intentionally reminded me of the Fox network's view of the global economic crisis). For a moment it looks as if they've pulled it off, but they suddenly realise in the middle of something like a wrap-party that it's going wrong and they are in serious trouble... the "sacrifice" industry appears to have become too tech-sophisticated for its own good, and finally appears to have succumbed to that scariest of all scenarios, human error. No wonder the hi-tech priests talk about simpler times when all they had to do was throw virgin's into volcanoes...At this point we are in a strange dilemma, do we want the "bad" guys to win and safeguard humanity, or do we want the dumb youngsters (so dumb they almost make dumb-as-they-come inbred redneck zombies look clever) to survive and secure the horrific destruction of mankind?All this happens in the first half of the film, and while the execution of the idea is interesting and entertaining, the telescoping of the normal 90 or 120 min horror narrative into this much shorter time, coupled with the fact that every clichéd move is intentionally telegraphed, tends to rob it of any jump-out-of-your-seat moments that were potentially there. But that's hardly what the movie is about, and in the second half it really comes into its own in a roller-coaster of subtle, not-so-subtle and over-the-head-with-a-baseball-bat referencing of too many genre favourites to mention. After I've watched it a few times more for the laughs, I might watch it once more to see just how many I can identify, they come too fast and furious to get in just one or two sittings, but if you don't get at least a dozen the first time, you are something of a tourist in this territory.OK, so there are as many plot holes as there are clichés and if you don't buy into it or want something genuinely frightening (why?) it will come across as horror 101. But with some friends, some beer and pizza, it's hard to go wrong with this.</fullReview>

I thought it was just going to be about a murderer in a cabin or something like that. The characters were your stereotypical horror movie characters with no depth and nothing likable about them. The pothead guy was kinda funny just because he kept reminding me of Shaggy from Scooby Doo. I am completely shocked that everyone loves this movie. When the zombies came out I was like OK this is getting really stupid now. And at the end, what was with that giant hand coming out? I don't really like the whole idea of gods or whatever, it just seemed really cheesy and unrealistic. I kind of like the concept how people control the environment that the teens are in, but I don't really get why they wanted those two teens to have sex. Was this all on a TV show or something or just something for the control people to watch? I don't really get why they showed those Japanese girls in the classroom either. I just found the whole movie to be really stupid. And then who was the girl at the very end? I know sigourney weaver was the actress and the director but I don't really get who she was in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One for the horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has literally been years since the horror genre had something nice to offer, with crap security camera footage "films" dominating the landscape (crap like PARANORMAL ACTIVITY) after the demise of the once mighty torture porn (SAW and the rest). Just when horror fans like me began to lose hope, along comes THE CABIN IN THE WOODS which plays as both a tribute and a subtle parody of the horror genre.The basic plot is basically a copy-paste version of EVIL DEAD; some teens go to a cabin in the woods to party and then cue the ancient unspeakable horror. If you think that's bland, remember that the trailers made it obvious that there was something more to this bare bones plot and by god, there IS a lot more than just a bunch of teens getting high and drunk in some run down shack. If you haven't seen the trailers prior to the film, well let's just say you're in for a lot of twists and turns. To say anymore about this could end up spoiling more than one detail so I'll just say that the plot is a lot smarter than you could expect.While it does pay tribute and homage to an old, tried and tested genre, the movie doesn't fail to be both funny and horrifying. It does more than just play out the genre conventions straight. The script is dotted with moments of random dark humor that work in the story's context. The dialogue points out some flaws and stereotypes of the genre but it never does it in an "In your FACE!!" way similar to say, SCREAM (not to say it's bad); it's really subtle so if you know the conventions, you'll get the jokes. The characters may act in their stereotypical ways but for once this is actually justified. Every little bit of the genre that made it more of a joke as the decades went by is given justification and it works.The horror is old school; kill shots, decapitations, nightmarish creatures, etc... none of that kill shot cutting seen a lot in PG-13 garbage or the shaky camera crap seen way too many times. This is a HORROR movie so people die on screen, not off screen like today's "horror" which are too scared to show even a drop of blood. Visually it may not be the most impressive collection of on-screen kills ever imagined but in a time when almost everything is being marketed to children, this is more than a refresher.THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is really for the horror fans; it's for people who've grown up with the likes of Freddy Kruger and have grown weary of today's "horror." It's not only a fright-fest, it's a lot smarter than one could expect and it works. If you're new to the genre or you don't really like it, you'll either get it or not. Otherwise if you like horror movies with some sort of passion, you'll like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabin in the woods is a master piece taking the horror tropes and turning them on there heads.Taking all the monsters from past and present genres they are dumped into a battleground feel within the woods. Its not easy to pull this off, like Freddy and Jason proved, but each got scare time and never once made it feel over the top.Joss Whedon can take the stereotype of a jock, a princess, virgin, lower and pot head and give them layers you or I have. They really seem like teenagers you would find on a college campus.The plot never once felt lacking or needed improvement and there isn't a chance for a sequel to squander the magic of the first.One thing I can appreciate about horror is if the comedy works with the scares and it pulls it off in strides. The dark humor is sprinkled in the dialogue and situations in unique places you wouldn't expect to find it. The ending was truly brilliant and can't be topped. 10 for 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slasher flick with a creative twist and over-the-top climax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2012 and directed by Drew Goddard, "The Cabin in the Woods" is a slasher flick with satirical elements about five youths who take a getaway to a, you guessed it, cabin in the woods. Everything's not as it appears, however, and total havoc ensues.Right off the bat, the movie gives away the fact that something is going on behind the scenes with the cabin, as if the kids are being set-up for some diabolical purpose. I liked the cast and the movie was decent, but I was a little turned-off by the set-up angle, which I'll leave for you to discover. I just prefer more straight-forward storytelling. But the ridiculously over-the-top climax won my respect because there's no way I would've predicted what was really going on and the motive thereof. So the movie gets points for creativity.While "Cabin in the Woods" is somewhat satirical, it's not a horror comedy. It comes across as one of the Friday the 13th sequels with some Scooby-Doo elements thrown in. Chris Hemsworth plays the alpha male, Anna Hutchison the (too thin) blond hottie, Jesse Williams the studious dude, Fran Kranz the burnout and Kristen Connolly the virginal main protagonist (the true hottie). Amy Acker and Sigourney Weaver have peripheral roles. The filmmakers should've taken advantage of Amy's magnificent presence, but they failed. The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in British Columbia.GRADE: B</fullReview>

Yet I admit it started out good with the challenge to create something new based on that stale horror flick canvas. The gently spoofy start with a scientific background bent was promising but I realise now that the dual storyline is just a routine screen writing device to stretch a flimsy concept in order to fill up a season or the 90-min feature length.With all the back and forth between the two story lines you lose the tension and there remains only, on the surface, the curiosity about what it is all about. The climax is a Grand Carnival and it develops over the last third of the movie so either you'll feel that the main storyline is straight and efficient before switching to another movie or you will feel cheated of a real movie with substance while you get a bagful of popular horror culture, clichés and references all laid out as if it was a clever mix.</fullReview>

It is about a flock of teens going to a cabin in the woods but something isn't right, as you see from the backdrop. The best thing about this film is how it keeps escalating. I mean, it delivers and builds up to more and then delivers and the builds up to more yet again. And ultimately it climaxes into total insanity. It reminds me of the original Scream in how it breaks all the rules and uses that as part of the movie. I watched this film literally a few hours ago. That was my second time viewing the film because I was lucky enough to first see it when it came out back in 2012. And I'm sure I'll be seeing it a few more times and loving it more and more with each viewing, but there just isn't anything like experiencing this film for the first time and doing so without knowing anything about it.

I wish I knew what it takes for a well-known, and actually good actor chose the film they will be in it. In a movie such as this one, maybe they did it for money, there isn't any other explanation?

		<shortDescription>Tries Too Hard To Be Different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods is not just another horror movie, as the PR tries to advertise. But, in its core, maybe it is.As the IMDb curiosities state, this movie's script was written in only three days, and it sure reflects on the movie. We are given an interesting premise, with what feels like almost a really sadistic reality show. But we already guess, of course, because it has been told to us that this movie is different, that this isn't a reality show at all.So, from the beginning, the script tells you that all the clichés that take place in the first hour of running time are some sort of gag, that this film is kind of mocking all other horror movies by doing what they do. But they're mocking, so, they're self-aware, right? Well, that doesn't fix things.This film has an urge to shake this weight off its shoulders from the beginning, almost fearing that the public will lose interest if they're not warned of all the silliness in the cabin-forest-zombies plot. Therefore, I think it's coward.In the end, you get a foreshadowed conclusion (you can't predict the exact ending, but you can guess something similar). So, what can you say? It won't dazzle you, and its gimmick doesn't work. But it still offers you a good hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destroy all monsters indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Bureaucratic demons hire an American firm to fulfill their young and stupid blood longings in order to avoid the apocalypse" The main problem with this film is that it aims to reinvent the wheel, trough the less desirable way: the bureaucratic way. First, it creates a narrative dimension which establishes a series of clichés as a matrix that pretends to be a mythology ( "the cabin in the woods" itself, a "murderer clown", a "zombie family" or the " killer Tooth fairy ballerina ", they are not some kind of modern mythology, they are just ridiculous standard forms); Second, all this narrative stodgy soup is placed over another layer - a high-tech management firm(American style), controlling these clichés - with all the "monster squad" being very real, not an induced hallucination, (which would be better), with an hilarious "release all monsters inside the premises" button included; Third, revealing a third layer - and the third act -, in the form of an "altar ambiance" with a travesty vibe and Lovecraft's style pretensions, with (literally) a basement of "old demons" from another dimension, where the lambs are - the greatest of all the idiotic clichés - a bunch of stupid people - nihilistic by nature, flat as the script commands, and tossed into a scenario with label terms engraved in stone as "slut" or "athlete" and a famous didactic narrator included; The result of this mess is a film that can only be conceived in terms of funding, thanks to the questionable reputation of the producer, who enriched with such kind of pasteurized, silly and sad banality. An adult telling a classic ghost story to a child, is more honest and effective than this atrocity that sincerely impoverishes the film industry with its narrative and enriches someone with another's stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All I have to say is this movie is underrated. Joss Whedon is a genius. I love all of his work. He always hits the nail on the head. I enjoy all of his work. I hope he returns to television. Loved the movie. Needs a sequel. now. Great movie. Great ending. Five teenagers head off for a weekend at a secluded cabin in the woods. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no means of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open, they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of relics and curios, but when one of the women, Dana, reads from a book, she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. However, there's far more going on than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dour Cliché Breaking Sci-Fi/Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very dark and genre breaking horror/sci fi fusion movie. From Buffy: The Vampire Slayer fame, Josh Whedon, comes this cliché aversion thriller that begins as a college prat party and transforms into a hard science fiction movie devolving into a horror drenched movie into a fusion of sci-fi and horror without the redeeming values of Buffy. The script and plot seem to have been patched together in rather sterile hotel rooms where the creators were allowed to go wild and break the traditional story lines of sci fi and horror. The end result is surprising, twisting, and is swallowed whole like Planet of the Apes (1968).Cabin has fewer elements from Buffy than it's an adult version of Cube Zero (2004) along with the horror elements borrowed from Thir13teen Ghosts (2001) and Cell (2000). Overall, it's a fun but creepy and rather dour film experience. For perhaps an even more elevated sci-fi, horror experience check out: THX-1138 (1971) Brazil (1985) Silent Hill (2006) 1408 (2007) Black Death (2010) The Awakening (2010) The Host (2013)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought, maybe it's about time I watched this. It's been a while since it came out, maybe it will be good; Joss Wheedon is involved, it must be better than average. How wrong I was. I'm not sure where this film fits but it could be re-titled goosebumps and had Jack Black starred in it then it would have been almost as interesting. OK the techno version of a ritual sacrifice is minimally interesting and the commercialization of the "product" for the old gods has some merit but this "horror" film lacks both heart and horror. It is like an intellectual experiment in re-visioning horror movies. Sorry, Joss, this might not be quite a stinker but put it in the same box set as films like "Mausoleum", "Gamer", "Superman Returns", "Mission to Mars" and "Robocop 3", you could possibly put "The Kindred" in there as well just for a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Comedy Horror, While Still Maintaining Originality as a Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was certainly interested in seeing this movie. I loved the idea, and was really hoping that it would be done right. In the end I think that it was done quite well. Cabin in the Woods takes a somewhat different approach to the horror genre. It takes a lot of clichés and uses them, but its self-aware and pretty much shoves that fact in your face, so the clichés end up coming off as much less than a cliché. While the 'twist' in the movie is relatively obvious early on, I want to avoid giving you as many spoilers as possible. But it's about a group of friends staying in a cabin in the woods and they find out that there's something much different than they expected happening in the cabin. It's a really awesome idea actually, and I was really impressed overall by how it went. It could have benefited from being longer, but it still had good reason for its 95 minute run time. The characters are all built around clichés, and like I said, the movie is short so the characters don't have much time to be developed. It's clear that that characters aren't the main focus of the movie, but they're still relatively likable, and your not completely sure who you want to root for in the end. The movie is quite obviously a comedy, despite not being categorized (on IMDb) as one. The movie is filled with outright goofy moments and funny things that you have to look for. Some of the humor is also in how over the top the movie can be, so if you have a dark sense of humor than you'll probably enjoy this movie. Overall Cabin in the Woods is a solid movie. The plot is great, the characters are good, and the dark comedy is great. While it would have benefited from a longer run time, it was still great and paced relatively well. It still managed to feel unique while embracing clichés. Sometimes these clichés weren't incorporated well unfortunately, as in they ended up actually feeling cliché. In the end I'd certainly recommend that if you love horror, comedy and/or a mix of the two then give this one a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A group of college kids go away to a remote cabin, only to fall prey to a massive game.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was little, often or not I would be cooped up in my bedroom, rays of sunshine pouring through the blinds, with an open tub of action figures to keep my attention. Sprawled on the floor would be Skeletor, Michelangelo with his orange bandana, a 12-inch Godzilla, Emperor Palpatine with clip on lightening bolts, and a lazily played with Stretch Armstrong. Constructed around them would be a partially fictionalized Lego city, playing off the layered buildings of New York and Chicago (Gotham City and Metropolis respectively). Tossing these miniature idols around with a child's unforgiving carelessness, Skeletor and the rest of the dirty dozen would be engaged in a pieced together recreation of a battle my innocent eyes saw last Saturday morning. Like my fantasy world recreations of yesteryear, Cabin in the Woods plays like a piecemeal childhood meta-mash-up, deriving its tongue in cheek humor, stereotypical character archetypes, and laid out horror from an all encompassing love of a well worn genre.Beginning like most estrogen fueled teen slashers, Cabin in the Woods juxtaposes between the mid-academia antics of a group of friends heading out to a secluded cabin with that of two lab technicians, played with gleeful adoration by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. Little is known of the two and their motives, but producer/writer Joss Whedon, a veteran writer of teen clichés and a key player in the resurgence of meta-horror surrounds us with enough characters to keep our curiosity and questions satiated until the final frame. As the teens begin to uncover the unsettling faults and horrors within the cabin, we are given more pieces to the meta- puzzle, allowing us to bare witness to the sights and sounds of a film that teeters on the brink of self-referential overload. What allows Cabin in the Woods to continue on without losing its mystique and fascination is Whedon's mindful appreciation for the horror genre in multiple mediums, paving the way for a film that balances scares with blood-stained black comedy like a cup of coffee shakily delivered to its final destination.When the film introduces us to its respectively titled setting, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead immediately stands tall as the referential lifeboats captain. Soon after though, Cabin in the Woods begins filling itself with horror passengers from other vessels, causing one to cringe as water begins flooding over. From your standard stalker in the woods affair such as Friday the 13th, Dead and Buried, and Wrong Turn to Fulchi's Zombi, Carpenters The Fog, and Cliver Barker's Hellraiser, the fondness for decades of terror become evident in Goddard and Whedon as they craft a film on the crafting of the perfect horror scenario. One by one the kids fall prey to the cabins elaborate operating system as fog pours out of the ground, hormone induced gas creeps into the teens bodies, and the manipulation of the perfect unmade fright flick begins to lay waste to the perfect weekend getaway. Watching all of this unfold is something true horror junkies will revel in, while those who are less aware of the genre it holds in high esteem may slip under the cracks, finding Cabin in the Woods to be a glorified mockery of the yet-buried reality genre.Picking apart Drew Goddards film is akin to over-analyzing every piece of horror cinema that has graced the video racks and late night cinemas over the years, giving one a fistful of material to uncover and piece together. There is much to admire in what Joss Whedon has crammed into a 90 minute horror tribute, yet without the countless chapters of film history already established by the classics there wouldn't be much of a skeletal structure for the film to hold itself up, sagging like the rotting flesh of one of its zombies. However, it's a film that deserves attention and praise for its multilayer meta use, taking a well-worn sub-genre and flipping it on its three heads and giving us a ride well worth the ticket price. If Cabin in the Woods won't turn you on to the multiple mediums and genres it references (and references well), then horror may very well be lost on you for good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woah! That's creepy...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I thought that this was a very typical horror movie, where a group of friends go into a deserted cabin and horrific monsters start to kill each of the friends one by one. There is the typical jock, the slutty girl, the hot athlete, the smart guy, and the virgin. These teenagers are portrayed so generically that you actually kind of want them to die because of their stupidity. But as the story progresses, we find out that they were selected and manipulated by an organization in order to complete a ritual. So as I watch this film, I knew that all the monsters were controlled by this one huge organization, but the thought of that was pretty creepy. And then after I finished watching the movie, I realized that there are a lot of conspiracy theories in this movie. At first I thought this was such a typical horror movie but then I realized that this movie had a deeper meaning, and it's not just a horror movie, but also a mystery movie. Like I've mentioned before, this is because there are a lot of conspiracy theory in this movie. In the movie, they never mention the name of the organization and it appears that the organization is highly sophisticated and dealing with a lot of military tech. In addition, after the death of the first victim, we see one of the workers praying a dark prayer and kissing an ornament. Hmmmm? starting to get a little bit freaky. So basically, there is a cult organization which is constantly sacrificing people. It's definitely puzzling and ominous. In the end, there is this huge fiery-hand that comes out from the ground and it grabs the audience and basically the world ends. I thought the ending was definitely something. Then it made me think, whether or not if the protagonists were the real protagonists. Because the jock and the virgin weren't offered as a sacrifice, the world ended. So I realized that it was difficult to decide who the protagonists were. The organization was trying to stop the end of the world, and the two teenage friends were just trying to survive. 80/100</fullReview>

I'm not talking about the "I love horror" fans who are talking about all the bull sh$@ excuse of horror movies that get spoon fed to us week after week with the same god damn thing we just got. Jump scare after jump scare. The horror fan I'm referring to you know who you are, you were there when Myers kept us up at night, not the shitty rob versions either! You where there when Freddy Gave you nightmares, when the thing (not the re make) made you wonder who the person is next to you. This is a horror movie to its core and knows it. It takes every stereotype In horror films specifically slasher, and pokes fun at it. This is clearly created with love of the horror genre and any horror fan will pick up on its humour and love it. It's not terrifying it is completely and utterly an unexpected horror comedy thrill ride to get slasher fans dopamine receptors firing off. If you are a true horror film you will love this journey!</fullReview>

You can not really take this film seriously. It is a parody but it is not the kind of Parody where its all funny and has tons of stupid jokes in it. It is a serious film but you could still see obvious nods to other films. I am not a big fan of horror films. i have not seen many but i saw this one because it is such a unique film and i'm getting bored of seeing films that are obviously made to be like a film that has already been made. You don't have to be a fan of horror films. you could be like me where u don't care for horror films. you should see this one because it is so original and because it has very strange plot twists. I personally dislike most horror films but like i said this is not really a horror film at all. it is a parody of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better to die like a soldier than live like a coolie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whedon and Goddard changed my mind about all Hollywood writers being hacks. These two knew their craft.There is much to this film, and one has to stick it out, because it begins with as big a cliché of horror as one can get, and that's intentional because of the story here, which is actually many symbolic stories rolled into one.I probably wouldn't have continued watching had I not intended to critique it, and that's why I'm not a fan of modern story telling. In order to be produced, one must do as these two writers do, "unfold" the story. I don't like being manipulated, and Christianity dictates not to "manipulate", and that's why this story is as Christian as one can get, albeit a more Gnostic Christian story than usual. It shows up "manipulation".How to tell of this film without spoilers? I think some things need to be said. But I won't reveal any "real spoiler", other than a lot of what you see that you think is off subject, is actually right on target.There are allusions here to many films, but mostly to THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. The evil Japanese commander in that film states:BETTER TO DIE LIKE A SOLDIER THAN LIVE LIKE A COOLIEAnd our five young people do that. They encounter danger, and of course the first fatality has no idea of the danger, just as if five people walk through their football field, and suddenly one steps on a mine. The first one can have no clue as to the reality, and so the others learn more and more as they go along.Remember that quote from KWAI. It has meaning. Because the surface of the story is about five young people who are the usual five who enter the horror story, so much so that we can almost sense the writing team has something else in mind, if they're truly writers, and they don't disappoint us.I don't give this a 10/10 yet, because before I give a film that, it must digest and pass a test of time with me.This film will be relevant as long as we have IMDb bubble boys, and those are the ones who are put down most by this film.The film is "anti-horror" instead of "horror".There are many levels of symbolism here. For example, there is an "army symbolism" here. The five young people are "sacrificed" in a way by the "officer characters".And the writers are careful to show that of the main "office" characters relegating the action, only two are "officers" who have the ideology of the Hellish game, while the others are symbolic of the squadron clerks, maintenance, mechanics, the support people doing their job. One girl, maybe the closest of the "enlisted" to the "officers" even states that while the officer characters are "celebrating", she is "drinking". That line, among others, has more significance than the casual observer might realize.The "sacrifice" angle is shown for what it is, too. We see the officer characters demanding to be in complete control, even of the order of fatalities.And the five young people do their best. They are given labels of "nerd", "virgin" and other labels, labels which for one of them proves to be the ultimate irony.We see other cultures playing the same control game with young people, but not to the degree the Americans do. Again, there is more being stated here than meets the eye. The modern American, in a worship of evil, in considering cannibals immortal, serial killers undying, homicidal maniacs gifted, the bubble boy horror fan who worships this idea, is the exact opposite of the American revolutionaries Patrick Henry and Thomas Payne. The exact opposite.Back in the 1960s I remember kids playing make believe, and there would always be the older control freak kid who made each invisible door release an even bigger demon to defeat, just to torment the other kids. And I've no doubt that there were such control freaks in 1960 B.C. doing the same.According to the film, people have been subjecting themselves to this for ages. And it became a religion to those who have the worst outlook on good and evil. "Fair is foul and Foul is Fair", except these maniacs take it to mean spiritual "fair and foul" being the opposite.A lot of this is explored. And pay attention to the Japanese girls. Because there is more symbolism here. They represent the total opposite of what the American ideology is. Again, I refer to the quote in the classic war film given above.In the end, I won't say if it's some of the original five young people, or some of the other characters, but two of them are given the choice to continue playing the game, and they fall for it for a while, because they believe the lies that it will save humanity, when in fact, all it does is keep humanity in slavery.I hope I haven't "spoiled" anything. I would rather a first time viewer just keep an open mind throughout, and wait till the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is a typical horror movie with plenty of gore and thrill. Any horror-junkie would enjoy this movie because of it's integration of the typical components of a slasher movie but it has some extra twists to make it more modern and off track. The plot is easy to follow and everything comes together in the end in an unexpected way.Five college students (Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams) decide to spend a weekend at Curt's (Chris Hemsworth) cousins cabin in the woods. I know, total shocker right? Not like it's the title of the movie or anything. Anyway, as expected in a typical horror movie the teens die off one by one. The cause of their death just so happens to be a 2012 favorite: Zombies. Director Drew Goddard didn't want this to be a typical 'hey everyone dies because zombies suck, hooray!' kind of movie. He added in a new factor to switch things up and give the audience something new to enjoy. The government has a facility completely controlling most of the outcome. The facility drugs them and uses immoral tactics to have things work this way. The one question is why? Why would the government do this to five college students? They must have a reason right? Correct! They are following a ritual that is later explained in detail during the movie, but despite the government's attempts to make everything run smoothly, it all doesn't quite go as planned.This movie takes all of the basic components of a slasher movie and plays on them in a fun-spirited humorous way. The college students are all attractive to the audience's eye and they have one teen from each typical slasher archetype (The virgin, druggie, whore, nerd, and the jock). The movie plays the slasher stereotype to a T and everything seems to go as planned. Then the unexpected happens and the movie hits an unanticipated turn of events and in the end doesn't end like a typical slasher film but it takes on a more modern sci-fi ending. Due to the immense amount of spoilers I cannot explain this in much detail but it is a very creative way to incorporate modern day horror with old school tactics. One unusual element of this horror movie is that because the movie kept getting switched from the cabin to the government facility, any and all typical scare moments were ruined and made funny. This was not something I personally enjoyed but was more than likely done for the idea of a wider audience to enjoy.All in all, the movie was well done and had twists and turns that brought you along for a typical slasher ride with a modern day kick. The movie is appropriate for a wide variety of audience however, horror genre lovers will be satisfied with the appropriate amount of old school slasher mixed with modern day horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been relatively curious for this one for a while, and recently it was aired on television on some Halloween-related movie marathon. And so I gave it a try.Chris Hemsworth will never be a charismatic actor and I'd prefer it if would try any other segment of the entertainment business, but alas. Kristen Connolly did a better job (and of course Anna Hutchinson was quite easy on the eye), and then there were some (very) small roles that were quite okay, such as the ones by Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford and Sigourney Weaver. But the main attraction of 'The cabin...' was the story, anyway.The plot is a hotch-potch of familiar (sci-fi, horror and such) movie elements, and it was only just about entertaining enough the whole way through. The unleashing of all the creatures was a really fun bit, but all in all this didn't blow me away much.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filled with monsters of all sorts, blood, and angry underground gods, The Cabin in the Woods has an unimaginable plot twist that most people would never see coming. However, the entire plan of the film is to allow the audience to think they know what is coming next. With classic slasher film characters and a classic plot, most viewers will think they know what will happen in this film; a group of naive teenagers will be murdered while they rent a house in the middle of the woods, leaving the survivor girl, or the virgin, to fight off the murderer and survive. More or less, in this film, that is not the case.The Cabin in the Woods, directed by Drew Goddard and released in 2012, is a film that has many critics and viewers alike asking questions. With a very specific plot twist for the classic slasher film, many are thrown off by the plot of this film. Some people may not feel as though this is a true slasher film, or even that this film mocks horror. However, I believe that this film takes classic and previously horribly done slasher-films, puts them together, and upgrades the entire ideal of what a slasher-film truly is. In this film, a group of five college friends hop into a van and head towards the middle of the woods to spend a weekend in an old cabin on a lake. The five main characters all represent classic trope characters in this genre of film. For example, you have your slutty stupid blonde character, who in this film is named Jules. You also have your smart and innocent girl, who you later will find out is a virgin, this character is the survivor girl, who is Dana in this film. We then have Marty, the funny stoner character, who is supposed to be stupid, however we soon realize he is the only character that is not passive about what is going on. Another classic trope character we have is Curt, the macho athlete with the hot sluttty blonde girlfriend (Jules), who acts like the savior of the night. Finally, we have the smart nice guy, Holden, who plays Dana's somewhat love interest, before he is soon murdered. I know what you are thinking right now, classic, right? How much more obvious can a horror film get than a group of five teenagers spending a weekend in a creepy cabin in the middle of the woods? That's what I thought too. I was not shocked to see myself jump at false scares, and cover my eyes at intense music. Regardless of this, there was one aspect of the film that drew me into the film more so than I have ever been drawn into a slasher-film before, and that is the concept of the film. The most intriguing aspect of the film is that the entire plot of the movie was based inside another plot of a movie. What the hell am I talking about? Well, in this film, there is a facility that selects people, or groups of friends without their knowing, and controls the entire process of the murders. For example, in this facility, the faculty put wires and cameras all throughout the cabin house. Through many computers and technology, the faculty control every aspect of what goes on while this group of friends is actually at cabin in the middle of the woods. They control the temperature, the air, the lighting, everything. The entire area in which the group of friends are in is actually within a contained dome type structure, therefore, they cannot leave a certain parameter of land. I personally loved how the faculty put a ball type machine, in which the characters find in the basement in the beginning of the film, and twist it, unknowingly selecting how they will be killed. This is not even half of the film, there's more! We later find out the goal of the facility in controlling these mass murders, is in order to please earth's gods, whom are hidden in the underground of the facility. If the murders are not completed, and the blood of the characters are not given to the gods underground, the angry gods will destroy the entire world. Crazy, right?Regardless of the fact that this film's plot may be overdone, and chaotic, having hundreds of unimaginable monsters running around killing everyone in sight in the facility at the end of the film, this film strongly represents a true slasher film. It is not ordinary, but it does not mock the classic plot of a slasher-film, it advances the classic plot of a true slasher- film. The film is unique and amazing because it takes a classic slasher film plot, and puts it within another plot, which in this sense is the facility being in charge of these murders in order to please the gods in order to ultimately save all mankind. With many critics stating that this is not a true slasher-film, and that this film is ridiculously overdone, I am here to state that regardless of the fact that the film may be overdone, it is just as true and genuine of a slasher film as any classic, such as Scream or A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Cabin in the Woods has just modernized the slasher genre in order to appeal the typical twenty first century audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a must see. A good film to show new to horror movie watchers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie puts an interesting twist to the horror/slasher film genre. The acting (Hemsworth, Polk, Mikalski and others) was by far some of the best in modern horror films. Not that this movie required amazing acting, it required realistic acting which was portrayed very well. What sets this movie apart is its lurid monsters and death scenes. While being "scary" it was not to gruesome, which allows a wide variety of audiences that I think would enjoy this film. Cabin In The Woods has two running stories in one film (which is something I have not seen before in horror films). While we see the typical teenager mini-vacation and drugs and alcohol, the audience views an almost "behind the scenes" version of what seems to be an institution trying to kill them. As the kids fight for their survival, and underlying message of world destruction comes to surface. All of this is brilliance in its authenticity of writing and directing by Goddard. I strongly recommend movie to all people young and old who are looking for a chilling, intriguing movie. I always judge my views on films by if they were memorable or not, and this film (especially the last scene) was very memorable. In a life or death situation how far would you go to save yourself and the world?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure where to begin with The Cabin in the Woods without giving too much away. This will be brief and probably not very helpful, but this films needs to be seen with as little known about it as possible. Five friends go on vacation to a... yes you named it... cabin in the woods. They're overseen by two office workers, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, from an underground-lab. What beholds the holiday- goers? Words cannot describe. Drew Goddard pumps out cliché after cliché, only to slap us in the face with outrageousness. This is unique, gory and funny, thanks to Joss Whedon's writing skills. Watch this, but be warned, you will never be prepared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) A Review by JP February 5, 2015GGGEEK-GGGASM I've been a devout fan of this genre-bending orgy of shrewd, cliché-exposing (&amp; utilizing) elements since its release just under 3 years ago. With a sales rank like an offline used copy of Stephen King's novel "It", "The Cabin in the Woods" is one of the rarities people seek out for purchase in a physical format. Ginger Geek God Joss Whedon, creator of "TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer" (1996-2003) &amp; director of "Marvel's The Avengers" (2012) collaborated with Drew Goddard (TV's Lost Producer, World War Z Screenwriter, &amp; this film's director), an unknown (&amp; apparent horror aficionado) at the time ? and under the veil of a simple slasher flick brought serenity (geek puns intended of course) to a basic concept, turned it on its ear, flipped it over, dashed it with a touch of nearly every category of film, and pumped-out one insane, intense, hilarious, grotesque, maddening, silly, intentionally-ridiculous social satire. It occurred to me while showing it to a reluctant horror-hater that this film had even more layers than I'd truly embraced upon earlier views. With few exceptions, the sad slasher sub-genre is reverse-endowed with a thoughtless equation that has filled both theaters &amp; studios' wallets since the late '70s (right around my birth). There are few exceptions. This is one of the best.THE CAST IN THE WOODS (&amp; BEYOND) The standard-issued cast?for the horror film?with the stereotypical whore, jock, scholar, stoner, &amp; the "innocent virgin" worked well for the most part with: an overly-pheromone'd Anna Hutchison (TV's Spartacus); sexxxy-with-shorter-hair Thor aka Chris Hemsworth (Red Dawn)-who totally channeled Josh Hartnett from Halloween: H20 (1998) (though I am in NO WAY complaining); smirk-cheeked, Mochaccino, godly-blue-eyed (&amp; bodied) Jesse Williams (TV's Grey's Anatomy); ironically-written*/often helium-voiced toke-stoker Fran Kranz (The Village); and perky-lipped, bright-eyed Kristen Connolly (TV's The Bay). Stud-strutted Bradley Whitford (TV's West Wing) &amp; "moves-like-Jagger" Richard Jenkins (The Witches of Eastwick) finagle the?the?I guess I could say "sub-plot"?(sorry, it's REALLY difficult not to drop a spoiler with this one) and the 2 suit-&amp;-tie, HR-reported-daily fellows add worthy cheese &amp; momentary empathy to balance this complex tale of crazy good facets I'm shocked "Cabin" managed to convince a green light from even Lions Gate Entertainment. No disrespect LGE, but if I chose to be disrespectful, I could cite a series of torture porn known as the "Saw" films. Obviously GGG Whedon's impressive (or buff-y) résumé?or perhaps the highly-manipulative demonic invading his soulless gingerly, nom-worthy shell cast a spell. I couldn't say for sure, but I'm glad it got funded! Just when you think you have it all figured-out, *!!!!!G-G-Ginger S'Nap Slap Beyotch!!!!!*, everything changes. Information is given?when it is intended to be questioned.5G NETWORK Technically, dark lighting &amp; slick cinematography by Peter Deming (Scream 2-4, Mulholland Drive) added to the gloom vividly which complemented the genuine fright it built oh-so-very-delicately. Considering the scope of this story, I sometimes forget just how under your skin it burrows. That's a credit to GGG &amp; the Great Goddard. Yes, I can call him Great from one film. That should be the best indicator of how inventive &amp; intriguing this impaling-unicorn of a gem is, but the 5-Gs can't take all the credit. Much like Hitchcock owes an immense wealth of gratitude to legendary "Psycho" (1960) composer Bernard Herrmann for the success of that film, the 5-Gs should bow to an intense, booming score by David Julyan (Memento, The Descent).DAWN APPROACHES I would love to go on for another 570 words, but I didn't mean to go this long. To close: at least 4-Stars-Worthy, "The Cabin in the Woods" is a love letter to horror, sci-fi, comedy, and probably every other genre in the celluloid spectrum; one of the most enjoyable gore-fests attainable (even to those who hate bloody films). One warning: if you have phobia(s)?don't be distracted by the potential of it popping-up. It will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inventive, tongue-in-cheek horror comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this inventive horror-comedy directed by Drew Goddard, five college friends head out to spend a nice weekend at the lake, while staying at a lone cabin deep in the woods. These college friends include muscle-head jock Kurt (played by Chris Hemsworth), his sexy girlfriend Jules (played by Anna Hutchinson), average, smart guy Holden (played by Jesse Williams), clean cut Dana (played by Kristen Connonlly), and an absent-minded stoner Marty (played by Fran Kranz). What starts out as a fun night of drinking and truth-or-dare quickly turns into a nightmare when a horde of zombie killers come out of nowhere and begin attacking. Now why does this happen exactly? Well, the hideous creatures are summoned and controlled by no one other than a group of technicians of a secret underground facility, where the teenagers are unknowingly being watched from hidden security cameras inside the cabin. So the teenagers must escape and survive against the chaotic, gore-filled monster onslaught.This is not your average, everyday horror film that you might expect. This film takes the horror-genre is mixes it with some "Truman Show" like elements. You have these hideous monsters who attack these teenagers not to prey on them, but because they are being controlled by these techno-masterminds that spy on them through these high-tech security devices. The film comes up with a very smart idea that's, at the same time, gets a bit dumb and way over the top. The audience is treated with scenes of characters getting attacked by a wide variety of monsters including flying creatures that resemble the monsters from other horror films like Gremlins, The Mist, and Jeepers Creepers, and outrageous blood and gore. There are a lot of scary moments, but they are done in a very comedic fashion that will scare you, but make you laugh at the same time. So this film succeeds on evenly balancing humor and scares. However as the film progresses, the plot gets more and more sillier to the point where it gets a little too dumb, especially with the ending. Luckily, the screenplay is very thoughtful and what I think redeems the film for its utter silliness. The Cabin in The Woods is quite a fun movie, even if it gets dumb at times. I can agree that this film is a bit overdone, but it is very easy for horror fans to evenly blends comedy and horror elements together. This is certainly one of the best comedy-horrors I've seen in recent years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who say that this film is a genius are those who started watching horror movies five years or less. I guess that's why they say that Whedon is a genius. I do not like work of Whedon. Whedon is characterized by put everything in a blender, which is what happens at the end of the film. Whedon has a trauma with HP Lovecraft and can not write a movie of ?terror? without any reference to his work. The movie is not scary ... it is laughable. Sorry boys ... for me Whedon is not a genius. A guy who creates a character like Loren is a genius? God, that we are wrong to say that !!! They say that history know ... you do not know what is the end. And he's right, that final can only be created by the sick mind of Whedon. Very good special effects, nothing more</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sloppy waste of potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually love Whedon's material, and this meta-horror movie definitely had some good ideas and great potential, but ultimately it disappoints. The sloppiness of the writing simply makes it hard to enjoy.The good stuff is the scattered snippets of Whedon's snappy dialog, and the concept.Spoilers follow.The bad stuff is exemplified by the puff of smoke that makes one character suddenly change his mind, and say the exact thing that they wanted him to say. I mean, I can tolerate the sci-fi approach where they somehow built a huge Truman-like enclosure and somehow invented the technology for an invisible barrier. But brain control that makes people think and say exact illogical things with a puff of smoke, is way too much.And this is the kind of thing I hate with bad sci-fi and fantasy writing: If you are going to invent a superpower or super-technology, don't make believe that it doesn't exist when it isn't convenient. Why didn't they use that puff of smoke to stop them from driving away into the tunnel instead of rushing to blow it up? Or use it to stop them from going into the elevator? Or from killing zombies? And why not make them run into the monster's hands for that matter? Evidently they don't care about freewill after they chose the monster, since they used the puff of smoke. Not to mention that they made most of the characters so dumb that they would ignore things like cellar doors opening by themselves and tunnels blowing up.And what kind of stupid monster facility has a big red button available to guests that brings ALL of the monsters into the facility and frees them? That's really dumb. And why didn't the monsters attack each other? There are several more examples like these of lazy writing that insult the audience.Other flaws include many bland or nonsensical characters in the facility (no one seemed to be bothered by the fact that they are killing people even if it's for the greater good), and there's the weird redneck character that never made any sense (biblical preaching over the phone but afraid of being heard over speaker-phone? why?), all of which makes it impossible to tune into what they were about.And then there are the various rules on how to kill their sacrifices. Obviously, all of the rules are just there so that they will conform to horror movie clichés. But it isn't clever to simply invent a 'system' that conforms to horror clichés if they don't give any reasons why these rules are there! In short, the concept in the movie feels very undeveloped and the writing is too sloppy. Good idea, a moderately entertaining movie, but a poor execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods revolves around two stories, there are the main characters who go to the cabin and wound up getting attacked by monsters and a group of mysterious business men who seem to be controlling the whole thing. Overall the movie seemed like it was just going to be a fun, campy horror movie and in the first act it was. The setup was perfect and it got me really excited for what was going to come but when the monsters show up it was vastly underwhelming but that's not the worst part. The worst part is the third act which is SO different from the rest of the movie it gave me a headache. In the last twenty minutes I ended up tapping my foot waiting it to be done so I could continue on with my life. If you're a horror fan then I recommend you stay away from this one.</fullReview>

I laughed all way till the end because it felt like more of a comedy. Since the beginning, obviously the works are lazily executed. Of all the monsters, they conveniently chose zombies. Why? It's easier compare to the banshee, giant snake, creepy-faced ballerina etc. Huh?Another thing I don't understand is that they mentioned they are doing the ritual for the Ancient One. Could they please explain who exactly is this Ancient One( the gods?), are there more than one given that many facilities were built, and how come the facilities were ruined (ruined by what?). See? They just shoved that hard bullcrap of Ancient One without bothering to explain what is actually going on.I recommend to watch it online, not worth to download. Just don't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods is a modern horror classic even though the movie is mediocre at large portions of times. It tries to be funny and scary at the same time but it's really not. Joss Wheedon, way to go. What it is though, to the best of my knowledge ability, is simply entertaining with a terrifyingly twisted ending.The beginning ---&gt; trip to the cabin is basically horrible being way too slow without establishing any kind of recognizable plot line and poorish character dialogue.The middle ---&gt; arrival at the cabin and nightfall is resembling of your standard good slasher horror with nothing much special but a creepy cabin in the woods that's not as creepy as u maybe think but actually is way more creepy then you ever imagined.And the end ---&gt; escape from the evil cabin in the woods is the big payoff. The end is nuts!! The end is so crazy it makes you wanna watch the movie over again right after the first time seeing it. The elevator lobby scene with the swat team says it all!I've said too much but that's where it's at. Don't judge this movie 'til it's over. Cabin in the Woods scores major points for horror originality and a fun and imaginative ending. I liked it and that's okay. Watch this movie for the ending!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It tries to start like the usual teen slasher movie, but since the start I felt something not good. In fact before we get to know the "usual teens" that are leaving for the cabin in the woods, we are introduced to two guys dressed in white overalls chatting in a factory rest room, in front of a coffee machine. It seems that they are engineers or some technical staff members. Minutes later we are informed that these tech staffers are part of a big nameless firm or governmental agency, in competitions with other similar agencies in other parts of the world, in order to conduct a sort of an horror and deadly Truman Show having the unaware teens as main characters.Since the motivation for this "game" with human sacrifices is to appease some divinities, preventing them from destroying earth, and due to the awful way the movie depicts the characters (teens and "controllers" alike) from there on I struggled to keep watching this boring mess of a story.Two out of ten.</fullReview>

I think is one of the less enjoyable movies I ever saw , portraying human life as something laughable and also depicting those "normal" workers on this company extremely bad and cruel. By the way,is this "company"a secret? Do all those people pretend to work somewhere else the whole time? Also , the movie never says who watch the reality show, the life of those people! On top of that the story with the ancient gods is dull and the concept of being held by a sacrifice even sillier. The man also insulting the Asian girls for not dying is also something i am furious about. It's kids dammit. Let them live. I didn't understand in general the whole concept of sacrifices. How many people should be killed? Long story short, the movie is a mess, original might be, but in the worst possible way. In the end, when i was imagining Cabine in the Woods i thought i would see some kind of ghost story, or at least a killer story , and not that mess. Stay simple. I would enjoy it more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the movie has a high number of on screen deaths, I was not scared at any point of time. As this movie is supposed to be a slasher film, my expectations were much higher. In this film, there are five people who decide to go to a cabin in the woods. The title is very apt. Now, here things start to get interesting as they find out some undead people, a mysterious room and other haunted images. Apart from this, there are a number of people who are overlooking the protagonists from an unknown place. One of the problems in this movie is that we never get to know the motivation behind the happenings that are taking place. This makes the overall experience much less enjoyable. The starting of the movie was promising but the rest of the movie was a huge letdown. I believe 6 stars is what this movie deserves and I think I am being generous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horror and thriller movies, but this one was like the Truman show meets Resident Evil! Don't be confused, I am not giving it a good start to my review.I was confused from the start, a bunch of mid 20's early 30 year old actors trying to put on a teen role of going away to a cabin that is rigged by a reality TV sort of experiment? It would have been much more exciting and lets say, less embarrassing for the actors to just play a role in which the Cabin is haunted rather than have comical zombies and a Unicorn (which is pure and a thing of beauty in mythical cultures) stalking the living in the "underground maze of horrors".I found this film so boring, lifeless and cheap really. Good special effects, but even a young person with windows movie maker can do better. I am yet to see a great modern thriller and horror movie to really leave me going, "that one was good.." but SFX these days and cheap sloppy actors and scripts are all that matters.The best recent thriller I have seen is Insidious, including the 2nd Chapter. I found that way better as a thriller and horror than this garbage. Lets hope they don't make a 2nd one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods (2012): Dir: Drew Goddard / Cast: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams: While the previews spew off promises of ominous thrills of forbidden evils, the screenplay quickly unravels to reveal a total mess complete with every moron stereotype that the screenwriter could muster up. The premise seems familiar yet it works up to an extent. Five college students travel to an isolated cabin not realizing that the place is bugged and they're being watched. The viewers are scientist types cheering, betting, giving high fives, and all around manipulating what occurs to these victims. The first mistake is a venture down a dark cellar where objects are handled and the Latin spell of a book is read. This unleashes zombies that originally occupied the cabin. These victims are chosen specifically for a certain element. Chris Hemsworth is the athlete, Anna Hutchison is the sexually active, Jesse Williams is the intellect, Fran Kranz is the dope smoking fool, and Kristen Connolly is tagged as the virgin. None of them emerge with personalities but director Drew Goddard makes great references to films such as The Evil Dead. The third act is bizarre and leaves a severe sense of dread. Why these films insists on a future of hellish fatality gives one the belief that its makers have no faith in the reality of good. The special effects are inventive, graphic and pretty much steal the film. If you have the desire to watch people suffer for the entertainment of others, then this film is for you. For a superior choice, I recommend The Hunger Games. Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

All but two of the characters end up dying when they find the people that put them into the situation where their lives are at stake. Because two of the victims lived they messed up the whole "sacrifice" system that this company had going on. They both stayed alive, which angered the "gods" and forced the "gods" to come out of hiding and essentially destroy the world.The ending is very bizarre, and I didn't like it because the explanation that was given about the sacrifice and the way the system works wasn't very informing.

Any lover of horror and its tropes, or anyone complaining that these tropes are 'getting old' and that there's 'nothing original any more' should watch this film. Not only is it a great watch with a scattering of classic jump scares, and hilarious black comedy and irony, it's something that will make you stop and think for a second about what it really means, if you like to go that deep with film, which I certainly do.

		<shortDescription>Wow - something a bit different!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the last ten years or so, so many horror movies have been labelled as 'genre-changing.' And most of them have been utter tosh - simply regurgitating tried and tested formulas, filled with annoying horror clichés and even more annoying screaming teenagers.Enter The Cabin in the Woods. I picked up on the hype before it was released and deliberately tried to avoid finding out too much about it as I wanted to be surprised.I was surprised indeed. It was actually pretty good. Yes, it's horror. However, there's not an awful lot of gore or scares if that's what you're looking for. Instead, it pays homage to classic horror films like Evil Dead and rips them off in a good way, while at the same time introducing a slightly new spin on the genre.It's about five teenagers who take a trip to a deserted cabin in the woods the come to a sticky end, one by one. Nothing particularly original there, but it's the overall package that makes it slightly different to the norm.I won't say too much in case you don't know about there whys and hows of it all. Basically, if you like cheesy B-movie style horror films and you want one with a different plot which pokes fun at the many horror clichés you've become accustomed (and possibly desensitised to) over the years, then give this one a go. It may just surprise you.I really liked this film, but, after reading various Internet reviews, I've found a fair few people didn't. Their criticism was that either it wasn't scary or horrific enough, or that they didn't understand it. A fair comment on the lack of gore and scares, but I think the point of the film isn't to make you throw your dinner up or have a heart attack out of fright - but more to try and make something new out of something old. As for not understanding it - yes, this one does take an ounce more understanding that just a maniac in an ice hockey mask cutting people up with a chainsaw. Pay careful attention to the scenes in the office style environment which are interspersed with the story of the teenagers in the cabin - it should answer all questions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You knew a movie like this would come one day. After years of generic blood splatter, teens wandering aimlessly, and mindless killers. That one day someone would completely turn it upside down. Since horror films have been on a major nose dive for years finally came The Cabin in the Woods. Directed by Joss Whedon (The Avengers) and Drew Goddard (Cloverfield) take the old tried and true horror movie formula and completely outclass everything out there today. The movie starts out with, you guessed it five college students going to their cabin for a weekend of partying. As you would guess, beers were drank. Sexual tension everywhere and blood shed all about. Looks like any typical cliché horror film which is exactly what the directors want you to think. During all of this there is a second story going on where two technicians seem to be preparing for something unknown. The movie's screenplay makes you second guess yourself whenever you finally think you know what's going on. The twist and surprises are perfect and I won't go into too much detail to spoil it, but I can remember at least one time where I thought "Oh that's cool, but if they did this" just for it to completely amaze me. The movie gets progressively more intense and creative the longer it plays on. With the last act being a pause-and-rewind classic that you can talk about for hours on end. This is the type of movie if you're a movie buff worth re-watching to pick up every little clever reference to other horror films while at the same time being completely unique with nothing else like it out there today. Along with already one of the freshest and funniest scripts out there comes also one of the best cast for horror films. Featuring Kristen Connolly (Dana), Anne Hutchison (Jules), Chris Hemsworth (Curt or better known as Thor), Jesse Williams (Holden), and Fran Kranz (Marty). Each actor flourishes in their given role either being the athlete, the virgin, the scholar, the whore, or the fool. These people aren't just your typical dumb college kids. They were given difficult task of not only embracing their stereotypes, but also rejecting it. Like Marty, who would be labeled as the fool, seems to be the only character who feels like something just isn't right. There overall acting is well done in the comedy area while at the same time having a good straight forward horror performance. Also, you probably would never have guessed Kranz, portrayed in the movie as some conspiracy stoner, was actually in the best shape out of any of the male actors and it even went as far as the writes calling him muscular Jesus. Added to it the dialogue is top notch coming from Whedon. Whedon has always been known for his witty and sharp dialogue from his older shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There is plenty of fantastic lines here like Marty pointing at a wolf head saying "I dare you to kiss that moose!" There are plenty more lines after that will leave you breathless. Ultimately, The Cabin in the Woods is wildly entertaining because of its smart balance of embracing what the audience expects but at the same time completely rejecting it by doing their own thing. It is portrayed at the start like some run of the mill slasher film. There is enough gore and scares for any slasher fan to like it, but the movie brings so much more and completely turns the script. You can almost feel like this movie would bring an end to a lot of horror clichés, but there just aren't enough filmmakers who are either willing or capable to step outside the box like Whedon and company. If anything The Cabin in the Woods at least reinvigorated horror films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(93%) My personal favourite movie of the year, and indeed one of my favourite movies all time, which is strange as I was in two minds to even watch it after seeing the perfectly decent, yet not exactly mind blowing trailer (it is not an easy film to advertise as the less you know about it the better). I have hardly ever been as intrigued by any movie's plot as much as this one, as every time a question is answered, or at least partly answered, another pops straight back up until the very final moments, that's something really quite difficult to do and the writers should be proud of themselves for pulling it off. The film persuades the audience that what they are watching is a perfectly normal, generic horror movie only every so often it raises a question "what are the bad guys motives, and who the hell are they ?" The direction is spot-on, the cast is perfect, the writing couldn't be better, I laughed at the superb comedy parts that worked so fantastically well, it's just such an entertaining movie with so much going for it. It's maybe not 100% perfect (the ending is a little OTT) but I don't care as I'll stand by this movie as a future classic. A brilliant, brilliant film and a genuine surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is for those who likes mystery-horror films with a good story. Though like most horror films it depends on some sudden scare tactics, it has a nice story that brings the creeps into your skin. If you like Cthulhu and Lovecraft stuff, I am sure you are definitely gonna enjoy this. It gives a little bit the taste of the first Resident Evil film. May even taste a little bit like Hunger Games as well but among all the strongest taste I get from this film is similar to that of watching Evil Dead. If you are looking for a horror film with a good mysterious story, you would not have a bad night with this one.*(*Statement above is only for the palate of horror fans.

		<shortDescription>((SPOILER FULL!)) Cabin in the Woods was unique in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed this movie. It took a basic horror movie plot (5 kids going into the woods for a weekend of fun) and twisted it into something cool. The movie answered a question that many horror fans eventually ask at least once: "Why is all this stuff happening?" Well, instead of just saying there is a curse on the book she read out loud in Latin, they say that it is much more than that. It is a whole company devoted to killing teens in creative ways to use them as sacrifices. I thought this was very creative and give them props for trying something new. Also, I loved how they played on a bunch of other horror movie clichés such as having an "easy" girl, a jock, a book worm, a pot-head, and a virgin who is supposed to be the only one left alive (to kill the virgin is optional). I loved how they told us why there are always those 5 kinds of people in horror movies, and to find out more, please watch the movie, I have already said too many spoilers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in, all I knew was that this one had Thor headlining, and that one/more of the brains behind 'Lost' had dreamt this up. Also, on the negative side, the focus was more on the production, distribution and release delays, which never augur well for any flick, esp. when Thor had something similar going on with the 'Red dawn' remake (and we all know how 'classic' that turned out).Anyway, any fears I had were unfounded. This one turned out to be, simply, one of the most intelligent, and gleefully irreverent take on various genres, including schlock-horror. From one mind-bending twist to the next mind-numbing one, this one doesn't allow anyone to relax, and keeps pushing our buttons all through, defying/sending up all the genre conventions, without descending to parody.The casting and the acting are apt, with Weaver and Jenkins making welcome appearances, and nothing is what meets the eye.Surely the makings of a cult classic - Try ignoring reviews written by morons who give everything away, and be prepped to be pleasantly surprised by this masterwork, the likes of which will be rare to watch once again on the big screen. And yeah, take your significant other, and watch it on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts off introducing the characters, like all movies should, however it seems to emphasize all the negative qualities in every person. Most horror movies make you want one or two of the characters survive, but in this one I immediately wanted every character to die.The premise of this movie is a friend of the main characters buys a cabin in the woods, where the cast chooses to go for a party weekend. Before arriving they are greeted by an old angry cowboy who warns them of the danger, insults them, and then tells them to leave. The cast immediately starts treating him like crap. Then you find out the cabin is set up for them to all be "cleansed" and people in some organization are taking bets on what happens. They have to make choices of what happens to them and how they will survive. They shortly find themselves in some basement reading some book that rises zombies from the ground.I find it extremely difficult to get into this movie, because the constant cut scenes to the organization throw everything off, and add humor to every situation. Furthermore, the way this movie portrays "stoners" is deplorable. They make the character a burnt out long haired clueless pervert. He is so high that he mistakes a wolf for a moose, then blames it on being so high that he can't tell what is going on. This scene, and his whole persona is riddled with inaccuracy. First off, the fact that every horror movie that has a stoner makes him a dumb burn out is insulting, and really hurts the path of legalization. Secondly, "pot" has no effects that impair vision to the point of mistaking obvious objects that are not even 10 feet away. On another note, he's always spitting out these idiotic metaphors that do not make sense in any way. This is all proof that none of the people in charge of making this movie have done anything to try to be factual, and instead want to make some idiotic comedy like horror that is insulting to American media.And on a side note the only member of the cast that I consider to be a good actor dies near the beginning. My overall rating of this movie is a 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been some time since the initial release of this movie. It has received relatively positive reviews, which at the time may have been inspired by the novelty value of the film.I suspect, if most reviewers would re-evaluate the film now, they would agree that is mostly mediocre and almost completely lacks a sensible plot. At first it may seem interesting, but assessing the movie in totality, I don't think the novelty of many elements of the film makes up for the lack of the plot.There are some scary and surprising scenes, but it just seems like a mindless "bloodfest" in the end. You can see the demise of ALL the characters coming as if sign posted on a freeway.My conclusion is that this is a highly overrated film, which embraced gratuitous violence unashamedly. This is not even relevant, like for example in a Quinton Tarantino movie, and therefore I give it a generous 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! Sure, it has clear fundamentals for an average horror flick, but the film completely lacks one thing that is compulsory for such a highly rated "horror": scares. The film works along the premise of twisting that of which we already know (i.e. it tries to mess up our mind-set that the horror genre is pretty much done-and-dusted) and, looking at it from a pretty basic point of view, one would say it generally succeeds in that effort. However, when we delve deeper into the actual story and ask ourselves (cue Freaky Friday reference) "How do I feel about that?" it becomes clear the film isn't actually all that it's so famously made out to be. The acting is no more than average, and even though the movie strains to tear apart clichés, the characters are - in essence - predictable (with the exception of Marty, whom I have a soft spot for.) The lousy special effects don't much help this film either ? in fact I'd go so far as to say they let it down in a certain retrospect. In light of that, I did actually enjoy the scene where the monsters were unleashed upon the TV crews/behind the scenes bastards or whatever you may call them. I'd say definitely give this film a try. I can completely and utterly understand why people adore it so much, yet whilst keeping that in mind, the reasons pro-burning "Cabin in the Woods" exist is fairly clear too. Personally, I didn't expect much from this film ("from the director of Cloverfield" uh? no thanks!) and not much is what I received.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it a horror movie that isn't scary or is it a comedy that isn't funny? Either way, this movie is a loser. I can say that this is not a "dumb" movie. In fact, the film presents a thoughtful consideration of horror archetypes. Unfortunately, this would have been communicated more successfully in an essay. Otherwise, Cabin in the Woods has no compelling story, no heart, and (most fatally) no soul. If your idea of a good time at the movies is to feel superior to the very idea of story telling, then this film is for you. If, however, you like to watch movies to think and feel in new ways, then this movie will feel pretty hollow.I cannot leave this review without bemoaning the unrepentant smarminess of flattery masquerading as entertainment. Do you squeal in recognition when a genre movie lays bare its mechanisms? Does it make you feel smart? Why do you need a movie to make you feel smart?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi there!I watch the movie last night, and I felt uncomfortable with some comments. This movie is overrated. I agree that your subject is well chosen, but the development of his production team leaves much to be desired. Before I begin, let me make clear that I love certain productions of joss whedon also, it's very original, and in this movie as well. My problematic is the ultimate succession of facts before the apocalyptic end. Earlier, the allusion of typical American teenager, led most to think: "cliché". And in fact is a cliché, not only this part, but like many others throughout the movie, and successive allusions to other films, creating what I consider a great parody. Until then OK. That old man appear to then, the messenger, talking a lot of weird stuff, and then an eagle colliding in a field of force, which does not match the level of technology of this alternate world, but OK too. From then on, had all the horror / comedy movie construction, with a complex symbolism and even interesting, although nothing funny, which generated a relaxed atmosphere and creating a tension between the constant alternation of seriousness and comedy.Skipping various parts, I was well entertained with the movie and enjoying a lot, got the party marty resurfaces from the dead, and saves dana. Genial, I expected something to happen, as they put it clear that she would survive or not. But wait, how they managed to lose marty? Continuing, they enter the tomb, which is kind of a place for maintenance, has the lift, I think they get a good escape, arriving at the building, causing all the destruction.Now comes the second change, which is the main part of the displeasure of several reviews scattered around the internet. The fact is, okay they are invisible to the monsters distributed by the environment, that is the only premise that ensures a decent ending to the film. They escape, arriving in the rituals room, and it appears that woman, that must be some of the upstairs-guys, unarmed to talk? Please!! After the werewolf appears, then the little girl buckner, not being fulfilled the established ritual, arousing the anger of the elder gods, and it all ends in a spectacle of dreadful graphics effects (is so damn easy to make, they could have improved it). But, from another premise, that the gods have always existed, how they were regulated before? How were neutralized? I don't see this as a burden for me, but as a problem for the author.So, concluding this huge text, the film is well developed to the point where they begin to arise false assertions to ensure the end, without worrying about the "vision" of the viewer, breaking the mix of events. It had everything to be great, but eventually became a movie with obvious conclusions, without parts that cause fear, or bring smiles, with one thing or another original in its content. There are many things I would like to mention in this text, but as is already too big, it ends here. 5/10</fullReview>

Then it turned onto itself and more people died.(Bradley's self-prophesized death was a little too silly for me. It's the type that elicited a polite chuckle from the audience just cuz that particular audience is making an effort to like the movie.) To be honest, it really relied very much on the audience being a big horror genre fan for the extra kicks. But, I enjoyed it, it was a cute ride. I wished it was a bit more, but whatever, selfish teenagers ruined humanity. OK. Doesn't matter. I still think it was pretty cute.But then, something bothered me. They said all other rituals had failed in the world. But horror genre differs from culture to culture. And, the five archetype of sacrifices wouldn't have worked in the movie's own Japanese counterpart. There were no athlete, nor whore, and presumably everyone was virginal in the 9-years-old set up telecasted from Kyoto.I wished logic would just shut up sometimes when I'm watching horror. But then again, it's Joss Whedon, and his quirky, cute, grating, self-satisfied writing had ran its course by the end of the movie.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining romp with smart twists and incisive genre commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched The Cabin in the Woods last night. I meant to see it when it came out, but circumstances conspired against me, so I'm just now getting around to it. For better or worse, I had some preconceived notions going in, but I wish I could have had a clean viewing. I do think my expectations affected the experience somewhat. That being said, the movie is a lot of fun. Right from the opener with Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, we get a slightly different tone than usual. How many horror movies lead off with amusing banter amid the tedium of a (somewhat scientific-looking) corporate day-job? And really, for me, this tonal idiosyncrasy is what defined the movie. Unfortunately, it also limits the film somewhat, but not tremendously so. Without spoiling anything (because I wouldn't want to pass on those preconceived notions I mentioned) the movie is excellently written, the cast performs gamely, and the dialogue is sharp and enjoyable throughout. Classic horror tropes are toyed with, turned about, and molded anew. This is all great fun, but it's also relatively standard for horror satire. Where the film almost succeeds masterfully is with genuine horror-- actually generating scares. As with Shaun of the Dead, weaving real fear into the absurdity often proves a struggle, though both films give a noble effort. I'll also point out that this is where that initial tone and my preconceived notions may have colluded with the movie's mounting silliness to hold me back as a viewer (I can't stop thinking of one particularly drawn out scene where a large number of people are enjoying drinks while another person is horribly beaten in the background--it's hilarious, but not remotely frightening). In any event, it's an entertaining romp with a few smart twists that serves as an incisive commentary on the genre at large, particularly the more recent convention of introducing a cast full of unlikable characters as fodder for the primary antagonist(s). It also strikes me as the kind of movie that improves under the microscope of repeat viewings, as you catch more jokes and collect additional Easter Eggs.This one's a solid 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun and entertaining deconstruction of horror film tropes. If there's a problem, it's kind of like when a magician explains how a trick is done, which spoils the fun. Here, the horror elements are never scary, because you see the gears turning. We can normally suspend disbelief for 90 minutes and believe zombies are real, but not here. Second problem, Joss Whedon simply can't get out of his own way. He can't just do something clever, he has to stop every ten minutes and tell everyone how clever he is. It gets tiresome. So this is a fun ride, and often very funny, not scary, and the presence of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford is invaluable. (Jenkins has the best moment in the movie, screaming at a monitor, "Fuck you! Goddamnit Japan, how hard is it to kill nine-year-olds?!?" In context, this is very funny.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin In The Woods Has A Few Leaks In It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By today's standards, it has become kind of obvious that Hollywood is running short on original ideas, and part of the problem is that the industry is based on a predilection of ignoring and pretty much stone-walling struggling new writers with fresh ideas. If you look at the number of horror movies coming out these days, the majority of them are nothing bur remakes, sequels or new spins and incarnations of existing horror movies. You could say that there is only really around twelve to fifteen horror movie archetypes, but every once in a while, a movie comes around like "Cabin In The Woods" that takes its archetype and either re-invents it or twists it on its side. Set up with the general format of "The Evil Dead" or cabin-in-the-woods story, the movie centers around five college kids who vanish from society for a wasted weekend of debauchery, drugs and all the god awful anti-social stigma frowned upon in a normal rational society, but from behind the scenes they are being watched by what seems to be an advanced social experiment. Not a lot of details are wasted on the re-animated undead redneck slasher zombie family attacking the kids, although their invention hearkens back to every slasher/gore movie from "Friday The 13th" to "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." The main drive is centered on the two voyeurs and their company controlling the events. Immediately, one starts wondering what their agenda is. You start thinking they might be some sort of hidden camera series or a sociological experiment, but then the murders turn out to be real, and they start engineering details to keep the kids from escaping or leaving the confines of the plot. Once their main drive in seeing the kids murdered off is revealed though, a whole barrage of questions arise that make the movie that much more unbelievable. At the top is how in the world could one agency or corporation capture and contain so many potential paranormal and psychotic threats, and there are a lot of them. The majority of them can pretty much be separated or reduced down to their base core: ghosts, demons, undead, cryptids, psychos, mutants and alien entities. I mean, there is so many of them, it would take an entire website to describe and identify them all. Another thing, how does a simple thick glass prison (shades of the "Thirteen Ghosts" remake) contain the majority of them; what could possibly have been used as a deterrent to imprison the supernatural beings? Another unanswered question, why even have one switch in such an obvious accessible spot where just one irate employee or, in this case, one of the kids having sneaked into the facility could let everything loose at once. What is so laughable is that we see several of seemingly human psychos released who just walk through the carnage without getting attacked by the more powerful inhuman entities. (If Michael Myers or even Jack The Ripper crossed paths with Dracula or the living dead, psycho or not, they would be toast.) Is it just because they're wearing a costume? That is the true appeal and climax of the movie: seeing variations of every major and obscure horror character of other seventy years of cinema all at once in the movie from the Wolfman and zombies down to Pennywise the Clown and the Fifty-Foot Woman in one all-holds barred blood bath. That is why I liked this movie, and why it should appeal to aficionados of horror movies, even those purists who only care for haunted house movies or the deadheads who prefer slasher flicks. The only bad thing about "Cabin In The Woods" would be I don't see a sequel possibly coming out of this carnage, except maybe a prequel showing just how this agency captured and contained all these entities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror? No. Horror parody? Yes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cabin in the woods was a total disappointment. It's more like a horror parody than a horror movie. Does it scare? Nope. Does it entertain? A little. And that little comes only from not knowing the reason why everything is happening and from waiting to find out. Is it original? Yes, but it's boring anyway. That's because even if the idea behind it is good, the way it's developed is just silly. It doesn't take itself seriously and has a very cheap teen slasher feel to it. In the end you get some sort of big mess that is a mix between Evil Dead, the Truman Show and Scary Movie. It just doesn't work. Some of the visuals and effects are pretty good, and that's why I gave it 3 instead of 1. Probably the fact that the stoner in the movie has such a big part is not a coincidence. I think the only way you can enjoy this is if you are stoned off your head and your brain is not able to do much reasoning.Best to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Idea and A Cameo Added 1 Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a horror fan since my preteens, (I am now 71) and love a good comedy. But I don't like horror-comedy much, perhaps with the exception of "Night of The Creeps", because the purpose of horror is to scare the viewer and create suspense and terror. The comedy tends to undercut those emotions. "Cabin In The Woods" starts with a clever idea, that being some Corporate Biggies have created a setting to lure clichéd horror film types unknowingly into a fully technologically engineered location in the woods, to meet their deaths as sacrifices to an ancient group.As others have mentioned, there is some similarity in plot to "Scream", which to me was far superior to this mess. Also "The Midnight Meat Train" has some ideas in common, but that too was infinitely more terrifying and satisfying, at least to me. "Cabin" throws in every kind of monster or creature, one after the other, and gratuitous gore with generic dialog, and plenty of f-bombs. But I don't think I really laughed once, and almost never felt any terror or suspense, because it looked so derivative and even silly.The other thing that made this a two instead of one star was a cameo near the end by a highly respected actress (I won't say who) since while I checked the spoiler box, this was about the only thing I liked other than the concept. Way too long too, a mostly wasted hour and three quarters. A hundred jolts doth not a good horror movie make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weirdly Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the very beginning, it gave off a very cliché horror film scenario which was expected. At first I was hesitant to watch as I thought it wouldn't be to the expectation of an ordinary horror film, but it was so surprising. I thought that the film was going a bit to fast as everything was happening quite quickly but to the surprise of everyone, it's hard to tell how good this film is without spoiling as there is so much that goes on. There were parts that gave a scare and parts that were truly inventive and unexpected. This style of Horror is very entertaining and I would like to see similar films like this as it adds a new flavour to the genre.It's hard to say how amazing entertaining this film is but all I can say is that another story opens up that happens so suddenly that you wouldn't of anticipated in a horror. I highly recommend watching this film for new taste of the horror genre and be prepared to absolutely be confused and entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A whore, Shaggy from Scobby Doo, a racially ambiguous faux nerd, and a supposed virgin who's -- actually not. None of them have any redeeming characteristics; none of them would be particularly missed by society. In fact, forget the Gods, can I kill these people myself? The world is better off with monsters at the helm, assuming that they intend to annihilate both the film's creator and any critics who praised it.The occultist allusions, and the concept of human sacrifice for an elitist group's advancement are the sole interesting elements of the picture. Unfortunately those ideas are left unexplored in exchange for special effects and horror clichés that caused Freddy Krueger to walk out of the screening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redeeming qualities, but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Joss Wheedon fan, so I had pretty high expectations for this - and it just didn't live up to them. For a John Carpenter movie, this'd be pretty much middle of the road, and for a Ewe Boll flick, this would be a masterpiece, but it's not really up to Joss's usual standards.The single most disappointing part of the movie is the editing - much of the action is shown in dimly-lit, flash-cut closeups. The film editors, having seen all of the footage shot, know what's going on; they forget that the audience doesn't, and much of the action leaves the audience wondering what the heck just happened. This trend in cinematography is already longer-lived than it deserved; maybe Hollywood will get over the 'flash cuts cause excitement' nonsense and get back to telling the story, rather than manipulating the audience.Other than that, there was a new twist on an old genre, some good fun, some mystery to solve, some characters you could care about, and an unusual ending. Worth seeing, but don't expect a masterpiece, and accept that there's action that you won't quite be able to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film, didn't really enjoy it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really like this film and I don't think that many Horror film fans will enjoy it either as it is more of a comedy than a horror. I found the start to be a little too cliché. For example, 5 city kids going to a remote cabin in the countryside out of their comfort zone, the GPS not recognising their location, not having any mobile phone signal, etc. Although this film is part of the Thriller/Horror genre, I don't feel that it lives up to being a Thriller/Horror film as the narrative is average, the characters are too stereotypical as there is the 'whore', the alpha- male, the geek, the drug-addict and the virgin so it is predictable as to who dies/survives Also, another cliché that I found was that they die one by one, just like most other horror movies. I found the film to be quite confusing and hard to follow at times, especially during the ending as it was quite difficult to keep up with what was happening as it all seemed too busy. Another element I found to be confusing was the switching between two scenes as it didn't quite make sense to me. Overall, I give this film a rating of 5/10 mainly because it wasn't as good as the trailer made out to be and it was confusing but predictable. I don't recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average film, undeserved hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods was portrayed as your typical horror movie - but with a twist...However the twist that happens is one that is quite frankly disappointing and unimaginative. From the beginning it has all the main aspects of your standard horror film with little moments in the first hour that make you jump out of your seat (which is the essence of a horror movie) and the deaths that occur seem to be more humorous than horror, this may be down to a lack of blood and gore, as well as this you do not become attached to one single character or any character for that matter therefore the deaths are a mere sideshow to the actual plot. Despite all of this the movie has the core components of the characters in a horror movie: The whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool and the virgin. Although it seems brave by Goddard to change the general plot of the story and in which orders they die, the gamble seems to have not paid off. Furthermore the storyline seems slightly confusing and by the end of the film you are still asking yourself simple questions that should have been answered in the film.Overall I gave this a 5/10 simply because of the disappointing twist however the fact that the gods take over and wipe out the human race seems to balance this out and for me the ending seemed better than most the film put together as it contained comedy and horror perfectly intertwined. The big let-down is the hype surrounding this movie however I feel that if that burden of expectation was not there before then it would have seemed more impressive overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever hated horror film clichés? Check this out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading through the reviews trying to understand why some people would dislike this movie... some say the comedy and the horror stuff seems too nonsensical; others mentioned it was the worst movie they ever saw (I'll bet I could point them into really bad stuff :D); someone even mentioned this was a movie for Scream lovers... I disagree (I, for one, never liked Scream).Ever hated how predictable most horror films are and why it seems that the only way the plot works is because all the characters seem to be making an effort to get killed? Here it is not different... but it is. True, I don't think this is a movie for everyone, but it is full of redeeming qualities and, most of all, manages to feel fresh. If you're looking for a serious movie you should step back, this is not for you. I must admit that I loved the irony in the whole film; certain scenes will bring you a smile and seem out of touch, but it is a depiction of humanity that has lost touch with reality. And that makes it believable. If you love (and hate) horror movies, you should absolutely check this out. It's a good ride and worth the watch if you're not feeling up for a soul touching film and you're annoyed at horror films' predictability.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very knowing of horror history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past thirty or so years, the horror and science-fiction genre's of cinema have created vast armies of devotional fanatics, that they have somehow become somewhat powerful within the film making world. We now lovingly call them "fanboys", and as a public we view them as geeks. However, in the genre cinema world, their opinions, and attentions upon the minutia of a particular film, or film series, can sometimes alter the direction the film makers were originally going to take on the film. The horror genre is certainly one of these more scrupulously deconstructed filmic forms, perfectly illustrated with Wes Craven's Scream (1996 - 2011) films. But what The Cabin in the Woods does within this deconstructionist context, is to actually take a stab at criticising the level of involvement in the making of a film of the fanboy's, and their connection with keeping something almost uniform, such as if the "conventions" of a genre are changed, it becomes an issue for the gimpy-kids.Writer Joss Whedon and writer/director Drew Goddard have constructed a rather witty, and intelligent screenplay, that does everything within it's power to keep the conventions of a kids-go-to-the-woods horror movie. We follow five friends as they go to a remote cabin. They meet a desolate garage owner, who has no "gas". They begin acting within film- world stereotypes, and horror film images build. However, parallel to this action, we follow two white-collar workers begin their day at a production studio, pushing buttons at a console. These suit and collar workers structure, manipulate, and construct the horror narrative, making sure that every detail adheres to the set conventions.OK, so it could be argued that this is simply another criticism of reality television, and another apocalyptic view of our future entertainment. I would have to say that it is a little more complex than that notion. Whilst the films poster visualises a mechanical nature of this "puzzle house", the films secrets do not fully expose themselves to the climax. With many, many references to other horror films, - The Evil Dead (1982), gets the most - and a finale that will have horror fans delighted (if somewhat perplexed if they "get" it). The script is very knowing of horror history, and manages to maintain interest throughout, despite its more metaphysical concept. It's also good to see that Joss Whedon is finally getting the opportunity to flex his more cinematic muscles, instead of his usual relegation to television.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in the Woods is refreshing, complex, wicked, and its final act is the dream of every horror fan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: The Cabin in the Woods is refreshing, complex, wicked, and its final act is the dream of every horror fan. 94/100 (A-)Directed by Drew Goddard and starring Fran Kranz and Kristen Connolly, The Cabin in the Woods is definitely the best horror film of 2012, not only for its excellent reviews, it's the horror film of the year for its refreshing and original screenplay that revolutionized the horror genre. Although it has a slow start and the first 35 minutes are character development, the whole film was quite interesting. The characters were likable and friendly. Also, it is a very confusing and strange flick, but do not worry, everything made sense at the end.It was complex as hell and is difficult not to spoil it, but I will try. The direction was superb, the writing and the actions of the characters were smartly written and the movie is filled with lots of epic twists and memorable moments. It's not more of the same crap, everything in the film feels so fresh and original. The performances were amazing and effective. Shout out here to Fran Kranz, he's definitely the star of the film, he makes us laugh again and again, his performance was excellent. He's so underrated. It's sad that Chris Hemsworth gets all the attention and he's not even the protagonist of the movie.The rest of the cast was hilarious and extremely likable too. Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford and Amy Acker were terrific and they added some weird humor to the film. It was made with a budget of $40 million and that is very high for a horror flick, I believe that half of the budget was used in the last 30 minutes. They were truly impressive, believe the hype. In addition, I want to add that the special effects were just good enough, do not expect mind- blowing or extremely-realistic effects. The horror genre needs more movies like this one, I mean horror films with a decent budget.On the upside, the CGI was good enough, it has unexpected twists, comedy, tension, and gore; mostly in the last act. The second half was a bloody explosion of horror, there was a perfect balance between scares and comedy. It is a must see if you love the horror genre or if you want to watch something so messed up and different; seriously, it exceeded my expectations and it is not overrated at all. See it if you want surprises or violence, also if you want to laugh out loud. On the downside, some of the jump-scares were unnecessary and predictable, but that's my only issue with the film. I can't wait to buy it! (A-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie that makes fun of the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its part horror and part comedy. Some time mid movie it changes tones and shows you what is really going on, making you take a step back and realize how silly monsters can be from a certain perspective. For example, would you be afraid of monsters if they were under your own absolute control? The reason I liked it is because it reminded me a lot of dreams as I grew up. Like most kids, when i was young, I used to get nightmares but at some point (probably by Jr. high) I started realizing when I was dreaming and all of a sudden the scary Pinhead or Freddy became irrelevant within my own dream because I knew I controlled them (and they quickly changed to well endowed women...). This is how this movies advances. Its like a coming of age movie for horror lovers. They give hints about what is going on during the movie but it starts to come together towards the end and it was fun to watch the chaos. Some younger viewers might find some parts scary, but by the end everyone should be cheering for the monsters.- Side note -Most of the low reviews here score the movie based on silly things like not getting scared (or gasp... plot holes in a horror flick lol) during the movie. Well, did it ever occur to you people that maybe, you are older now and its not as easy to be surprised or scared in a horror movie? Get used to it. I had a bad habit of sneaking into the kitchen after everyone was asleep and watching horror movies on late night TV. I saw so many, that I am practically immune to horror hijinks like sudden scares, gore, tension or death. Of course, at the time, these movies gave me nightmares but I was only 4th grade (and I loved the adrenaline rush) but now I am 38. No horror movie has scared me since Hellraiser I. So to grade a movie on the fact that it didn't scare me would not be fair. Does one rate a kids movie as bad because they are no longer a kid? I hope not.</fullReview>

I know i'm going to have to put this is the spoiler section but I was really rooting for the two guys controlling the cabin. I really hope they make more movies based on the other item they can use to resurrect the evil creatures. maybe the people in charge of the facility will give them one more chance and this time they get it right.

It's not often I go with a horror movie, but I am glad I did. I found the story intriguing and was curious throughout of just what was going on. Sure the acting wasn't great and the story was lacking at times, but I would say this movie is definitely worth watching at least once. For me it really wasn't scary, but there were a few spots the caught me off guard... It was original, all be it a tad cheesy at times, and I thought the ending was kind of cool. So with that being said it's not going down as one of my favorite movies but I could see myself watching this one again on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The appeal of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre lost its originality years ago. With the exception of few refreshing movies ("The Descent", "Rec", "Amer", original "Saw"), it's comprised of remakes, sequels, and multiple reiterations of the same themes done in the same way. Yet people still watch horrors. It's like there's some kind of need for brutality and gruesomeness. Can it be that getting scared and seeing other people die makes us feel more alive? "The Cabin in the Woods", a new horror directed by Drew Goddard from a script by himself and Joss Whedon, seems to think so and takes that premise to the extreme.Five friends are going on a trip to some cabin deep in the woods to spend a fun weekend far from all kinds of commitment, people, and civilization in general. That sounds like a standard horror plot, but what neither they nor we know is that it's also as far from truth as it can be. The movie opens with two guys in some kind of office building going about their daily routine and seeming pretty indifferent about their jobs. It will turn out their job is much more serious than it looks in the beginning. From there we go to the friends packing for the trip and as we're watching them connections between the two are gradually revealed. Since the movie can't be properly discussed without an abundance of spoilers anyway, I'll just briefly explain the plot. In the earth beneath us live ancient gods who demand sacrifice or they'll destroy us all. So the rituals are created all over the world to appease the gods. What we see in the movie is basically one such ritual, with five people being killed to save us all. But as in any ritual there's a procedure that must be followed, and here comes the fantastic homage to horror genre. The characters are given a chance of survival, but that chance is only illusory as there is a whole crew modifying their surroundings, just like in a horror movie. So it's like watching a movie and behind-the-scenes simultaneously. There are also specific roles for each character: the whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool, and the virgin. And, of course, they must all be young. They also must choose the weapon of their destruction by themselves, so in the cellar of the cabin they are introduced to a whole bunch of creepy and mysterious objects each representing one kind of monster the crew from the "office building" has at their disposal. Another parallel with the movie-making business.But the movie goes far beyond the homage to horror genre. It actually speaks about the end of humanity and what would we do to stop it. One of the most horrifying things is the easiness with which the crew responsible for the ritual does their job. And yet it is one that is so human. We as a species survive by adapting to circumstances (if we can't change them) and excluding emotions. At the same time we want to differentiate ourselves from other animals and have notions like fairness, nobility or friendship. All of those instincts and notions come together in this bizarre fight between the two groups of people. One being immoral and cruel for sacrificing people and the other being selfish for putting themselves before the whole world. Sort of collectivism vs. individualism battle with no definite answer.On top of all that layers "The Cabin in the Woods" functions as a great horror, creating suspense and scaring us with more than just cheap tricks, and also as a great comedy in its behind-the-scenes segment. The credit for that goes to all the cast and crew. The acting is simply fantastic. From Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth and Fran Kranz as part of the five friends to brilliant performances by Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins as those pulling the strings. All the other elements like cinematography, editing, music and production design are flawless and brought together by Goddard's assured debut direction. But the thing that rises above all else is the screenplay. What Goddard and Whedon have written is simply amazing. The originality of the idea, the beauty of the dialogue, the perfect balance between the two sides of the story, it just makes you want to watch it again and again. At least it did that for me."The Cabin in the Woods" is a movie about horrors, a horror about movies, a comedy about human sacrifice, a thriller about five people in the woods, a story about the end of the world, and above all an excellent piece of work that gets even better with each subsequent viewing. So be sure to watch it more than once. Who knows, maybe next time they will finally choose the merman.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is a bit like marmite; you either love it or hate it. It uses the typical people, a boyfriend and girlfriend, a stoner, a virgin and a boy who start to have a romance, just like every movie they throw in a pointless romance. It's meant to be a horror and a comedy and the only thing about it that was comical was the things the stoner came out with but apart from that I don't see the point in it being either, it's a bit silly and confusing but saying that, the way Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon used a cabin in the forest/woods was a clever but typical setting for a horror, as many people associate the woods with ghosts, zombies and the unknown. If it wasn't for the build up music and the loud sudden bangs, this wouldn't be a horror movie;they're the only thing that made it that. Otherwise it would've looked like a few zombies chasing some people. Having watched this movie twice I still think the ending of the movie was poor as it had nothing to do with what the film was about and altogether the film is just over rated.</fullReview>

I am not joking folks this is the movie where you will find whatever you ever liked in any horror movie.....name out few (evil dead, all zombies movies, silent hill and whatever in your mind). Though the plot is quite simple and if you will go to this movie with light mood you will surely like this one. Special effects are good and acting is fair from these folks. In the beginning you will find out this movie is yet another teen horror flick but wait for the bet (i will not spoil the suspense)and you will get so deep in the plot. But few things poorly executed and i am being fair to say that the trend and intellectualism of today's movie's gore. But the whole idea is very good and suspenseful. Its a mix combination of all scary movies and ghost and haunting which i am sure you already seen here and there and like always in the end you will explore the intensity of story and forget/forgive what director missed out on your movie pallet. Go guys if you need some good light sex, suspense, gore, ghost, zombies, mermaids, cobra, blood sucking huge bats........list is very long. I am giving it 8 out of 10 but i bet you will be entertained.</fullReview>

The storyline is retarded and the only reason that I gave this two stars was because it had a unique twist at the end but believe me when I tell you that this movie is sooo lame. With a $30,000,000 budget THAT'S ALL THEY COULD COME UP WITH? I mean the creature special effects and acting is pretty decent but that's about it...the movie could've been so much better if the writers would've elaborated on the story and not spent so much time on leaving the audience in the dark watching teenie boppers parade around like idiots. I remember sitting there watching it thinking to myself "what in the world is going on in this movie?" The movie could've been better...just saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe because this film had been billed as a "Game Changer" I was expecting a little more.In my opinion one of the key elements to a successful horror/slasher movie is that it needs to be marginally believable - this very definitely isn't.It compliments the horror genre with so many references to bygone classics - but I'm not sure that was really necessary.I found myself trying to analyse the film the whole way through and work out what was going on - that spoilt it for me and left me disappointed with the ending. I was waiting for a sharp twist that didn't come instead it was more like a gentle turn - BORING!. That said - I think the story would have suited a comic book or animation a lot better.The casting was okay, without Chris Hemsworth and Sigourney Weaver my vote would have been a 4 out of 10. I did like the idea of the "shaggy-esque" anti hero though.In summary - it wasn't a waste of ?10. I left the cinema pondering why this film was made. I just hope this isn't a catalyst for more of the same. "COULD HAVE DONE BETTER"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods (2011) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Horror-comedy with a familiar location (scary cabin in scary woods) with familiar characters (virgin, slut, pothead, athlete, brain) but with one major twist. The least you know the better so let's just say that five people go to a mysterious cabin in the woods and soon they're attacked by monsters. I must admit that it's been a very long time since a horror film made me think but that's exactly what THE CABIN IN THE WOODS did. I was thankful that I had a thirty-minute drive home because that would give me time to think about the film. It's strange because I enjoyed so much about the movie but in the end when the credits began to role it just didn't work for me. I thought all five actors were extremely good as were Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. I thought the special effects were pretty good once everything got going. I thought the atmosphere in the woods was very authentic and I thought there were a couple good, old-fashioned jump scenes that really worked. I even thought several bits of the comedy worked including the various jokes with the pothead. Even the big twist that I won't ruin was an interesting spin on the familiar subject matter. So, why did I enjoy the film more? In the end I just don't think all these different things came together for a complete movie. Yes, I respect the filmmakers a great deal for trying something new and I give them a lot of credit for not delivering your typical slasher but at the same time I just felt it went overboard in the final act. We're given an explanation for what we're watching but this too didn't work for me. I actually thought the best moments in the picture is when they go for straight terror and this happens in the woods as our five victims are being stalked. For the sake of the film I won't ruin what monsters attack them but they're very effective. Perhaps a second viewing would help. Again, it's strange to enjoy so much about a movie and not come away liking it more but THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is just the type of film that I respect more than I actually enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains spoilers!I don't normally review but this film annoyed me enough to write something. This could have been a hugely enjoyable - the two technicians, Jenkins and Whitford, provide a virtual light relief to the by-the-numbers teen slasher set. The idea is quality- take a routine teen slasher and make it the Truman Show. The problem is not with the concept, the problem is feeling excessively cheated by a poor ending. The whole film build on the ethos 'The ancient Ones' need appeasing. So instead of a teen slasher you now have a chuck a virgin in the volcano scenario. In defence of the film, the whole sub level scenes are truly inspired but it's too late to save the plot. My biggest issues with this film- firstly the only actual 'jump' moments are the ones that have been scripted a million times before, i.e. turn around and the monster is stood there, standing with your back to a window etc. The second issue is with the idea that the Ancient Ones have a penchant for teen slasher films, even deciding the order in which the jock, nerdy girl etc get bumped off. So as long as these gods get to see their own custom made low budget teen slasher the world is spared and we get saved a large CGI hand busting out the ground to smite everyone. The best thing about the ending was Nine Inch Nails providing exit music. I'm sure there will be loads of people who will say, "but that's the point! it's meant to be clichéd." Fine but then the parts that aren't clichéd deliberately need to be deviously ingenious to make up for it and this falls short. At least this won't be turned into a franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (2012) *** Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, Brian White, Amy Acker, (Cameo: Sigourney Weaver) The eponymous genre flick gets itself turned inside out in this at times too-cool-for-its-own-school underpinnings from filmmakers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard : five stereotypical young adults venture into the secluded topiary where upon visiting the abandoned edifice ?.well let's just say things start to happen and then ?things?really?start?to..HAPPEN! While the clever premise gets giddy in its final act where the collective horror ya-yas are set loose (literally) there is little terror and more in the line of show-me-how-you-can-top-THIS ethos, the expectations high eventually plateaus but those-in-the-know fanboys/girls will eat this up begging for more. Kudos to Kranz as the clear-eyed stoner getting in touch with his inner Shaggy in this long-form SCOOBY-DOO meets THE EVIL DEAD by way of a cosmic Rubik's cube plotting.</fullReview>

Lemmings see the high score and are scared to say they don't like it, for fear of being told they are mentally slow. I couldn't wait to see this. Good horror movies are hard to find and having heard the nods towards 'evil dead' and seeing the high ratings...I couldn't wait.Finally got to see this the other night and...what a let down.Comedy you say? Well, excuse me whilst my sides split. I didn't laugh once.Horror? About as scary as Scooby Doo.In fact about as intelligent as Scooby Doo.In fact this IS an episode of Scooby Doo with gore.The acting was 'B' movie standard and I couldn't stick it out. I tried but with 10 mins or so to go..I was bored and a bit confused. I knew that these kids were being sacrificed to some kind of demon by the lab dudes but I didn't care.The movie just became more and more ridiculous and not in a good way.Some critics bang on about the movie being on 3 levels of the gods are us, the audience. That the control room is the directors and blah blah blah. Who cares? It's an awful movie! If I made a movie with a 'deep' (lol) meaning but the movie was total plop...you fools would lap it up!This is not a time for beard scratching and trying to find deep meanings. This is Scooby Doo. Next they'll tell us that Dumb and Dumber is actually about the thoughts of north Korean political prisoners during the 80's.For those saying only those with an IQ of over 80 will like it....never in my life have I heard such sanctimonious piffle. YOU ARE THE FOOLS!Those who fooled many of us into watching this garbage should refrain from reviewing movies on here and take up a new hobby like base jumping or something really, really dangerous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin and the death of parody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason Cabin in the Woods fails is that it isn't any longer possible to parody a genre which has been sending itself up for years. Cabin doesn't believe, like Scary Movie, that merely quoting another film is terribly funny, but it isn't able, either, to successfully apply satire to horror tropes, since audiences already fully appreciate their absurdity. So what we're left with has all the entertainment-value of a long-winded analysis of a joke. In the process of deconstructing the modern horror, Cabin loses all structural integrity and its only resolution can be a bathetic self-destruction. There are snappy one-liners and a few original ideas but mostly Cabin just preaches to the converted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admired the concept but the film as a whole fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm pretty disappointed about this film. The first hour was bland to say the least with only the scenes involving the two geezers in the white shirts making me intrigued. But even then, i felt if the humour had been turned up a little bit to much. When it came to the last third of the film, i began to love it. However, my mood fluctuated once more when it came perfectly clear in the last ten minutes how the film was going to end. The reasoning behind the whole concept of the cabin left a sour taste in my mouth.The actors in the film were annoying. The dude with the Bong was unfunny and wished for him to die first. My decree of death swifted over too the blond girl who spent her time futilely making out with a wolf and dancing around in tiny shorts. Yes, I know the whole reason behind the characters but this doesn't change my opinion. The main lead was boring and the geek was invisible for most parts.Another annoying factor is the use of the wrong killers. When I saw what was available too kill, i frowned and thought ' why the hell did they choose the boring zombies and not the monster with blades around his head.' But being in a Cabin, i suppose Zombies makes perfect sense.If you are expecting a typical horror film, then you will enjoy this and will most certainly become baffled about the amount of jokes being told by geezers inside a control room. Ardent Horror fans will love it as it's basically a homage to all horror films and will appreciate the ending.I can praise the concept and the whole idea but i couldn't help but wish they would take out the humour, make it broodier and darker, and create better characters. But then, i'm surely taking out all the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted so badly to love this movie but just ... didn't. I think part of the problem is that A Cabin in the Woods (ACITW) is seriously mismarketed as a horror film when really, it's never scary and I'm not sure it's even trying to be. I'm not going to recount the plot because either you know it or you don't, in which case I don't want to ruin it. I'll just talk about what worked and what didn't (for me).The concept was very clever and I really appreciated that the film was willing to go so far off the reservation. There is a scene of utter Lovecraftian mayhem at the end that almost made the entire film ... you WILL know it when you see it! The performances are uniformly strong and the film looks good and it's well-shot. I admired the film's ambition and attempt to deliver something we haven't seen before.That said ... I felt that ACITW was more of a gimmick than a movie and for that reason I was never truly engaged in the story. The traditional horror elements failed to deliver what I like about horror: namely suspense and atmosphere. And the "twist" was somewhat predictable, stupid, and full of plot holes. There is a difference between knowingly recycling genre clichés and actually having something credible and new to say about them. ACITW never really seemed to get this distinction, and as a result it came across as a movie made by people who don't particularly understand or like the horror genre.Part of the problem is that I've reached the saturation point with these meta-exercises and after a while it almost seems like a cop-out. There are plenty of horror deconstructions out there (Scream, Behind the Mask: the Rise of Leslie Vernon, Shaun of the Dead, etc.). ACITW is better than some of them, not as good as others. Overall though it isn't any more insightful or clever than any of these similar films.I really don't want to dump all over this film because it has it's moments and if it leads some younger viewers to seek out the first Evil Dead or read some H.P. Lovecraft that's a good thing. And it definitely has more to offer than yet another half-baked remake. But I still can't help but think that the filmmakers should've just made an honest to god legitimately good and original horror movie, instead of taking the easy way out - recycling other movies and painting it all with an ironic gloss. Again, that final segment of the film finally goes balls out and finally delivers something we've never seen before. It's a shame I had to sit through so much of the same old crapola to get there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting yet slightly disappointing 'meta' horror film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lab guys try to shoehorn their subject matters into their own idea of what a horror film is and they get it right (just about) to start with. Luckily their test subjects are dumb enough to fall for their tricks but not without having to tweak their environment somewhat to force them to split up or venture out into the darkness alone. The lab guys could be like modern horror or 'torture porn' directors; gore loving creeps. Their lab sterile and detached from the violence they themselves are directing. They joke about the horrors happening on their display screens and even hold betting games based on them.The puppets used in the sarcastic techies real life 'film' are pretty dumb but not as dumb as the techies would like them to be (cause this is 'real' life (see how meta this all is) and in real life people just don't go down into the basement on their own). The players in this strange game cant be manipulated as effortlessly as the lab guys would like (the techies are old and incompetent, maybe bored of their jobs, maybe just careless) and the players finally brake the 'game' and make their way into the inner-workings of it and finally end the 'film' and the world in the process.Perhaps what the makers of cabin in the woods are partly trying to say is that if the people in horror films acted like they would do in real life then the film simply would not work or would be too complex and may well bore the audience. They could be making a point about the horror audience dumbing down, possibly. They might also have been trying to make the point that the horror genre is getting old and the cheap tricks they use are boring and we are in need of a change in style.I don't think the cabin in the woods is 'that' film. It is no game changer because it is not a horror film. It is fun purely as a mind f**ck but delivers hardly any scares as the horror actually happening on screen seems like it is being observed by someone and then us so we are detached from the action. The cabin in the woods also falls into the same traps as the horrors it is trying to mock or homage. A girl is attacked by a zombie for 5 minutes and mauled horribly by a werewolf but not only survives (covered head to toe in deep red blood) but jokes and smiles with her friend as the world comes to an end. And the worst thing about all the hypocrisies in the film is that they can easily be excused by some as being parody moments. I cant forgive them so easily. I understand and enjoy many of the metaphors and the references but I would have liked the main characters to have struggled and acted more realistically. Maybe it just goes to show that it is simply impossible in horror films for realistic behaviour to be shown due to the totally unrealistic nature of zombies and werewolves (sorry if you believe in zombies and werewolves). But this is not a horror film and the reactions could have been thought out better and in my mind could have helped to make more of a point about the nature of horror films.The film is a lot of fun though, especially in its final half hour and held my interest throughout but it is not as honed as I would have liked it to be. This could have been something else, something of a real game changer. If they tightened the logic and upped the action in the first half and instead of boring zombies we had a whole host of evils being released by accident upon the unsuspecting students it could have been extra special. Meta-special...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love horror movies, and I also love Whedon, and also enjoyed Cloverfield, done by Goddard. Combine the three and I was giddy from the go. I do remember the first time I saw the trailer I was intrigued but a little skeptical, but now having seen the film, I understand the trailer more. It's hard to talk too much about the movie without giving away something so I'll keep this short. The marketing campaign, I'm not sure if it was done as best as possible, as it tends to market it as purely horror when the movie is clearly more black comedy. That isn't to say that horror fans will be left in the dust, much the opposite, as there are so many elements that hardcore horror fans will love.An original horror movie, it will make you laugh, it will make you wonder what the hell is going on, and it will delight you. It reminds me much of Scream in the style of writing and some of the story, it definitely has some commentary going on, which is one of the reason why I think horror fans will like it.</fullReview>

Absolutely not your run of the mill teenage slasher movie!! Hard to say much more without spoiling the truly bizarre and unique plot of this well made film. Well shot, very well written. Every horrific nightmarish ghoul you could possibly come up with and just enough humor thrown in so you are not pushed too far over the edge. Not for the really squeamish or feint of heart.

In reading from a book they then inadvertently summon a family of zombie killers. However, they've only just scratched the surface of what the cabin is hiding.Pleasantly surprised, but ultimately disappointing. Was expecting your average (i.e. crap) horror movie but for the first 60% or so of the movie it was very interesting. Intriguing, engaging and, most surprising, funny. From a point, however, it degenerates into your usual humans-vs- ghouls/zombies schlock, and from then on it is incredibly formulaic and tiresome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood and Lore: Cabin is a Revisionist Take on Scary Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1985 film "Fright Night", Roddy MacDowall's hammy veteran of vampire films makes a self-aware observation that informs the proceedings of 2011's "Cabin in the Woods": "Nobody wants to see vampire killers... or vampires (anymore)... Apparently all they want to see are demented madmen running around in ski-masks, hacking up young virgins." If someone unexposed to horror films from the past 35 years or so were to watch a marathon of several of these films back to back--and let's say none of them were sequels--how many would it take before he or she began to predict what's going to happen next? For an American film audience that has by now endured the irony-heavy Scream franchise and the gloomily anti-ironic spate of "torture porn" from directors like Eli Roth and others, can there truly be any genuine shocks in horror anymore? "Cabin in the Woods" film attempts to answer that question with a wink and a nod."Cabin" features five college-aged protagonists, each fitting a certain stock cliché to be found in assorted horror films. There's the jock and de facto leader (Chris Hemsworth), the dumb blonde (Anna Hutchison), the nerd (Jesse Williams, who also serves as his group's token minority), the druggie (Fran Kranz) and the nice girl (Kristin Connolly). The slight twist is, not all of the characters inhabit these roles from the get-go, but are manipulated into them.A creepy gas station attendant (is there any other kind in these films?) gives an oblique warning--to the students and the audience--as the quintet heads up to the titular cabin for a weekend of unsupervised fun. Before the film is over, threads from Deliverance, Friday the 13th, Ju-On/The Grudge and more are touched on in various depths. The Saw films, which are already on their seventh (or is that VIIth) installment, are also clipped for some thematic DNA.The film was co-written by Joss Whedon ("Marvel's The Avengers") and directed by Drew Goddard--the latter of whom wrote and directed several episodes of Whedon's "Buffy" and "Angel" TV series as well as the conspiracy-heavy TV drama Lost. Both collaborators bring a satirical sensibility to this horror entry. Cabin reveals its core conceit in its opening scenes (though less-knowing viewers may be hard-pressed to connect the dots early on), and so perhaps the film has less bite (pun intended) than it would have were it to wait until later. Still, the twists, when they happen, are more intriguing than draining, especially by the climax, which manages to be nihilistic and liberating at the same time.Cabin functions as a witty indictment and an apology of sorts for the clichés of contemporary horror cinema and the slasher subgenre in particular. Depending on how cynical the viewer is, the only way to really ruin this experience would be to have a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first part of the movie was OK and has your average teens heading out on a trip and meeting your average creepy gas station guy. There isn't very much background on the teens, so it is difficult to connect with them on an emotional level. The movie gets interesting in the middle, but then toward the last third it plummets in believability and "realism" and becomes completely non-plausible. It has minimal imagination stirring elements, since the physical aspects of what is happening are dreadfully impossible. It seems that there is an orchestrated reality show going on in which the teens are entrapped and then slowly killed off, but how they got there, why, the reasons for their demise and the background of why this program exists are extremely blurry, confusing and hard to follow. The movie ends with a really sucky CG scene of a large hand with no back story destroying everything. All in all this is the second worst movie I have ever wasted time on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heading out to a cabin in the woods, a group of friends finds that their actions have stirred a dark, evil presence nearby and must try to fight for their lives only to learn of a far greater threat within.This was quite a fun and enjoyable entry that has a lot of really fun things about it. One of the better elements to this one is the fact that there's just enough comedy here to play this off as a parody yet still be taken completely seriously. Because this one is so heavily built around clichés and utilizes them to their fullest extent here really drives this one not only by partaking in the clichés but then offering a rather unique take on that need for the clichéd nature of these prototypical stories. This in turn drives up the rather ingenious storyline here where it builds on these types and then sets them into action against numerous enemies as this one kicks in with some rather dark and chilling takes on the prototypical killer-in-the-woods types. Not only is this section of the film pretty dark, creepy and packed with plenty of chilling encounters but it also runs through some rather ingenious moments to keep this one going along quite nicely throughout as there's enough action and gore here to really satisfy here. Unfortunately, what doesn't work here is everything after that point which is the last half-hour of the film as this delves into an over-developed and needless exploration of what's going on that's not in the slightest bit clever, original or worthwhile. Trying to hide behind tons of gory bloodshed doesn't help disguise the fruitless endeavor this tries to undertake all in the name of trying to be original or clever and never is all that enjoyable for it. This isn't enough to really knock this down, but it's enough to lower this slightly.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language, Nudity and continuous drug use.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious Send-Up and Fitting Tribute to the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what I was expecting, but Cabin in the woods wasn't it. It was a hundred times more awesome. It starts just like any other horror movie. No, make that every other horror movie. Five teens, including a jock, a slut, a stoner, a nerd, and a shy pretty girl head for a weekend of partying at a remote cabin none of them has ever been to before. And it's not long before they realize that something is very, very wrong, and that there's no way out and no-one to save them.So yeah, it sounds like another clichéd horror clone, except that it's not. Because Joss Whedon doesn't do hackneyed formula movies. That's why from the very beginning, Cabin in the Woods jams in every horror cliché in existence, dials them up to eleven, slathers on the comic relief, and turns the whole thing on its head. And the result is oddball, over the top, blood soaked, side splitting, and made of pure win.Cabin follows a fairly standard three part arc, which is just about the only standard thing about it. In the first act the setting is established, the characters do all the stupid things people in a horror movie should never do, and not so subtle hints of what's to come are dropped. In act two, evil is awakened and teenagers begin dying in grisly fashion, at a rate that makes you wonder if the movie will reach the one hour mark. And then the third act takes everything in a direction that only Whedon could have come up with.Without giving anything away, the important thing to understand is that there are bigger things at work than a few teens and zombies. There are powerful players with global reach watching their every move and manipulating every event, but they're actually not that bad once you get to know them. And that's part of the brilliance of Cabin in the Woods, the combination of seemingly mismatched elements that work together to create outrageousness and hilarity; graphic violence and stoner wisdom, evil conspiracies and office parties, zombies and werewolves plus unicorns and the sugar plum fairy.The other thing that makes Cabin brilliant is that it's the antithesis of Scary Movie. It's a smart satire that actually skewers the common elements of American (and occasionally Japanese) horror movies instead of just making references and fart jokes. It takes all the old clichés, deconstructs them, and has a lot of fun doing it. When it does make references, they're clever and often subtle. And it has a plot that matters and makes sense. Plus it's not just a great comedy; it's a competent horror film with sudden shocks, gruesome deaths, and moments of real terror.This was one of the most original and entertaining movies I have seen in a very long time. As horror comedies go it may even be better than Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead, though I admit that's up for debate. All I know is that I could not stop laughing, and the ending had me holding my sides, then cheering, then doing an air guitar solo. (When you see it you'll understand why.) This movie is pure unadulterated awesomeness. If a friend asks if you want to watch Scary Movie or whatever exorcism movie is coming out this month, bring this one instead.</fullReview>

Judging from the trailers, one can pick up the basic premise of the movie: Several young adults going to a Cabin in the Woods that is being run by a testing facility that will try to control their decisions to play out horror movie tropes.The interesting thing about The Cabin in the Woods is that it is surprisingly predictable. You pretty much know what's going to happen next. You can tell that certain characters that are fleshed out are going to survive and that the simplistic and "boring" characters will die. However, I will say that it is still a very entertaining movie.The nice thing about this movie is that its premise is very outlandish and part of its humor comes from irony and the very "business" like aspects of the film. The movie literally reuses classic horror movie tropes and explains that the reason those tropes exist is because it is all run by the same organization that tries to play out specific scenarios.It is hard to review this movie without revealing too much. The Cabin in the Woods is definitely an entertaining movie for horror movie fans and it has some clever ideas. However, the movie isn't ingenious by any means. It is simply a fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Either you think its a 10 or 0 There are some here that just don't get a fun horror movie. They think its above them or they have no need to laugh at parodies.Um you aren't clever for seeing common horror plot themes - as that was the point!! Its like being sarcastic, and someone pointing out its incorrect. NO DUH IDIOT - talk about being the smartest child in the room filled with down syndrome!Those that rated it a 10, understand the jokes and the parodies. This is an awesome movie, fun at many turns, a few odd surprises that all leads up to a simple explosion of anything and everything you can think of at the end. Those that don't get it, are simply idiots and more likely boring. You'd want to spend about 5 minutes with them and then leave their company in avoidance of wasting your life. They are the type that think the Rocky horror picture show is strange and silly, or think that Raising Arizona isn't funny. They simply don't get it - They never will.This is a definitely a cult movie. People who don't like horror movies will even like this one, and may cringe a little, but then laugh when all hell breaks loose. Bring popcorn !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The fantastic "The Cabin in the Woods" (2012) is a surprise-filled movie that is difficult to review without spoilers ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... so I can't say much about it. Suffice to say, I really, really liked it ? I'd give it a 9 out of 10.This is a smart, inventive film that is probably the most creative thing I've seen in a long time ? it's safe to say that I've never seen anything like it. Do yourself a favor and avoid news articles or websites like IMDb.com ? you'll enjoy this much more if you know little about it.It actually takes a while to get going. I had a lukewarm response to this movie for maybe its entire first half. The end ? which brings together a surprising number of story elements (I really can't say more) ? really redeemed it. The buildup to that ending is a lot of things that have long been established as horror clichés. But that's intentional, as screenwriter Drew Goddard and producer Joss Whedon made it, I think, partly as a parody and partly as an homage to the genre.A few caveats ? if you've been looking forward to this movie for a while, as I have, you're aware that it was very well reviewed. But I'm pretty sure it got so much praise because it was creative and original ? not because it was the best HORROR movie ever made. The central plot device is too contrived and fantastic to be really frightening, and the movie is too self-aware to allow us to forget it's just a movie. Parts of it were disturbing, but there's just too much humor to make this a truly scary movie. You're not sitting down to "The Exorcist" or "The Shining."Also, various reviews seem to indicate a twist that is impossible to guess. This isn't true. Horror fans ? especially fans of a certain subgenre ? will know the big reveal before the halfway mark, especially if they listen to the dialogue of the story's antagonists. Hell, I was just talking about it with another aspiring horror writer just the other day. Don't expect a surprise on the level of "The Sixth Sense" or "Unbreakable."Still, this was a hell of a lot of fun. And what a GREAT Halloween movie it would make!! It would also be fun to watch back-to-back with "Cabin Fever" or one of the "Evil Dead" movies, given their similar settings.http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this movie but it is truly the weirdest movie I've ever watched. There is something new every second and you wouldn't get bored at all. They can make many sequels of it and in each one there will be a new twist. The movie begins like all road trip horror movies in an RV driving in an unknown road to find themselves at an abandoned gas station with a creepy owner but no, as they continue driving and enter the tunnel, you will for sure know that this movie has a very different and twisted plot than the stereotyped road trip movies. " Won't say anything more, watch it for yourself " :P The movie has many weird and unexplained scenes but this what makes it thrilling, but it's not really scary and there are no horrifying scenes at all, they might be shocking but not scary " for me at least".I really hoped that at the end that all of this was kinda a virtual video game or something and and when it's over, everything will go back the same but unfortunately it wasn't.So, great movie, well executed but I wished that the end was different as it is a bit selfish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the greatest achievement of accountable film can be considered that the enthusiasm with which all instantly remembered Wes Craven. Still, after our guinea painfully similar to the one that has given us in 1996, the "father" Freddie, but there it was, on closer inspection it turns out that some mutated monster, though, and was loved by the audience. Wes and to this genre often scoffed at, even the above- mentioned maniac from the world of dreams was in his own black sheep among his colleagues. Well, that was not in it the pattern, and a framework in which it seems to be possible to push it, he cut miracle hairdresser thought, or cooking - as you will be pleased. But with all this, the creation of Mr. Craven vengeance mocked genre, but nevertheless remained in it without losing face, but rather sitting on a high ledge jiving and mocked like that never grew out of a simple excision teenagers. With all the same deliberate carelessness "Scream" and "Nightmare on Elm Street", it is impossible not to recognize their contribution and impact on popular cinema: as it turns out, can be removed as part of the genre, giggling over the rules and laws, jumping and rejoicing in its awkwardness. Paradox? Yes, and that they are fine. Not even very successful "Scream 4" has shown that the case of murder of young people with a claim for a Darwin Award, you can once again be extended beyond, and along the way to make fun of it remake creators. But at the same time, in the same 1996, many have wondered: is not sorted out whether Wes? Are there too many frivolous? Can I have more fun of the genre, so as not to slide into a comedy? As it turned out, the line was reached, and then there were only a way into a farce, and the way that went Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard. Can not ask for that way - still tell - this couple is completely out of the limits of the genre, and parse it into pieces, smiling, joking and herbs, as well as many years ago did "Scream". Only the latter ridiculed his tribesmen living, and "The Cabin in the Woods" - it costs almost over deathbed genre. Yes, you heard right - my opinion is that in the description of genre affiliation "horrors" and "slasher" - obviously superfluous. As it says in the old days - an action movie. With intrigue. To the "detective" also falls short. Among the advantages of this film can be noted in the earlier mentioned "opinions" sensitivity and flexibility to the subtle mockery. Note that there is no vulgarity, there is no humor for those who do not know the material. Anyway, it's not a comedy. Movie with a straight face tells a story, that's only the latter is turned inside out, but still delivered at such an angle that even warned viewers ask slogan literally at the screen: "Are you serious?" And Whedon would answer: "Nope." That's the beauty of it all mockery of clean water. From the beginning, before the scene in the basement, through the scene to the elevator and up to the very end. For the latter, by the way, custom bow - because on classics such stories, they must either get stuck, or pass the baton to the sequel. See, this here is "should". Should not be anybody to anybody, and that "The Cabin in the Woods" puts flashing letters right above the entrance. So from what this movie revels in such popularity and hate at the same time? From the fact that "deceived expectations"? Well, guys, even I got tired of opinion to say that no one promised. That it was "not a horror film, not a slasher, and indeed that the devils"? Yes, this is the beast that was missing genre. After he already will not get the usual story in the style of "once upon a time, have themselves to blame" on the lake, and not be able to earn a lot of money on a remake of the classics, made &#x200b;&#x200b;darker and more realistic, That's when, I think, and remember "Cabin in the Woods" with a kind word, and say thank you for that showed how the genre became dilapidated, old, and it seems generally ceased to show signs of life. The beauty is, what to do with such enthusiasm does not remain in the singular, and will be imitators, and will be the ones who inspired and do something better, more interesting, tense. So what comes out that "The Cabin" is not worthy of viewing? No, it is worthy, I just, it turns out - an optimist, and I believe that these movies are new blood, and more - only better. And while everybody takes a breath from the abundance of oxygen in this movie, it is, that look more and revisions deserve. Just do not approach it too seriously, and then see what happens with serious people in the hands of non-serious writers and directors?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a funny, gory, beautifully structured movie. There are some genuinely scary moments, as well as a number of set pieces that are jaw-droppingly good. There is, I must admit, a gaping unlikelihood in an otherwise solidly-put-together story, but bigger, bloodier events prevent you from lingering over it. Its running time has been perfectly judged. Having sat through 130 heavy-going minutes of DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES a few nights before made me particularly grateful for the slim, trim pace of CABIN.I was watching it for the third time.

Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods. If you think you know this story, think again.

The satirical humor of the desensitized human society in this time period is quite funny, and although it may be ridiculous at times, it accentuates the message being presented about human culture. The acting wasn't top notch, but the characters were developed well, and the action throughout the film was not only exhilarating and fun to watch, but also moved the character development along at a perfect pace. Overall, the film was put together outstandingly, and it was a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a six because while it is very confusing, it is also entertaining. It is under the genres Horror, Mystery, and Thriller. If anything I would have labeled it under Comedy, Parody, and maybe tacked Mystery on at the end. This movie was kind of hilarious. Both me and the person I was watching it with laughed throughout the movie. We kept having to look back at what category it was under because we could not believe that it wasn't a comedy or parody. I don't understand why it is under the horror genre because though it has the classic elements of a scary movie, it is also seems to be making fun of that fact. And the things that would have made it only a scary movie (the parts with the cabin and zombies) were constantly interrupted with funny dialogue from the people watching them. Not that that is a bad thing! If those funny parts were taken out it would have just been another utterly forgettable B horror film. All around I think that this is a fun movie. It was not what we were expecting when we picked out a "scary" movie, but we enjoyed it nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it thinks it is, but great last half hour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first hour of its running time, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is a fairly awful movie. It comes across as a semi-spoof of THE EVIL DEAD and all of its ilk with one of those oh-so-witty post-modern twists, in which the whole set-up is being televised and broadcast a la THE TRUMAN SHOW. For this first hour, the film is saddled with an obnoxious script and the kind of characters you'd find in a cheesy B-movie. I'm not quite sure what Joss Whedon was thinking.Then, at around the hour mark, there's a huge, huge twist and the film becomes something else entirely. It becomes a higher-budgeted spin on the likes of CUBE, and then of course there's a sudden onslaught of monsters which will delight any fans of the horror genre. Sadly, copyright means that some of the monsters only resemble cinematic creations of old, like the Lord of Bondage and Pain guy who looks like Pinhead from HELLRAISER but isn't. Imagine if they'd had the rights to show all the great movie creatures - now that would have been great!So, for the finale, this film becomes a post-modern spoof with references to anything and everything, not least my old favourite, H. P. Lovecraft. The thing it most brings to mind, for me, are the two WAXWORKS movies with their celebration of the depth and breadth of horror movie monsters. The CGI effects are passable, and the script is never as good as it thinks it is, but it is quite a bit of fun at the end. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS as a whole doesn't hang together and both acting and direction are bland, but it's a film that's been purpose built to appeal to movie fans so it's worth at least a single watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most seem to peg "The Cabin in the Woods" as either a traditional horror film with a neat twist or a predictable horror film that becomes increasingly ridiculous. However, a literal viewing the story totally misses the point.It's quite clear that this film is a satire, not so much a parody of the genre as a vehicle for the filmmakers to poke fun at you, the audience, "the Ancients," whose unquenchable thirst for blood must be appeased. The NASA-like technical team that "produces" the "sacrifice"?with precision and professionalism, totally detached from any moral culpability, ensuring every single moment "sticks to the script"?these might just represent filmmakers, or more generally, the Hollywood system.I think this is what makes this film quite ingenious. It's sort of like a mainstream version of Haneke's "Funny Games." The filmmaker is trying to jolt you out of your somnambulistic film-watching routine and make you think about what you're doing and perhaps ask yourself some interesting and uncomfortable questions. Why do we watch these films? Are we as sick as the people manning the controls? Is this really entertainment? Why must a film always live within the boundaries of the formula? And if it break the rules, will it really be the "end of the world"?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK. Enough of the artsy, fartsy Euro-drama stuff. Time for some good old-fashioned genre cinema of the horror pastiche variety. Whilst this may be directed by Drew Goddard it has the grubby finger-prints of Joss Wheedon all over it. Drenched with more genre in-jokes, post-modern and post-Scream horror references than you could shake a severed hand at Cabin in the Woods plays it's cards close to it's chest but it's love of genre proudly on it's sleeve.So where do we begin without being suitably spoilerific. The setup is 5 young, dumb and of varying degrees of beautiful college types head off to the eponymous cabin in search of a weekend of fun in the flora and fauna (No, I don't see the attraction either). However, they're being watched before they even get there. There that's all I can say without giving anything away.So what do we have here? Essentially, this is a live-action feature length episode of Scooby-doo for grown-ups (except without the talking dog. And that's the rub. Everything here is knowingly pastiche and stereotypical. The cast all fulfill fixed roles: the hunky-jock, the babe, the last-girl nerd, the stoner and the geek. The twists are twisty. The jokes are funny. The knowingness is er... knowingy. The scares unfortunately aren't really scary but I'm not sure they're supposed to be.You see this homage/ pastiche/ parody/ whatever sticks so closely to conventions that it's hard to react to a scare you've seen done a thousand times before. But... and it's a big one... was it entertaining? Yes, big smartly dumb fun which is not a bad return for minimal brain investment.</fullReview>

The ones that are so comical that it takes away from the fact its a horror get boring after a while it definitely isn't like the title suggests "the cabin in the woods". for me that title makes me think its going to be your typical slasher or ghost film, so this one was a nice surprise.it was a mix between horror with the blood, guts and zombies,and syfy with the entire thing being an experiment and they cant get out.I love the guys who are watching over the experiment, they are super funny.one thing I only picked up on when the stoner mentioned it, because they didn't really emphasize, was that the game was changing their personalities. they could have done a bit better on that.also nicely surprised when it didn't end where I thought it would.its pretty cool how its all like elevators like the movie "cube", there were actually a few references to other movies in this I noticed.I love when the elevators all open up and all the monsters come out, that was funny and its awesome how many different creatures and things were in the cube elevators, that was pretty inventive there.the one thing I didn't really like was the "ritual" thing, I thought it would have been better to go along the lines of an experimental thing.but without thinking too much into it, it was a good comedy horror, one to sit back with your mates, have a few drinks and have a good laugh while at the same time getting a bit squeamish or shocked!</fullReview>

I wasn't expecting much but I have to admit the originality of the film did capture me. I was disappointed with the ending and unfortunately it took me a while to understand what was going on for the first hour.For the originality of the film, I gave it a 6. I also have to give credit to the fact it didn't end with the usual happy ending horror films have become accustomed to.It did make me jump (once) at the opening credits, when my kitchen door mysteriously closed on its own (just what I needed!) There were a few parts that made me laugh too. However the blonde character was a rather poor actress. I am glad I watched it, but I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought Cabin in the Woods was an enjoyable movie with some creative twists on horror movie clichés wrapped around a decent horror movie.First, the movie doesn't just deviate from the clichés but actively mocks them, and this is what really differentiates Cabin in the Woods from its peers. Unfortunately, this is also a weak point in the film because it's hard to play so directly with the clichés without coming off as campy. This leads to some of the most creative parts of the movie coming off as comedic and taking you out of the suspense and horror of the moment.Outside of the twists, Cabin in the Woods is a decent horror movie. It doesn't rely excessively on gore and provides a mix of suspenseful and shock moment that keep you interested. However, there's nothing that really differentiates it from any other movie, and so anyone looking for a pure horror movie would be better off picking another film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In an industrial facility, two technicians are preparing for their day on an unknown operation. Meanwhile, five friends are preparing for their trip to a remote cabin owned by Kurt's cousin. On the way, they stop for gas and have an encounter with the strange local who owns the gas station. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no means of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open, they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of relics and curios but when one of the women, Dana (Kristen Connolly), reads from a book, she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. There's far more going on however than meets the eye as the five campers are all under observation.I knew absolutely nothing about Cabin in the Woods except for the behind the scenes stuff where it got pushed forward due to MGM's financial difficulties. This is a fantastic deconstruction of the horror genre to its bare bones. Joss Whedon is one of the writers in the movie which is a satirical take on typical slasher/horror movies. Its original, strange, funny and has some surprising moments while all the time embracing its stereotypes. It works as an intriguing puzzle for us to solve for the most part. I didn't particularly care for any of the characters since they were so two dimensional (intentionally as the plot progresses). Chris Hemsworth was forgettable like most of the actors from the core group. Its the other part of the movie that was clearly the driving force for the movie's effectiveness and critiques of the typical modern horror fan (the ancient ones). Its a shame that Amy Acker didn't have more to do since she's a phenomenal actress. For anyone with a sense of humor, this movie will do wonders.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surfacing as a fresh breathe of life in what is slowly becoming a dying genre with every passing year, The Cabin in the Woods is a smartly crafted satirical horror film that dares to do something different with its genre, is cleverly structured like a jigsaw puzzle that keeps dropping hints every now n then, and succeeds as a quality example of both horror &amp; comedy.The story concerns five teenagers who head off for a weekend at a remote cabin in the woods where they seem to be having a really good time until they discover a cellar door &amp; decide to investigate. Things are set in motion when one of them unwittingly awakens the dead but what they don't know is that all of their actions is being observed by a hidden underground facility.Written by Joss Whedon &amp; Drew Goddard, produced by the former and directed by the latter, the best thing about this film is that it confuses till the very end by twisting &amp; embracing its genre at the same time while carefully blending humour with elements of horror but fanatics of the genre are sure gonna have a great time in working out the countless references this feature makes to the chillers of the past.Very well directed by Goddard in what's his directional debut, superbly written, finely photographed, brilliantly edited, nicely performed &amp; elegantly presented, The Cabin in the Woods is both a homage &amp; satire of its genre that offers a far more enjoyable &amp; entertaining ride than expected. Relatively fun, slightly unsettling &amp; highly amusing from start to finish, this self- parody flick is definitely worth a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshingly different take on a tired horror film formula</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: Major Plot spoilers * * * * * * Last night we watched 'The Cabin in the Woods'. From the title and brief description I read, I was expecting the usual type horror story. The kind with partying college or high school kids isolated from the rest of civilization doing stupid things and a monster killing them off one by one. Just like in so many other films before. Instead this one had an interesting twist to it. The party bound college kids in this film were actually being set up by some sort of secret organization that periodically sacrificed young people to various type of horrors zombies, ghosts, werewolves, giant bats and so in. The human sacrifices were needed in order to keep some giant Lovecraftian type creatures from taking over the world. It's similar to the way virgins had once been sacrificed in ancient cultures to appease their gods like being thrown into a volcano or stabbed on an altar. Now the young were being sacrificed in a different way and certain types were needed like a studious one, a virgin, an athlete, a buffoon, a promiscuous girl and so on. Also they were being watched by TV cameras without their knowledge. They were even drugged in order to affect their actions and ways were set up to prevent their escape. A few of the assigned victims decided not to give in so easily to the zombies killers sent to destroy them. Instead they turn the tables on the organization that is using them as sacrifices. The organization itself was an interesting setup. They almost seemed like any other group of white collar corporate co-workers, even taking bets on what type of horror the victims would inadvertently pick to destroy themselves. The way others might bet on the outcome of a weekly pro football game. When it looked like all was going as planned they seemed to be having a typical office type party to celebrate another success. They cared little for the lives of the people they had set up. They viewed it as something necessary for the survival of humanity and were used to it. This added side plot to the movie made all the difference to me, making it refreshingly different instead of the usual formula.As many of you know, I don't care for gore fests or that kind of film. I did like this movie and the sort that take you off guard, it was not overly gory and was different for a change. It also had an appropriate final scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original, but the premise is a bit wooden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, the story is not without originality (which we so lack in modern movies). But I wonder, isn't Freedom'n'Democracy? mass-kills enough on regular basis to satisfy any possible evil gods? I mean, all the invasions under false pretext, bombing, insurgencies, etc. You know what I mean, just turn on TV news. All over the world for centuries now. Hundreds of thousands or even millions dead. Effectively slaughtered with effective modern hi-tech means of destruction.Makes the death of some other five guys any difference? Oh, really? Or, may be, that's because of just better qualities of them. Well, you know, something like that: one white American virgin costs some hundreds thousands of Arab (f.e.) men, women and children. Such currency rate on free? hell-market. Huh? OK, if cast aside the excursus to the interesting phenomenon of popular consciousness (to be scared by simple fantasy, and turn blind on scariest reality), the film is pretty watchable. There is mood. The story develops well and is involving. Entertaining.So to reality: there is no god. All the regular mass killings we have seem ritual and are useless. Should we interpret the message of the movie in this way: trash all the smoothfaced sacrificers in firepot! P.S. That such girl is still a virgin is sad anyway. Something definitely wrong with the reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Points out the stupidity of lazy horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start by saying that unlike people who gave this film a 1/10 and proclaimed it the worst thing they'd ever seen, I will actually give the film a sensible review and point out it's failings as well as its successes.I for one really enjoyed it, and as many reviewers have already stated this is a comedy, which uses the horror genre as its source material. The most baffling thing I found in reading others reviews was that apparently intelligent people completely missed the point of this film and judged it not as a comedy but as a genuine horror. This is more likely the fault of the advertising campaign which is generally done to a generic model by people who have obviously spent very little time with the people who created the film. It is easy to miss many of the points Joss relates to in order to point out his fairly simple concept, which is that most horror films rely heavily on an unacceptable level of suspension of disbelief in order to tell their stories. From the girl who walks into a room where the lights won't turn on while searching for her boyfriend to the beloved staple line, "let's split up". Joss has had to go to great lengths to show the level of complexity and convolution in order to adequately explain the stupidity and implausibility of the characters who generally populate horror films. I found the most entertaining parts of the film to be the technicians behind the scenes, as the main characters were all quite boring. With the exception of the fool who is intensionally and ironically the only character to work out the manipulation of the group due to the drugs he was smoking, which have been missed by the department responsible for dosing it like the other charatcers have been. I also believe that this too is no accident, the characters who are drugged and make stupid decisions are the ones you care the least for, which is why in genuine horror films I always find it hard to sympathise with the main characters for their very stupidity. This is also why I find the support characters more interesting and believable. One reviewer mentioned that the only character he thought to be scary was the gas station owner. This however completely ignores his later phone conversation which clearly points out that he was playing a part to appease the old Gods, and again this level of attention to detail easily gets missed by those hoping to have to switch their brains off while they watch another 90 mins of gore and predictable, even iconic characters. I for one applaud Joss for his courage to fly in the face of convention and demonstrate how it is possible to make a film that pokes fun of a genre but doesn't descend to fart jokes, IE Scary Movie etc.As I said I didn't really care for the main characters, and this is to the film's detriment, however with that in mind I don't think it would have been possible to make this film without making the main characters boring. In the end the plot like the characters had to suffer in order to make the point, but it has been done so well and with humour and creativity that this does not matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Drew says... 10 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods (2012): The Good, the Bad and the IntelligentSynopsis: Your typical "kids go to a creepy cabin in the woods and are terrorized by evil"? Nope. This horror/sci-fi gem follows a group of unsuspecting college students that are "willed" to a cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun. Little do they know they are about to be the undoing of the world... by surviving.The Good: Oh man, what a great film. This is an instant classic and probably one of my all-time favorites. From the witty dialogue to the mega plot-twist, Whedon and Goddard leave it all on the line. I don't give "10 out of 10" very often, but this movie is very deserving. The genius blending of horror and sci-fi have never been done better (except maybe Aliens). The writers pay homage to every horror film out there (especially the Evil Dead series) and instead of ripping them off, it works flawlessly within the confines of the script. Once you start to get the "big reveal", you begin to understand the genius of this movie. When I first watched it, I really knew very little about it and the less you know, the better the movie will ultimately be. The true standouts from an acting point of view are Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins as the supervisors of the ritual. Their chemistry and banter is pure cinematic joy to watch. I sat there with a big 'ol smile on my face during all of their scenes. And the idea of the facility workers placing bets and turning a demonic ritual that could end the world into your run-of-the-mill office betting pool is sheer genius. There's just so much to like about this film.The Bad: It's really hard to come up with anything that wouldn't be picking some serious nits. There are a few scenes here and there that fall into the "cheesy horror" type of dialogue trap and while most of it is intentional... some of it is not. Whedon might be held up on a pedestal by geeks worldwide, but his scripts aren't always perfect. He hits more than he misses though and while it's not a perfect movie, it's certainly perfect enough to look past any minor inconsistencies.The Intelligent: This is just a well-thought out idea that is very well executed. It's originality is hard to come by in this day and age of the reboot and recycled. Most of the dialogue is as witty as you get and that is just another notch in the hype machine that is Joss Whedon... who steals Goddard's thunder a little here... because most assume that Whedon directed this movie. Either way, it's a brilliant film based solely on the concept. The fact that the actors are good, the script is amazing, the dialogue is sharp and fresh and that the idea is so imaginative and fascinating.... how could you NOT like this movie? Again, this is an instant classic for me and one that will get a yearly or bi-yearly view from me. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I entered the movie thinking that it was just another movie with gore and teen spirit getting bummed out by some killer. But once I got to see up to the thirtieth minute, I knew I was gonna enjoy it!The thing about this movie is that you can either love it or hate it. Anyone who barely watches horror movies would probably hate it. But if you were a fan of horror movies and you've lately gotten bored of the recent lame and predictable horror movie, then this is the movie for you!Cabin in the woods is by far the most unpredictable movie I've seen in a while... Not only is the cast &amp; plot so perfectly put out, but so is the directing.I recommend this movie if you're in the mood for something different and just simply AWESOME.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods.The trouble with writing a review for this film is that I risk giving too much away, so I will just not say anything at all. The creators -- Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon -- have taken the horror genre and turned it on its head. The themes that have been done to death are satirized here while maintaining a scary atmosphere.What a shame that this film got caught up in MGM's financial problems and took almost three years to get released. Chris Hemsworth needs more exposure, and Richard Jenkins never disappoints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh take on the horror genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not surprised by the negative reviews given by some people as I wouldn't so much class this as a horror film. If you go into this open minded, I feel people would have a different view. Most horror films I have watched recently have just made me laugh, when they weren't supposed to. This film is clearly made on the base that it should be laughed at. They take the mic out of other horror films that just aren't scary.The main idea of this film is that it has the normal 'scare tactic' horror feel to it, however what the writers are getting at is that this scenario is starting to get very boring. So they add the twist that the whole story is being controlled by other humans. This made it more enjoyable to watch in my opinion as they were basically mocking the stupid decisions made by characters in normal horror films by forcing it upon the main characters in this film, that otherwise were acting rather like any real person would in the situations given.I felt the film kept a good pace with a few twists along the way, okay so its a bit far-fetched but it's a film, it's not supposed to have real world limitations and i think that a lot of people seem to forget this fact.Overall i would give this a 7/10 as there were a few aspects that could have been cleaner, but still a very enjoyable, fresh thinking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin is a First Rate Horror/Myster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Witty, crafty, sneaky and good production values (30 million in budget helps) make this horror movie with a "social message" engaging and intriguing.The characters are interesting and played with such an understated low key, natural energy that the typical "over the top bad acting" associated with most horror films is a welcomed missing component of this film. The characters are diverse and actually interesting.The story development is well done. Yeah, like most films, the story sags and drags at times; yet my desire to "figure out the plot" never slowed. Multiple story lines develop into one cohesive and congruent story with a funky finish. I had a couple of "WTF" moments during the film. The subtly at which the writers and producers poke fun at the typical stereo-types of horror films is done with masterful of understated sarcasm. There is a voyeur quality to the films underlying message. The balance of humor and horror story-telling is first rate.The film's commentary on the manner in which some members of our global society are willing to accept and even celebrate violence against other innocent people so that a concept, "religion" or cause survives is vibrantly interwoven into the subtle and at times, over the head with a mallet, story telling.No matter the level and skill of the satirical and anti-societal humor as well as the clever and tangled story-development, this is a horror film. The horror scenes are on par with many of the other films in this genera: over the top, quick, gory and with unspeakable violence that is likely to haunt your imagination for days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever you do don't read the reviews before seeing this movie!!I didn't and I am so relieved I didn't. There are spoilers everywhere - even when unintended AND some of the reviews seem like they were written by people who've never seen it!!I noticed several slamming this movie and giving it such low scores you'd think it was the worst movie ever made when the opposite is more the case. I can only assume those people stopped watching it after a particular point very early in the movie, (you'll know what I mean if you've seen it), having made certain assumptions that would have proved totally wrong if they'd stuck with it. This is easily one of the best movies I've seen and has gone straight to my top 10 favourites. It has everything you'd ever want from a horror movie and none of what you don't want. Original, smart, sexy, funny, scary, action-packed and surprises at every turn. Great acting, wonderful cinematography, directing and special effects and - for once - characters I actually cared about.This movie succeeded where so many have failed - it surprised me - and delighted me. Just when you think you've got it all figured out...... BAM!.... it sideswipes you again and again. On top of that it doesn't play cute and hide stuff so that the ending has a cheap "twist" that is really just an illogical "add-on". The twists and turns in this movie are way too cunning to need such fraudulent manipulation. I wasn't going to bother watching this movie because I'd assumed it would be exactly like all the other run of the mill horror flicks that have been around lately &amp; didn't want to waste my time. But once I saw Josh Whedon's name attached to it I had to give it a chance. And am I glad I did.Don't miss this one. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holy Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean wow. Wow. I can't believe I just saw the worst movie I've ever seen......... at being bad. It's very bad at being bad, cause it's really good. Honestly, I loved it because I love movies which show people reacting oddly to massacre (Hunger Games- mainly books-, God Bless America, or things like that). First, I didn't laugh, except some giggles or inner laugh, but I knew it was funny. I thought it was pretty scary also. I believe it deserves a sequel, or prequel, but not like explaining more, just different cast (obviously, but maybe not entirely), different setting, and just show a previews ritual, making a total new movie. Or maybe, or probably, not a movie, but a short. The actors were great, and it maybe not create a cult (like The Evil Dead, or Saw, or Paranormal Activity has done), but it surely goes through a very interesting set of emotions. I'm with a fever right now, so I'm not going to go very deep because I can't really think deep right now, but all through the movie I was like: "Holy (bleep) Im so glad I decided to watch this, How can it be so good?". I didn't watch it at first, because I don't know why, I though I had seen that it had a bad rating in IMDb (5 point something) but then I saw it again and was pretty surprised. Bad things: CGI is very, very bad sometimes. Also, when the massacre in the building occurred, PROBABLY one of the thousands killed must have possible, been a fool and must've counted as sacrifice, I'm I right? Also, I saw a lot of The Evil Dead (not Evil Dead) references, like the part the cellar opens, and the camera films them like from inside, and someone goes alone inside (I'm talking about the old The Evil Dead, not new very great horror movie Evil Dead), and the cabin looked like the one in Evil Dead new and old. I would've further explained or try and give some inception (yeah, I just used that word) on how the monsters existed, primarily. I get this must be a parody, because on the bet board it said Deadite, and Jack'o Lantern, and don't get me wrong, I became a fan-girl when they mention or reference a movie I've seen. I wanted to see a deadite :( Oh and last bad thing, sometimes, some characters reactions to things happening weren't quite realistic and seemed fake and acted (Like when the Chinese creepy, scary kids defeated the ghost, the weren't scared, they were celebrating, or when some zombies came, I don't remember exactly)Must See.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never understood the Cult of Whedon. I've spent my life at the altar of sci-fi and fantasy, and I find his efforts to water down both genres so as to make it digestible to the "norms" deplorable. His imagination seems alive, but restrained by some kind of formula or methodology which lays waste to every cool concept he writes up.But then, I've never understood the concept of horror. The old, pre-war Hammer and Universal horror movies are cool because they're just cheap popcorn fun. Horror was easy before the images of Nazi concentration camps made humankind a bigger, badder monster than his celluloid creations.Having said all that--I understand what they're trying to do in this film. It's a homage mixed with some half-baked concept that actually sounds kind of cool if you extricate it from the homage part. Too bad they're beating the old ideas they homage into a fine paste with the blunt instrument of a half-baked idea.</fullReview>

True, there were hardly any jump scares but the gore and violence make up for it.There's something for everyone with this movie. If you want the slasher violence, you got it. Want something authentically funny? Then this has it as well. And if you want a good popcorn movie to watch with your friends or significant other on a late Saturday night, then this should definitely be one of your choices.I hardly ever watch horror movies but I gave this one a shot and it was totally worth the eight stars I gave it.

Let's be honest, that version wasn't too great either!Not that it needs to be said, but I was highly disappointed with this film, I thought it had potential to break free from standard horror films. Unfortunately, it was just like any typical college thriller; the biggest disappointment came from the zombies. Out of all those mystical, blood- thirsty beings seen later on...the initial monsters were zombies. Seriously, why not that pterodactyl thing? All in all, this movie is a disappointing and overrated creative failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What would be a boring horror film is actually a brilliant satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what attracted this film to me, maybe it was the cover, maybe it was somebody saying that they can't wait to see Cabin in the Woods, so when I was wondering through the video shop I decided to pick it up to see what it was all about. In one word I would describe this movie as 'strange'. Actually I have two words that would basically describe this film, but IMDb won't actually let me write that, so I will simply say 'incredibly twisted'.The first strange thing I found with the movie was that it opened in some sort of top secret research facility with a couple of scientists chatting away about nothing in particular and that is what caught me at first. However, the movie then jumped to the scene with the college aged kids going away on some camping trip in the woods and that was when I groaned and said 'oh no, not again.' As the movie progressed I sort of groaned even more, especially when the zombies came out of the ground. I was sort of like the guy in the film that said 'why can't we have mermaids!' My response was 'yeah! Why can't we have mermaids.' After cruising through some of the message boards I then realised why we couldn't have mermaids, and that was because this movie is actually satirical. The thing was that despite all of the clichéd slasher horror movie scenes, we kept on jumping back to this research facility (including a scene where there is a betting pool) but the director is clever because he does actually keep you guessing about what is going on. We hear about the betting pool, but we have no idea what this pool is until after the event in which they are betting on. In fact, you have no idea what the connection between the research facility and the happy (or not so happy) campers is until about halfway during the film. Mind you, there are some hints, and the stoner character (the college kid characters are all clichéd) seems to have a better idea than most (namely because the copious amount of weed that he smokes actually counter acts the drugs that are being used on them).It is halfway through the film that it actually gets interesting, and in fact it is the purge (I won't mention what that is) that is actually my favourite part of the film. The thing is that this is a twist, and despite the fact that I have listed this commentary as containing a spoiler does not mean that I am going to give it away. You see, this is a satire, and it is a satire that pokes fun at all of the standard fare horror films that Hollywood churns out. While the cabin in the woods is considered to be standard fare (popularised by Evil Dead, where it was actually done properly) only one of the many clichés that are there. The major cliché is not only that everybody has to die (and in a particular order) but also that the who genre, the murder, killing, blood, and gore, is actually created to placate an ancient god, and that ancient god is the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant!!! In a really weird way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had zero expectations for this movie. I had not read anything about and I had not seen the trailer. All I was looking for was some standard horror, perhaps with a minor supernatural twist. Needless to say I got more than I bargained for.This movie is not a horror movie. Neither is it a comedy. This movie belongs in the genre where these two genres collide and become something brilliant and awesome. Every little turn and twist of this movie is so weird that I could not take my eyes from it! I liked the way that this movie parodies other horror movies (please pay attention to the white-board!) and the small references that is thrown at the viewer.On the other hand, I can see why some viewers will/would hate this movie due to the fact that it is how it is. Lots of people have been and will be fooled and not all will react like me. Nonetheless, I will strongly advise everyone I know to watch this movie if they want to watch something "out of the box".I have chosen to give this movie 8/10. It was very close to 9, but I am generally a bit stingy when it comes to throwing out 10's and 9's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CABIN IN THE WOODSWow... this film surprised me. I was expecting it to be a typical slasher film... basically another Evil Dead wannabe... but it was different... and I loved it!The movie is about a bunch of kids who go up to a cabin in the woods for a small vacation (yeah I know... sounds all too similar so far) but then they accidentally bring a group of zombies to life. The difference with this film though, is they are all being watched and it is all part of a set up by a company that is sacrificing them without them knowing.The film is very entertaining and had some great bloody moments. The deaths were very cool.The effects were great and the monsters/zombies were awesome. I loved they way this film didn't follow every other horror film. I also think the ending is brilliant.The acting was OK mostly... there is one guy in the movie (Fran Kranz) that I think could have done better, but his bad performance was funny which added to the movie. He might have even played it bad on purpose for comedy value.Other cast members were Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins &amp; Bradley Whitford.Chris Hemsworth just seems to be in everything these days... he is a good actor, but he has made some bad decisions... he has made some movies that I have not been impressed with. But not this one.I will give this film 7 out of 10.A very good movie that was a mixture of Night of the Living Dead, Evil Dead and The Cube.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't know what to say. This isn't a bad thing, though. In many ways being unable to come to an affirmative conclusion is what the filmmaker wants; polarisation of views. My view is split because, quite simply, I don't know if this film is a joke or not.My standard review structure has to be broken for this because, well, nothing I can say can really summarise my opinions. The film seems to have a mixture of comedy and serious horror undertones. The opening would suggest a key sub-plot, but then the title hits the screen in 70's B-horror movie style (big, bold and red). The film progresses in this same style; giving you creepy pretences for the rest of the plot, then adding 'dorky' cliché's. The main characters are all parodies of classic horror films; a 'hot' girl and her 'jock BF'. The nerd who becomes 'Mr Nice Guy', and the unlikely hero who saves the strong-headed female lead. This assortment is then used as an explanation for the plot... (***SPOILERS***) ...as the 'ancient ones' required said characteristics in youth to be appeased. So, they take some funny cliché stuff and infuse it with some deep, intriguing horror plot. Interesting, isn't it? Why then, do I have such confused feelings? Well, because this happens THROUGHOUT the film. Hell (excuse the pun), even the monster's existence in horror films is explained as a kind of 'game show' to appease the previously mentioned ancient ones. The characters act like the classic horror film ones do (think Ash and Mia in The Evil Dead), and yet they appear very traumatised and pivotal to the progression of the plot.The cinematography also combines the strange atmosphere of most horror films with the setting of any classic 'it all goes wrong' horror.This film is a spoof of the very genre it falls under. Sure, the film is different, and sure, that's good, but is it entirely justified? I just wish it could have been more decisive in it's final plot choice; either be serious, or be a joke. This film did both, even at the very end. I admire the cleverness of the director because it had me going through every second, and yet I wasn't entirely satisfied. I can understand the bad reviews, and the 'OMFGGROFLBBQ BEST HORROR EVAR' reviews. But personally, it isn't either. I give it a ?/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar and one of my favorite stories.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the horror genre has ceased to please the audience with new villains and plots in different time release of the film pays homage to the recognized classics. Walk through the history of such horror. In 1986 came even three of the film "Fright Night" by Tom Holland, "Re- Animator" Gordon Stewart and "Return of the Living Dead" by Dan O'Bannon. In 1986 "Fright Night" won the Saturn as the best horror movie surpassing its competitors. It was filmed as though for fans of Dracula and vampire movies. Complied with all the canons and with a hilarious comedy with cool special effects. "Re-Animator" was a modern look at the history of "Frankenstein" and "The Return of the Living Dead" is the most controversial film of all three continued the story of "night" and Dawn of the Living Dead "in a humorous style. 1996 was the year of the movie "Scream" to use a cliché, "Halloween" and the most overrated horror film in the history of the "Friday the 13th." He was dedicated to all fans of the genre of slasher and turns of the canons of the genre inside out and this has become so popular in his day .. In 1999, the Department released Robert Rodriguez with the story plot of "Body Snatchers." In 1998 "The Lost Boys" is also about vampires. In 2010, "Drag Me to Hell," with references to "Zloveyschim dead," but the film was a curse. By the way director Sam Raimi produced remake of the Japanese "curse." It turned out bad."Cabin in the Woods" pays tribute to the classic "dead Zloveyschie" Sam Raimi. One of the coolest horror films for innovative photography and special effects. And Bruce Campbell, tough guy. But in fact, in contrast to the "Scream" Wes Craven's here we see very different techniques. The first 20 minutes of the film is an introduction to the style of "Zloveyschih dead." Teens go to the forest to the damn cabin. They are talking. Mention of the map and the road, or rather the fact that there is no road map. Just as in «Evil dead». They come back, start to come off in full, then find the basement, there a book that certainly is cursed. As in the movie Raimi one character out of five said that it is not worth reading, the more so in this book and it is written. Characters receive a warning about the dangers and still read! This is so stupid you say, but you would not have done? It's the same as a teenager in the 80's sitting in a movie theater watching "Halloween" to say: "Do not go there, you were waiting for a maniac! Damn well why did you go here! »: Facepalm: In parallel, they are being watched workers underground research center, controlling the situation by pressing any buttons. Their goal to teenagers died and died spectacularly. Yes they are, and they are also an Image. Center employee laughing, discussing everything that makes teenagers and how they are being killed, and those trying to escape. This is an unusual story, this fact has not been anywhere, in any horror movie. All the colorful characters, dialogues through in many ways I'm sure Joss Whedon is very interesting. In his script characters always look like a family - Avengers, Mission Sererniti, Toy Story. It can create an interesting dialogue between them and then he did a great job.After the entry is a different horror movie, nothing to do with "Zloveyschimi dead." Lots of blood, there is nudity, good special effects, even though the computer is not much. There is a scene making fun of clichés of the genre of horror. They are not as many as we would like, but they are very clever and most importantly - the end of the movie, you just will not know how it will end until the inspection up to the galleries. This is the first film for the whole year which is really fun to watch. And I was thinking that "Battleship" in no way inferior to the stupidity of "Pearl Harbor," that's all I see this year. Horror genre could again surprise and Joss Whedon to pair with Drew Goddard proved almost as well as Wace Craven 6 years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well its a bit of a mixed bag this one. On the one hand its original and does keep you guessing a lot of the way through, i did wonder if it was gonna have a kind of hostel like twist to it (it didn't).I must admit my heart sank when it transpired that zombies were gonna be the enemy! Honestly i am soooooooooo sick of zombie movies now, its like everybody is obsessed with them at the moment! Its been so overdone now and if i've seen one zombie movie, i've seen them all! In my opinion zombies aren't even that scary! Anyway, i digress! So the bits right up to the zombies were quite enjoyable, my trouble is i can't get my head around films that are both realistic and fantasy all at the same time. If its obvious from the start that its a fantasy that i'm cool with that. But not once did anybody utter the words "but this is ridiculous, zombies, witches and werewolves don't exist", unless they lived in a world where, zombies, witches werewolves did exist and everybody knew about it but got on with their daily lives regardless, in which case the film writers should have made it more obvious.I was a bit confused as to who the cabin belonged to. It was supposed to be one of the group's cousin, so does this mean the cousin was in on it too? If so what was his motive for wanting to kill off a member of his family. If the cousin wasn't in on it then that just doesn't seem feasible that some random corporate company could build a forcefield around your property, fill it with camera and bury some zombies in the ground without the owner being a little bit suspicious.I liked it for its originality, but i wouldn't watch it again anytime soon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie defiantly could have used some work, but overall it was decent. This is more of a movie for analyzing than it is for watching if you know what I mean. This movie is quite enjoyable if you really read deep into what the characters are saying and what they mean. A lot of what the characters are saying have a literal meaning and figurative meaning. Now for the part that I did not like. I was kind of upset with the animations done in the film, its not a big deal, but it was clearly noticeable as an animation. I felt like there was a lack of development with the character behind the whole scheme of the killings. I think more could have been done to make a better connection with the people watching the film. Overall, I am not sure if I would recommend this film or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because it was listed on moviefone as #13 for top 50 movies of 2012. An earlier review mentioned that it was worth watching for the last 30 minutes. With this, I have to agree. The first half of the movie seems cheesy and like a typical low budget horror movie gone bad. The acting in the cabin scenes leave much to be desired; however, their lack of talent is a nice contrast to the men in the control room who seem to have it together. This movie is a nice blending of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Truman Show, Hunger Games, and Monsters, Inc. with a few zombies sprinkled in the mix. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am quite selective in watching zombie movies, I like a few of them, but all from 1960-70ies or their later remakes. But The Cabin in the Woods... Hm, combining manhunt for money, zombies from the recent past and medieval dragons does not necessarily mean that all categories of viewers fond of them separately would be fond of them together in one. The outcome is at times funny, then stupid and the total summary is a "porridge" of this and that... Not impressive.Actors-actresses were also nothing special, even Sigourney Weaver's character was too briefly on screen. Well, it can still be that I do not belong into a target audience, that the movie is meant for teens and twinks - as all the main actors are in their 20ies. Nevertheless I know that there are better horror movies out there. Just search IMDb.com!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of immature young adults acting just like horror film caricatures go off to spend the weekend in a cabin in the woods for some sex and partying, but hit a snag when they unwittingly awake a family of flesh eating zombies, all of this after getting a scary warning from crazy loner at a service station? C'mon, how can any girl really be that tarty? Or any guy really that big a sex mad jerk? Or someone be such an incoherent perpetually stoned misfit? Well in this film, all those questions are answered. This particular cabin in the woods is being manipulated by outside forces. Indeed, the manipulation began before they left home. A usually normal girl having chemicals added to her body to make her horny, etc etc. But to what end game? In the first part of its mission, the film delivers, as we see the skillful people running the cabin coming up with creative ways to get our poor caricatures to follow their script. I must say one character who doesn't work for me is the security guard who is questioning the ethics of what they are doing. There is clearly not a single person involved who thinks what they are doing is ethical, merely an organic necessity. But they've adjusted to this being part of their jobs and so try to have fun doing it.Scenes such as the one where one of the directors laments to another that he "may never get to see a Mer-man," and where the entire room starts booing when our normal girl turned sex addict refuses to sleep with her boyfriend because they are outside and "it's chilly," are quite funny and echo the feelings of the audience. That's why these scenes work: they are playing the role of you: watching a horror movie and face palming at the victim's stupidity and ignorance, and kind of regretting they didn't get it worse than they did, or that the kill wasn't slightly more creative.Then we get to the final act, and things get a little silly. All of these murders have been sacrifices made to keep an evil demon asleep who will tear the world open if he awakes. Our heroes get to the end and then learn they are in a no win situation, and so sit back and watch it burn. But then we have to see the beast wake up. Can't we just finish with our two heroes there awaiting the end, the ground rumbles, the camera shakes, fade to black... Just seeing that hand seemed to say they didn't understand the horror genre or why we watch these films quite as much as I thought. And the scenes in the bunker don't quite work for me either. They made something good and fun, when it could have been something great.Apart from that, this is a well made, well acted film that is definitely worth a look. Now there is nudity and a mild sex scene,a lot of language and quite a bit of blood. Always mention that as I get a lot of people asking me. Quite good, should have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate experience in mindf***ing terror and hilarity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a blue moon a movie comes along and blows your mind. The Cabin in the Woods is that movie.Most horror movies are cannibals. Coprophagic cannibals, to be precise. They eat up genre conventions and clichés and crap them back out for filmmakers and the audience to consume. What we end up with is the same regurgitated turds with slightly different stinks. To be fair, there are movies out there that play up horror clichés and still manage to be plenty entertaining. Insidious, Hatchet, and Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell come to mind. Those films are the minority however; most modern horrors are uninspired turds.On the surface, The Cabin in the Woods seems like just another one of said turds. The movie synopsis is this: five archetypal college students (the jock, the nerd, the stoner, the slut, and the virgin) decide to take a trip to a cabin in the woods for a fun-filled weekend of beer, partying, and sex. Once they finally reach the cabin, they stumble upon something in the basement that they shouldn't have and promptly unleash hell upon themselves. If this synopsis reads like the setup to countless horror films, it's because it is supposed to. Those who are familiar with writer-director Drew Goddard and writer-producer Joss Whedon's genre-bending work in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel series, however, know better.One of the reasons why The Cabin in the Woods is so good is that was written by individuals that have a deep love and understanding of the genre. Whedon and Goddard know the utility and appeal of horror tropes, but also see how they have stagnated the genre. Stupid teens that go into the basement when common sense tells them not to, stupid teens that decide to split up when the group is attacked, stupid teens that decide to go out to investigate what that strange noise was? The genius of Cabin is that it takes these rules and assumptions about how the protagonists behave in horror films, hacks them up, and then assembles them into an eerily familiar but ambitiously unique beast.In keeping with horror tradition, The Cabin in the Woods delivers the plenty of nightmarish monsters and gruesome kills. The movie defies tradition, however, by providing characters that are actually have personality and sympathetic. In a genre where the characters exist solely for the purpose of getting butchered for the audience's delight, Cabin has truly achieved something special. Each member of the gang gets their chance to shine and subvert their respective stereotype but it's ultimately the stoner, Marty (played by Fran Kranz who also starred in Whedon's TV series Dollhouse) who steals the mainstage show. Behind the scenes however, it's the two technicians Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Hadley (Bradley Whitford) who bring the most laughs.Cabin also manages to be absurdly hilarious while still delivering the scares. The only other recent film that can make that claim is Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, his spiritual successor to the seminal first two Evil Dead movies. Whedon and Goddard understand something that most people don't ? that horror and comedy share a good deal in common. They make or break themselves depending on the setup, can get away with portraying the most ridiculous and offensive things, and are specifically calibrated to get a visceral reaction.Horror and comedy aren't just limited to pushing people's buttons. Good horror and comedy can sometimes give them something to think about it. The term "meta" has used a lot to describe The Cabin in the Woods. It's a half-accurate label because while the movie is definitely a critique of horror but it doesn't have to resort to being self-referential to make that statement. The problem with "meta" films is that they typically ruin one's suspension of disbelief by being self-referential and deliberately poking fun at itself but Cabin's main conceit (which I will not spoil for you) itself is a perfect metaphor for horror film and allows the movie to critique the horror while still remaining serious and believable itself. Cabin takes a mirror and points it at the audience to ask some serious questions but desensitization to violence, manipulation, the importance of narrative to human culture, and more but it does not make the movie a mere vehicle for the message or trivialize the story and characters themselves. The commentary and content are one.If there is any flaw to this movie, it's that it isn't that scary. There are a few "boo" moments and definitely plenty of blood and gore but you're probably not going to find yourself peeking through your fingers. The Cabin in the Woods gets a pass though because it does everything else right. It might not make you leap out of your seat but it will certainly keep you on the edge of it. It's entertaining, smart, thought provoking, funny, original, and most importantly, memorable, things that are hard to say about most other mainstream movies, not just horror.Like the tagline says, you think you know the story, but really, you don't know squat. Go watch this movie, have a laugh and a scream or two, then get your brain matter splattered over the theater wall. You'll love it.I promise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a major misstep from Whedon. This junk wasn't even a horror film. Rather it was a lame cartoon. First too much time is spent on getting the thing underway and even when it does, the very original gimmick is revealed - if not explained - right from the beginning of the action so as to utterly kill off any suspense or surprises and reduce it to a level somewhat below the typical slasher flick.No tricky twists. No suspense. No real emotions. Unceremonious deaths. Creatures were mostly shown so dark and rapidly cut that they weren't particularly interesting. The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 was it's dark quirky sense of humor. Even the gore was silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Cabin in the Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods is a classic horror movie that brings itself into modern times. The reason this movie has succeeded is because it is an extremely fun movie that will make you jump out of your skin. Cabin in the Woods can have you laughing and then in a split second your scared beyond belief. The movie is conducted by Drew Goddard and stars Chris Hemsworth, Kristen Connolly and Anna Hutchison. Cabin in the Woods appeals to both comedy and horror audiences. In addition, personally the movie is a great horror movie. Cabin in the Woods takes all of the aspects of original horror movies, like the monsters, the mood, the end of the line, and even a small thing such as creepy people in the background, and mashes that into one big comedy/horror movie. Except in this movie, there are uncanny things that happen to each and every single person. Additionally, Cabin in the Woods is also an fun comedy to watch. There are many little conversations between the group of college students that are funny to hear and watch the reactions to the people. But you would have to put everything else down, and just sit and watch the movie and you will see the comedy buried inside of this nit typical horror film. On the other hand, Cabin in the Woods is a great movie to watch, the director could have used more imagination set the mood of the movie. The sound effects were a little on the cheesy side, when there is plenty of good sound effects and music that would be extremely outstanding and would fit this movie great. Additionally, the length of this movie may be of such notice to all of you out there. It is shorter than a general movie. It is only 95 minutes, so if your looking to watch a family movie that lasts a while, I, personally, would not recommend this one.Furthermore, Cabin in the Woods is just a fun and unusual movie to watch. Normally in a comedy you would not find zombies and such, but in this comedy/horror, there are multiple options that could have to the college students. This movie is highly successful and it ventures so far off of the map. It inflicts many chuckled and horrifying gasps at the same time. Nevertheless, Cabin in the Woods is a great movie to watch if you enjoy comedy and horror. There are some flaws in the movie, but if you can look past them, you have yourself a great and enjoyable movie. The movies biggest surprise is that it is not your typical modern, scary horror film we all know, it is funny and sometimes dulled by the illogic of the college students. If you are into horror, I challenge you to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent and truly original horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how many films I have seen with this same plot: a group of young people decides to spend some days in a remote cabin in the woods, and the only thing they find is their violent deaths in hands of some unknown threat (it can be mundane or supernatural). It's one of the most employed formulas in horror cinema, and even though we have occasionally seen interesting variations of the same story (such as Tucker &amp; Dale Vs. Evil), I had rarely found such an ingenious, amusing and ambitious one as The Cabin in the Woods. In fact, the word "ambitious" doesn't adequately describe the scope of the screenplay, nor the way in which it has changed my perception of that particular formula.Let's see...How am I going to talk about The Cabin in the Woods without revealing the delicious surprises its screenplay includes? Well, there definitely are surprises, but the central premise is predictable, specially because co-screenwriters Drew Goddard (who was also the director) and Joss Whedon offer us various clues from the beginning. So, we might not find unexpected twists which defy our perception, but a gradual evolution in the subjects dealt by the film, and a methodic re-accommodation of the apparently incongruent elements of the story. But the best thing of all is the deep affection shown by Goddard and Whedon to this particular genre, honoring (and also satirizing with a piercing precision) many popular clichés of horror cinema which take a new life and meaning under their imagination. Having said that, the last third of the movie takes some questionable creative licenses, stretching our credulity to the maximum in order to satisfy the screenplay's huge ambition. I won't say any more, except that I found the "red button" issue excessively convenient and improbable. On the other hand, I can't deny the fact that that I agree with the ideology of the few survivors who accompany us to the nihilistic ending.Goddard's direction is incredibly precise and disciplined, employing an agile and modern style which drives the narrative at a perfect rhythm, slowing it a bit down during the beginning in order to create suspense and later loosening the reins until leading to an exuberant and ironic ending, bathed in blood but at the same time based on universal ideas. The whole cast makes a good work in their roles, highlighting Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, whose perfect chemistry makes the long labor relationship between their characters completely credible.So, in conclusion, I enthusiastically recommend The Cabin in the Woods, whether you are a fan of the horror genre or a hater, because this film works as a denounce against the creative stagnation of the genre...but instead of simply criticizing it, it found a very ingenious way in order to exploit it on its favor, and also offering us a unique experience of fantastic cinema. There are movies I like very much, but don't inspire me to watch them again; The Cabin in the Woods is the opposite because, besides of its narrative values, it includes such a quantity of details which will make various additional visits necessary in order to appreciate all the tributes, satires and references.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you miss Joss Whedon this is your film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a horror movie, if isn't even a thriller. This is a Joss Whedon film through and through.If you miss him and his shows/movies/etc., then you will love this movie. I have heard many people say the acting is weak, but I disagree. If you miss your beloved Buffy/Angel/Dollhouse characters then you will truly appreciate this film.If you know Joss, then you will love this film. If you don't then you won't get it at all, move along; he has enough fans to support him.Absolutely 10/10. His characters are perfect. The storyline is exactly what you'd expect from him (in a good way).And even though it was advertised as a horror (I blame whomever was in charge of that), it is still a great film if you enjoy ingenuity and classic b movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the cliché of horror clichés a group of five friends decide to take a vacation in a forest hideout supposedly belonging to the cousin of sociology major / burly athlete Curt (Chris Hemsworth). The foursome features a newly blond Jules (Anna Hutchison), her single 'reborn virgin' friend Dana (Kristen Connolly), the setup boyfriend Holden (Jesse Williams) and the bong-smoking jester Marty (Fran Kranz). On path to the isolated cabin they meet the awkwardly crazed hill-billy, but still embark to their fate: one full of flinging cellar doors, blood-hungry zombies and all that is dark / dreadful. Meanwhile a group of technicians follow our group en route to their demise, supplying them with hypnotic drugs and pheromones in order for the murderous mayhem complete an ancient ritual aimed at keeping the Ancient Ones at bay...Flung into the crossroads of horror scripts comes a truly original movie-joke, albeit one not as cerebrally engaging as many want to believe. Taking "Scream" a step beyond from laughing at horror movies oversimplifications to re-imagining a limbo for horror scripts. Many viewers will be engaged enough by the sheer glee of playing the 'name-that-horror' game, started off from the obvious "Evil Dead" nudge to some less apparent homages like "Hellraiser" to those absolutely marginal like the "Angel"-inspired tentacle scene. Throughout a vast array at knocks towards horror idiosyncrasies, including inspirationally over-the-top famous last-lines, a character changing his sane opinion into an insane one via technician-induced stupidity or the intelligent Jules going blond and dumb just to fit the 'tech script'. Insanely funny with a nudging smartness, whilst not receding on gore, "Cabin in the Woods" offers a true relapse from the typical horror fanfare. The main loss is in regards to atmosphere, as there is none - whenever the tension starts building we are always swept away into 'horror technician' land, where a couple of goofy lines and comments eat away the suspense.Featuring a very self-aware script and great performances across the board (especially from the duo technobabble of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford), is a vastly improved metaspoof (when compared to the "Scream" franchise) aimed directly at true aficionados of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin in the Woods, that is where we are...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is never quite what it seems, which is precisely, exactly what you want a suspense-horror movie to be. You don't show the slashing! You don't show the thing that's coming at you! You hide things in shadows, under layers, beneath covers, physically and, more importantly, psychologically. Consequently, the movie messes with your mind, annihilates any preconceived notions you may have about the genre, and the invites a cataclysm of morbid monstrosities into your living room. It's an honest-to-goodness scary movie.Cowritten by Joss Whedon, the movie follows a pretty standard premise: a group of five stereotypes journey to a remote cabin for the weekend, and bad things happen when they venture into the basement on a dare and read from an ancient tome. Now, if you're not in on the joke - that is, no one's spoiled it for you - you're probably nodding right now in recognition. This is what happens in these movies. This is not new. To add to that, your characters are straight out of central casting: a jock, a pretty girl, a wallflower, a stoner, and a smart dude. It seems too trite to be true, and it most certainly is.The movie intentionally deals in tropes from all kinds of scary movies. Zombies. Zombie families. Ghosts, blobs, redneck hillbillies with chainsaws. Cave-ins. By now, you're reading this and, still naive to the actual plot, are starting to catch on. You see, this is what the Scream movies should have been. You remember those, right? They loudly and proudly proclaimed they were "in on the joke," but with every known horror-movie rule they explained to a knowing audience, the characters in that movie broke another one. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.But not here, oh no. Our characters are never in control of anything. They aren't wiseasses; they're just caricatures, symbols of certain archetypes. They make their choices and deal with the consequences. If a game is being played, it's not rigged in their favor; it may not, in fact, be really rigged at all.It isn't long into the movie that we learn the cause of our heroes' distress. It would be unfair to detail it here, but let's just say that others can see every move they make and that there is apparently plenty more at stake than the lives of five measly young adults. In addition to the thrills that the movie offers, there's a great contrast between what the characters experience (as mere victims) and what goes on behind the curtain. When the audience realizes this, the movie...well, it's a whole new movie. Suddenly it's not about the fate of those five, it's about a heck of a lot more than that. Or less than that, if one doesn't buy the given premise at that turning point. There are few recognizable names in the cast. Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford, and even Sigourney Weaver show up. They're not the focus here. What will be recognizable are the monsters, the breadth of which cannot be overstated. The action at its best is so frantic it might take a DVD pause to spot a particular baddie. There's mayhem, there's a lot of bloodletting, there's gore, and there's a visceral sense of satisfaction that cannot be simply slapped together by amateurs playing movie makers.For me, Cabin in the Woods was terrifying, and in the gleeful, do-it- again way. I don't think it means to be realistic, even in its created environment. It's scary in the jolts and the surprises and the smack- you-in-the-face action. Does it seem like I'm gushing too much? Not half as much as blood gushes in the movie. Okay, that was a cheap shot, but it was fun to type. This is an essential scary movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because I like so much of his work.The problem with this movie is that it was TOO clever. A typical group of American Horror Movie victims is placed in a scenario where they have to inadvertently pick their monster and be killed in order to appease ancient gods, all organized by a corporate bureaucracy who are competing to make sure that they beat their competition, who are staging a parallel Japanese Horror Movie.(A funny line, "How hard is it to kill a bunch of nine-year olds?" when their Japanese counterparts fail.) The victims escape the trap involving zombies and encounter werewolves, Cenobites and other "not quite violating someone else's copyright" monsters before Sigourny Weaver shows up to provide exposition.Josh, I love you man, but I never cared about any of these characters. Characters breaking through the fourth wall can be interesting, but you can't make a whole movie out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Scary But an Okay Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out like your stereotypical horror movie- teens are joking around and having fun; about to go on vacation. You have your main character- the little innocent girl whom you just HAVE to feel sorry for. The whore who is as dumb and self centered as can be. The idiot jock with muscles but no brains. The stoner kid/loser/loner/weirdo all wrapped into one whom you just KNOW would never actually hang out with these type of people. And the brain/the nerd who thinks things through at all times.For quite some time it's your average movie about kids being killed in a cabin in the woods. But little things like the weird company and computers and people watching these kids, the odd force field that kills a bird, and chemicals being sprayed to alter a person's brain make you think "Okay then.. whatever.."It's not until close to the end when the lady mentions "if we don't do this then the ancients will rise.." and that the people who are partying in the office get a call whilst celebrating for some unknown reason that you finally scratch your head and say "What the hell is this crap?" The movie was pretty boring and you don't get the weird twist until the end, when, SURPRISE! The virgin AND the stoner are alive! That's when it finally becomes semi-interesting enough to kind of wake you up. But, THEN, it's just kind of like "UH... WHAT?!!" Because from the time that you discover the stoner kid is alive- the rest of the movie almost doesn't make sense. The facility below them houses a series of monsters and nightmares that the people in the facility used to try to get sacrifices. Basically- every culture around the world uses this technique to keep "ancient gods" who used to inhabit the Earth from waking up and destroying everything. This part is the ONLY good part- In my opinion. Mainly cause the mass deaths of people at the hands and tentacles and whatever you wanna call em.. of monsters and creatures that are ode to famous creations from books, movies, TV shows, games, etc.. is just AWESOME!That- and the whole Ancient Gods waking up at the end and killing everyone thing- Is the twist. And while it was cheesy and ended abruptly, I felt it was quite different than a lot of the same ole same ole stuff from today.People who say the movie was predictable can't POSSIBLY have guessed that the whole plot was centered around keeping ancient gods asleep by sacrificing the stereotypical young adults from movies in a computerized and biological fashion by using props to call upon monsters from a vast assortment of creatures stashed in an underground facility and that every culture has to do this so that humans don't fail and that the ancients don't wake up to destroy Earth. I felt the movie was OKAY. Not great, not scary, not stupid. But, Okay. It was definitely worth either Red-Boxing it or Netflix-ing it. But not seeing it in theaters.While I did semi-like it- I red-boxed it. And was glad I made that decision after hearing what people were saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin in the woods. What could go wrong?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alrighty. I saw trailers. I laughed at the title of the movie from thinking of the classic The Evil Dead. I had to see the movie. Not fully sure I knew what to expect when I went to see it. Wasn't too sure what I was walking into, a legit horror film or some dark comedy. Well as it turns out, from the beginning alone I saw it's mostly a dark comedy. From the very beginning to being introduce to the characters you know you won't be getting scared but laughing. Unless of course you are easily frighten. From the beginning to middle it was slow, I won't lie. I'd say character building. You could imagine what's going on from the start but the reason of, why??? You think it's another movie in the woods and college kids are gonna die. Once the end starts getting closer the movie picks up. And I believe from that alone that had me loving it. I knew what to expect but the ending still makes you think and laugh how they go and do it. So I have to give it 10/10. It made me laugh, got to know your characters. Confused you into what's going on. Turns into a slasher good time. And before you know it, the end just has you going. If you got an open mind, love to laugh, possibly get scared, who knows maybe even cry, I recommend it. I wasn't disappointed in anything about it. For a movie, sure it has certain moments. But hey what movie doesn't? Go and see it and check it out yourself. In my review, I loved it. A horror comedy about a cabin in the woods with a twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The cabin in the woods' (2012) is marvelously meta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a phoenix, every few years the horror genre requires a complete strip down and reboot. The category too frequently falls prey to monotony, employing the same tropes repeatedly. Characters are stereotypes, predictable scenarios abound, and the villain is somehow near-immortal. Wes Craven spectacularly lampooned this phenomenon with his horror-comedy series "Scream." However, as "Scream" began in the 90's, and was followed by a string of sequels, it was bound for an update. That came in 2012 as "The Cabin in the Woods," an enchantingly clever, self-aware comedy ripe with references to the horror genre."The Cabin in the Woods" opens with technicians Gary Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) in a lab, talking about a ritual. We then meet a group of college kids on their way to a vacation in a cabin, which (you guessed it) is nestled in the woods. There's Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), the resident good girl. Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz) plays the obligatory stoner. Curt Vaughn (Chris Hemsworth) is the group's resident jock. We have Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams) representing the nerds, and finally Jules Louden (Anna Hutchinson), the promiscuous one.It's difficult to describe the plot of "The Cabin in the Woods" without spoilers, so we'll instead concentrate on why the film is so spectacular. Like "Scream," it parodies the horror genre perfectly. Let's be honest, although there are plenty of awesome horror flicks, there are at least twice as many stale imitations. "The Cabin in the Woods" acknowledges the formula, with a familiar set up. A group of college student caricatures representing different factions band together to battle a supernatural force. It's very meta, and elicits a ton of laughs as we're well accustomed with the set up.However where the film really shines is in its ability to mock, while surprising and serving as a tribute. While certain aspects are definitely intended as a horror mad-libs, where we know exactly what's about to happen, there are several unforeseen happenings, including a major plot line. Furthermore, "The Cabin in the Woods" sought not only to criticize our fascination with gore fests, but also to pay homage to classic genre flicks: there are obvious "The Evil Dead" references, as well as recognizable "Hellraiser" tidbits, a nod to "The Ring," and even "The Shining." Watch the movie several times and maybe you'll pick up on half of the shoutouts. It's this ability to simultaneously question, and celebrate, out obsession with horror flicks that establishes "The Cabin in the Woods" as an utter masterpiece and revitalization of the genre we love so dearly.-- Mitchell "Moe" Long</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the first thing that i will say is that this film is very unique and is sort of a parody or homage to almost every genre of horror films ever made. You can not really take this film seriously. It is a parody but it is not the kind of Parody where its all funny and has tons of stupid jokes in it. It is a serious film but you could still see obvious nods to other films. I am not a big fan of horror films. i have not seen many but i saw this one because it is such a unique film and i'm getting bored of seeing films that are obviously made to be like a film that has already been made. You don't have to be a fan of horror films. you could be like me where u don't care for horror films. you should see this one because it is so original and because it has very strange plot twists. I personally dislike most horror films but like i said this is not really a horror film at all. it is a parody of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cabin In The Woods" is very much a "Scream 2.0", constantly playing around with genre conventions and actively mocking how wrong your expectations are. It starts of like any other slasher flick (five stereotypes go to the woods, do stupid things, get killed), but it's always hinting at the fact that sooner or later it'll start doing things differently. And when it delivers, it delivers in stride. The third act is beyond amazing, not just because it's so violent (blood and gore doesn't necessarily make a movie better) but because it surprises you over and over again with new twists while still making sense (within its own realm, at least). "Cabin In The Woods" is more than just a (past) hype or a gimmick, it's already one of the most original and thought-provoking horror movies of the (albeit still young) decade. It also gets bonus points for featuring the scariest clown in movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>new age propaganda movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film promised a lot and did not deliver.As many movies today is full of sh*t from the New Age Movement ideas . The stupidity is beyond limits and all it does it promotes pagan ideas. Basically the whole idea is this: "if pagan deities indeed are real, human sacrifice is logical and we should not be judgmental on people who adhere to those religions!". But I am getting ahead of myself. This is just the stupid impossible to enjoy end. I downloaded this movie to see a horror movie full of clichés. For me most of them are like comedy due to the stupidity of the actors. And the movies has a promising start in this matter. But then the movie twists and there are all the people that basically control everything in that gigantic movie set. And if this would have been all it would have been OK. There are tons of movies that play around the idea that some rich people find entertainment in the mutilation and murder of others (hostel for instance). It was a bit a disappointment because this was not what was promised, but it was livable. Towards the 2/3 of the movie another twist appears. We find out that people that constructed the facility did this because they believe that pagan deities will destroy the world if they did not. The movie value deprecated even more at this point, but it was still tolerable (in the end I wanted a movie full of clichés). But the end totally ruined it. The CGI hand that makes it look like the deities were real ruined it for me. If they just left at that. If there were some crazy dudes that worked for rich people with lots of money even crazier than themselves it would have been OK. But the movie maker wants to make a step more in twisting everything and makes the gods real.Also the sentence "Humanity must leave place for something else" has been overused by advocates for New Age Movement that have in plan removing more than 90% of the earth population because "we harm nature" so much that some people have become so brainwashed they actually believe in it. Of course they do not want to be themselves that die, but everyone else. It is a very disturbing movie indeed. Some claimed that the viewers are the gods. No, the pagan gods. , IE demons are the gods (the last screen shows a fire titan- I doubt any human has hands made of magma). I am tired of all this New Age pagan propaganda! I am tired of people defending witches and paganism and presenting in a favorable light! They kidnapped and killed people folks! All of them! And the witch hunt in Salem started because some of these pagans kidnapped and sacrificed kids. The horror of this made everyone suspect everyone.Witchcraft is never good, and pagans should be put in jail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror Movie with a Brilliant Twist...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really a fan of horror movies, because mostly they only scare me the first time I watch it, and watching it another time just proves to be ineffective simply because the scare factor is gone. However, this movie proves to be one of the rare exceptions. I've watched it 3 times already and still haven't gotten over it, probably never will. Usually I find horror movies like a bad nightmare, once I go through with it, it's just like I woke up with no recollection of what happened. But this movie really sticks, and I wouldn't mind watching it over and over again. The scare factor has already long gone after watching for a few times, but this movie is a blend of many things, which make it so memorable and entertaining to watch again. I think the concept and idea behind this movie is really different. It dares to break away from typical horror movies, comes in from other angles and projects interesting perspectives. There were times I thought whether I was watching a horror movie or not. Some scenes were simply brilliant and hilarious, where the fear and suspense could just instantly change into something funny to lighten the mood and ease all the tension. I particularly enjoyed watching the final parts of the movie, where all the monsters and unspeakable creatures were released and all hell breaks loose. I really rooted for the monsters this time, as there were so many of them showcasing their individuality and creative ways of killing. I really applaud the film crew for their creativity in assembling so many impressive monstrosities under one roof, making it a free for all killing spree that was truly entertaining and satisfying to watch. All I can say is this movie is a truly refreshing experience, as there are so many layers to it and different ways to interpret it. The ending kind of leaves everything open for debate, whether it's worth it to sacrifice a few lives to ensure all of humanity's existence, or all of humanity is too corrupted and deserves to be wiped out to start anew. I really think this horror movie is unlike any other, and all horror movie enthusiasts should definitely watch it at least once. It made me ponder on things, hope it does the same for you too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie. A Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great. If your a horror film fan it's a must see. However don't expect to be scared but surprised. It is a horror comedy but I give it very high points for being clever. This movie is not stupid funny but smart funny. Nearly all children will not understand it's comic appeal. Even though it has it's touch of fantasy behaviors and situations have logic behind them. You will not be saying "wtf what was obviously stupid" at any part. If you watched the trailer it does not give away any of the meat that makes up this movie. Just a couple of small potatoes. I say give this movie a try. I don't think anyone could possibly dislike this movie.After looking at many of the reviews I decided to edit mine. Do you like "Family Guy" over "American Dad"? Did you like "The Hang Over" over "Hot Tub Time Machine"? If you like "Family Guy" and "The Hang Over" the hang over. This is not for you. I left the theatre after I watched "The Hang Over" very disappointed. A typical copy paste comedy of nearly every teen comedy out there but with old people. "Family Guy" repeatative nonsense jokes that get old like a kid that keeps laughing at peek a boo. "American Dad" and "Hot Tub Time Machine" they have originality and witty jokes that take time to build. For these you need to be thoughtful and have patience to see how the joke comes together. In that kind of comedy you may have to remember a word from the beginning to see why it's funny at the end. "Family Guy" for instance has jokes with a 2 second punch line. While "American Dad" develops the joke through the entire episode with the punch line being the conclusion to the episode therefore the real joke is much more elaborate and detailed. Another example is "War of the Worlds". What would you do in such a crisis? It was a movie of survival not kick ass. In my mind it was very realistic and reflective. A good example of what a normal person would do durring an apocalypse. Defend their family as far as they can. Totally under rated. If you can't see it then I say good luck understanding life. You'll live with tunnel vision not understanding even half the world around you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect in so many ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible to say very much meaningful about this film without spoilers, so be warned."Cabin in the Woods" is an outstandingly clever and well-put-together film which I think succeeds at everything it sets out to do. It's taken me a while to get around to seeing it, so the film had a formidable reputation to live up to, which for me, it did.The basic premise is familiar to the point of banality: five American college students encompassing typical horror movie stereotypes set out to spend a weekend in a secluded cabin in the wilderness. In what follows, writer Joss Whedon and director Drew Goddard pay homage to, lampshade, subvert, and riff on a wide variety of horror movie tropes.The film neatly breaks down into two parts: the first plays almost straight as the movie that it's set up to be, with the college students being gruesomely picked off one at a time by zombie hillbillies. Despite its utter (intended) predictability, this is extraordinarily well-made, with much more naturalistic dialogue and performances than are the norm for slasher films. Indeed, if this had really been all there was to "The Cabin in the Woods", it would probably still have acquired cult status as maybe the most artfully made example of the genre.The second half breaks the fourth wall of the original narrative (literally at some points) and tells a bigger story. This larger plot is a little less hackneyed than the slasher plot, but still never wanders far from its Lovecraftian roots. Again, the joy here is both in the skill of the execution, and in the makers' unmistakable knowledge of and respect for their material. The finale is far more Japanese than American, but Japanese horror has also been referenced throughout the film. Everything here works.This is a horror film in its own right -- it's not parody. If you don't know or don't like that genre, there probably won't be much here for you. For everyone else, this is an absolute must-see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie that makes fun of horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people do not understand that this movie is a satire - it makes fun of horror movies (and maybe more). the characters are all horror-movie clichés (and most of the scenes). and that's the fun part of it. It's the right movie for those who are not huge fans of horror movies (like me). The truth is that this movie is just really, really, hilarious. If you're one of those who didn't like it at all, then you're probably not a Joss Whedon fan.But me: I love satires. I love Joss Whedon. The movie was awesome. I loved it so much that I sat through the credits. and watched it again. it's that good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films- one of those gems- you don't want to watch too many times for fear of ruining it for next time, like The Shawshank Redemption, or Pulp Fiction. An original opening, with it's understated office worker setting, title appearance and introduction to the protagonists. Every character seems to be a perfect fit. Excellent casting- Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford especially. Flawless acting. Superb, witty dialogue. A brilliant storyline with refreshing twists. I couldn't stop smiling from about half-way through. A few minutes later, I was holding my girlfriend's hand- not because I was scared- just because I was so excited to see what was coming next. When we reached the denouement, I just didn't want it to be a let down -Please don't ruin the film- It didn't. It was nothing I would've thought of and easily one of the best endings to ANY film- let alone a horror film. We've all seen the 'cabin in the woods' films before, but this one leaves them all behind, even the greats, such as The Evil Dead and... well, Evil Dead 2. This is 'The Evil Dead' meets 'Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil'. The monsters seem to be revitalised in this film. Like new. Nothing clichéd. I'm tempted to put in spoilers, but I don't think I need to. If you've seen the film, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't seen the film- watch it! It's full of jumps, frights, surprises, twists, laughter... and a little bit of Japan. Hilarious. You root for the kids and you root for the office guys. You even root for the monsters (and Mordecai- the Gas Station Guy). This film is nothing like what you might be expecting, or even dreading, This is not the Evil Dead remake. This is a piece of art that should be appreciated for the genius it is. It's No.12 in my all-time list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has the tendency to make people mad, and I can see why. You pay $15 bucks to go see a horror movie to get scared. When the movie doesn't give you what you expect, you end up hating it, because you feel like it tricked you into seeing it in the first place.This is the only way I can explain why the haters are so freaking passionate about hating this particular movie. (There is another way, but I don't want to inadvertently insult someone I don't know.)I recommend this movie for people who have a particular fondness for cult movies, but people shouldn't watch this movie if:1. They don't like thinking about movies, and how they relate to other movies.If you are the type of person who likes to be passively entertained by media, and are not at all interested in any kind of intellectual interaction, then you will not like this movie.2. They don't accept Alien as an entry in the horror movie genre.Some people think of Alien as Sci-Fi, but it is actually a slasher movie set in space. Everything about the genre fits, right down to the "last girl" character. If you can't accept this, then you will not like this movie. 3. They can't tell "bad acting" from directorial choice.This one actually makes me upset when I read other peoples reviews. If you can't see that the characters in this movie are intentionally two dimensional to make a point, (in most modern horror they are unintentionally two dimensional, out of laziness) then you should never ever be in the same room with me, because I do not want to share my oxygen with you, and you should also never see this movie.4. They wear a fedora, and think it's cool.This one should be self explanatory, but just to break it down. If you fancy yourself to be a connoisseur of film, have an opinion about everything, talk more than you listen, have no friends, and on a general basis think that you know what you're talking about and consequently never question your undeniably omniscient self, then you will probably not like this movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plenty of killings, blood and gore, The Cabin in The Woods is ideal for any horror film fanatic. Despite the unknown cast, except for Chris Hemsworth (Thor and Avengers Assemble) the quality of acting is superb and introduces the audience to stars of the future. 5 teenage friends wanting to get away for a weekend of sex, drugs and rock n roll. You'd of thought that this would be something simple, relaxing and fun, but thanks to two sick and sadistic technicians it is turned into a weekend of brutal killings and suffering. The five teenagers set off for a weekend in a secluded cabin in the woods. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no way of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open, they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of objects but when one of the women, Dana, reads from a book she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. However, there is far more going on as the campers are under observation. Kristen Connolly plays the role of Dana who is the more mature member of the group but still likes having a good time. Chris Hemsworth plays Curt, Curt is the stereotypical high school jockey that likes girls, sport and drinking. Anna Hitchison plays Jules, Jules is the "dumb blonde" who is young and ready to party. Fran Kranz plays the role of Marty who is the stoner of the group, he turns out to be a very vital part of the film although you wouldn't think that from the first sight of him. Jesse Williams plays Holden, Holden is also a jock but he takes pride in his education. He is invited on the trip in an attempt to hook up with Dana. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford play the roles of Sitterson and Hadley. These are the two technicians who are observing the group, there night doesn't end how they hoped it would. The Director of the film Drew Goddard, also known for Cloverfield, Lost and Alias has done a stupendous job whilst making The Cabin In The Woods compared to Cloverfield which didn't get the best of feedback. He has redeemed himself with the making of this film which is good because he has a real talent for directing horror/ thriller films. The Cabin In The Woods is now available on DVD and Blu Ray in all entertainment shops and websites. If you have not yet watched this film I strongly advise that you do. It is a superb story and is a new beginning to the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five college kids - the jock, the party girl, the innocent girl, the hippie and the nerd - all decide to spend a holiday on a remote cabin, swimming, grilling, drinking, all around partying. Yet all is not as it seems.Sound familiar? Yes, it's the done-to-death, classical B-horror movie plot about young adults getting into trouble, with lots of gore, screaming and the dumb blond always dies first. Am I right? And dare I guess that you honestly couldn't care less about another one? Luckily for you, this film is not just another B-horror movie. It's all that and more. With The Cabin in the Woods, director Joss Whedon delves into one of his all time favourite genres, yet he's not content just directing a really good scream fest. He knows the genre inside out, he knows all the tricks, all the clichés, all the conventions, and just like with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, he wants to take all these and turn them upside down while still staying true to them.I cannot really say it otherwise, this movie is amazing. It plays all the clichés right from the very start, except when it suddenly veers into the exact opposite direction, only to immediately pounce back when you least expect it. It's a constantly surprising, constantly thrilling and constantly exciting roller coaster of jokes, hidden meanings, lampshade hangings and parodies. And yet it's a fine horror movie in its own right. It's that and more.And that's pretty much all I can say about the movie without spoiling your fun. On the technical side of thing, I have no complaints. It's well-acted, well-shot, well-produced film, but its biggest value lies in its vision, its idea that's all Whedon. Trust me, if you're a fan of horror, you owe it to yourself to watch this film. You've never seen anything quite like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've read much H.P. Lovecraft you will understand this movie. There is a race of Ancient Gods, or Great Old Ones, or whatever, lurking just underneath our perception. They are "dead but dreaming" down there, waiting for the moment when they will be released to rule, or kill, the human race. There is a cult of humans trying to keep the Ancient Gods down, or perhaps trying to release them. Some poor soul says the wrong words and releases one of the Great Old Ones. Use your bloodiest imagination to fill in the rest. It's all rather nonsensical, but if you suspend your disbelief for a few pages you will lose sleep over it. If you are young and impressionable it might scare the crap out of you.What this movie does is to techify Lovecraft's idea and then take it further than Lovecraft himself ever took it.

I realize it's suppose to be a commentary about the state of horror movies, but the monster chase scenes seemed a little too "low budget movie" for my liking. They weren't exactly scooby doo, but they weren't scary or very suspenseful either. If this was different the movie easily would have been a 9 or maybe 10 out of 10.

Thought it was a clever spin on the quite predictable horror genre and that kept my attention throughout the whole film. It was obviously completely unbelievable and ridiculous in a lot of ways but hey I can suspend reality for a few hours if you can entertain me. And this film did just that. There were some good kills, some good sex, some funny dialog, and of course a spooky ass cabin. I would of liked even more kills, more sex, and better dialog but hey it was pretty decent. My biggest complaint was the monsters seemed way too unbelievable and way too powerful. Who created these? Humans? Or the earth demons? Why would they not die? That was the main complaint for me. But still gave the film a thumbs up. I recommend it as a good rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I know Joss Whedon very well from reputation, the only things of his that are distinctly Whedon I've seen (Serenity and a couple episodes of Firefly) I haven't enjoyed, but I'm always willing to give him a chance. The Cabin In The Woods plays on the formula and expectations of contemporary horror films, pandering to them, rather than breaking them, creating a film that is comedy before horror - with only one genuinely scary scene. It's part tribute, part criticism of the genre, celebrating and berating the clichés with its humour. It's true strengths, beyond the twists and surprises that sometimes don't deliver, are the characterisations that it plays with. It's littered with great personality, particularly with its stoner character, played by Fran Kranz, and the reliable chemistry emitted from Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins. Its frequent satire alleviates the tension, making it thoroughly entertaining but not as intense or engaging as it could be, playing it safe in its self-awareness. While it's not quite as good as some people are making it out to be, The Cabin In The Woods attempts to be the ultimate horror film, and succeeds in some parts, if just in the mainstream contemporary-American part.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this film and though I was skeptical given the title and the look, I cannot express how absolutely pleasantly surprising this film is. I will try not to give it away, but know this ? this is not another slashed in the woods movie! Rather think of Clive Barker's Night Breed or the original Hellraiser. Then you have Cabin In The Woods ? the new generation alternative genre film. I call this an alternative genre, because without being uncertain what it wants to be ? it knows exactly what it is ? it is a film that breaks the borders of genre and the conventional. The acting is surprisingly adequate and the cinematography is really up to standard. The special effects are good and the sets and costume leaves nothing to be desired. None of these are above excellence, but all up to standard. Then comes the plot. It is fast paced, unexpected and completely new. The story delves into human fear and more than just individual fear. It delves into a primal fear of the...well, you will have to watch it to see what I mean. Do not judge this film by the first 45 minutes. It is setting you up for a much larger picture to come. I love that nothing is given away too soon yet you are not left wondering what the hell is going on the whole time. Really good balance, timed just right with all the right mechanisms of storytelling in just the right place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no way to describe this movie without spoiling the plot for someone. Easy to say this is not a typical horror movie you were lead to believe it is. Horror/Sci-Fi/Comedy/Action...that is the only way I can attempt to describe this film. There are things I wanted to see earlier on in the film, that I was thrilled to see happen towards the end. For that, I give it a lot of credit. Everyone keeps saying it was "inspired" by 5 or 6 other movies, and maybe it is, but who cares. It is it's own film and unique in its own right. I was not blown away though. It was good for plenty of laughs, and surprises, and the comedy in this film is excellently woven into a gory action flick. I want so much to go into detail about it, but I will ruin it. Don't watch the trailers, don't talk to people who have seen this movie, don't think about it.

I don't believe this movie was even made with a satire in mind but that it was just labeled so when it became apparent that it doesn't work.

		<fullReview>I would have rated it 8/10 up to the last few seconds of the movie. It's a nice homage to a lot of the classic genres and archetypes. Some people seem to miss the point that it is supposed to be predictable - almost comfortable - the game is too see how many story lines you can pick up on. But the ending takes it off the charts. I struggle to remember when last an US-made movie had the guts to show that particular choice being made. People with a slightly cynical outlook on life should love it. The acting is what it should be; campy and semi-serious, and the special effects are at times almost stage like in simplicity. The movies simultaneously slams the genre it belongs to, and contributes to it. I cannot see this one working for casual horror watchers; this one is for the fans. Especially for the subset that has been longing for more realistic endings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am shocked some people are giving this 1 or 2 stars. I have definitely seen movies that hold far less entertainment or production value than this.That being said, this movie was poor. Not scary nor funny, not intriguing? certainly rushed. The positive of the film was it definitely kept you wondering where exactly it was going to end? but that's all there was to it. Literally everything in the film was mediocre at best. I would not exactly put this into the horror genre and if you are expecting a solid horror film I don't even think that's what the film was aiming at. It is something of a black comedy with a horror tribute, but the general underlying statement is a poor attempt at thought provoking drama. I suppose the problem is that the movie is too confused to be good.Clocking in at only around 90 minutes, you won't suffer through this for long. I wouldn't ever recommend it? but if there's nothing else on TV I suppose it is watchable.At the time of me writing this the movie has a 7.1 rating on IMDb and I am baffled. I have seen some excellent films clocking in at around 7 to 7.5. This movie is at very best a star below that, at its worst three stars. I think a 5 feels pretty good.</fullReview>

If you're reading this review and planning on seeing the film, then I wouldn't read too much into it as I did this and it ruined it a little bit for me as I knew the ending! Having said that, the movie was still not what I expected and the 'silly' ending, I found not to be so silly as it does fit into the movie.*SPOILER* People may say there are clichés, but they are meant to be there, the movie has purposely been made in this way, and the group of people have been 'chosen' because of who they are and the type of people they are. *END SPOILER*Overall, I would recommend the movie, don't expect it to be scary, because it's not, but expect the unexpected, laughs, and surprises. Enjoy the movie, and don't take it too seriously!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meaningless movie full with Violence, Murdering, Bloodshed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a movie about spy , detective, etc, but I was wrong. This movie is showing Zombies, Bloodshed, Murderers, Tortures, Death and expression of people enjoying such activities. In the end there is no meaning about this movie.Just like the Bible says, in the last era humans love violence, this represents the movie writers, directors,actors, and audience who loves it. Stay away from this movie and those people..You will feel sick, disturbed and full of negative emotions when you see this. Don't waste your time. Protect yourself from this violence idea.</fullReview>

It's just very hard for me to imagine one can actually like this (kind of) film.In the cinema where I was watching it, most people seemed / sounded to feel awkward during the whole film.

		<shortDescription>Cabin In the Woods (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this soon to be cult classic, a group of five college stereotypes head off to a deserted cabin located in the woods for a long weekend of relaxation. But, soon after arriving, they learn that they are there for a higher power.This movie was fantastic, when I first heard of it, it sounded very generic. But, looking back, all of my friends who recommended it to me were in the right place, as spoiling the film would tarnish the experience. What mainly interested me in the film, was the Joss Wheadon-isms to it, his trademark writing is what makes the film so much better for what is, and what it should be, a great horror film for future generations.The ending is best not spoiled, but once you learn it, your respect for horror will be completely rebirthed.I give the film a 10.5 ticket stub, happily I might add!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found out about this movie after I searched for some more new horror and a friend said to me that it's a good movie. After what I've seen it I've convinced that it is a good movie ... to be thrown in the trash. I can't believe that Richard Jenkins, a good actor that I've seen in The Visitor (that is a very successful film) and Six Feet Under, appeared in this mess. Especially the role played by researcher who makes jokes about the situation together with other fellow dragging the image characters and with what weapons will be destroyed protagonists. He more played in dramas but this movie did not match. When I saw those two still remaining alive in the elevator who no longer know where he appeared, in the basement of the cabin, I immediately thought of The Cube. The only difference is that there is no location where are the actors and we do not know where the action is carried out and how they got there, while here we know they have leave home with a caravan and went on a country road and into the woods. And the cube is one of the best SF movies ever. When one of them was hit by the invisible wall in front of him, almost I was amused, from where a wall in the middle of the woods? And later on with all those monsters, again was fun. Then I was reminded of the films of the Alien franchise. I think the Director didn't knew what to fill the 90 minutes of the movie and said to put walls, all manner of creatures, but apparently it does not work, simply does not work. If you saw the players flying with a rocket in space may so it would have been more believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hemsworth shines in otherwise derivative slasher film (with computer-game concept added as a twist)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CABIN IN THE WOODS (2011) is the (horror) film that Australian beefcake Chris Hemsworth managed to appear in just before rising to stardom, in the same year, with the blockbuster THOR. Easily enough like other slasher films where the young (often goodlooking) leads get killed one by one (a very old premise, used by Dame Agatha Christie in her 1939 AND THEN THERE WERE NONE a.k.a. TEN LITTLE INDIANS), director Drew Goddard and writer Joss Whedon add their own twist by mixing a horror theme with a computer-game concept, where the "test subjects" are led on to a grisly adventure as the technicians control the whole environment, but inevitably things get out of hand. Mix Sean Penn's film THE GAME with SCREAM, or something like that. In a nutshell, Hemsworth and his friends wander around the titular cabin, where they unwittingly unleash a horde of zombies... who simply won't die! CABIN IN THE WOODS suffers from shoddy cinematography (Peter Deming), wide-eyed acting by the two female leads (Anna Hutchison, Kristen Connolly) and a bizarre concept, and as a whole has the feel of a 1970s B movie. Only the presence of Richard Jenkins (as one of the technicians) and the surprise appearance of Sigourney Weaver, and Chris Hemsworth's performance, raise this slasher film notches above others of its ilk. You can easily see star quality in Hemsworth, only 28 when he made this (and when he appeared in THOR immediately after) with this early title in his filmography.</fullReview>

But in reality they are in a science experiment. We learn that a bunch of betting, goofy scientists have planned their trip to the woods without them knowing. And when the 2 survivors learn the truth, it gets really bloody and blows your mind as to what is really going on. And how are the Japanese kids so smart. I liked the originality of it all.FINAL VERDICT: Different, a unique twist on a horror story. If you like lots of blood, check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Something New for a Change, but Still a Let-down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I am a big naysayer of stereotypical American horror flicks. I usually hate them for being all the same with no plots, stereotypical characters, tying to appeal with visual gore or startling the audience off-guard. That said, this movie was definitely something new that had to offer more than a typical horror flick. The movie expressly acknowledges the stereotypes of horror flicks, and there are few times in the movie that were genuinely interesting/intimidating/entertaining. However, being something new does not make a movie a great one. The plot still felt shallow with many elements that gave me the impression that they were just simply made up on the fly and put together and characters that one simply could not sympathize with.Overall, it did succeed to differentiate from the usual horror flick, but it left too much to be desired.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Cabin in the Woods (2011)" -- not your average Zombie Movie -- A Review!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cabin in the Woods (2011)" is definitely not your average zombie movie. It's not even your average horror or sci-fi movie.How to describe it? It's like "The Evil Dead" meets "Night of the Living Dead" meets "The Immortals..." meets "The Truman Show." 5 young folks suit up in their best summer-wear, hop in buddy's dad's RV, and head out to a cousin's cabin... in the woods.All of the prerequisite character types are included: the Jock, the Braniac, the Stoner, the Sexy (just turned) Blonde and of course, the Virgin.These roles become more and more stereotypical as the movie continues-- but that in no way detracts from this being one of the most creative, well scripted; at times hilarious, and at other times horrifying films I've seen in years-- and it's not just because it has zombies. Actually it has a whole "redneck torture family of zombies"... who use weapons! Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are absolutely fantastic in their roles -- a little jaded about their work, going through the motions-- but, eh... it's a living. Anybody notice the "rookie" (shall we call him the summer intern) was named Truman. Coincidence? I think NOT! All of the kids are more than respectable as terrified late-teenagers, especially Fran Kranz as Marty, the constantly stoned wise-cracker. It's his stoner mind that starts to actually put things together-- except, is this sh*t really happening or is he just stoned? Marty Marty Marty.This was one of Fran's first movies-- and I predict we will see a lot more of him.There are more twists and bizarre turns than a really warped Penrose Stairscase! If you think you've got it all figured out, just keep watching. About every ten minutes you'll change your mind. And in the final climactic scene, there is such a smörg?sbord of violence and chaos that I wanted to stand up and cheer! Joss Whedon's quippy dialogue is a pleasure! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror as a Warhol-esque Prank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cabin in the Woods", directed by comic book geek god Joss Whedon, is the first postmodern horror movie to go mainstream. Whereas Jason was slow walking, and Leatherface was so one-dimensional about his killing, all the villains you'll meet in The Cabin in the Woods are faster, deadlier, in amazing 3D/CGI, and unfortunately for horror film purists, a whole generation removed from visceral terror.The Cabin in the Woods opens with a two-way fourth wall premise: our protagonists are being watched and their fate is being decided upon by some master manipulator. While the story has its own sci-fi logic, keeping within mainstream continuity, the film maker's gag is clear: we, the audience, are the ones who are ultimately deciding the fates of these less than lovable characters. We control the monsters, the demons, and the deformed murderous hillbillies that bring on the bloody conflict. The tongue-in-cheek story goes well beyond traditional horror formula and satirizes its own grim machinations, as well as the entire genre.Horror and GoreThe gore level and scare tactics are moderate at best, though it's not exactly mom-friendly. What horror fans will love about the movie is that it does poke fun at many well known horror movie icons and clichés. The best screen villains are caricatured and set loose on our fleeing protagonists building up to a ludicrous but hilarious conclusion where the entire earth "jumps the shark" so to speak. Catching all the incisive inside jokes, as they fly besides or over your head, will be a treat. However, the smarter-than-thou approach to the genre is not for all tastes, and may very well kill the suspense for you--that is if you still find the idea of one lone axe murderer scary. How to Watch ItWith friends and on a big screen TV. Talking about the movies Joss parodies is half the fun.</fullReview>

But then, a turn of events and then the seriousness of the movie starts to reveal itself ( if only they spent more time on developing that part of the movie) anyways, i like the several minutes leading up to the ending, it made me think of the what ifs and i wanted to see what each ghost and monsters abilities were but they were just touch and go.

		<fullReview>With so much hype around the originality of this film, and worse, coming with high critical acclaim, it had me bursting with anticipation.This was arguably the worst film I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Drawn in by critics remarking how "clever" it was and how it "really turns the horror genre on its head", I was desperate to see it. Eminem once released an album where he mocked anyone who was stupid enough to part with money to buy it. The same kind of cynicism pervades The Cabin in the Woods.It's a story about a group of 5 college kids, who, unbeknownst to them, fit five categories of personality type. They think they are going away for the weekend to a remote mountain cabin, owned by a cousin. The cabin, and the area around it, is an environment, controlled in every respect, by a covert organisation, located deep under the ground beneath it. Everything taking place above ground is watched by the people controlling such factors as temperature, lighting and even latent air pheromone concentration. Get the picture?In essence it's a movie within a movie and the underground organisation is watching reality TV. But to what end? The department work on behalf of some Gods who need these kids to die, one by one, and in a specific order. While some factors are being controlled, the kids make their own choices, outside of the control of the "puppeteers". If these kids don't die, or they don't die in the right order, the Gods get angry and could, indeed, destroy the world if their sacrificial needs are not met.How exactly do the kids die? No less than a family of zombies rising up from the ground, proceeding to wreak havoc, killing three of the five kids. At this point my heart truly sank. Zombies? Puh-lease! If zombies weren't enough, the film would not be complete if there was no mention made of the veritable menagerie of beasts and mythical creatures held captive in glass cages. When pandemonium ensues on accidental release of them all, it comes as no surprise that a bloodbath results. In a quirkily humorous moment, a unicorn gores a man repeatedly against a wall with its horn! More shocking is an actress with a respectable reputation appearing in a small role towards the end, Sigourney Weaver. What made her think this was a good film to appear in? Her moment is fleeting, nevertheless, bemusing.This film is marketed as a spoof, like the Scream series. What it succeeds in doing is slapping it's audience in the face. Yes, it's a spoof but it's not funny and it is anything but original. It's cynical and boring. It's as if writers Joss Whedon and writer-director Drew Goddard thought, "You like a horror film? We know who you are, what you like and this is what you deserve!" It really feels like a hoax played on the audience stupid enough to pay money to see it. It's so bad, you can't even call it mediocre. For most of it's short ninety minutes, I could not wait for it to end.The only really clever thing about it is the marketing! Absolutely atrocious!</fullReview>

The characters would you believe it or not are exactly the same as in every other horror film, boring to watch. I actually felt like I was going to fall asleep watching this film, that was until they went to the underground facility. The movie sky rocketed with entertainment, there were so many monsters and people getting torn apart, I couldn't believe all the crazy stuff was actually happening, the last twenty minutes were a horror fans dream. If only the movie would have taken place in the brightly lite facility, instead of the dark forest. I guess the fact that the facility workers were all celebrating while the woman was getting beaten by the creature was somewhat unsettling. I didn't find the movie to be clever in anyway.Over all the film wasn't as great as everyone said it was in my opinion, if you want to watch a movie that takes place in a cabin your best bet is The Evil Dead or it's remake that is coming out.</fullReview>

It's a limp-wristed attempt to cash in on the SCREAM formula, with a dash of WESTWORLD thrown into the mix. In the process, it manages the amazing feat of dumbing down the old SCOOBY-DOO cartoons- a show made for American children with Special Needs! At no point in the proceedings- not ONCE- did I feel empathy for ANY of the cardboard cut-outs; the unleashing of the cgi didn't make it any easier to sympathize with them, either. (It's yet another of those man-versus-cgi scenarios that leaves one wondering just what the **** the filmmakers were thinking when they conceived it.) Giver a pass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING HUGE SPOILERS!This movie was, first of all, strange (not in a good way, though).It tried to be a mix of horror, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy... while it was none of them. First, it had many plot holes, a thing which I could've gone over with, if that was all. Second, the most interesting character (that old guy at the gas station), which I thought would play an important part in the story was there just for the sake of it. Third, why (OH WHY?) would a bunch of people make bets, joking and laughing about some silly kids dying? I mean, even if there is a "great" purpose of saving the entire humanity (blah, blah), why would you be so happy about killing? Fourth, if in all other countries the operation failed and the faith of humanity rests in their hands, why don't they seem at least a bit stressed? Fifth, what started to look like a decent horror, ended miserably when all those creatures were released from their cells; they looked like a bunch of cartoony monsters with non-realistic blood. And if they were all a bunch of brainless creatures, why were they killing only human beings? Why weren't they killing each other, I mean, they weren't all the same species?... Sixth, there is no such thing as character development, no sort of compassion for any of the characters, no nothing. Just 5 stereotypical kids which happen to die very fast, with 2 of them surviving and smoking relaxed a joint (after one of them was supposedly torn by a werewolf) while assisting to the world's end. WHAT? Seventh, it had some lame comedy parts; but the real problem is that, while I didn't laugh at all at the comedy parts, I laughed at the so called horror parts.And the list could go on, and on, and on...Maybe there's a greater meaning to this movie, which I failed to figure out. But again, maybe not.Mediocre. No matter how I wish, I can't give it more than that. 4/10</fullReview>

It starts as a dumb teen horror flick but then ?mutates" into something that looks like a Truman show rip-off only to end up like nothing you have ever seen before. It's an astonishingly original genre mix that is multi layered in its storyline as well as in its ideas and plays clever with clichés, stereotypes and archetypes.It's thrilling from beginning to end; full of ideas - sometimes too many to handle - you keep guessing what way the movie will turn and - unlike so many movies these days - you're not going to be right, not even in the last minute. Of course it's not flawless: Maybe at times it is just over the top, I mean flashy exaggeration of gore ? in the best tradition of American movies.One could say it's a typical movie of our times because it is a synthesis of sociocultural phenomenons such as game and reality shows, big brother voyeurism, video games and phony politicians. It is in fact a cleverly disguised satire of all these phenomenons and at the same time a satire of its main genre, the horror movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It starts of like all the rest of the stupid boring thrash monster movies of the past few decades, the story is predictable, nothing is scary just gallons of blood... and that's the point!!!!Ah for a horror movie fan like myself this movie was just eye candy once I understood what's going on, I just couldn't stop laughing! Awesome piece of work, but I was quite surprised that almost half the cinema gave the movie a big BOO at the end, I mean seriously??? Obviously they didn't see the point of the movie, it's a metaphor as big as the planet itself!!! I mean for any horror movie fan who watches it and says ''I don't get it'', he should throw himself out of the window!Anyway this is a movie any horror movie fan should go and see, it's bound to make them laugh and answer all the questions they once asked when seeing dumb B movies, and after all - the audience that BOOed the movie and wrote bad reviews here are the angry Gods themselves, aren't they?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, here we have it, the other big Whedon film released in 2012.This one could've fared a bit better in the sense that it packed more surprises for the viewer. Problem is, before those surprises come along, we're subjected to a rather conventional horror structure. A group of unsympathetic youngsters venture out to a cabin in the deep, isolated woods, and weird stuff happens that changes their entire day for the worse. Throughout the story, the film cuts back and forth between the youngsters and a mysterious facility later revealed to be underneath the cabin, which we quickly realize is filled with folks who are not only aware of the youngsters' location, but are watching their every move and collecting their blood when they die for a sacrifice detailed at the end of the film. Creepy and interesting, but like with the youngsters, Whedon's dialogue is more corny than it is funny, a far-cry from some of his other work. Drew Goddard's direction was iffy at best. He doesn't seem capable of keeping up with the action and filming it in a way that is both coherent and sustains your interest. His direction improves at the end, where the entire film gets better, but too often are there moments where I got the sense that he didn't know where to place his camera.The actual scenes involving the youngsters, for the most part, are as standard as they come. Whedon tried his best to mix things up a little, specifically in a scene involving "Truth or Dare", but by the end, you realize all that nonsense was nothing but build-up to the main event, and quite a main even it is. Without giving anything away for those who haven't seen it, I'll just say that it raises the quality of an otherwise dull film drastically, not only because it is unexpected, but because it keeps going long after one would expect the film to come to a close. Whedon could've easily had the film end right after the two survivors are revealed to be in the middle of several different creatures in the facility we see throughout the film, but that would've been lazy and not satisfying enough. Instead, he kept the excitement building from there to reach one of the most memorable finales in any film this year.It's just a shame that the rest of the film wasn't as strong. Instead of giving us characters to care for, we're given caricatures with little to no personality, so when all of them are killed of, it's really hard to give a care. Our two survivors' final moment is needlessly contrived and without meaning because of this and the fact that the characterizations simply were not there. Thus, we're given Terminator 3.5 instead of an affecting and powerful closer. Whedon should know better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Badass gore, but too typical and confusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't like this; in fact, I found myself huffing and puffing throughout it. First of all, the characters are too typical (the whore, the nerd, the jock, and the shy virgin). It's also so American. I mean, I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but as an English girl, it irritates me because it's so cheesy. The couple that ALWAYS have to get naked and make out whenever they get the opportunity. And to be fair, if my girlfriend was dancing like that and flirting that strongly with other girls, I'd tell her off a little.Enough about the characters, let's get onto the main aesthetics of the movie. The setting is pretty typical and the acting isn't the best I've seen - Hemsworth was a let down. I feel like they also revealed what was going on too soon and there seemed to be two plots - the second of which was revealed right at the end. The second one to me, wasn't needed and just left me confused. However, I will say, the whole idea was pretty good and unique and featured some bad ass deaths. It was like a cross between Hatchet and thirteen ghosts. Therefore, making it resemble a horror/Sci-fi film. I know this review is short but I don't really know what to say about it! I'd recommend it for fans of Hatchet/thirteen ghosts as I just pointed out, but not Chris Hemsworth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the idea of this movie.Perhaps this material would have been better suited for Adam Green or Sam Raimi.It's very difficult to discuss this film without giving away plot-points, and I'm not going to do that.It had some comedic moments, which I enjoyed, but the film didn't come anywhere close to meeting my expectations.I watched a slightly average Aussy horror flick last night that was better than this, "The Loved One's"(6/10), only without the hype. I can tell you that the idea of the film is a 10/10... where do you think the other aspects of this film sit for me to rank it 5.7/10?They barely tapped into a brilliant story, and seemed totally lost in how to finish this thing. The entire set-up of the main characters needs re-written and re-shot, and it really starts the movie off with a huge THUD. I think the ultimate explanation or 'purpose' of the storyline is a bit ridiculous, and could have been better explained away(as it so terribly was), or justified(another "you'll have to see it' statement).This brilliant 'idea' will split audiences. Some will gush over the idea itself, but I believe the idea only takes a movie so far. Perhaps the films humor will eventually open my heart to give this film a re-watch, but not any time soon.Sorry I feel the need to say it,... this film is a little over-rated. Not a lot. A little. It isn't a terrible movie, but it also isn't a 7.3 movie either.. Perhaps my expectations here are affecting my score a little bit. BUT, I love the horror genre. I believe this falls into the very average horror category,.. near the likes of the "My Bloody Valentine 3D" remake or "Silent Hill", and not like the posthumously honored cult-classic that we were told it was upon release.57/100You'll like this if you liked: Cabin Fever(slightly better), Silent Hill(about even), Cube(slightly better), Zombieland(better), or Dylan Dog(worse).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER FREE (mostly)Cabin in the Woods is a movie who's success depends largely on how much you pretend the core joke is funny. For me, It was funny as in smirk funny, but not really LOL funny. For some people, this will be a riot. For others, a stale shaggy dog story. I'm a little in the middle.On the surface this is In the Mouth of Madness meets Army of Darkness. I don't think it's as threatening a premise as the former or as charming as the latter, but it does burn 90 minutes with some occasionally creative touches. Maybe this is more Evil Dead meets Buffy. Is it SAW meets Blade? Or is it Event Horizon meets Big Brother? All of the above. That's the whole point. The "monster's ball" of mayhem sequence is probably the most riotous fun of Cabin in the Woods, but the rest of the movie doesn't quite hold up. The ending especially is pretty flat. The rest of the film builds so much to it and it feels like Goddard and Whedon forgot that in referencing so much other material, they really need to write something good of their own. The whole thing feels as disposable as a Big Mac container. There was a better last 2 or 3 minutes instead of what/who they threw up there before the credits roll. Or they ran out of money, which is a possibility.You could do worse, but I've already heard this joke a few times and it was better told and more entertaining when Kevin Williamson called it Scream.</fullReview>

Since the beginning you can tell what the rest of the movie is going to be about. In some parts of the movie the viewer is left a bit confused. The ending is pretty predictable. A little comedy is incorporated in the movie.If your looking for a bloody and gory type of movie go for it but don't expect to get truly scared or completely intrigued by the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of witless teens travel for a weekend out in the woods, only to find that they are being hunted and killed by a malevolent evil which might not be all that it seems.It is a difficult line to tread, to both intellectually engage your audience whilst ultimately giving them what they want. Meta-horror has experienced a checkered and relatively unsuccessful life since Wes Craven re-opened the box with New Nightmare. Subsequently, we have been treated to such delights as Scream, Behind The Mask, Trick R Treat but for every (relatively) successful movie we have had to sit through dirge like 'The Cabin In The Woods'. Its a movie that seems to revel in thought of its clued in audience pointing and laughing, picking up its silly and needless references to better movies. It forgoes any weight and intensity to firmly pat its own back. Its a movie that seems to forget about the genre its poking fun at, whereas the best meta-horror (or self aware horror movies) are the ones that can equally scare and pick apart. Behind The Mask is a good example of a movie that shatters the veneer of the slasher movie whilst actually being a great slasher movie.OK, the central premise is quite enjoyable and well conceived but the screenplay it has sprung is lifeless and uninspired. The writing is subversive and hokey to a fault for example, the scene in which the twisted hill-billy is on speaker-phone serves only to break the film entirely and is insultingly mis-placed. I liked the idea of the 'directors' changing the characters to fit the mould of a horror movie but it was done too obviously. Maybe this idea (or its execution) would have worked much better as a short film or even as a mini series. Indeed, it seems that the humour and some of the ideas are lifted straight from Whedons other creations such as Buffy and Angel. Within that format there is much more scope to be inflammatory or tonally subversive as you can just pick up the normal story arc next week (the musical episode in Buffy is perhaps the best representation of this). I think in cinema this has to be more subtle or cleverer or else you alienate your audience. By the end of the picture, i didn't care one sh*t for either character or what was going to happen to the world if the cinematic tropes weren't fulfilled, i was just praying for the curtains to roll.It is clear then that 'The Cabin In The Woods' left me cold. It wasn't overtly funny enough nor was it innovative in its scares to warrant its tidy billing and after all is said and done, it was just another good idea chopped up and left for dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, the reviews I've read here about this movie surprised me a hell of a lot more than the movie itself did. It really makes me wonder what most of these folks were expecting.Joss Whedon himself said that the movie is "an angry love/hate letter to the horror movie genre", if I quoted that right - and that's exactly what it is. It's not without its share of humor, but make no mistake - it's very bleak and cynical. It's almost like Joss and Drew Goddard are actually admitting that there's nothing new in the horror genre anymore, and coming from the guys who made "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" such a fun TV series, it's a bit of a bitter pill to swallow. But then again...given how often he's had his TV series canceled before they really get out of the gate ("Firefly", "Dollhouse"), I really can't blame the man for wanting to vent a little. I kind of wish this bit of film vitriol had been more memorable, but if it refreshes him enough to keep him creating, then I'm all for it.There's blood. Plenty of it. There's also some boob-age. So all you gorehounds and permanent prepubescents out there that are really to blame for most horror movies in the last two decades sucking so bad, you're getting what you want. Quit complaining.There's also a heaping helping of CGI, which both helped and detracted from the second half of the picture.Also, for those of you who hail from outside the United States, a fair warning: there's an almost painfully Western mentality to the humor, here, which might not agree with your sensibilities. And I don't mean that as an insult; I'm just saying that the humor might not make as much sense if you're not willing to see it with an upside-down-Hollywood kind of viewpoint.Still...if you like Joss Whedon's work at all, this is well worth a rental, at least. Any of the reviewers here that claim that it's the worst movie they've ever seen don't know what they're talking about. If they like horror movies, then they've seen MUCH worse, already. I know I have. And there's enough of the Scooby-Doo formula at work here to be almost comforting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this movie is that it was advertised as a horror/slasher movie. It's not. It's a combination of a comedy, a thriller, and a slasher. I myself, didn't love or hate this movie. I was, however, disappointed at the fact that it wasn't what I was expecting at all. What this movie lacks in perception of reality, it makes up for with originality and that's what makes it watchable. The injuries sustained by some of these characters should have been life ending and weren't. Some of the injuries were portrayed poorly and taken lightly. I also suspect that the people who will like this movie the most are people who enjoy a variety of monsters being thrown into one film. It's a little overdone, in my opinion, but some might like it.Don't expect to be scared by this movie, expect to laugh more than you're jumping out of your seat, and don't be too disappointed because you're watching an original movie that is writing its own chapter in its genre.</fullReview>

The fact that they were watching them on tape just made every scary detail crumble to nothing. Second, the story was way to rushed and happened in a split second. Everything was predictable throughout the entire movie and just made it so boring. The 3d was something to cry about. It was as if someone had a 3d effect app on their mobile phone and recorded an empty room. It was so blatantly obviously fake. The blood and 3d monsters were as if they came straight out of a 2005 game, which clashes violently when you mix that low quality with real world environment. And to top it off, it had no proper ending. I had to shake my head in shame! It's like a slightly more gory scoobydoo without the dog.A proper waste of time. I would definitely not recommend it unless you're looking for a laughable cliché horror title with additional nonsense added to it.</fullReview>

The plot is stupid and full of gaps, the cast is very uninspired (how could they not be?!), and the only true amazing thing about it is the appearance of a star like Sigourney Weaver. When it ends, the only two thoughts that crossed my mind were: "How did they get her to work in this cr*p" and "if I only could have my 2 hours back" Please IMDb fans, be aware: whenever you see reviews so apart from each other, so many "ones" and "tens" for the same movie, read as many reviews as you can and try to guess which ones are more similar to what you might think.</fullReview>

It was a big waste of time and money I feel sorry for anyone who rented this movie or went to the theater to watch it. And once again I just thought I would say this movie was horrible. I don't see how it has a rating of 7 it deserves a rating more like a 2 or 3, a 2 or 3 in my mind would be considered generous which is why I rated it 1. The directors wasted a lot of of money making this as do most directs these days. Sinister was a good one but no other horror movie made in 2011 can compare.

		<fullReview>This movie is not a parody of horror movies, it is a parody of bad American horror movies that are obsessed with cutting up teens, and deliberately goes out of it's way to insult the audience. I won't bother going into the story, everyone pretty much knows it by now.This movie seeks to suck out all the fun of a real horror movie and replace it with bland non-comedy and dull dialogue. The characters are all incredibly bland and unlikeable,the fact that they are actually impressed by the Cabin itself,which is the ugliest thing ever,makes them look like idiots who need to be culled!lol! These are not actual characters, they are walking clichés that the audience doesn't need to care about, and that,i suppose, is the point of the movie, they must die for the entertainment of the audience and that is all they do. Except in this movie they don't die fast enough,they have to live long enough to explain what is happening to the audience,just in case we can't see it with our actual eyes!Now onto the parts that insult the audience. *Possible Spoilers*The "virgin" isn't a virgin- This supposed to be a joke that girls are slutty these days so there just aren't any virgins. But the Stoner character and the Nerd boy were far more likely to be virgins than the attractive girl! The writers just decided to stick to the boring cliché where girls are expected to be virgins.The "Gods" (the audience) demand to be entertained- This is actually funny because the "Gods" are not entertained enough and start to destroy the world, a bit like the audience they feel cheated! LOL!What the writers forget is that unlike the "Gods" the audience of a horror movie might also want to be challenged and presented with something that actually makes them think about life,death and choices.This movie presents us with nothing new, there are funny teen horrors with monsters like Gremlins, or scary thriller horrors where people die for the benefit of an audience like My Little Eye. This is nowhere near in the same league as those movies,The Cabin in the Woods is a complete waste of everyone's time, it might have worked as an hour long TV drama but fails as a movie.</fullReview>

In a desperate attempt to try to hide the fact that the movie has nothing of value, the director hoped to disguise it all with the use of surprise-scenes that is suppose to make you jump (very much similar to the surprise shock-clips from Youtube when suddenly a witch appears and screams at the screen). The director Drew Goddard should never attempt to make a movie in this genre again, at least not until watching some real horror movies like I Saw The Devil or Grotesque.STAY AWAY FROM THIS.

		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods is a movie that defies many things, starting off with its genre, and then quickly moving on to any semblance of logic. I found it to be neither thrilling, nor horrifying. And definitely not mysterious. Sure, I couldn't get what was happening, but mysterious? No way! Taking almost every single monster that has ever been witnessed in books and or films and making them elicit mostly laughs from the audience to me felt like a pathetic waste of time.There are many who laugh at horror movies. But that is not really the point. We are meant to be scared by watching them and that doesn't happen here. Key plot points are revealed quite early on in the movie, one of which is extremely similar to that of the Hunger Games and takes the edge of the seat suspense totally and unnecessarily away.The acting however was good, the dialogs nice, the makeup and special effects cool. But in totality, this was truly an epic disaster with way too many references to innumerable books, films, and even TV shows of the same genre. So much for the 'Ancient ones'. Bah!

They're orchestrating the carnage to collect blood for a mysterious force which left unquenched would wreak havoc on the world: the legion of demented morons who are fans of the genre.

You sparingly mix in a plot that doesn't matter too much - so long as you have a few madmen or women who are manipulating others. You spice the dialogue with the usual language of the gutter found in nearly all films these days and sumptuously add to the mix a lot of blood and gore.This film started off well, then got sillier and sillier as it went on. The final reason for the whole thing was as ludicrous as I think it possibly could have been and I wonder who was taking what when it was "thought" up.If the plot could have been re-worked with a more sensible premise, something remotely believable, then we may have been presented with something watchable. As it was, everything was so way over the top it parodied itself.No doubt this film will appeal to 12 year old chimpanzees for whom it was obviously intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst horror movie ever, quite possibly worst movie period!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most stupid and boring movies I have ever seen, I get the point of horror that things need to be scary without explanation but this was SuPER LAME.. A cheap Sci-fi movie at best, Makes no sense whatsoever, not that I was asking to make sense of zombies actually waking up with the click of a button, and nightmare monsters trapped in Cubes.... The rating of this movie, PROVES that smart and logical people in this will WILL strive.... Just a waste of my 2 hours...My suggestions watch the Halloween episode of the Simpsons, Much more thrilling...Evil gods need sacrifice! gosh!! Wonder what the producer/writer were smoking!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a worst movie that came up with the "Awful mixture of the best horrors and thrillers" in Hollywood. Bloody disgusting all the way, not because of characters. It's just because of the cheap story and movie values. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP IN EVERY WAY. Don't believe the reviews.I really pity for who liked it. It's definitely not one of the movies that you can add to your library. Bloody headache. I have to take pills to sleep now. If you wanna watch a good horror movie, go back to the old collections. They are 1000 times better than this movie. I personally believe the movies came out twenty years ago have done much great job than this one did. This one is just for the profits and money. That's it. Nothing more. They deceived people by making this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for an option of -10 for this review. I have completely lost any faith what so ever in the population of the human race, to have seen this mindless insipid drivel and given it a score of 7.3 based- on 102,983 reviews. Perhaps these 102 thousand plus viewers were all drunk, stoned teen-agers? I can only hope so. The scariest part of this movie was the high rating it received, given it's banal, hackneyed script, which was nothing short of embarrassing. The second scariest thing was that I actually sat through it, staring in fascination at the stupidity of it, without turning it off, thinking it impossible that it could get any worse than it already was half way through. But...it did. That the cast should include people like Sigourney Weaver, Chris Hemsworth,and Richard Jenkins, all of whom have starred in some really great productions, brings me to tears. What possessed them to sink so low??? I haven't watched a "horror" movie in a long time. Now I remember why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what a movie! It's definitely up there with the "weirdest films I've ever watched list", along side Donnie Darko! At first, you may think that it's one of those typical horrors with the pretty girl ,the jock, the smarty pants, the joker and the innocent girl, but that's entirely the point! The basics of the story line, without revealing any spoilers, is that a group of teenagers set out on a trip to stay in a Cabin rented out by one of the friend's cousins. Once they arrive, they make themselves at home, have a little party, play truth or dare etc. But, when they're lured down into the cellar and discover a mysterious diary, things go a bit topsy turvy! Little do they know that they're being watched by a bunch of lunatics that are filming their every move. A bit like the Hunger Games if you like, that's how I explained it to my mum! You're probably sighing to yourself now, because it does sound very familiar to many horrors already around today, but there's a twist! I can't say much more really at the risk of spoiling it all! My advice is watch it yourself and find out! If you're into the boring, predicable horrors when you always know what's going on, then the Cabin in the Woods is probably not for you. But, if you're into fresh, original, edge of your seat ones where at some points you'll be thinking "what the hell is going on here" and at others you'll be like "wow, this is so cool...", this is a must watch! There aren't many movies, especially horrors, in which I've actually paused the TV and stated how much I loved it! The fact that the ending was so inconclusive excited me, didn't irritate me or make me feel like a massive chunk was missing, it allowed me to come up with the ending for myself, which I always appreciate. Thank you everyone involved in the making of the Cabin in the Woods for giving me a thoroughly entertaining evening! Had to write this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute worst movie that has come out in a long time. Waste of time and money ... Cannot believe this was even thought of. Hollywood really needs some yelp if this is what is coming out. I would suggest looking into some new ideas. Honestly this is the worst movie in years I hope it never made it to theaters. It barely has a storyline because there should have been more background at the beginning of the movie. The previews were the only good sets. Don't waste your tine watching this. I've seen movies who try for this storyline d this one was just awful. I'm assuming no famous actors or actresses would appear in this because of his terribly written it was. We need more horror films but at least e them believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the director of Cloverfield and the director of The Avengers comes a movie I didn't expect to be good.The Cabin in the Woods was one of the most mind blowing movies I've ever seen, the twists around every corner provided thorough entertainment and you screaming at the TV. Although this movie is gory, it provides the just amount of danger they're in. This shocked me and was very unpredictable for a horror film. The concept was amazing and well written and I give it a nine by overdoing major points of the movie. When you first start the movie you think it's just an average horror film but ends up being, well.. I can't say.;D The trailer and poster revealed very little of the plot, other than teens are at a lake and it has a Friday the 13th type feel. Although it is a great movie, I recommend DVD before theaters. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

After all that build up of a movie, what a letdown after wasting my time watching it. It wasn't scary in the least. The story was absolutely IDIOTIC. The acting was about as bad as it gets....and I know the acting in these movies is usually not that good. The gore factor was OK if thats what you like in a horror movie.

		<fullReview>Intro: I waited a long time to finally see a horror movie that surprises the audience. Storyline : The movies starts off just like any other typical horror movie: there's a group of five college students that want to take a break from the city life and from all of their problems and go in a secluded place to party. So they end up going.. you guessed it: a cabin in the woods (typical setting!) to drink, party and have sex. After a while of course spooky and strange things start to happen and they start dyeing. That sums it all up doesn't it? Well not really. If you think you know the story think again! Personal view: As I said there's something special about this movie and I don't want to spoil it for you. It has quite a few twists in it, you never know where the story will take you. The dialog was awesome, especially between Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, their chemistry was great. Although he didn't play the main character Chris Hemsworth didn't disappoint. It had a lot of dark comedy which I really enjoyed, it had a few scary moments but I wouldn't call it a scary movie. There are some technological and mythological aspects to it but I can't say too much. The last 15 minutes of the movie were the best from my point of view, I wasn't really scared by it but the overall story is a really good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard good things about "The Cabin in the Woods" and very much looked forward to watching it. I felt very let down after viewing it. The movies characters were standard slasher movie fare. So much in fact, that thought the film was going be satirical. My idea of satire has an intrinsic thread of humor, but this film had none. The attempts at humor manifested mostly as pot head jokes which have grown shop worn over the past 50 years. There was a complete lack of suspense. When the murderers appeared, my reactions were, "Okay. Move on." The movie was very gory. Very. Gory to excess even by slasher movie standards. The premise of the movie was a clever twist, but it fell flat in the assault of splattering gore. "The Cabin in the Woods" was, for me, a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be the most original horror flick I have seen in over a decade. The writing, effects, and plot all make it worth watching, but just barely. The basic flaws are in the performances. None of the actors in this movie looked as if they gave a damm. However it is a very original premise that both pays homage to, and makes fun of the genre at the same time. The scene where the spooky old guy from the gas station asks if he's on speakerphone is really funny. If they had just gotten some better acting I would have given it more stars. But if you are a fan of the genre, you may find it well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent horror film, ultimately not gratifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a horror movie with a fresh plot! And in the days of torture porn masquerading as feature films, Cabin in the Woods definitely delivers in the category of originality. The problem, however, is what to do with the end of the story. My 6th grade English teacher used to tell me "that's what separates the men from the boys, the real writers from the mediocre ones." That is, what to to with the end of the story.The problem that I have with the film is inherent in Joss Wheedon's purpose--that is, to create a stand-alone horror flick that is unlike anything that came before it, or will come after it. Fine, mission accomplished. But one can put a chair in an art gallery and call it art. And perhaps some might find it amusing, interesting, entertaining---but ultimately, it doesn't gratify.The premise is interesting--but given away a bit too early, in my opinion. 5 teenagers (?) spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods, zombies attack, people have sex and die, da da da da da.....But the twist is that it's all in the control of technicians who seem to care little for the participants, who are watching the teens' every move, and helping to ensure their demises. Why, we all ask? Well, that's the biggest problem with the film.Even if the movie had been left completely open-ended, with no further explanation past "trying to keep the people upstairs happy," the movie would have been better. But that would have left room for a sequel, which Wheedon certainly doesn't want. Or perhaps it could have ended with a twisted government experiment, but that would have seemed like too much of a social statement. I think Joss Wheedon's character in the movie said it best: "Do you remember the days when all you had to do was throw a woman into a volcano?" From this, I gather, the movie is ultimately an homage to the past horror films of our lives, and I thank you, dear sir. But ultimately, the ending just doesn't cut it, and it certainly doesn't live up to the expectations of the rest of the film. And just one quick question: What the #%&amp;* was Sigourney Weaver doing in this movie?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, naively, had higher expectations for this film. It had very solid reviews, one I specifically remember stating from the cast: "the horror film to end all horror films". Absolutely false. This film can be summed up as Hunger Games meets a zombie movie meets any cliché teen horror film ever made. It maintains a humor aspect, which I not only despise in this genre, but also regard as a tell tale sign that what I'm watching is not a legitimate horror film. Though this film was sub-par compared to what I was hoping for, I will however say that it is (though completely comprised of a million ideas already previously used) worth a watch. It may be a compilation of other screenplays, but as a whole, it is "different" than the normal teen horror film trash that today's market is, sadly, flooded with. Just remember though, that in the end... It falls into the same category (fake-horror-cliché- throwaway-trash).</fullReview>

I have to say that while it was original, they didn't really explore this new world they created too much. What bothered me was that when it finally got to the new and interesting part, they just didn't expand the movie too much anymore... And I don't understand why. It's not too often you see a horror movie with a new story line that you just haven't seen before - so why waste that in the last itty-bitty party of the movie? Why not shorten the first part to get to the goodies and explore that? Such a great concept gone to waste. I give this movie a five for that alone. Still, I thought it was an enjoyable movie with an interesting mix of comedy, drama and innovation; worth your time if you're into horror movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods... a clever film mixing the traditional horror film with the old books and weird families with weird stories and the modern lab with scientists choosing the outcome of people's death. A predictable cast, the 'Whore', the sporty guy, the clever guy, the druggy and the girl who understand what's going on and will probably survive. But what makes this horror movie different is the lab rats, deciding what will happen on this weird kind of reality show. With a few glitches, this film is perfect for people who are amazed easily. However, there are a few parts in the film which will put you on edge and will shock you, that's what these kind of films are all about right? The Cabin in the Woods, if you are bored and want something to stick on, i advise this. But those who seek a thrilling, horrific, blood fest which will make you tremble, i suggest you to keep on searching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to this, the opening scene was not expected and set it up quite nicely. but the film was just a rehash of previous sci-fi horrors.. if you have seen the Cube films then just don't bother with this... the acting was OK, and reminded me of the teen horror explosions in the late 90's to early 2000s (which have been lacking of late. I was also disappointed with the antagonists, they were not shown in a lot of detail, it was like the makers were harking back to the old horrors where you see an arm smash through some wooden boards and that is all. It ended pretty meekly too, didn't tie the loose ends up or show what happened next, and i didn't really feel it was set up for a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the stereotype movie of some young people going to a place far from civilization to have a fun weekend and then stuff happens.Sounds familiar? Have we not seen this kind of movie like a hundred times?I was told that this movie wasn't as you'd expect so I gave it a chance. Minute by minute I got more and more bored, and when finally reaching the credits I really felt I'd wasted about 90 minutes of my life. What a bummer.If you are into those kind of movies I guess it's OK, but otherwise stay away from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well after reading several of the reviews on this movie, I noticed that reviewers either loved or hated it. I guess I am somewhere in between, though leaning more towards hated. And I would really like to ask those that loved it, what it was about this film that they loved so much. Granted it was different, but different doesn't necessarily mean better. This film may have been different, but in the end it was just as dumb as your traditional slasher movie. Scream was different, but it was smart. This was just different and dumb. And like another reviewer said, you can serve up this movie in 3 parts. Part one was very traditional and sucked royally. Part two made me say, OK, what's going on here. And part three almost made it worth the price of admission, but missed it by that much. So I can't say this movie is worth seeing, but I have to admit, I did like a couple of the characters. And I think if they had shortened parts one and two and extended part three, there would have been much more to talk about. But as it is, don't even waste your time.</fullReview>

Every now and again, we the horror fan/ aficionado / extremist / reluctant passerby are greeted to something new. Something fresh. Something that took everything we're so accustomed to and flip it on it's head. Apart from being awarded to a fresh, innovative take on the genre we so DEARLY love, they also spoil us rotten with gratuitous amount of blood, tits, cuss words, cheap scares, unintentional laughter and darkness, darkness, darkness. Nope. I'm not going to review Cabin In The Woods, because you're going to thank me for it. Don't believe the bullshit, don't cave in to the hype. If you really, REALLY, enjoy horror movies... you're going to be in heaven.If not, well hey... isn't it funny? Just like Titanic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice try but I'm unimpressed and sorely disappointed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an honest review of this movie from me, I am not going to hold anything back so please understand if I really hate an element of it I will say so. First off the characters and I will try to keep it short, simple, to the point.Marty is my favorite character, I love how he portrays the fool and the stoner as he does an excellent job and is the only redeemable character in the movie. I actually agree with his philosophy that humanity needs a reboot, he is the only character that makes sense in this movie and properly uses his head even before the gas hits them. The fact the pot blend he uses makes him immune, I would be worried to if I were one of the people controlling this. He is the biggest threat to this plan, hands down.The Jock is decently played but he is the scholarly kind, Chris Hemsworth is a great actor, though I am not a fan of stereotypes and how his character is also on a scholastic scholarship actually bends them. So no issues here, but I think his death coulda been different and more interesting than an evil kinevil stunt.The slut just plays it as mentioned before, however I liked her before the gas and after it I just despise her. I am not surprised she is among the first to go, cliché there and this kinda lame death too. Unimpressed with this character, but it's catering to the typical audience. I do not even think the actress who plays her is even pretty, then again I do not have a thing for celebs as their more trouble than their worth.The virgin acts so naive that it's not even funny, seriously her role is the lamest of the bunch. I am sick of horror movie "virgins" acting so naive and stupid, and walking into the scenario like a blind man walking into the pit. Her character annoys me the most, which makes her the most unlikeable.The scholar is OK, nothing much to say about him except that he should have the common sense even under the influence of the gas to know what is going on. Honestly he is my third favorite character after the fool and the jock. The jock himself could have easily passed for the scholar, so this role is kind of redundant except they needed 5 sacrifices.For characters I give this movie a 4/10, Marty saves it as I love his character.Plot: The plot as mentioned before is rather lackluster, while the concept is good it is poorly executed and this is my honest opinion. Joss Whedon has done much greater things in Buffy, ANgel, Firefly, Serenity, Dollhouse, and other series as well as movies. I know this is supposed to be a satire but I'm not laughing, I am rather bored at how the character interaction seems to develop awkwardly and none of the characters can really relate to each other unless manipulated. The first half of the movie is by far the worst part, only until the ending does this half baked and mediocre plot actually show promise.One would think the absence of stars would be a bad thing, honestly if I saw that I'd be assuming something is up and trying to find the cause immediately. The whole feel of the movie leading up to the ending is like they tried to cram too much into the short span of the movie at once. This movie felt rushed and thus the poor execution, and if anybody suggests splitting up in a setting like this I too would be immediately pushing to stay as a group and force my opinion on the group.The ending however is genius and the only saving grace, almost all movies end up with survivors and they move on to live disturbed but productive lives. Happy ending somewhat, this movie takes that cliché and burns it in the fire. So there is little to this movie besides the ending, that I enjoyed plotwise. How the fool survives being killed is beyond me, and leaves a huge and glaring plot hole. You don't see them die but also you do not see them escape, which leaves me to wonder if this part was not thought through too well. Honestly come on Joss, you can do better than this kind of shoddy writing that leaves holes in the plot where it seriously looks and sounds like someone died.Clichés are good and all IF they mesh together well, but honestly their over-saturating this film and there seems to be no escape from them in Hollywood today. So overall for plot I'd give this movie a 3/10, not horrible but not even average or sub par. This is sub-sub-par and in my opinion a movie to watch as background noise.Now as for the quality of acting, what can one expect? With headliners like Chris Hemsworthm Fran Kranz, and others this has decent acting. Though it is stereotypical and a satire I still think they could have done way better, but the acting is nothing special and very typical. I give the acting job a 2/10 with the exception of Chris Hemsworth and Fran Kranz. Amy Ackers is also great, though she has such a minor role in it, seriously she should have had more of a role in my opinion.Overall I give this movie a 3/10 rating as it could have been way better even for a satire, but due to many factors it fails as a movie. This also rates as being classified at background noise, a movie to watch while your doing something monotonous to break up the tedious nature of whatever your doing with something to distract your eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kept watching based on the good reviews here. I was suckered.This movie is simply a standard stab/gore bloodfest with a "twist" that is minor at best, and stupid at worst. To elevate this flick to anything more would be to misrepresent it as, apparently, many reviewers here have done.Is it oh-so-totally cool to have a standard horror movie with maybe two or three smart lines of dialogue? I guess so, but that's not quite enough for me.I did enjoy the prancings of the sexy young blonde. That's mostly standard for this type of movie, too, though.</fullReview>

The entire premise of the film is designed to actually make the viewer think. It's a gore-fest, but a gore-fest with meaning, with a message.Nothing is what it appears to be exactly and all the little twists and surprises only add to the sumptuous feeling that the film somehow manages to create.All thumbs up!

		<shortDescription>Best horror ever (horror = entertainment)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the people who actually thought this was going to be scary, go and watch Paranormal Activity 4. This movie was flat out entertainment, done with great wit, intellect and originality whilst delivering on the 'horror' front. If you appreciate satire and go in expecting entertainment, you'll be very pleasantly surprised. It is actually more realistic than most other horror movies I've seen. There basically isn't much else to say without spoiling it... Don't watch the trailers (never watch trailers where avoidable), obviously you cannot trust any rating on IMDb, but people either loved this as I did, or hated it and would prefer to watch Paranormal Activity 4 whilst they pack their dacks, if you're someone who is more likely to fall asleep during Paranormal Activity (I haven't seen number 4, just number one, how on earth did it make it to 4?!!) then this film is for you. Probably the best movie I have seen this year. Highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tonight we rented this movie on the recommendation of one of the guys behind the counter in our local Blockbusters. Last week he recommended I should watch the 80's film "Stand by me" which I had never seen and his advice was good.Maybe they now run some sort of bonus scheme for certain titles but as from this moment forward, I will have to take his judgement with a pinch of salt. This one was a love it or hate it job.Yeah, I get that it was meant to have a black comedy undertone but there was a bloody good reason that it was left on the shelf years before it was released. It is very poor, in my opinion.Up until this point my yardstick for cinematic catastrophe was Percy Jackson and the lightning thief, but as from today Percy, you can consider yourself put out to grass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate deconstruction-slash-love letter to the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always a pain in the ass when someone tells you that you don't "get" a movie. It comes off as pretentious, and as an excuse that a fan uses to explains what may be valid observations against the film. However, and hear me out, this is not intended as insulting, but is simply the film's style: Cabin in the Woods was made BY horror fans, FOR horror fans; whether they have the strongest or weakest understanding of how the genre works. Those of you who still jump at bathroom mirror scares and are shocked when they see "OMG, the killer isn't dead yet!" should keep on watching scary movies until they get a better idea of how the genre works. Those who DO understand how it works, or are willing to laugh and enjoy a film's ride instead of being bogged down by its logic, will find themselves immensely satisfied.The setup couldn't be simpler, giving us a tale so ancient in horror that it could be carved in stone: 5 good-looking college kids, who have loaded their rambler with booze and weed, set off for a weekend of debauchery (no points as to guessing where the film takes place). Here's where the catch kicks in: Unbeknownst to them, they are secretly being monitored by a group of scientists that have very big plans in store. As nightfall kicks in, we eventually see that not only are the scientists monitoring these kids, but are also influencing their behavior through various means in their control room. As the kids devolve from fleshed out, likable characters into your typical horror movie ensemble (the slutty girl, the alpha male jock, the virginal girl, etc.), the goal of the scientists becomes clear: they are turning the kids weekend into a standard horror movie scenario.Why they are doing this is not the point (although the film explains this in full in a series of twists that further the theme of the movie). The point is the commentary of the film on horror: do horror characters make their own decisions, or decisions based on the requirements of the genre? After all, wouldn't a horror movie be over too quickly if everyone was making good decisions? How quickly would the villain(s) of the film be defeated if the characters didn't decide to split up? Or to turn their back to a window that something can obviously burst through and grab them? Or dropping a weapon and running instead of using it to make sure the incapped villain is dead for sure? And of course, everyone's favorite, running off into the woods to have sex with no one around? This is where the fun of the film comes in: the cliché nature of the scenario is treated as a fun homage to the typical horror setup, while we eagerly await to see how the scientists will create another cliché. We get things like pheromone mist being sprayed to encourage the couple of the film to go have sex, where things will go very bad for them, as they always do in horror, or whispers in the air subconsciously telling characters to go for a walk by themselves in the middle of the night. This builds up and up in intensity until the final 30 minutes, which I will do absolutely nothing to describe, except for saying that it is basically every horror fans dream finale.As I described before, this is a film that toys with how horror films work from the very beginning, and is something that those that are new to the genre may not understand. In most horror films, we are treated to an "opening kill", featuring a hapless character being brutally killed by the antagonist, followed by a smash cut with blaring music to the title screen. We get the same smash cut here...from two characters casually discussing baby-proofing a house at a water-cooler with elevator music playing in the background. Horror fans will get the joke. Others will wonder what the hell is going on. If you get the joke, then Cabin in the Woods is a frighteningly fun ride that will stay with you as a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pretty insanely entertaining horror comedy that is far more interested in deconstructing the genre than it is in providing its audience with any legitimate scares.Five obligatory college kids go off to a cabin that looks an awful lot like the one from "The Evil Dead," only to accidentally awaken from slumber a family of deranged hillbilly zombies. We then are treated to all of the typical conversations and actions that college kids in these kinds of movies would seem perpetually forced to go through and that we've seen a hundred times before, until the movie reveals that these kids ARE being forced through their paces and that we've seen this a hundred times before because someone WANTS us to see it a hundred times.The big reveal in this movie isn't that much of a reveal. The film is way too well written to overly rely on a gimmick. It sets the stage in its first scene, and develops its conceit through funny writing and clever plotting, not through major twists and "gotcha!" moments.In our age of instant gratification, it's probably pointless to try to keep movie secrets secret. Discussions with spoilers are started on message boards before the audience has even left the theatre. But if you're interested in "The Cabin in the Woods," try to go into it knowing as little about it as possible. Knowing the general premise won't ruin your enjoyment of the movie, but it's still a film best experienced fresh.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't watch a lot of mainstream movies, and this movie is the exact reason why. I'm forced to give the movie at least one star, and the 1 redeeming trait was the completely absurd idiotic world that this movie took place in ENDED (and hopefully along with it any chances of a sequel).Chris Hemsworth movies continue to impress me (SARCASM; Thor was only minimally better than this steaming pile of feces). It was brilliant to cast him as pseudo-intelligent in this movie (more sarcasm).The amounts of pot smoking in this movie suggest that the film makers must've smoked a few ounces themselves to even believe that this incoherent, implausible movie was worth producing.If you like this The Cabin in the Woods, please read a book.

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is just the kind of horror movie that has been sorely missing for years. The horror genre tends to play it too safe. There's the slasher era, the torture porn era, and now we're suffering through the awful lost footage era, unfortunately the zombie TV fad never really made it to the movies. Horror and comedy has often been combined and the result has usually been embarrassing. This movie has a bit of comedy and zombies and just breaks through these subgenres to create something fresh and unique. I've been waiting for a movie like this, a movie in the spirit of The Return of the Living Dead, a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but respects the audience.We initially meet some 60s style scientists in some large facility who are taking part in some sort of international contest, the only contenders left are the US and Japan.Suddenly we switch to a group of horror-movie-stereotypical kids. The guy who goes everywhere with a football, the guy who goes everywhere with a bong, the slutty blonde, the pure girl, and the nerdy guy. They're going for a road trip to a cabin in the woods. On the way they meet the stereotypical backward gas station attendant who warns them. Once they get there it all seems nice and fun enough until they go to the cellar, find all sorts of creepy objects among them a book and start reading incantations in Latin from it. Then one of the scientist in control pulls a lever to release the Buckner family- a family of zombies. The zombies go after and kill some of the kids in gruesome ways.When only the virgin is thought to be left, the entire staff at the science project celebrates their victory over Japan. We also get hints of what is behind all this. But it turns out the celebration was premature. The remaining kids not only escape the Buckner family but also make it into the science facility and what they've find there is just wild.The Cabin in the Woods successfully combines plenty of elements/references from other horror movies into something new and unexpected. It succeeds in all its different aspects. The horror element is very well done, with the truly scary zombie family. And these zombies look and act the way zombies should. They don't look like people with some pasty mascara on and don't run around like toddlers on a sugar high. The look more like 80s Italian zombies, the best kind. Skinny, rotten. Well except for a big rotten zombie. The funny bits are truly funny, and our dopey guy gets the funny lines and he sure delivers them well. Acting all around is excellent. Then there is a crazy fantasy aspect to the movie as well as a more serious mythology to it that is interesting. And of course the scientists add a bit of deception and conspiracy. While a sequel would be difficult to make, I sure wouldn't mind some prequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just spectacular. There really isn't any bad acting in it, surprisingly. The cinematography, everything was just spot on. There are a couple of parts that give you jumps but you shouldn't get any chills with this movie. If you watch it with a group of people, you'll definitely get a kick out of some of it. I watched it alone and laughed a few times. This is one of the best horror films to come out in the past decade. And one of the scenes in it, I would put it in my top 5 horror scenes of all time list. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, I don't even know anyone who wouldn't like it. This is a pretty original idea for a movie and if Hollywood were to start making movies like this more often, the horror genre would get way more hype. Spot on, 100% recommend this movie to anyone. Don't watch the trailer, if you haven't already yet. It'll be more entertaining without it, as in my opinion they gave too much away. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cabin In The Woods is a genuinely good story but not as good as it is made out to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, Cabin In The Woods is an entertaining film, but slightly cliché. The storyline is a genuinely good idea, but the way it is presented is hard to follow and at times doesn't make sense. I found that the first half of the film didn't really relate to the second half, and it was a little difficult to get into. It is well performed by the actors who took on the roles of their characters excellently. Although predictable, it does make you eager to see the ending. I found this film quite interesting and would recommend it to fans of thriller and comedy, but horror fans may be disappointed as it is not as scary as it is made out to be in the trailer, it is funny rather than terrifying. Personally I found that it was more comical than scary. It was entirely not what I expected it to be, both in a good and bad way. Some elements were quite ridiculous but this made it watchable. The ending was a bit manic and hard to keep up with as there were so many different people, creatures etc, and I was disappointed with it, it could have been much better. There were many intelligent twists in the narrative as the film progresses which made it bearable. I rate it 6/10 overall as it could have been better and is overrated for what it is, but is a generally good story.</fullReview>

But then they decide to give it a little twist, which at first I enjoyed. You don't see a lot of cliché movies have a little Sci-Fi. But then at the end it felt like they basically pulled the ending right out of their a****. I mean really? The ritual, the prehistoric creatures?? Not to mention terrible acting, and the added comedy made me feel like they were trying to mimic a parody! It's one thing to add a twist or two, but to add one genre and mix it with another is going a bit too far and becomes completely unbelievable. Including the terrible acting... The movie was better off a classic cabin cliché than this s***...Whoever liked this doesn't know real scary movies. I'm sorry but THIS?</fullReview>

The special effects were awful and I wonder why fine actors like Richard Jenkins and Sigourney Weaver ever decided to embark on such a disastrous project. Or was it only for the money?If you love great cinema: do not be mislead by the majority of review ratings (like I was). It is an absolute waste of time.

		<fullReview>I am trying to understand how so many people are giving this movie 7 and 8 stars. Are you people trying to be funny? Is this some kind of coordinated joke among a large group or something? The movie is terrible! Although this is my first review, I am normally in sync with other reviews on movies but these reviews are far from reality in my opinion and I felt compelled to sign up and write my own review. I Watched it till the end just so i can say that I gave it a chance and it was as disappointing at the end as it was from the beginning. The plot is pointless and the film was obvious created by a group of potheads, You have to be high on something to sit through this film and give it good reviews. Skip this movie and don't let the cast, ratings and reviews fool you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does this garbage have a rating of 7.6? does it mean that most film goers just consume way to much aspartame laden soda drinks? The story line is just so predictable and weak, and lets not forget the wooden acting.No lets wait it must have such high ratings due to the great horror suspense and blood and guts, NOT! I was going to say sorry, but damn why should I? If more people would demand better viewing material then this rubbish would never make it to the big screen, but this seems to be the standard set by Hollywood for some years now.I should have known better seeing it has teen dumb ass Aussie soap star Chris Hemsworth in it, as he has no credibility of any level as an actor, damn I just gave the reason why it has that rating of 7.6. it caters for teens! Unless you have lost a heap of brain cells, you should real not waste your time on this! walk your dog, wash your car or BMX, pick your nose, do the dishes, even watching the toilet flush makes better time spent! Very very solid 1 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't trust the high IMDb mark!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched Chronicle without the Mrs, and regretting the fact she didn't see it with me (it is an excellent film IMO) I saw this was out and thought it would be selfish of me to watch it alone. It has a high IMDb mark, which can often be trusted, and in particular a very high mark for a horror film.Unfortunately, my Mrs was rather angry with me for ruining her Saturday night by getting her to watch The Cabin In The Woods.The "twist" is not really a twist, as you'll know exactly what's going by the halfway point. And you'll know 90% of what is going on by the 10th minute of the film. This means the film just meanders along. It all feels pointless. If folk regard the twist in this film as clever then I despair at the general viewing public.I sniggered a couple of times at a couple of funny scenes. But I'm literally talking two times. As for scares, there are none to be found. The killings are not even up to standard horror deaths.I'm a massive horror fan so was really looking forward to this supposed twist on the genre. Unfortunately it's a whole film based on an idea that was probably thought of at Pint Nine on a Friday night.I mark it 3 out of 10 for the topless shot and the two funny bits.Please don't waste your life on this. Hopefully some souls will be saved by this review and decide not to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie can't decide what it whats to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with a vague understanding of what it was already about. Unlike everyone else who either LOVED IT or HATED IT, I thought it was "EH." I can't say that I loved or hated it because the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. It started out as a natural horror, in Hostel fashion. A tech crew was orchestrating factors to bring 5 young adults into what appeared to be a test enclosure, without the subjects knowing it and intent to kill them. This style was drawing me in and playing out well until real zombies came into play. Still not too far fetched for Resident Evil, but it hadn't shifted through all of its gears. Two of the subjects survive and discover someone had been orchestrating events and they break into the behind the scenes area. Next gear was pure supernatural horror, in Buffy the Vampire Slayer style. All outlandish walks of creatures were being imprisoned by the tech crew. (Lots of obvious similarities to past horror franchises.) The storyline took a quick turn into an end of the world scenario with a need to appease gods with sacrifices in some sort of formulaic sequence. The end was a let down for being such a humongous stretch from the beginning. I would have liked the movie more if it could have figured out what it wanted to be from the beginning and following that throughout. For instance, I like ice cream, but I have to be in the mood for it. Otherwise, I don't care for it.People who want Natural Horror will like the first third of the movie. People wanting a zombie movie will like the middle. And Supernatural Horror lovers will like the ending. I find it hard to believe that anyone LOVES the entire movie. People like me will see the mishmash of the three types, the mismatch between, and just think "Eh, it's OK.- I guess."</fullReview>

I was fooled by the user rating.The first 15 minutes of the movie is watchable only because it has been taken from many other movies. Apart from that the entire movie is absolute crap.. no words to describe it.. Just crap..The film lacks logic at all levels. It sucks in every aspect creativity, camera-work, screenplay, direction, cast, music, editing, make up, props..

		<fullReview>For a movie that tries to be original, its fails miserably. This is probably the most overrated, Unoriginal horror film that has ever been made. It is basically The Evil Dead mixed with Friday The 13th mixed with about every already existing horror classic that has ever existed, and they flush it down the drain with a would-be comedy horror film? If you want to see a real comedy-horror film watch evil dead 2, because this film is just a bad filter that sucks every great horror film and makes something not creative, but rather pathetic and poorly executed. I do not recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of horror or comedy. I wouldn't even recommend this for people that enjoy watching horrible movies to make fun of it. Because this film is the equivalent to Rebecca Black's "Friday", It's so horrible, it's kind of sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A layered film that seems to be misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who rate this movie badly likely think it was "trying" to be something in particular (a horror for example) or "trying" to prove something to the viewer (some type of moral).In my opinion this movie is unlike anything we've seen before. The main characters are SUPPOSE to be stereotypical, look at the title of the movie for instance! It plays on the stupidity of basic movies such as straight-forward horrors and interlocks this with true comedy. Beyond this, the actual cabin is just the tip of the iceberg of what lies beneath as I was impressed by the sheer magnitude of villains and craziness that surrounds the final half of the film.The scenes involving the humans in the control room are SUPPOSE to be silly and detached from reality - it's that type of movie. I am truly shocked that people are judging this movie as if it's trying to be something substantial beyond what it delivered.I think this movie is incredibly unique and misjudged because many viewers aren't expecting a movie that comes from a direction outside the stencil that most films these days sadly seem to follow.Highly recommended to open-minded viewers. 9/10</fullReview>

The thought that these people were preselected brings up way too many questions! In what way were they controlled without their knowing prior to this trip? The female tech in the Govt. facility, eluded to the one chicks hair dye being chemically tainted. The fact that the govt. had all of these mythical beasts locked away to use (by elevator!) at their very own disposal is laughable. How come when our stars were getting a nice long look at the freaks, that the doors weren't opening to rip them to shreds?The monitors,in the govt. facility, showed progress in other countries! Not only here, this goofy game was happening everywhere? Madrid already LOST, so you would think game over right? Especially since the arm that came from below was about 100 stories high. NO, somehow losing in other countries is no big deal.Japan manages to survive. Their horrible beasts were defeated by school children. Apparently, Japan seemingly did it without needing a virgin, a jock, a slut and so on. they didn't need trickery either as the kids pulled it off in school.Don't see if you want be scared!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***May Contain Spoilers*** I must say this about The Cabin in the Woods...They tricked me. I rented it via PPV and was so happy. Got the family together and was really ready to look at a good horror movie. I thought of it as an up-to-date Evil Dead or something (Sorry Bruce Campbell for the insult).Seriously, you couldn't have hired Bruce to help this movie. It was not funny, horror, or interesting. My mother was so bored that she fell asleep looking at it several times.I was so mad that I was ready to cut it off and chalk it up as a lost but said to myself that I would see it through. Then it really got bad! It went from a normal scary done-million-of-times-before movie to what the heck just happen.I heard someone refer to it as a SyFy movie but I had just got finish looking at something on SyFy before deciding to rent this movie and I was mad that I didn't say with their programing.Please, wait for it to come out on TV so that you can tell everyone why you are passing by it as you channel surf. The movie is not good at all.If they would have really put some effort into it and really tried to make the halfway point less fake then I might would give this a good review but I cannot and will not give this a good review even if you paid me to. I rather not lie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In a category of its own-- and should be reviewed as such</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an attempt to be objective, I have tried to set aside my personal bias of being desperately in love with past works of Joss Whedon when reading the negative reviews of this movie. Admittedly, there is a SUBSTANTIAL bonus to being a Whedon fan viewing this film, as it is thoroughly steeped in his style.The biggest critique I see of this film in negative user reviews is that it is "neither scary nor funny." My response to this is that these people are trying too hard to make The Cabin in the Woods fit into whatever mold they were expecting. It's not scary in a traditional thriller or slasher type of way, and for the most part it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. Instead, what you're left with is a film that engages you 100% in the story and concept in a way that I can only describe as hilariously clever and innovative. I feel that comparing it to the original Scream is unfair, as Scream's parody style is much more tongue-in-cheek than CitW's "What if THIS were the reason?" approach.So... hang on through the first half of the movie, if you think you've got it all figured out. I found myself feeling disappointed as I came to what I THOUGHT was the end, only to then be given everything I didn't realize I wanted in a horror movie to make it all worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I loved about this movie is that it goes far beyond my imagination and anyone else's!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain works of media in the cultural canon that cannot be discussed without being "spoiled", because the element of surprise is fundamental to their laudable qualities. Eventually, just by simple desire to discuss it with other people, everybody finds out who Keyser Soze and Luke Skywalker's father are, why Bruce Willis is connected to Haley Joel Osment and how Dr. Jekyll relates to Mr Hyde. There are also films whose charms rely not so much on a shocking twist but a sustained run of unpredictability. The very fact that you know there is something beyond the initial surface idea is detrimental to the full capacity of your enjoyment, and yet, if you didn't know there was a deeper level, you wouldn't be interested at all. Just as something like Takashi Miike's Audition isn't your typical romance drama, Drew Goddard &amp; Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods isn't your typical slasher film.The plot certainly introduces us to some typical slasher archetypes though. We meet handsome, athletic Curt (Chris Hemsworth) as he's throwing a football out the window of his girlfriend, newly-blonde Jules (Anna Hutchison), and her mousy roommate Dana (Kristen Connolly). On the receiving end is equally buff, bespectacled Holden (Jesse Williams), and soon arrives their prototypical stoner buddy Marty (Fran Kranz). Curt's cousin has an old cabin out in the woods (hey!) and fittingly, they run into an aggressive portentous old man named Mordecai (!) at a gas station (Tim De Zam) whose warnings they ignore. But as you might expect, peculiar things begin happening as they arrive, and their nubile young fun starts to take a dark turn as they begin exploring the cellar. We are also introduced in the opening credits to two men in business casual (Richard Jenkins &amp; Bradley Whitford) who have their own relation to the goings-on.I was going to say that I wouldn't spoil anything that wasn't already displayed in the trailer, and that's true, but now that I re watch said promotional clip, it ends up revealing WAY more than I realized about the film. Instead of talking about the plot machinations (which, to quote Jeffrey Lebowski, are ample), I'll talk about its tone, which is knowledgeable and loving towards its subjects. Even in the slasher genre, the "cabin in the wood" trope gives everything a distinctly early-eighties flair. Considering its respectful nods to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, it's fitting that Cabin's closest modern equivalent is Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, two of the scant few recent movies that remember that horror doesn't have to be grim misery, and black humor can be as effective to making an audience warm to you You can make the macabre fun without making it a geek show. The Cabin in the Woods succeeds in being a wild ride that keeps you on your toes as well.Also strengthening the film's overall credentials is the acting and characterization, which is slightly more nuanced and interesting than your typical slasher. A movie like Hostel or the House of Wax remake, the characters were horrible people who I hated viscerally but felt no sort of rush when they died. The main group of people here is multifaceted and genuinely funny in many spots (Marty especially receives a ton of funny lines and Kranz manages to sell them with vigor, managing to be a comic relief character who actually happens to be funny). Even if there wasn't a suggestion of something else going on here, it would still be the most watchable group of slasher fodder I've seen in quite some time. Apparently this was filmed in 2009, which is why Chris Helmsford had so much time to grow his hair out for Thor. Befitting the creator's Buffy origins, the entire cast is attractive but not egregiously so, which really allows you to focus on the situation at hand.For that situation I've given you but the barest of bare-bones plot descriptions, and I'd encourage you not to go reading much of anything that speaks to much more than what I'm dancing around. It's the kind of film that even casual slips could taint, which is why I raced to the theater and caught the first possible show, before anyone spoiled it for me. I mostly avoided that problem by talking about the film without talking about the film. The coldest you can get is the best you want to be, and unless somebody tells you, I promise you won't guess where it goes. I think the film's filmmaking strengths, from the great Whedon and his buddy Goddard (responsible for some of the most acclaimed episodes of Lost, incidentally), are great enough that even if you do have it spoiled, it's still structured to pack a punch as it unfolds, but man, if you don't know nothing', you'll find a lot to love. As a matter of fact, I'll get the ball rolling: The Cabin in the Woods is a typical slasher film, The Cabin in the Woods is as normal as normal can be. What The Cabin in the Woods definitely ISN'T is pure, heedless awesome. NOW?you won't suspect a thing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my second review about a movie on here. The reason I'm writing this review is because I cannot believe that a movie like this has/had 8.1 rating on here and the reviews were mostly great. So I was really excited to watch this especially after watching the trailer as well. I understand that different people like different things and if this movie was not hyped as it has been maybe I would have given it 2 or 3 stars for the effort. OK let's start with this movie that had so many positive reviews. In few words I like to say that if my review stops one person from watching this movie then I feel like I helped someone. It was a waste of time. About the story......... I am not going to spoil any of the awesome plot....... eeh what PLOT! This movie is a complete mess. The dialogue between characters involved didn't make any sense. Slow start and no build up at all for any type of story and no growth of character or anything like that. Could not careless who dies or who lives. In the first half an hour I started to yawn and was finding it really hard to stay awake. Awful feeling. Some spoke about the originality of this movie, what originality? This movie tries to be lots of different movies in one which made it almost unwatchable and most certainly not original. The action/comedy or gore starts from nowhere and nothing makes any real sense and it continues while I was wondering what the hell is going on. And it keeps getting worst until it finished the way it did. Nothing explained. Thank God is finished. I found this movie so bad that I had to make an effort and write a review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fellow fellows,Yesterday my imaginary wife and i decided to watch a movie that was just as abnormal as the relationship we are having, i guess the movie nailed the abnormal part. While watching the movie we ate mac and cheese which i never ate before, to bad i was making it up and macaroni is banned in my country.Then i started watching the movie and my first thought was: Wow what a bunch of hipsters. You could tell from there faces they were probably to retarded to survive even without the evil god creatures. BANG! there it was 30 minutes into the movie some cliché looking zombie comes out of the ground like the freak she is only one arm and even more ugly then your girlfriend, she really reminds me why i'm scared of the Chewpacabra.(And i should be) PS, she brought her mom and dad, how sweet.60 minutes into the movie all hell brakes loose, all the action you were waiting for is going to happen in such a short amount of time that all you can think of is, What the hell is going on. maybe if they would have used the monsters in a good movie it would have been super awesome.finishing it with a final act as shitty as most of the newer movies, it was worse then the ending of ''the day the world stood still'' and that my friends is a very very hard task. It's even pretty similar to in some points. Cant they just thing of an ending perhaps next time, or a story to begin with.Final conclusion: This movie is overrated and stupid, they took superb special effects and managed to make it into a stupid movie. If you did like this movie your either a hipster or just as brainless as this movie. During the writing of this review i threw up in my mouth just because i'm still sick and tired of watching this movie.All other reviews are retarded, and if your still reading this your probably a Mormon. As for me i wont live for long cause i have a typing arm from all this typing, after all i'm not made of steel i'm made of corn.Keep up the love for movies and don't forget to bring a towel.

While it's smart, it suddenly tries to be some sort of sci-fi-zombie- conspiracy-Armageddon-comedy which makes it feel horribly disjointed as it tries to hit too many territories. It could have done really well in one or two fields, but it does poorly in all of them because it's stretched out way too thin.Scary? No, not in the slightest. Over the top? Yes. I know that they were aiming for this but they took it too far to where I couldn't stop rolling my eyes the entire time. Funny? No, not really, more so just corny. Thought provoking? You could say it is mildly, but not to what it thinks it is.All in all, The Cabin in the Woods is not scary at all and unfortunately poorly done. It tries to be so many genres that it fails at being all of them and there's too much inane crap going on. If a movie tries to be smart but it's overshadowed by extraneous plot lines, sexuality, and drug usage, its cleverness is hidden and immediately forgotten. You're thinking right now, "BUT WAIT! It's making fun of the clichés!" My response is that the sexuality could have been hinted at, and the fact that they directly showed it seemed to bow down to stereotypical horror movie clichés, and the drug usage was unneeded. You can just have the character be a total dumbass.5.5/10, F, two thumbs down, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not sure what the fuzz is about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the good reviews, I decided to go see the movie this week-end. The fact that there was something different about this horror movie combined with the good reviews, sparked my interest.I must admit, it had an element which was surprising for a horror movie. Even though I guessed it quite quickly, it's still a welcome change. Unfortunately this is the only thing that I can comment on positively. The rest of the film is the standard formula; hot chicks, cool jocks and scary surroundings. They added a druggie in an attempt to add some humor, but sadly the humor was quite cheesy, very predictable and I rarely broke a smile. I wonder if they had pre-screenings? The movie also lacked any scare factor and that should be the basis of a horror movie. All in all a 6 for effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and apparently well over the head of many a commentator on this benighted site, "Cabin in the Woods" nevertheless adds another worthy notch to the belts of writer/producer Joss "Firefly" Whedon and writer/tyro director Drew "Cloverfield" Goddard. Its deft deconstruction of horror movie tropes wedded to an outlandish Act Three reveal of Lovecraftian fantasy sets "Cabin in the Woods" firmly above the bulk of its LCD competition. Whedon may have cut his eyeteeth with dross like "Roseanne" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," but his truest creative successes have always come with genuinely intelligent creations like "Toy Story," "Firefly"/"Serenity," (yes) "The Avengers," and "Cabin in the Woods." Goddard handles his fine cast extremely well, with nary a flicker of self-conscious aren't-we-cleverness. Everything is of a piece: acting, effects, and camera-wrangling. Had the powers-that-be not foolishly delayed the film in a misguided attempt to render it in 3D, thus consigning it to a less than appropriate early spring release, I'm convinced it would have done much better box office than it did. Still, it did decent business worldwide, and is likely to have a strong video run, and if nothing else will be a cult favorite for some years to come.Needless to say, highly recommended to fans of the genre. I'd wax even more enthusiastic in detail, but I think my time would be better spent rewatching it.</fullReview>

The whole premise of the movie was I thought, getting isolated in the woods and having prey attempt to murder you in creative ways. This was a 'set up' experiment that did not quite go right for the scientists. The ghouls and goblin were a ridiculous substitution for a good horror flick. I do not how this even got past production and I feel bad for the people that actually spent money to see this sad excuse for entertainment.

		<shortDescription>A horrible mish-mash of almost every horror/slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with "classics" such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, Christine, Bad Taste, Phantazm etc. Even before my time audiences were treated to original movies like White Zombie, Dracula etc. Always something new always something of a muddled lens of the camera trough which director managed to have all of his creative shine get trough. It was back in the day when budgets were very tight an imagination of the writer/director had to account for a movie's success. Here however the movie not only goes trough a cliché routine of establishing this "just your average all-American teens" characters, but steadily strolls (or trolls perhaps?) trough all known horror genres really chewing trough pretty much every trick in the book. We are talking of a really low level here, no creativity what so ever. The part where my gag reflex went off was when I saw a very badly CG animated "eagle" fly above a steep cliff side. From there on it just rolled downhill. Almost every scene was predictable, the plot with a few exceptions had surprises in it and I give it a rating of 2 stars for making me laugh when I saw a unicorn impale a man. That was about the only part of the movie I enjoyed. The ending makes no sense, I am almost surprised they didn't rip that off any other movie... but I might be mistaking. IMHO the horror movies work best on kids and young adults. Not much can scare a grown person, but every once and a while come movies like Saw (NOT to be confused with its useless sequels) that makes the audience not only scared, not only sick to their stomach but also give a grand finale in the end that makes everyone scratch their heads in disbelief. This movie did none of that. I guess the high ratings come from either kids who are not critical of it at all, or people who just have no understanding of horror movies.</fullReview>

The view of the world in this film is very innovative, I agree with it. All the monsters and horrible creatures people know are gathered in one spot, where they awaits their turn to kill this year's sacrifice lamb. Otherwise the dark god beneath the globe will rise and all humans will have demise. So we can see an exposition of ghosts here. wolf-man, dragon, zombies, Japanese female ghost, .....But what else? the plot was predicted from the very beginning, and there was not a twist at last. Only bloody scenes are remained red-handed in the brain.I had expected something fresher, like resurrection of the killed, awakening of a zombie girl...but no way. All die. That's it.Why Sigourney is starred ??? She should'not have accepted the casting. PATHETIC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hollywoodized Watered Down Funny Games</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to be this smug about pulling off what Haneke did in Funny Games, tearing down the "fourth" cinematic wall at an attempt to make your film this self-aware, at least use a different style the title than the film you took from. Appalling! Shameless! Uninspired! Those are three words that come to mind. The eraser board, the glass elevators full of other possible monsters, the Scream humor... all of that's been done before, and the sad part about the film is that they actually believe they may be doing something different. Ask Piradello. Perhaps, the film serves as a Hollywood version of Funny Games and best works that way. I've read that it's a "hateful love letter to the horror genre" but most of that is bullshit when you're engaging the fantasy of a pothead director. How Sigourney Weaver ever agreed to do the film must have something to do with her dedication to taking roles that don't demonize marijuana. Didn't she play a character who smokes marijuana in Unstrung Heroes? Anyway, the film fails to subverse. It's typically self-gratifying, sympathizing with two most likable characters, which happens to be a burn-out. Surprise surprise. The film was praised as "smart" and "funny" but I found it to be stupid, full of holes, not addressing enough of anything interesting to be an existential metaphor, in the way of Badlands. The characters are not trying to escape the genre they were written into. They just become aware of a force which controls their lives, which may be enough to save the film. But, the director loves to identify with Hadley. It's obvious. The control issues are blaring you in the face, and that's what is most annoying about the film. The puppeteer prides himself on his manipulation, which is all the film has to offer. That's not suspense. It's cheap. Cue the scary music, wait for something to pop out. Oh, look at how easy it is to make some money at the box office, but let's just let the audience know we're all smarter than that... include them. I have to give him credit for rewarding what's good, for that should exist in how we identify with characters. The film ends up tied up into everything that it pokes fun of. If I wanted to read inside jokes on a white board, I'd want them thoughtfully fleshed out. Since the filmmaker knows what he lacks, having mainly written crappy TV (the actual Buffy the film was decent), he tries to overcompensate by giving us gore.</fullReview>

But I was bored, because you know how horror movie's always are, the whore dies first, the jock dies second, etc. It would have been better if the people at the end would have said, 'We've already won the fight, because our souls are filled with the spirit of Jesus, so live or die, we win.' But NO, (spoiler) they lose, and the guy lights a joint right before he dies. This is intended to make you feel like your life is hopeless. It's an evil movie, even if you don't realize it while you're watching it. They even want you to feel your life is worthless at the end, which is a lie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this and read the plot, I immediately thought about The Evil Dead (which I'm a huge fan of). So I said no about seeing this. Then I saw the very good reviews and heard friends of mine, saying it was good. I then watched the trailers and decided to give it go. When a friend and I left the movies, I said 'what was that?'The first half was the story is about friends staying at a cabin in the the woods and bad things happen. Yes, that has been done before (going back to The Evil Dead). But there was the plot about the company, which is new. This gave me some hope about the film being good.Then the second half came in, where you find out about all the information , twists and turns. This when it get's totally ridiculous. You find that this sought of thing is happening all over the world, involving horrific creatures, ghosts, demons etc. May I ask where did all these creatures come from? OK they may be man made, but I didn't hear any of the characters say that. I have to say, it was entertaining watching all the bad guys get killed by the creatures.Now the climax, this is where stupidity hit the peak. It is all for a ritual on feeding gods blood that are underground. If this doesn't happen, the world will be destroyed. You find that gods are bigger than Godzilla. What is going on with this. The writer of the film did an amazing job for The Avengers, but please don't let him do horror again. I reckon the child inside him went overboard and said while writing the script 'lets add this and lets add that'The acting was good enough but not really Oscar worthy. It was good to see Chris Hemsworth do something else.Seriously, I wouldn't bother with this at all. I would rather rent it on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Horror" for non-Horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is full of CGI, cliché horror predators, comedy, and plenty of jump scares. Of course, this is the whole point. The problem is the execution is done without generating any real suspense, atmosphere or character development. This is absent in most recent horror movies anyway so youthful, casual, fans may not even notice.The problem is, beyond the idea, there's not much else redeeming about the movie. Every scare you know is coming. (I went to this movie with a person who rarely watches horror movies and this person was able to predict when most jump scares were about to occur.) The gore is also lacking. Lots of CGI blood, yes. But actual horror-movie as-it's-happening gore? Very little. The person I went with is easily frightened but walked away from this with a 'meh' attitude (not frightened at all). A lot of ideas weren't followed through with. There was almost no detail to anything, and nothing really came as a surprise (despite what all the reviews say).The best parts were the comedic moments (although many missed the mark) and the quirkiness of some scenes. There also were a few WTF moments which were all good and certainly the best parts of the movie - I just wish they were a more cohesive part of it.Overall, the movie seemed like a good idea that was slapped together without much passion. It's a different take on everything, but beyond that the movie is quite simple and plain. It's too scatter-shot and doesn't take some ideas as far as they needed to go. Casual movie fans and non-Horror fans will appreciate this movie more for what it is. However, even this is not much more than a simple 'unique' shell of an idea that is lightly packed with generic, meta, filler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having now seen this twice, I'm more glad than ever that I've always been a devotee of Joss Whedon and his twisted view of the world (or, if one factors in "Firefly"/"Serenity," the universe). Remember that phrase coined by Hannah Arendt, "the banality of evil"? That's what Whedon has always illustrated: evil needs functionaries, usually "regular guys" who show up to work and go about their business pretty much as anyone else would. They can always rationalize what they do for a living. Whether it was the law firm Wolfram and Hart in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"/"Angel," the Alliance, the Rossum Corporation in "Dollhouse," or now this organization simulating horror movies, these people are very recognizable. They're probably good neighbors and show up at PTA meetings...As everyone must know by now, the set-up is classic scream fest: five college types pile into a recreational vehicle and head for a cabin in the middle of nowhere for some (presumably) frisky business. What they don't know, but we do (in fact they follow the corporate types on-screen) is that they're being led into a high-tech trap. This lets Whedon and his co-writer (and director) Drew Goddard have their cake and eat it too: the five are stock types (albeit as well written as one would expect from these guys) but their constant monitoring by the underground "techies" conveys that that's why they were chosen. (Presumably ALL stereotyped characters were inspired by SOMEONE who really existed. Wisconsin's own local yokel Ed Gein would have been amazed how many stories have him behind their tenuous claim to verisimilitude.) Once they get to the cabin, their predictably suicidal behavior is explained by various chemicals the techies have wafting around. At one point a trap door in the floor snaps open for no reason; "Must have been the wind," someone predictably suggests. "And that makes sense how?" responds the substance-abusing type, whose pot use apparently makes him immune to the various chemicals. It would have been funny if all of them had simply shrugged and walked away from the trap door without bothering to explore the cellar, with the techies screaming profanities in frustration, but by then---another insidious victory by Whedon and Goddard---we're pretty much seeing the characters as the techies see them. The cellar of course is full of props, the manipulation of one of which will trigger the arrival of one of a set of stock horror monsters, thus the victims have unwittingly chosen their own demise. Things play out more or less by the book, although one of them meets a rather novel end apparently borrowed from "The Thirteenth Floor." There's a beautifully wicked sequence where the "good girl" victim barely survives and gets a moving tribute to her spunk from one of the techies (Bradley Whitford from "West Wing") but the tribute stops dead when some colleagues arrive with tequila, then all the employees party hearty while her ongoing victimization is ignored on the monitor screen. But here's where I need to indulge in a paragraph break...I wanted a new paragraph because the best part of "Cabin in the Woods" happens AFTER all this, and if you haven't seen it yet and may still want to, this part really should come as something of a surprise; on your second viewing you'll enjoy it even more (as I did). So if you're still with me: the "good girl" and the "Fool" escape into the gleaming bowels of the stronghold and discover that all the various monstrosities are readily available for use at the flip of a switch...Whedon and Goddard deserve to go to movie heaven if only for the one shot of a bunch of heavily armed security goons in the hallway; a split second later they're monster-chow. Y'all always wanted a scene with the walls, floor and ceiling frescoed with blood and body parts? Enjoy. Eventually all the employees get theirs with the same ruthlessness that they had visited upon the college types; I haven't been so happy to see so many people die violently since "The Island." Finally only "the Director" (a cameo part that others may enjoy more than I did) is left to explain everything; apparently some huge ancient creatures live way underground &amp; will leave humanity alone if this company simulates horror movies for them. (I guess there are monitor screens down in the earth's core too.) At this point "Cabin" unfortunately gets a little goofy, but credit Whedon and Goddard for following through with their premise right to the end. What better way for the only two characters left to celebrate Armageddon than by sharing a final joint? (I'd prefer a beer, but never mind.) .... Fans of "Dollhouse" (such as myself) will enjoy the return of Fran Kranz and Amy Acker (the latter playing almost the same part) but I guess Harry Lennix was unavailable as the black security-guy-with-a-conscience (he's the only one who doesn't bet on which monster threat the kids will "choose") so they got someone else who's also pretty good. Tim De Zarn may have just guaranteed himself movie work for the rest of his life with his surly-last-chance-gas-station guy to end all such...If there's an Academy Award category for "Best Make Out Scene with a Stuffed Wolf's Head," Anna Hutchison should be a shoo-in for it...Wonder if retractable plastic bongs will now become a sought-after item...There's also a pretty good spoof of the "J-horror" genre with a bunch of little girls defeating the obligatory killer ghost, to be rewarded with a snarling series of "F--- you"s from Bradley Whitford's partner, played by the sinisterly taciturn Richard Jenkins... I'd be thrilled to learn that the scene with the jock character getting the idea for the bad tactical move inserted into his brain was inspired by a similar scene in "Time Bandits," hands down the funniest and most subversive English movie about dwarfs ever made....</fullReview>

For a film that started off with an interesting start, left you wondering 20 minutes in 'OK what next, how will they develop the story from here?' but instead of being pleasantly surprised I found myself thinking 'oh dear, another brainless horror, what a waste of potential brilliance'. The movie was a cross between the Truman Show and the Final Destination movies but only half as good as either, despite what your a fan of most. There's a character in this movie who is an absolute stoner, and as the movie approached the end I found myself scratching my head asking myself "I wonder if the writers we're stoned too when they said to one another 'Sure that makes sense!'" So how do I come to this conclusion? Here I'll keep it simple: Believability factor = 0%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just what the horror genre needed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years, the horror genre, particular the 'slasher films', have slowly deteriorated, with the odd shining star now and again. Needless to say, many of the films placed into the horror category follow virtually identical plots, only differing in location and characters. The reason 'The Cabin in the Woods' succeeds therefore, is because it recognises this cloning of horror films and turns it on its head.The writers of the film took the cliché genre and made into something very clever and unique, taking many viewers by surprise and giving me hope for the future of the horror genre. The film wasn't riddled with scares and I won't be losing any sleep because of it, but 'The Cabin in the Woods', despite all its twist, is still a horror. It has blood, tension, killers and a nice dark, clever plot to glue it all together.To begin with, I found the film's concept quite confusing and, before realising what the writers had done, found it rather far-fetched. If anyone is unsure of what goes on in the film, watch it first and then look it up if you still aren't sure as it may change your opinion of it.I don't wish to ruin any of the story, so I shall finish by saying 'The Cabin in the Woods' was a refreshing experience, written by creative minds and featuring a well-formed cast, supported by well-made special effects. If any of you are tired of watching the same old slasher-horror movies, you will certainly appreciate this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie for Horror Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really is just a ton of fun. It's not really meant to be scary and it's almost not a horror movie. Upon reading the "hated it" reviews, I have discovered that those people really didn't follow what was going on. They also walked into the theatre expecting something totally different than what they got, just like everyone else. The difference is that they got mad when it wasn't what they were expecting where the rest of us collectively said, "Hell yeah!" The characters were meant to be stereotypical horror movie characters, that was the whole point. The idea was that these people were supposed to follow a very specific outline of what was supposed to happen, the virgin is the only one allowed to live et cetera. I don't want to give too much away, but the plot really has very little to do with the "stereotypical characters" that everyone is so whole heartedly whining about. Don't expect to be scared, but expect to be intrigued and surprised by something very different than anything you've seen in any genre. It's fun, it's funny, and it's different. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great concept expertly realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't give this movie anything less than a 10, since I can't remember wanting to see any contemporary horror films more than once (and usually I wish I'd never seen them the first time). The genre has become so overly tired and cliché that it's not fun anymore. "The Cabin In The Woods" gets that, and misdirects the expectations of the audience. If you go into it knowing nothing about it, you might think you see where it's going, but then the movie takes a sudden turn and suddenly you're in uncharted territory. It's not exactly terrifying, but it does show you things you've probably never seen before. For that reason alone, I can't say enough about it. Many of the negative remarks I've read seem to have been from people who wanted a traditional horror movie of the kind that's spoofed here, although I can't imagine why anybody would really want another movie about a group of young people terrorized at a cabin the woods. This movie aims higher and I appreciated that. Even if you hate it, you've got to admit, it was an original concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's like a monet"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>in the classic movie called clueless there is a scene when Cher compares the girl to a Monet. Far away it looks cool but up close its just a big old mess?This movie falls squarely into that category. In theory it works and falls under the whedonverse world of snarky cleverness in it's approach.The reason people have got to stop praising it as this genius commentary of horror movies is because in their effort to pile on homage after homage and still maintain their quick wit they left out a few key factors that make a movie work and the audience is left with a lot of pretty crucial questions. Don't get me wrong, it had its moments. After Fran Kranz dropped the "stoner" voice that he felt like he needed to have in the first ten minutes of the film, his natural charm helped make the character likable. Brian White showed the moral conflict for a guy working a new job that is just weird.But everything else kind of floundered. You can say that it was too clever for its own good. Maybe if it didn't revert to the "it's awesome because the whedonverse says its so" reason for doing things, then people can see the holes that exist. And if some can poke so many holes in the movies plot, doesn't that mean it's not as good as it is made out to be? The worse thing about it is the ending. On the one hand it is genius because after the many twists and turns the movie has already made it turned it around once more, just for kicks. At the same time, the implications of the ending are really depressing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rating on this movie (which is part of the reason I watched it) just goes to show you that you simply cannot rely on the voting system here at IMDb anymore. There are entirely way too many cast and crew going and "reviewing" their own movies and giving them ridiculously high votes.As an unbiased viewer, I can sum it up in one short sentence: this movie was a ridiculous, laughable and shameful waste of time.I absolutely love horror movies. I don't expect much of a storyline, but something plausible is always nice. In Cabin in the Woods, it seems like they tried TOO hard to make a storyline, and a joke of one at that.I'm still cringing at the fact that I actually wasted an hour and a half of my time on this trash.

		<shortDescription>"You think you know the story"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films - Clichéd, stupid, poorly-acted, teenage-produced, campy, torture porn, lame twist, and contrived. This is what I passed this film of as, because every film nowadays has never done anything new. But who could go wrong with a film written by Josh Whedon? I took my chances and went, totally oblivious of what I was getting myself into... The Cabin in the Woods takes all the modernized clichés of these overdone films and presents them just as they are. We have stereotypical characters, the clichéd plot devices, and even the setting of the cabin in the woods. The movie uses these, yes, but then shreds the clichés all to pieces. It's going to be hard doing a review for this film, because everything about it is a twist. Even the beginning twists the story into something new, and it was just simply brilliant... The acting was surprisingly pretty good. It was sometimes hard to rate the teenager's acting because they were trying to be so clichéd and stereotypical as possible as any other teenager in any other horror film, so in that case they did wonderful. I loved the "behind- the-scenes" look and the duo of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. They added wit and something newer to the film... That reminds me, the movie is hilarious. The movie combines comedy + horror as good as Shaun of the Dead did, but better. Believe it or not, the film is a satirical comedy envisioned the truth behind these horror films, and it works brilliantly. I found the stoner good as comic relief, but honestly I thought they did too much with him... The plot. This was the best part. The movie did not just create a good horror, it broke the bar and created an underlying message about the truth of horror films. It was insanely cleverly done, and it was possibly the most entertaining and smart film this year. I really don't want to spoil the twist, but let me just say it is the best twist I could ever think of, and it was also really true... Should you see it? The movie is way better than I thought it would be, and it deserves it critical praise. If your expecting what I thought the film would turn out to be, then you'll surely find it unbelievable. And horror fans will be treated to the greatest new twist of the genre, and it surely shatters it to pieces. The movie was one of the best of the year, and it proves horror films need to be digested by our society, or else the world will end. Oops. 10/10.</fullReview>

So it wasn't horror and it wasn't funny either (in my opinion).It was so dark in places that it was hard to follow, which is always a minus.I know it's supposed to be "meta" but it just really wasn't very good.I would recommend that people wait for the DVD, although I do realise that I'm in the minority here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing that this movie had high reviews, I figured that this may be a good movie to see despite the fact that I'm not too big into horror films. I at least thought it would have an insightful plot. Boy was I wrong. The movie introduces a lot of details that never turn out to have significance later on. I also felt like there were just too many points in the movie where I was saying "well isn't that convenient". It had a lot of potential to be a good movie, but overall just let me down. Not very believable and too many holes in the story line. Don't see this movie if you like the movies you see to make sense and not be an (almost) complete waste of time.

		<shortDescription>Suffers From an Identity Crisis That I Couldn't Fight Through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been one to follow with the crowd. In fact, if something it popular, it's far more likely that I will oppose it rather than join in the love fest just out of principle. At the same time, however, I hate it when I don't like a film that all of my colleagues seem to adore. When this happens (which isn't very often), I always feel like I'm missing something or that I didn't understand the film which, in turn, makes me feel like a moron. In these situations, it takes everything in me to stand by my initial reaction and deny the peer pressure that would have me reverse course and join in the love fest. So let's get it out of the way up front: I did not care for The Cabin in the Woods. Needing some rest and relaxation, Dana (Kristen Connolly), her best friend Jules (Anna Hutchison), and Jules' boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth), retreat to a remote cabin recently purchased by Curt's cousin. The trio is joined by stoner-buddy Marty (Fran Kranz) and scholarly Holden (Jesse Williams), a friend of Curt's who Jules would like to set up with Dana. The cabin, while a bit on the rustic side, seems to be the ideal spot for the group to chill out and let loose. But before long, a hidden cellar full of creepy and mysterious artifacts is discovered and when Dana reads from an old journal, she unwittingly unleashes a terror upon the cabin that comes straight out of a nightmare that perhaps none of them will survive.To write a completely spoiler-free review of Cabin seems borderline impossible but I will try my best to stay away from the important facts. The behind-the-scenes concept of what is really taking place at the cabin is one of the cooler ideas I've seen in a film like this in quite some time. Someone or something pulling the strings in the background is not entirely unique within this genre but writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (also the director) bring a fresh take to the idea and make it their own beautifully early on. The happenings which take place away from the cabin (the spoiler-rific portions I shan't get into here) were BY FAR my favorite parts of the film and really left me wanting more when it was all said and done. By cutting back and forth between the events taking place at the cabin and those going on unbeknownst to our protagonists, Goddard creates a fun contrast through the first half of the film and gives dials up a sense of self-awareness that I almost loved for a while. But before long, I found that Cabin had no sense of true identity. I think the point of the film is to both poke fun at the horror genre while at the same time creating enough gore to satisfy genre enthusiasts. At times, Goddard and Whedon succeed in this but over the course of the film, I felt that instead of mocking the typical hallmarks of a horror film in hopes of creating a laugh in the midst of the scares (see: Scream), the duo only succeeded in laying the ground work for their own demise. That is to say, the film goes out of its way to point out the generic pratfalls that you could to expect from a slasher film and then deliberately falls directly into those traps over and over again. In essence, the film ends up becoming exactly what it sets out to make fun of in the early going. As a result, almost all of the jump-out- of-your-seat moments have been hamstrung by the Goddard telegraphing what was about to happen for the sake of the self-aware jokes. At the same time, I didn't find the film to be consistently funny enough to play as a real comedy (see: Shaun of the Dead). To be clear: there are some truly brilliant, witty moments and more than a few laugh-out-loud pieces of dialogue but not enough to keep the comedic ball rolling for 90 minutes. I think Cabin wants to be both a capable slasher film and a hilarious R-rated comedy but for me, the mix comes off almost as a half- hearted spoof. I think that all of that would have resulted in a three star, "totally acceptable entertainment"-type review from me had it not been for the fact that the vaunted twist which has had so many critics and viewers in a titter is really not that big of a deal. Again, I won't spoil anything but you can guess the basics of the twist within the first 15 minutes of the movie. (I promise I'm not one of those people who says, "I could totally see the twist coming" or, "I knew Bruce Willis was dead the whole time"; this is just a onetime thing.) I kept waiting and waiting for a real turn to catch me off guard and not only did it never come, that waiting took away from my enjoyment of the back half of the film. So while the whole, "Don't tell anyone the secret!" marketing campaign got me into the theater for a movie I probably wouldn't have seen otherwise, it also caused me to come out feeling extremely dissatisfied with the finished product.Believe me when I say, I wanted to love Cabin in the Woods. I wanted to write about Joss Whedon had reinvigorated the horror genre. And maybe more importantly, I wanted to see what all of my colleagues saw in a movie that almost everyone seems to love. But while the concept is fantastic and there are some definite and delicious Whedon-isms that play out through the course of the film, I cannot get on board for a film which suffers from such a tremendous identity crisis.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Not What You Think It Is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into "Cabin in the Woods" with zero expectations. I tried to stay as far away from the hype machine as possible. I avoided all trailers and TV spots, I didn't read a single review, and I didn't watch a single interview with any of the cast or crew. I wanted this movie going experience to be as "pure" as possible. All I knew going in was that it was written by Joss Whedon (creator of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer") and it featured a college aged cast trapped in a cabin?in the woods. Seriously, that's all I knew going into the film. I didn't want to know the twists and the turns. I know what expectations can do to a person and I know especially what it can do to a horror fan. So into the movie I went with a clear head ready for a new tale of terror. Let the carnage begin!"Cabin in the Woods" begins with five college students driving out for a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods. Among the group we have the beautiful and slightly "impure" Dana (Kristen Connolly) along with her attractive hunky jock boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth). We have the plain but pretty Jules (Anna Hutchison) who is being set up for a date with book smart boy-next-door Holden (Jesse Williams). Along as the fifth wheel is the punchline stoner Marty (Fran Kranz). That's all I'm going to tell you. Giving away what happens before or after this event will most likely hinder your enjoyment of the movie. All I can say is that some will die, some may live, and there is plenty of blood to be sprayed all around.If there is one thing that has to be said for "Cabin in the Woods" it is that it has a ton of ambition. Far more so than any other horror movie I've seen in years. The "twist" (which I refuse to give away even though many, many trailers and reviews have) is very clever and ingenious in concept. Like other "meta" horror movies, I enjoyed the references "Cabin in the Woods" made to past horror movies (particularly those in the slasher genre). However, that is where my love for the movie both began and ended. I thought this movie was a bit of a mess with no real follow through and an ending that was just lazy screen writing. I appreciated the concept behind this movie (which, again, I don't want to give too much away so I am being deliberately vague) but found the execution lacking. I also hated pretty much all of the characters and the "comic" relief felt flat to me. I couldn't wait for the "stoner" character to die and the less said about that, the better.I can understand and appreciate why people love this horror movie. It's something different. It isn't PG-13 and it isn't a remake. Nonetheless, I was left quite cold. This film attempts to be a clever horror-comedy packed with meta self awareness. Clever it is. Funny or scary? Not so much. This film is being billed as "Scream" for the next generation. That it is not. "Scream", for all its meta self awareness was both scary and funny as hell. Everything and everyone associated with this picture appear to either be trying far too hard or not enough, I'm not exactly sure which. I know I am in the minority here so if you have a desire to see this film by all means go out there and enjoy the hell out of it. I wanted to and didn't. I appreciate it when any horror movie gets recognition and acclaim. I love to see horror movies that make people fall in love with genre again. If I didn't fall in love with this one, that shouldn't stop you.</fullReview>

The general plot is pretty weak, and the ending is just the cherry on top! The events in the movie are too abrupt and easily anticipated. It also looks like a low budget movie overall. Also, the idea behind the story just sickens me. It almost seems like they are trying to mock horror movies by making the movie so ridiculous. The transition between one event and the next happens way too quickly and abruptly. The entire movie is pretty predictable from the beginning, which weakens the plot and ruins the movie.</fullReview>

We have a movie that troughs in the blender some of the most iconic horror images and scenarios and presents it all as NEW, Refreshing and "Black Comedy".. In order to pull something like that off you must first know what material you are using, 2nd you must Respect the material and 3rd you must have some talent...

The most idiotic and completely stupid fact is the whole "show" thing that has been going on (for ages). A show that goes on worldwide and nobody sees! Except perhaps for the overseers themselves. Around the world sacrifices are being made for some OLD ONES (here comes Cthulhu) but not as any intelligent person would choose to (get them, kill them and use their blood..) but through a parody where these individuals are lured into a so called cabin where they choose which monster or atrocity will kill them.! Because Cthulhu doesn't want a simple sacrifice but to see them suffer (and they can only suffer in the hands of zombies, ghosts, werewolves and other creatures that are conveniently tucked away in a nearby storage area). And these monster are REAL, not some androids made to look like them but the real deal.. mmm OK. Then comes the CUBE element, where all these are stored and operated in a cube like structure inside glass cages (and we all know how easy it is to store ghosts and other spirits inside an elevator?).We also have the girl from Silent Hill, and a dude that refers to Pinhead. And yes they even have a Cracken inside one of these 2m x 2m champers!! ?.ok And then comes the crown jewel! The sacrifice chamber where they need a "HO", an "athlete" , a "scholar", a "jester" and a "Virgin" (who has been screwing with her professor as we first learn in the movie..) to appease Cthulhu! One question for the enlightened minds that wrote this crap, and the critics that praised it, which one of the elementary school Japanese girls (from the Tokyo show) is the "Ho" and which is the "scholar"???90% approval by official critics?

		<fullReview>In the past decade we have not gotten many great horror films, most have been reboots and remakes of older franchises (i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th). It was fantastic getting a horror film that was fresh and new, and put a great spin on the horror movie franchise. It takes the familiar horror storyline (a group of friends in some remote place who get picked off one by one) and turns it on its head and gives the viewer something they would never expect. I honestly cannot recommend this movie high enough, any horror movie fan would love this film because it is not your typical horror film. I would put this up there with "The Shining", "Alien", and the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" as far as horror movies go. If you have not seen it, do not miss it. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the 12 year old mentality of Joss comes Cliché the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point a condescendingly ironic movie about genres is a cliché in itself. Joss Whedon &amp; company take every cliché you have seen in horror movies &amp; make a loud, unfunny "wink wink" to nerds who apparently can't get enough drugs, boobs or blood. Commenting on the mythology, spook stories and slasher clichés does not forgive rehashing it with bad dialogue. The twist *SPOILER* of the movie is nothing new. Night Dreams is a far superior porn movie with the exact same type of questioning of reality that Philip K. Dick novels explore. Cold observers studying people and and recording the results for us in the audience. The Scream movies were at least funny and stuck to one type of horror cliché. They throw everything at the audience with a loud thud to make you jump from surprise not out of any honestly earned horror. It was cute to see a unicorn or merman but the blandness stifled a laugh. A Ghost, wolf, Hellraiser Cenobite, unicorn, H. P. Lovecraft monster, snake and the most over used, Zombies. The notable missing homage is to the Exorcist (although there was green vomit among the chaos) to remind you of a classic well made film might remind you that this is just Evil Dead without the skill of Sam Raimi, Joel Coen or Bruce Campbell. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the greatest success for these writers. I think their stunted nerdy obsessions are the right maturity level for high school girls. Joss avoids adult themes or creative dialogue to rely on pop culture references and lines from other movies. His string of ill-fated scripts include Alien: Resurrection, Firefly, Dollhouse. All of which had good nuggets of ideas buried in embarrassing lines &amp; lost opportunities in plot. Buy EVIL DEAD 2 and forget this movies sad Family Guy humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The year's biggest disappointment (so far)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to it after hearing all the hype from film festivals as to how it will redefine the horror genre. And with Joss Whedon's name attached, I was expecting something special.But then I saw this yesterday at an advance screening and all I could think while I was watching this was what a missed opportunity of epic proportions!! Forget any real irony or subversiveness; neither scary or funny, unmemorable characters, implausible even within the realms of horror/science fiction; build up to a twist that is that isn't really a twist (I am pretty sure they came up with that at the last minute and pulled out a big name star hoping no-one would realise what a cop-out it really is) and an underwhelming ending with no point! Makes you appreciate Scream which masterfully dissected the modern horror movie and remained scary and funny at the same time. So overall like an average episode of 'Tales From the Darkside' from the 80s but without a decent twist.And if you do feel the urge to see a film about a cabin in the woods and have already seen The Evil Dead, go rent the little seen but wonderful Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly astounding and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is very familiar, 5 college friends go into a cabin deep inside the woods for a fun weekend and hell ensues, in this occasion hell REALLY ensues.Writers Joss Whedon (The Avengers) and Drew Goddard (Netflix's Daredevil) are giving us a completely different take on the genre that I personally didn't see coming. Of course the young people are attacked, dismembered, killed in all cruel ways imaginable but behind it all there is a higher purpose for their death (I am not joking).It is a nice mixture of horror and a lot of comedy, something Whedon and Goddard are used to since their work on the popular Cult TV Show Buffy the Vampire Slayer.I respect the filmmakers for using such a fresh approach to all of this and the result is one of the best movies of the genre I have ever seen.It might not be scary, it might be campy... but it is so much fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so there's a lot of controversy amongst the watchers of this film, half saying it's a cinematic masterpiece and the other half saying it's dreadful. I know mine is just another opinion, but hear me out.This film is garbage. It's complete Hollywood-Indie trash, with Whedon practically acting like a three year old who had way too much money left over after the first Avengers film and just went "aaaaaaah fudge it" and made one of the most overdone messes of a film I've seen in years. And I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.It. Is. Garbage. It take satire to a whole new level, actually managing to miss it completely in parts. It's loud and crowded and overacted and underdeveloped, and it comes out as this dirty little diamond amongst a genre that really does take itself way too seriously most of the time.The concept is excellent, with the scientist/occultist crew literally so overdone i nearly cried with laughter every time they spoke, and the menagerie of monsters an absolute delight in their selection (the mermaid, I will never recover). Yes, it's not brilliantly acted- thats the bloody point! This whole movie is meant to be a laugh (and if you didn't laugh at Hemsworth's character's abrupt departure from the film you have poor taste because that was comedy gold), and even the monster bloodbath in the final quarter is crafted specifically for humour. There are a few scares, particularly towards the start, but as the movie goes on the warped humour of it all takes the foreground, and I honestly found the lack of bothers this film gave a very refreshing thing to watch.So basically, if you are out there looking for a super well crafted and suspenseful horror film, this isn't the go to for you. But, if you want a movie that is nothing like you've seen before (and you'll probably be glad about that) with just enough scare to feed your masochistic tendencies, and a very typical Whedon flare, look no further. This movie made me want to hit my head against a wall until I passed out, only so I could regain consciousness and probably watch it again. Give it a go with an open mind and you may just be surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read somewhere that this movie had been referred to as being a love letter to horror movie fans everywhere and I figured it had to be hyperbole. I have never been happier to be proved wrong.I won't spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, and describing anything about the plot would almost assuredly do so, but it was amazing.I recommend that anyone who enjoys horror of any kind, but especially the more cerebral variety, should get one hell of a kick out of this one.

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is a spoof of slasher/teen/cabin films. It makes no apologies for that. However, if you've ever bothered to familiarize yourself with H.P., you are truly no horror fan. Yes, it makes fun of the typical Jason/Michael/Hills Have Eyes genre. But it is rather original in that it delves into a totally different scheme. It is camera en camera as well as a dark humor style I absolutely found intriguing. It brings us to a level of laughing at teen horror film styles, then interjects something far more adult in nature.It actually made people resume their interest in Lovecraft. You who thought this film sucked, was actually one of the best on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a true horror movie than most reviews let on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping for a horror-comedy along the lines of "Shawn of the Dead", but instead this movie is much closer to a straight up horror movie, albeit with a clever plot and some comedic elements and witty bits. I don't care that much for horror movies, although I am up on what goes on in the genre, so I think I got all of the jokes and references in this one. It's meta and satire in the same way as the "Scream" franchise, but I feel it was much harsher in terms of horror effects and plot. If you are into horror movies, I'm guessing that you're going to love this film, but it's just not my thing. I am still rating it highly, because I have to grant that it was very well done and an unexpected twist on conventional horror movies, and I can't quite say I regret watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in the Woods (8/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods takes your typical campy horror plot, a bunch of kids, on a weekend getaway, to a remote cabin and flips everything you know about that, upside down. Joss Whedon and Drew Goodard wrote an incredibly creative horror script, well not according to Peter Gallagher, but in terms of the onslaught of prequels, sequels, and remakes, it does. The cast for this movie was near perfect. Richard Jenkins's and Bradley Whitford's characters were hilarious, yet ruthless. The five youthful campers are headlined by Kristen Connolly and Chris Hemsworth, a couple big catches, since some might consider these risky roles. Once the movie's plot turns away from its "Evil Dead" type feel, into its whacky rabbit hole, the movie starts to get extremely interesting. Horror generalizations, elements, monsters, one liner's and themes are poured into this zany film. Is Cabin in the Woods ridiculous, yes, is it absurd and deranged, yes. Is it also a fun thrilling ride completely original to anything recently, most definitely! There are a few questionable eye rolling moments but overall it's a great watch, perhaps one of the top films of the twenty-tens decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly original, fairly generic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved horror movies where the main action takes place in an isolated house, hotel, cave, cabin or whatever. They just have a tendency to enthral me and capture my imagination. So that's what made me purchase this film when I saw it at a local bargain bucket store.The beginning had me a bit bamboozled - I thought I'd picked up Austin Powers by mistake. I kept watching and soon realised that the film was more a blend of The Truman Show, The Evil Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Texas Chainsaw...and Scooby Doo. It's basically a spoof of the horror genre without being too zany (as in it's not like Scary Movie). It shows us how silly and illogical horror films can be and is completely self aware (The bit where the Jock says "No matter what happens we have to stay together" only to say a few seconds later "This isn't right. We should split up" is hilarious).There are actually a few other laugh out loud moments, most of which are the result of the stoner character doing or saying something.So, of course this film isn't made to be taken seriously. It is a commentary on how predictable horror movies can be - and what would happen if they didn't stick to this format i.e. it would lead to the collapse of civilisation and the end of the world (obviously). It is great and original in this aspect and I admire it for the movie it was designed to be. It basically says what we've all been thinking for years. That being said, maybe about 70% of the movie is the stereotype it's trying to mock. The writers/directors have used a magician's misdirection to fool you into watching (for the most part) a generic horror film while claiming it's something else. Nevertheless, I have to say I did enjoy it and would say it's worth a watch if it comes on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is something different from classical horror movies like "Wrong turn". Screenplay is very good (I mean on dose of mystery to the bitter end) Zombies is the best part of this movie, he's create perfect. Maybie is some scenes too dark (from my perspective). First 2/3 of movie can be little boring but when you look full movie you will see that's O.K for whole story. Sounds also very good in particular when zombies in focus. End is something different for horror movies and that is best thing in whole storyAll 5 main actor's are very good,specially Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz. Character of Marty is perfect, like his write just for Fran Kranz.Very good movie for "kill" some boring afternoon if you like horror's and mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out like any other, with the clichés and typical horror movie stupid teens, but then takes a complete 180!! They resurrect a bunch of zombies, that office people are controlling, and making sure that everyone dies when they are supposed to, and so on and so forth. I didn't like how light hearted they felt about killing innocent people, I found that to be offensive. Although it is original and rather clever. Then 2 of them figure out what the heck's going on, but wait, then Sigourney Weaver shows up, and explains how the gods of the earth must have a sacrifice of stupid teen blood in a certain order, or the world will END. And Of course the world ends up ending, which I don't Really like it when a movie ends with the destruction of the entire earth, I feel empty about it, since the world ended, although thus film was entertaining and very original. Also I love how those 2 office guys died, and I adore Sigourney Weaver, so I was happy to see her! 6/10!</fullReview>

They kinda looked fairytale to me - though not all of them!I really liked the idea of the film, especially reality show thing. And I must say that at first, or better say first few minutes I was puzzled whether I was really starting to watch the beginning of the film or it was something else totally random!All in all, quite good.

But oh no, this is absolutely so much more. Shockingly good, quite frightening, all awesome....make sure you watch The Cabin in the Woods... This is one of the best movies I have seen in recent years - not just horror, but of every genre out there. It's full of sheer horror, craziness, twists and most importantly, entertainment.

		<shortDescription>Innovative and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot about this movie before I decided to see it. Since I am not a horror fan, I wasn't crazy about seeing it, but the more I heard about the more I got intrigued. One day, I decided to rent it and just see it. The result was an interesting and entertaining ride with unexpected results.1) The acting. Since the movie is not (primarily) focused on the teens I found that the two pillars of the movie are Jenkins and Whitford. The positive energy these two emit from the screen is contagious. It is obvious that they had so much fun acting that it is just a pleasure to watch them. But, the problem is, they were having such a good time acting two demonic and evil characters. The job that they do is disturbing beyond sanity, but their energy and fun made me root for them instead for the teens. And that is what disturbed me the most. This is one of the most interesting elements of the movie, the ones you are supposed to root for you want dead, and the bad guys are the ones who you are rooting for. The teens are so generic that there is almost nothing I can say about them. But, the point of the movie is to make them (too) generic, in fact one of the plot points is based on that. But, Kranz did a really good job. He was entertaining even more that it was intended, and he raised his character a little out of the boundaries, which was more than entertaining and fun to watch.2) The story. The thing one must understand is that this movie mocks all other teen-horror/slasher horror ever made. Elements of every cult horror can be found in this movie: Evil dead, Friday the 13th, almost every zombie movie ever made etc. Now, some would say that the movie is a copycat of all those movies, but the plot line is so ingenious that all those elements actually make sense and do not feel copied, but as well placed puzzle pieces. In all my years of watching movies I have never seen a movie that plays with horror elements so well. The climax is almost completely unexpected and innovative that one just can't believe it ended the way it did. Still, about two thirds into the movie the paste and story changes so abruptly that it leaves you stunned. The problem with it is that the change is explained too fast and too simple. The way the movie develops afterward is a bit rushed and the focus gets a bit lost. Still, the finale is exceptional and quite fitting for this movie. If the third part of the movie was a bit longer and more focused the final product would have been even more fun and interesting that it actually is.Every other aspect of the movie is not worth mentioning. It would be quite strange that a 95 min mystery-horror-comedy had more to offer than good acting and a great story with a couple of jump scares and quite a bit of gore. It is important to remember that everything you see has a reason, and if something feels familiar, that feeling is also there for a reason. An open mind and a box of popcorn with this movie guaranties a great evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I get it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie, people either really loved it or really hated it and I get both. Lets face it, most horror movies start out with a group of young people who usually end up getting picked off one by one- sometimes 2 at a time. Maybe there are 5 of them- maybe 2. For the most part, even Saw had younger people- even though they were killed in different ways. But there aren't many horror movies where the stars are middle aged people. Also- these young people are normally the athlete, the quiet one, the spacey one- usually on some kind of drugs, and a number of other clichés. My point is that the beginning of this movie is like every other horror movie you've seen. Then it changes... If you like out of the box thinking- and Joss Whedon- you'll like this. I didn't like it right after I watched it- but then after I thought about it and realized just how clever it was- I liked it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror flick since Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the woods is the best horror movie i have seen since Scream, it takes all the Horror genre's and plays them back not to type. So the movie starts with a office or facility with normal office types engaging in normal general chit chat, which puts us the viewer at unease as we think hey this is a Horror movie whats going on here ?So then we are introduced to a group of Standard Horror characters in your staple road trip to a Cabin in the woods. We have seen this before with the likes of Cabin Fever, The Evil Dead and your Friday the 13th films just to name a few.The horror cliques are played to the max, the geek, the Virgin, the Jock, the easy girl. All enter the cabin and nothing much happens for a while till the observers (those in the office) open a hatch into the Cellar, surely a nod to the Evil Dead ?Everyone knows "Don't go into the cellar", but of course they will and they do, and this is where the twist comes as unwittingly these teens choose their own demise with out realising it. You see down in the cellar are some artifacts that when chosen of interacted with bring out a certain monster. To carry on and reveal what comes next will spoil a film you simply must see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and smartly written and delivered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no great fan of horror movies and in particular I don't really like gore, so although I heard good things about this film, it never really appealed to me. I'm not sure why I ended up watching recently but I was very pleasantly surprised by what I found. Although the film opens in some sort of industrial/clerical banality, very soon we are in familiar territory as a group of college students head off to a cabin in the woods for a fun weekend. Despite the warning from an old man in a gas station about the dangers ahead, they continue up to the dark old cabin, where they find some weird things ? although perhaps not as weird as what lies ahead.The plot is bang on the genre tropes for a reason, and it does it very well. It is almost ironic that as a 'cabin in the woods' horror, it is pretty effective in how it works even though it is mostly meant as a pastiche of the genre. True enough it is not particularly scary but it is gory and effective in the way that so many of these things are. The contrast with the men in the offices is nicely played on many levels. I really enjoyed the linkage to modern horror films from different cultures, and the passive and humorous way in which they went about their job. I'll not say too much more than that, because although it an aspect of the film that unfolds from the start and throughout, my enjoyment was greater for not knowing anything.The delivery of the film is good. In the horror sections it gets the tone right, but also balances it very well with dark humor ? with neither detracting from the other. The cast are very good at what they do. The genre horror cast not only hit their marks but hit them well; Hemsworth and Connolly play their roles well, while Williams and Hutchinson have less to do but are still good. I enjoyed the Ash-referencing Franz a great deal. Meanwhile Jenkins and Whitford in particular do a good job with their side ? delivering with good comedy but convincing work. The special effects have a good quality of looking trashy but still effective ? very b-movie.The Cabin in the Woods is not as good as you have heard ? it is one of those films that catches a lot of people by pleasant surprise, and as such it probably got a bit more hype than it could support; however it is an enjoyable film which cleverly plays with the horror genre while also delivering a good genre film at the same time. The comedy works surprisingly well and in the end it is a nicely written and delivered film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a masterpiece of the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this film a full 10 stars as it is one of the few that I felt truly deserve such a rating. Far too often we see horror films, where at least one person lives and all is right with the world at the end. The Cabin In The Woods does not do this or at least that is what we are left to believe at the end. We do not know the true outcome, though we are left with an idea from which we draw our own conclusions. The ancient ones apparently rise, but at that point the credits roll. The addition of comedy to this film makes it that much more enjoyable as I found myself laughing at some of the dialogue. This is not because it was so stupid it was funny, but because it was genuinely written to be funny and succeeded at such. The cast performed beautifully and the movie is what I would call a must see. I've seen some negative reviews for this movie and I have to wonder what movie those individuals were watching. It obviously wasn't this one. The premise of the movie is one that I've not seen done in this manner previously or at least not with this level of success. All in all, this is a must see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever for Horror!!..What a bunch of terrible reviews saying it sucks...What you been smokin? Not Us.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The ones that are smokin are the ones that say this movie sucks or is bad or worst movie ever. Probably the people that think PG-13 horror is the movies to see. What the? That is why they are PG-13, is because its for 13 and under, DUH! Man you are stupid bunch of turds.Simple fact that people over 13 and are adults are not really grown up yet if they think a PG-13 is scary. You need to get out more. So F*cking lame that people say those are better than these kind of movies or rated R and Unrated ones.I personally think that all the bad reviews of this movie, those people probably have a stash of the movie somewhere to watch on their own time, because they get bullied by others if they like the movie, and sounds just like kids, and what they would do is bully others. They actually love the movie, but instead of bullied, they come on this site and say it sucks so no one would know they actually love it.I am not scared of anyone knowing I love the movie. I would actually recommend it. I am not going to take some stupid crap from others saying its a bad or worst horror movie or say its not even a horror, when it is. Also for those saying its not horror, its just gore, and horror is not gore is just stupid too.Look up the definition of horror dummies. It says gore or disgust is in the definition. Most of the people that tear movies down are the child. Children are the ones or wimps that say PG-13 is better than the rated R or Unrated horror movies, and are not the true horror fans that watch them and love them. They should not be called fans of horror in no way at all.Anyone over the age of 13 and watches those PG-13 horror wanna be horror movies and screams like a teenager girl even if they are male, are just plain need to taught how to be a man, and stop playing with dolls. Get out of you closet and be the man you should be.Same goes for all the bad reviews of this movie.What really is stupid too, is the fact there are people that review on this site and never use the rating at all. Dumb as anything could be for that. Really, you know if you don't rate the movie, that it won't affect the rating at all, up or down. It does nothing to it. That is how stupid you people are for not rating it.This is going to be my longest review ever, because these bad reviews from dumb *sses are that stupid.Keep smokin it up like Marty and saying this movie sucks.One thing I did not like is minor was just the way it started slow. Yes, I like fast and gory get to the killing people off movies in horror. This actually started off slow. Hate me for that all you want.Once they pick their rooms in the cabin though and that dare game it picked up nicely. For those that say this was the same as "The Evil Dead", its not. Different buy a lot. The scene where Curt and Jules were going to start going at it was great in the woods. It was kind of little slow even when they started being killed off one by one, by the Redneck Zombies.Marty was dumb and smart, which is kind of dumb, but was sort of funny. The way they were killed off was funnier than Marty. My best part of the movie is when Marty and Dana go into the elevator, and see all the horror characters on the elevators rotating, and they unleash them to keep them from being shot by the swat team.Once they were all released, the evil characters from other horror movies was a blood splatter fest. People that say this movie is gory is the ones that probably left the movie before it got to that point. Would be awesome if they made this movie Unrated. It would never happen.The cameo appearance of the actress from Aliens, and Ghost Busters was a little off, but fit at the end fine. All in all, this was one of the best horror flicks out there, and heck of a lot better than any PG-13 so called horror movie, that should actually be called "Thrillers".I recommend this movie to anyone, but there are haters out there no matter where you go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've often wondered with horror films wherein an evil horror from the depths of the world is brought forth by an unwitting protagonist whether an otherworldly bureaucrat with a clipboard is somewhere ticking items off on a list and providing due diligence before rubber stamping the unleashing of the relevant supernatural entity to wreak havoc upon the unfortunate victim. How close do they have to get it? Will a Vay instead of a Vaa do it? Close enough mate, off you go now and wreak your death and destruction on the feckless humans, I'll overlook it this time. And what do they do whilst they are waiting to be unleashed. The answers are sadly not in this film, however the solution as to where these evil entities are brought forth into this world, as opposed to how, is dealt with here in a manner provides a wonderful set up for the excellently entertaining final act of this short, fun and highly amusing movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a one of a kind movie then this is a must watch. It has it all! Comedy, drama, action, suspense, thriller, and zombies!!!! Yup, zombies! But not your ordinary boring zombie-type of movies. This has twist written all over it! I watched it and had no idea what the story was about. And to my surprise, it's really a good one!There's a bunch of questions in the end of the movie that were not explained but if you're the type that just wants to enjoy a movie and not get too obsessed with the loopholes of a movie, then this is for you. Definitely not a waste of 95 minutes of your life!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding breath of fresh air to the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five friends go away for a trip to a secluded cabin in the woods? and no, you haven't seen this one. 'Cabin is a love letter to all of the wonderful things in the horror genre by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard. I really did not know what to expect with this movie, but I knew it would be worthwhile. There is this wonderful aspect in the writing where you think you know what will happen, but you get completely blindsided. While I disagree with the majority of horror fans in that there are zero good ones being made anymore, The Cabin in the Woods was an outstanding breath of fresh air to the genre. I haven't been this satisfied with a horror movie since Trick 'r Treat. The detail in this movie was epic, to put it lightly and is one of the reasons you never get bored from watching it multiple times. It was a true labor of love from people who understand the genre. Another noteworthy aspect of the movie is they used practical effects as much as possible, which is a very rare thing today. Any filmmaker will tell you that digital effects are far easier, but it's nice to see a big studio film (let alone one of horror) not use CGI as a crutch. The Cabin in the Woods is hands down a modern-day horror classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for the right kind of person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching The Cabin in the Woods, you must bear two things in mind:1. This is not a pure horror film. Like the Scream franchise before it, this is the kind of movie that tries to function as both a genre film and a parody of the aforementioned genre. It is not scary, but it was not meant to be. Plus, if I were to judge a horror film solely on whether or not it genuinely scared me, then I could count the number of successful horror movies I've seen on my fingers.2. This is co-written by Joss Whedon, and whilst it is directed by Drew Goddard, it is very much Whedon's film. If you're not a fan of his particular brand of humor, you'll have a very tough time sitting through The Cabin in the Woods. The majority of the negative reviews of it can be attributed to this, especially those found on this website.With that out of the way, let's talk about how much I adore this movie. It's beautiful. It's fantastic. It's the best horror film I've seen since Shadow of the Vampire. I positively love The Cabin in the Woods; in the last twelve months, I have watched it four times, tying it with Black Dynamite for the movie I've seen the most in a year (which I suppose gives you a pretty good idea of what my sense of humor is like). The premise seems like the same tired movie we've seen in the horror genre too many times since The Evil Dead came out: five college students travel to a decrepit hovel in the middle of nowhere to "get away from it all". There, they proceed to drink, get high, and have sex until they find some macguffin (usually an old book, as is the case here) that contains jumbled Latin that raise some form of evil, in this case, a family of undead Rednecks hellbent on murdering all of the students in various brutal ways. But here there's a twist: the whole thing has been rigged by a secret worldwide organization set up to protect the world from being destroyed by the Elder Gods by presenting them with specific blood sacrifices.Herein lies the beauty of the film: the dumb things done by the five young adults have been set up by the organization to make them more suggestible. The requisite promiscuous blonde, for example, is actually a natural brunette who has dyed her hair blonde with a dye that has been chemically treated to make her dumber. On top of that, the inclusion of the giant, shady organization allow for the best scenes in the movie. The employees make the snarky commentary for us, and the funniest bits come from how routine these awful events are to them. They could not be more bored with the fact that five people are being picked off one by one by zombies. None of his is spoiling anything, by the way- the very first scene takes place in this building. You might have been fooled, as I was, into thinking that the trailers gave away the twist. They certainly did not. Nor will I, but I will say that the last thirty minutes get very, very weird. Again, this explains why I'm so fond of this film: there was a time, not too long ago, when horror movies were not only encouraged to be as bizarre as possible, but were expected to be so. It was a lovely time, when even the crap could at least be considered fascinating. Those days are- alas- over, and in its place has sprung up an era of dull, gray, un-creative horror films. For all the gore they heap upon us, most modern horror films have completely forgotten to be interesting. But out of the ashes like a particularly insane phoenix rises The Cabin in the Woods. A film that boldly goes where few horror movies have gone in the last fifteen to twenty years: completely off the rails. And. It. Is. Glorious. The last half our of this film is wonderfully demented, throwing everything they can think of at us, eventually leaving the least amount of room for a sequel that a film could possibly leave in its wake. It's a welcome change of pace from the boring mob of pointless sequel bait.It's a truly wonderful thing to behold. That's enough gushing on my part*: go see it.*No pun intended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with this movie is that it feels like it was originally intended as a straight ahead horror movie(albeit with dumb clichéd characters), but at some point the makers decided to change it to a spoof style. Either that, or they have done a very poor job of making a spoof movie. Even the trailer doesn't make it clear the style this movie really is, which is sure to leave viewers disappointed when they discover what it actually is. Its really not clear, until quite well into the film, when the first 'spoof' moment occurs, instantly leaving you thinking 'what the..? oh great, its one of those oh so funny spoof movies..' Whatever they've done, it doesn't work - there's no consistency in the style here, and when the 'spoof' moments occur they feel out of place, like an afterthought, added on later. Its a shame, because underneath this mishmash of styles is actually a very good story with an original twist on the horror genre. This could have been genuinely scary and clever like the Saw series (which BTW, there are echo's of here at points) but instead in ventures into silly territory. What a shame..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set expectations to 'stun' (not stunning) for this not particularly scary, but interesting effort. I'm not a big horror fan, so I'm not sure if this is post-Scream or post-post-Scream post-found-footage, but it's an entertaining enough film with a twist at the start that runs through it. The proceedings are unremarkable, although there are decent turns from the leads. Chris Hemsworth is convincing as the ubiquitous jock, and Kristen Connolly is engaging as the heroine in peril, but it's the underlying premise and the presence of Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford that will prevent you from turning off after the first fifteen minutes. And for me the story does offer something in addition to the usual tired horror clichés, even if the payoff is disappointing, not least down to the introduction of the CGI equivalent of claymation and polystyrene. You should be entertained, somewhat, if you are willing to go along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! Whatever your expectations of this movie are, they're wrong. It's a flick I've been meaning to watch for a while now, and just got around to it. It looked like a fun little horror flick, and I had no idea what I was really getting into by watching.For the first 15 or 20 minutes, I really was starting to worry it was going to be a lame film as we're introduced to some cliché characters. I'm glad I kept watching, because it became clear that having these characters be such tired clichés was exactly the point, and they're used to perfection as the plot starts to get more and more whacked out.Like everybody else is saying, I am not going to get too in-depth about the plot details because it will really detract from your experience more than any other movie I can think of. Go into this one without any expectations if possible. Just hit play, sit back, and have a blast. I'll probably watch it again in the near future to see how many things I didn't pick up on the first time. I'm sure there are many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good. But judging by the commercials it looks like a scary movie. Right? Well guess again. Because it really isn't that scary. at least not to me and I am a 12 year old girl. My little brother didn't even think it was scary and he gets scared pretty easily. So you know that says a lot. This would be a good movie if you're looking for something like hunger games. Spoiler Alert; Because they are out there and its they don't know it but they are on a TV show that is set up where there are people controlling what happens. So if you're looking for a scary movie. I wouldn't go for this. Instead watch something like Mama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is mixture of Friday 13th, Hellraiser and of course Truman Show. There is a bit of The Osterman Weekend (camper chase scene). Anyway the parts sadly do not make great whole. I enjoyed movie scene by scene not necessarily connected. For instance i like movie as THC promotion. Character that smokes pot knows better :). There are some seriously sexy scenes with Anna Hutchison. If separated i'd rate some parts 8 or 9.But mood isn't established, viewer is driven from one point to another to another too fast. Suspension fails. Monsters are popping out, there is no place to hide not for a second to think over the situation. Being in the house in the basement or later underground there is plenty of chance for claustrophobia, but none. Director should watch Alien before making this movie.You get used to characters not being really dead. I don't mean zombies but folks you considered done they come back as there was nothing wrong. Not very realistic right? No loss of blood or internal injuries.All in all i give 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not been much of a fan of Joss Whedon's other work, I didn't see this movie in theaters. I did see the Avengers in theaters, and thought it was okay, nothing really that special, which I know is not a popular opinion. However, I've heard great things about this movie, and when it came to Netflix, I had to give it a shot.That was an hour and a half I'll never forget.This movie is NOT for stupid people; I'll preface this entire review by saying that. I'm sure that there are plenty of people who saw this in theaters and completely missed the fact that the majority of it is satirizing the average horror movie. The characters make smart decisions initially, though are led by the forces controlling it all to make cliché, idiotic decisions and assume the roles of cliché B horror movie characters. Despite being endlessly interesting, I laughed my ass off at so many scenes in this movie.That, truly, is what makes it special. I can't remember a movie that blends satire with an overtone of "WHAT THE #$%^ IS GOING ON?!" more than this one. It's not the South Park brand of satire (and I love South Park) - with The Cabin in the Woods, the satire is there, but it's woven in with an overall very interesting story that keeps you guessing the entire time. It took me quite awhile to figure out what the "corporation" aspect of the movie was, though I did get most of it before the "big reveal".When the Japanese section was being shown for the first time, I thought to myself, "Is that the girl from the Ring?" It is. That is a PERFECT example of the subtle brilliance that this movie throws at you that will be lost on most people. Let me explain. The Ring was originally a Japanese horror film that is considered to probably be the best Japanese horror movie ever, and was remade into the English version that we all know a few years after. On top of that, there are many other characters from other horror movies thrown into the giant chaotic slaughter at the end. It, The Strangers, and many more that I haven't seen are given just enough screen time to let us know who they are. Why is that so brilliant? It gives us a reason, although fictional, for the stupid, ridiculous decisions of the characters in EVERY OTHER horror movie, and those last few minutes are truly the ultimate satire of it all, in addition to the very interesting and dramatic climax of this completely new story.Also, the final decision the characters make is from a very apathetic viewpoint of humanity; yet another thing that I can appreciate so much. Humanity really has served it's time on this earth. Let's let someone else have a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in the Woods: Homage to Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a confession ? last night was the first time I saw Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon's The Cabin in the Woods. Believe me, I hang my head in shame whilst writing this admittance. Now, however, I can sit bolt upright with a big grin on my face after experiencing such a brilliant film. I enjoyed it so much in fact, that I feel compelled to write this somewhat love letter to a film that is well... a love letter in itself, a declaration of adoration for the horror genre.For those of you who have not seen it (I won't lambast you as I don't really have a leg to stand on here) the film follows the basic premise of five teens taking a vacation to a cabin... in the woods (funnily enough). Whilst there they manage to unearth some deadly goings on and all hell ensues, as each teen is ultimately killed off one by one. Pretty formulaic no? Well herein lies the brilliance in the film ? Goddard and Whedon not only recognise this traditional horror formula but wave it in our faces and play with it for the entirety of the film . From the beginning we are introduced to Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley (wonderfully played by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford), who are technicians or 'gamemasters' manning a soulless control room. They (to a certain extent) control the fate of said teens, moulding them into stereotypes (slut, jock, joker, nerd and virgin) and induce pheromones that ultimately make them hornier and stupider (heaven forbid they actually stick together in a crisis). Basically every horror cliché is knowingly implemented in order to cause the inevitable demise of our beloved teenage protagonists (or so we are led to think). Now, I know what you're thinking and yes ? Wes Craven did do this with Scream in 1996. However, his postmodern take was primarily on the slasher sub- genre. Goddard and Whedon cover it all.The death of each teen is caused by the zombified Buckner family, an undead crew the teens unknowingly raised themselves. Whilst I love a bit of zombie action as much as the next person, it albeit felt anti- climactic. That is until two surviving teens manage to break into the control facility and let loose every horror creation you could ever think of via a "system purge". An all matter of carnage ensues creating the most entertaining sequence of the film. Fair enough, the ending of the film may spoil the whole experience for some but for me it didn't ? I was still reeling with enjoyment over a Merman eating Hadley. In fact, I will still reeling with enjoyment over the preceeding 80 minutes or so. As a film I believe it was totally miss-marketed and therefore underrated. It's not your typical horror film as most punters believed, nor is it a "game-changer". It's an intellectual, postmodern homage intertwining every horror cliché and monster into the narrative. That, and it's all spectacularly delivered via brilliant script and enjoyable performances (particularly by Jenkins and Whitford). There is no literal breaking of the "fourth wall" but Goddard and Whedon know we are there and are having fun with us. Well, trying to anyway. For those unfamiliar with the horror genre, the subtext and intertextual references will be totally lost on them. The influx of all things monstrous at the end will no doubt appear silly and definitely not terrifying (although that in itself is entirely subjective. For instance, if you have a fear of clowns or extremely toothy sugar plum fairies, odds are you will get a bit frightened). To horror aficionado's, however, it's a celebration, a love letter, a joyous game of who's-who in the horror genre as we revel in their destruction.The film is also wonderfully comical. The chemistry and one-liners from Hadley and Sitterson shine throughout and a scene transition within which the "final girl" reaches her apparent demise, but in the background whilst control room workers celebrate, is the epitome of sadistic comedy. As much as it is a love letter to the horror genre, it in some ways, is also a critique. The film highlights generic issues of senseless nudity via a scene in which men eagerly await a pair of boobs ("Does it really matter if we see...?" "Got to keep the customer satisfied..."). The five teens are also caricatures of the contemporary vacuous types that go hand in hand with the genre. Goddard and Whedon, furthermore, denounce the genres recent devolution in to torture porn territory by not including it whatsoever.Equally, there are a few criticisms toward the film itself. The use of CGI detracts from the experience and appears noticeably out of place. Also, as I have already touched upon, the ending was perhaps a step too far. The sadist in me would have preferred an even more nihilistic approach, with the film ending at Dana (our surviving 'virgin') shooting Marty (the 'joker'). Critics have expressed a disliking toward the films self-referential nature and lack of scares. However, I disagree. I may be biased as a horror fanatic, but there are enough thrills and spills to entertain everyone. Furthermore a little intelligence and self- reflexivity never hurt anyone... apart from those in the film of course.I completely understand that some may hate this film, finding it pretentious, silly and not even remotely scary. But hell, in essence it's two grown fan boys writing a love letter to the hyperdiegetic world of horror, and boy... did I enjoy reading it.</fullReview>

If you are a Joss Whedon fan, and you understand his humor...you will love this film as well. If you're expecting your normal horror movie...you're going to be disappointed. I think the artistry and concept may have lost a few, so hopefully you are not one of them. I had a friend who said he hated the movie, but then when I asked him why, he couldn't give me an answer. I said, but didn't "this part" surprise you, and he said "yeah." And, I said...well, wasn't "this idea" very original, and he said "well, yeah...but I just didn't like it." Just because you personally don't like the way something was done doesn't mean it was bad. People are horrible at reviewing things nowadays. Popping up on here saying "That was a horrible movie, don't waste your money." When they should be saying..."That was a very different thing...but it was definitely not for me." Just because something different was tried doesn't mean that it's a horrible movie and a waste of time...obviously. Especially since this movie is receiving excellent movie ratings across the board. Needless to say...it seems you'll love it or you'll hate it, but either way...I think it's worth a watch :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods has the most unimaginative premise imaginable for a horror movie. Five college young adults (two athletic guys, two beautiful girls and a nerdy junkie) decide to spend the week-end in an isolated cabin in the woods (pretty straightforward title, huh?). It doesn't take long before they awaken a "Zombie Redneck Torture Family". Does that sound like an overused, tired cliché or what? Truth be told, the movie makes a pretty bad first impression and its first half hour must have seen many leave the theatre. There is nothing original about those zombies. They're not even really scary. Two things however kept me interested enough to survive this poor beginning. First, even in this first part, the humour is a bit better than usual, and you can laugh even if you aren't a 15-years old teenager (and it only gets better in the second part). Secondly, there are frequent short interludes in a sort of underground laboratory, which let the viewer know there is more to this horrific cabin than meets the eyes.An indeed, about halfway through, the plot takes a dramatic turn. I won't spoil it, but suffice to say that we go from boring to pure, blissful entertainment. The story leaves the overly familiar territory and boldly turns into a festival of creativity. Not only does the second half completely redeem the first, it also sort of justifies it, story- wise. Overall, this is the best "horror with a comedy twist" movie I've seen in years, even surpassing the excellent Tucker and Dale vs Evil (which admittedly was much more comedy than horror). I therefore heartily recommend it, despite its disappointing beginning.</fullReview>

After some gruesome killings, the movie takes a drastic apocalyptic turn.And in the last 30 minutes, when only two of the original five still survive, all hell breaks loose. I mean it literally. Every creature, imaginable and unimaginable alike, is unleashed to run amok and gleefully kill humans in graphic, bloody detail.It is a ground-breaking horror movie that splendidly fuses horror, humor and science fiction in a thoroughly entertaining and intelligent package.

		<fullReview>"The Cabin in the Woods" looks to be another of those divisive genre entries that either pleases the viewer or annoys them. It's really not as clever as its filmmakers would seem to think, but it does offer a fresh spin on standard horror formulas for people desperate for something different.To reveal too much would be a mistake; it's best that people go in not knowing a lot. What this review will state is that on the surface this would appear to be an "Evil Dead" type of film about five young people journeying to the title location and having to deal with sadistic zombies. But things aren't as they appear. Other eyes are watching as the scenario plays out.The horror doesn't work as well as one might like due to the nature of the script, written by producer Joss Whedon (creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer') and director Drew Goddard. Still, some genre fans may be pleased to note the level of brutality on display. There ends up being a ton of special effects and spectacle. The ultimate revelation of why this is all necessary is really rather lame, but the audience may still enjoy being taken for the ride and appreciate the way that the story resolves itself.The acting from all concerned is solid, with old pro Richard Jenkins a standout. The five main roles are clichés - including a jock, a stoner, and a virgin - but as we will see the selection of such archetypes is quite deliberate. Fans will enjoy seeing the cameo appearance by a beloved genre superstar.Some genre fans may feel that this film is condescending to them and dislike what seems to be hubris on the part of the filmmakers in terms of their cleverness. Others will like seeing what amounts to an interesting deconstruction of genre staples. It's best left to the individual viewer as to how well this works or not.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

While borrowing plots and characters from other horrors (Jock, Tart, Geek, Virgin, party dude) and playing out familiar scenarios it's just a splendid notion that all this could be controlled from an laboratory/office environment.To then have the office staff bet on the victims likely killers genre (zombies,werewolf,unicorn!,, etc) again, superb. There's a good sprinkling of humour throughout the movie, and the killings are suitably gross. When things go belly up at the office late in the film, and the large stock of baddies run riot. This scene is a must see. I don't consider myself a big horror fan, but I do consider myself a fan of this. Switch of the lights, ramp up the volume,and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What I Expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The average campy slasher movie is fun because of the thrill inherent in the dangers the characters face, the suspense and irony of knowing what the characters are in for before they themselves know it (and, most likely, die from it), and because of the obligatory female nudity that all teenage males cheer for and all adult males discretely nod in approval of. This fun compensates for the downsides that also come with the territory, like the terrible acting, the horrible dialogue, and the pathetic plot.Fortunately, this movie has rid itself of the downsides and delivers on the fun factors in a big way! A cleverly written, very entertaining, and hilarious twist on the standard slasher-type movie, "The Cabin in the Woods" is a must watch for anyone who needs a good popcorn movie that packs something extra. (Make sure you watch with friends!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cabin in the woods" is a brilliant film, portrayed as the usual teenage massacre movie, it is however very deceiving.With this movie the expect the unexpected, as the usual horror/comedy cliché is flipped on its head with seriously jaw dropping events. I have never watched anything quite like this movie and i am a horror movie fanatic, the movie straight away ranks high on my list. What i most enjoyed about this movie is that as the mysteries are slowly uncoiling it makes you glued to the screen making the film feels like it was only 10 minuets long. The actors fit their roles perfectly and give you a few good laughs. "Cabin in the woods" is an absolute must watch as it dominated any other horror film releases' in that year. My only criticism is that a part two could not be released as it would not fit in, nevertheless it was unique and truly fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovation removes Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being original and having a big twist doesn't necessarily make a film good. For one thing, the twist in 'Cabin in the Woods' is introduced from the beginning, removing the prospect of a Usual Suspects style gasp moment, which can make an average film seem spectacular. My other big complaint about this film is that by far the most enjoyable section of it is the part before the twist really comes in, even though it seems to be a blatant rip-off of The Evil Dead. There is something timelessly entertaining about watching teenagers mess around in a log cabin, unaware that they are about to be ripped to pieces by zombies. Overall, Cabin in the Woods is not a bad film - in fact, it is rather clever and innovative. It's just in my opinion, that innovation takes away the fun of what should just be a fun log cabin zombie movie. And also, by the end, it just becomes so unrealistic that you feel like laughing and walking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really liked this movie and I am not a fan of the Horror flicks. I suppose not being one and forced to watch endless Horror movies with the wife, this came as a pleasant surprise. If you are expecting Friday the 13th and the like then you will be disappointed but if you are not expecting Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein then you will also not be disappointed for it is neither!!!! If the girlfriend wants to watch "a scary movie" and you want to watch, say, Dumb and Dumber, then stick this one on and you will both enjoy it. Well me and the wife did anyway!!!! As this "does not contain enough lines" I thought I'd add that you might also get lucky for choosing such a scary, funny, movie. (Didn't work for me, I'm married!!!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unpredictable comedy of horror tropes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has become something of a habit in Hollywood to point at horror movies and say, "isn't this silly?" The horror parody Scary Movie has four sequels, the Scream series is constantly one-upping the amount of meta-jokes and zombies are getting married with characters in 19th century literary classics. The storytelling tropes used in slasher films are well-known and largely discredited. Against this background, The Cabin in the Woods offers little we haven't seen. It is yet another parody on horror movies, pointing out their silliness while also showing the genre's effectiveness.Yet somehow The Cabin in the Woods still manages to feel fresh. It has a very unpredictable story, meandering in many different directions, and its characters, while nodding to typical horror stereotypes, are sympathetic, easy to relate to, fun to watch and occasionally even believable. The film has unforgettable scenes and dialogue and some striking visuals. The end is slightly flat, though, and the horror itself is rarely scary (though there is one scene that will make you grind your teeth as the shadow in the background moves closer...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't know what to think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with what we generally think during a horror movie. WE are all convinced that there will be a moment, somewhere in the movie, that almost everyone dies. We all know that, because that's our reference, that's our representation. Because the progression of a horror movie is quite simple: A small group's going to an unusual, they split up, and die somehow. This movie is trying to comply with it. But this movie is adding a story in it. The whole concept changes, but this is changing the course of the horror franchise.When I came out of the theater, I thought, what the hell was that? I mean, it didn't even look like a horror movie. Especially the ending. You're supposed to die, but if you're not dying, the world will end? It didn't make sense, but when I came home, it actually did.The point is, we are all used to the ordinary, and that's what we expected here. Now read the title. "The Cabin In The Woods". Well, that's pretty transparent, but no, this whole thing is a joke. We are trapped in a f'ed up plot that doesn't relatives with "normal" horror scenes. And, to be honest, it's not a joke. This shows us how different things could be, and the stupidest thing can still entertain me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genius, not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not every day that a genre bending movie such as Cabin in the Woods comes out. I loved this film, but I am surprised by all the negative reviews. You don't expect a strawberry, banana, pineapple smoothie to taste like only strawberries, or overpoweringly like banana, why would you expect a genre bender to be overwhelmingly comical or horrific? To begin with, the writing was well done. There are subtle layers that you pick up on the more you watch it. Generally that is considered to be good writing, when there are layers upon layers of subtle dialog and character development. Then of course there is the not so subtle dialog.It was comical. No it was not a film with both feet planted firmly into the most hysterical depths of comedy. IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE! The comedy, to me, created a refreshing contrast in a world of films where horror, screams and gore are all that is valued.It was suspenseful but not scary. I don't really like movies where things pop out all the time, so when I watch them, as the "scary" scene approaches I cover one eye and sink into my seat. This film provided enough eye-covering/seat-sinking moments that made my heart race. I understand some people need INTENSE HORROR to like a movie but again, this is not where the movie was trying to go.It was a conspiracy! The conspiracy was what made this film awesome. Because when I was asked if I wanted to see Cabin in the Woods or Promethus, I chose Promethus. I thought I knew the story already. Even once I watched the trailer I didn't KNOW the story.The characters were awesome. First, they were playing stereotypes without actually being stereotypes. The Virgin was not a virgin. The Athlete was studying sociology on full academic scholarship. The Scholar, while smart, played football. The Fool unravels the whole story, and the Whore was pre-med and acting like a "slut" because she was literally drugged. As for people who claim it was poorly acted or that the stereotypes were boring... THAT WAS THE POINT. Proof? The complacency of the story, of the work done by the puppeteers, they were so self satisfied that they ignored the warning signs of their down fall. Its called plot development and foreshadowing for those who would cry lazy writing.I personally found the editing to be very well done throughout. Awesome foreshadowing. Great dialog, original concept. Over all this move has several well developed themes that are reinforced through technical effects, especially the editing. Don't take the negative reviews here too seriously, just as you shouldn't take this movie too seriously. People who are hating are haters. They spend money on movies and choose to not be entertained. "It wasn't scary enough" "it wasn't funny enough"- Alright, you go make a better movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Cabin Gave Me the Fever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To avoid any kinds of spoilers, I will begin and finish this review with: I loved The Cabin in the Woods. See it. Thank you. Good-bye.(Man, I probably would double my fanbase all the way to two if all my reviews went like that?)There's been such an internet uproar on spoilers for movies, this one in particular. So much so, I finally avoided all podcasts and all reviews ? EVEN if they stated theirs didn't contain any. (Yeah, I know I am saying the same thing, so I understand if someone won't read this. But, allow me to assure you, I will NOT give anything away. It would be wrong on many accounts, but for the most part, this movie is plain fun as it progresses and divulging any secrets would ruin someone's amusement.)On a side note, sadly, one unhappy viewer on The Facebook® gave away one of the aspects I didn't know about. I quickly stopped reading and immediately dismissed their opinion thanks to ruining one part of this great film.This movie was, in fact, great, and as mentioned, it progressively got better ? which was hard for me since I ABSOLUTELY loved the intro and film's title appearing on the screen. In fact, few impress me, but this would fall in the top three next to The Silence of the Lambs and the "changed" one from Death Proof.Generally, I give a synopsis, and perhaps I can give a general one?five youths, all stereotypical Breakfast Club molds and usually found in these "cabin in the woods" horror films, travel to said cabin to party, but things aren't gonna be easy and they might have listened to the old, tobacco spitting gas attendant warning them to go no further. Sound familiar?Oh, GOD, if it were that simple, it would turn most away. I, however, LOVE those types of films ? and had wished the early 2012 release of Don't Go in the Woods would have been a 1/10 of that. But, I digress, that movie wasn't and this is dozens of times more fun, original, intelligent, scary and hilarious ? namely I loved the character of Pothead Marty who delivered the funniest and surprisingly deepest lines. It surely nourished all I craved growing up and so much more.I can see the reviewer's POV of giving away spoilers, despite their wrong-doing. This movie is almost 97.5% impossible to describe without spoiling anything the trailer didn't provide. But, like that remaining 2.5%, it can be done and suffice to say: This is the best new movie I've seen in 2012 and should be seen by all horror (and horror-comedy) fans, especially ones like me ? who grew up with horror all the way from the late 70s through to the 1990s horror.It was so good that any down time that's usually in the (honestly and I'm afraid) overused "Cabin in the Woods" horror story lines was filled with interesting, funny and fresh approaches. You cannot pinpoint pacing as a fault here or unoriginal ideas, EVEN with the same 'ole plot that's actually presented here.Summing this all up: if you're a horror-comedy fan, a (typically 1980s) "cabin in the woods" horror buff, you will love this fresh, exciting and bright approach?despite how dark it can be.Oops, I hope I didn't SPOIL anything there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading some of the reviews I have to say what's wrong with some of you? Are you just the parents of people who were turned down for the roles or are you trained in not knowing a good thing when you see it?!This film is full of clichés but that's the point it has enough suspense in it to hold your attention while providing the gore heads enough they can get off on. The great thing about this film is its not completely stereotypical, it blends different film genres well and has some very witty moments, on top of that.... Wait for it..... You actually like the characters and want to see them win!! Unlike other horror films where they look like the main characters have been chosen by shooting stun darts into a crowded primark.End result this film is a very good and enjoyable watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining Cabin in some original Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I finally decided to watch Drew Goddard's 'The Cabin in the Woods' I expected the clichéd tale of a group of youngsters vacationing in the woods only to be hunted by some psychopath or demonic creature. The truth is I was half right and half wrong, and boy was that wrong, really wrong!Chris Hemsworth is the big draw here and although his role was nothing Thor like, he does plays the big jock adequately. The other characters serve their purpose well while conspiracy theorist and stoner, Fran Kranz, is the stand out performer here. Veteran Bradley Whitford has to get a mention too, as you can't help but like his sadistically kooky character.As the end credits role, you may find yourself impressed with how the creators took an old, run down plot and flipped the script before remixing it Diddy style! Then, you'll begin to wonder if there's a sequel in the works as all you want is more!All in all, writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have done a fantastic job in seamlessly weaving horror and comedy together and creating a refreshing popcorn flick that will make you chuckle before shrieking in horror! Definitely worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must watch for horror fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First thing I really liked about this movie are the Taglines. viz. 'If something is chasing you... split up'... 'If an old man warns you not to go there... make fun of him'.They use all the clichés in a movie in this genre and creates a question in the viewers mind. Why would they do that? Thats the last possible thing I would do. This got me really interested in the movie and so I think got others too.Now, the movie has all the stereotypes of a horror movie of this genre. Has the same setup. 5 teenagers go to a deserted cabin to spend their holiday. An old man at a gas station warns them not to go there. They ignore it and start to go there. Then the movie starts taking a different path. Starts showing a bigger conspiracy in the ways things are shaping up. This is what will get the user glued to the movie. They manage to keep this mystery build up till the end. You manage to guess a little but some things still won't make sense till the climax scene where all the big explanation takes place.The movie obviously doesn't have any great acting and no character building, but thats how it was supposed to be. If they put any great actors with lot of back story in it, then the whole point of the movie will vanish. The mockery on the actions of a character in a movie like this wouldn't be there anymore. I give the movie a 6.5. Except for a few holes, it has a good story which is clichéd but begs to be different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last, an intelligent deconstrucion of the slasher movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years and years of repeating the same old tropes (and playing with them such as in Scream), at last, a perfect deconstruction of the tired and boring clichés that plague this genre.(HUGE SPOILERS NEXT) The point of the movie is "these stories are played this way to satisfy gods", which gods?, the horror movie audience, of course!. They are the torture porn addict gods, and reading some comments here about how this movie "isn't scary" shows how good this movie hits on the mark. Slasher flicks plots are just as pointless and repetitive as the ritual sacrifices in the movie, and if they are not played just straight as the audiences want, they got angry and "destroy" the movie. (END OF SPOILERS)But, in any case, aside from any pedantic deep reading, if you take this movie just for what it is, then it's just a silly comedy, and funny as hell. It has excellent moments, jokes, and some scary jumpy stuff from time to time. Just don't expect a normal "slasher flick", but a "very dark comedy" and you'll enjoy it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason this film got such high ratings is because of its satirical "message". Yes, it is primarily satire, falsely advertised as horror, and IMDb is too corrupt to slap on the genre "comedy" as the second or third genre of this movie. Because of dishonest marketing, a lot of people (such as myself) who see this film expecting some awesome immersive plot will be left with a movie with not much to offer except its "witty message" about our society. The movie is very snobbish and arrogant, prioritizing its wise/witty/clever message about society over its actual entertainment value! Therefore you will love this film if you are a film critic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so meta. For that alone I completely loved it. I love Joss Whedon's work. I love that he uses the same people over and over. It was great seeing Topher Brink, and Dr. Saunders again!While the trailer did show off a bit to much for my liking (see Dungeons and Dragons where the only good parts of the film were in the trailer), you figure out from the first scene that it is not your run-of-the-mill horror film, so I won't hold that against it.The main characters do great jobs of establishing which stereotypes they are meant to represent. The behind-the-scenes people are also a good laugh.The film is full of clichés, but that is why it works. It is not trying to be a serious horror film. BUT the premise, and the whole reason for the film are good enough. It isn't some thinly veiled excuse for a gore- fest. It was semi plausible.I highly recommend this film to anyone. I will claim it as a must see for any fans of Joss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharp, Hilarious Deconstruction of Horror Clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose 2012 is just the year when Joss Whedon (SERENITY) was due to breakout as a major force in Hollywood. Not one, but two awesome movies in the same summer. One is an epic level comic book superhero team. The other is a teasingly loving satire of the modern horror/slasher movie genre. Whedon didn't direct THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, but he did produce and co-write with director Drew Goddard, frequent Whedon collaborator and writer of the (in my opinion) under-appreciated CLOVERFIELD. Let's face it: a lot of the horror movies of the past 20 years or so have utilized the same ignorant clichés. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But there are elements that we find in just about all of them. My favorite "horror" movies are the ones that poke holes in the conventions we've come to expect from the genre, even if they're more funny than scary. In 2010 we had TUCKER &amp; DALE VS EVIL, now we have THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. Both are awesome, and Whedon/Goddard's movie is easily one of my favorites for 2012. The plot of the movie is one we've seen dozens and dozens of times, it's how the filmmakers turned it on its head that's great. The premise: five college age students pack themselves into an RV and head into the wilderness for some fun. They've gained access to a remote cabin in the woods where they're hoping to engage in a little drunken debauchery. As anyone who's familiar with horror films knows, this means certain doom but what these kids don't know is that there is someone behind the scenes pulling the strings and nothing is as it seems.This is one of those movies where the less said, the better. You want to go into this movie knowing as little as possible, so do your best to avoid spoilers before checking it out. The fun of the movie is the ridiculous premise and how Whedon and Goddard have a blast with it. I hadn't even watched a trailer for this movie before I finally saw it. I'd heard through enough reviews that it was a "must-see" and watched it with a clean slate. I will go so far as to assure that this movie delivers on both laughs and?well, not really scares. Unless you're just terrified of gore, of which this movie has more than enough. It goes to KILL BILL levels of splatter at times. All done in good fun, of course. I'm hesitant to even call THE CABIN IN THE WOODS a horror movie. It's got some tense moments but there's nothing really scary going on here. Everything that should be considered "horror" is so familiar that I'm totally desensitized to it all. Mutilated pain-worshipping zombie rednecks? Meh, seen it. Decapitations, stabbings, disembowelment?nothing I haven't seen before. But the comedy here, freaking hilarious. The writing, the casting, and even some of the practical effects used in the movie combine into one of the funniest movies of the year.There both familiar and unfamiliar faces here. Probably the most recognizable at this point is Chris Hemsworth even though this movie was shot before THOR and SNOW WHITE &amp; THE HUNTSMAN. Hemsworth is great filling out the role of the alpha male athlete of the students with, of course, some differences from the usual abusive jock. The rest of the kids are great: Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, and Jesse Williams. The best part of the movie, and I knew it from the moment he was introduced driving onto the scene with a giant bong that collapses into a coffee mug, is Fran Kranz as stoner Marty. He became my favorite character the moment he came on screen. Stoic, intelligent, and stoned out of his mind?he's the funniest of the group. Still, a lot of the funniest moments don't even happen in the titular cabin. The show stealers in this film are Richard Jenkins (BURN AFTER READING, THE RUM DIARY) and Bradley Whitford (who, despite being incredibly familiar, has starred in a bunch of stuff I've never seen). Jenkins and Whitford are a couple of technicians sitting at a console in a bunker at an undisclosed location with the fate of the world in their hands. And they're having a great time. I probably could've watched an entire movie based solely on these two men doing their jobs in this mysterious organization. All of these elements come together as one of the funniest movies I've seen this year and a sharp joke at the expense of the horror movies flooding theaters and home video.So I can't recommend this movie highly enough and, whatever you do, don't touch the conch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>13 ghosts revived</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fun Horror movie. It's not a comedy, as some would have you think. It has some black humor, but doesn't go overboard like "Evil Dead" it has more of an unintended comedy vibe. The funny thing is to see accomplished blockbuster names like Chris Hemsworth in a horror flick after he has starred in Big Budget movies. It's usually the other way around. It's still charming to him play the same Thor character just with short hair. That's the comedy of the film.Others would say the whole "Big Brother" live audience vibe also feels clichéd. I hate that word just as much as "Torture Porn" Horror movies have rules about the roles each youngster should play and this film follows them well. Enough said.I did want to compare this one to 13 Ghosts, not because it was bad, but because we get cameos from every Horror icon from the past 30 years and even some new ones. Not the actual faces, but very close. The way they are presented really had me hoping Mathew Lillard would reprise his 13 Ghosts role. Those who see the movie will understand my comment. I mean , how in Hades did anyone manage to cage them up like that? I would have enjoyed this film even more if the "Black Zodiac" persona's were integrated into the story line.To break it down. First half of movie is a cool Zombie/slasher flick set in a cabin, second half invites the Action element and payback is a bitch into full gear. The enjoyment factor is high. I recommend it if you like a little variety into your horror movies and are able to keep the comedy effect to a low. Much more enjoyable if you keep your head straight and see it a a Action/Horror with unintended humor.Again I say that "Black Zodiac" should have been in this movie. Would have been a nice mix with the whole ending scenario. The ending was the weakest link for me. I think Mrs. Weaver was miscast. She can do a great villain(Wicked witch in a snow white) remake, but not on this film. I think the Wicked Witch actually makes a cameo appearance in there as well.There is a lot of CGI , but it's most definitely needed in a film like this and really only introdiced in the second Action/Horror half. The kills are gruesome enough, but CGI, so be warned if you dislikes these effects. I'm not crazy about it myself, but I saw no other way of making the chaotic action scenes come to life.The acting was good. Chris Hemsworth is very entertaining reprising his Thor role as a teenager. He goes a bit over the top, but I expect this from an already accomplished actor. The "stoner" character Fran Krantz, is hilarious. He is stoned throughout the film yet completely aware something in that cabin isn't right? I didn't care too much for the female characters. The "Slutty" role wasn't hot enough and her encounter with a wolf head comes out as more disturbing then sexy. The other female lead; Kristen Connely was a bit chaotic. Not really good nor bad. Her character isn't even really a virgin and it seemed like she phoned in her performance. The "Brain child", That's the title he is given in the movie seems like just another pretty boy filler. Think Peter Barton in Friday the 13th. He is just there for body count purpose and aside from one act of chivarly doesn't get too developed at all, before he finally "bites" it. Final grade. I gave it an eight. It stays loyal to Horror movie rules and adds a bit of action fun into the mix. I would have loved to see more Big names in Body count roles like in Scream movies. That's always fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Every turn this film could have taken Joss Whedon decided not to write and I love that he took risks that paid off to a film that had me shocked at most of what was happening" Usually horror movies nowadays have the same stories that nobody cares about when most of the effort goes into the gore which most of time is not well done and too campy. With this particular horror film it takes the risks of unexpected turns that be shocked by what was happening. Five friends including Dana (Kristen Connolly), Jules (Anna Hutchison), Curt (Chris Hemsworth), Holden (Jesse Williams) and Marty (Fran Kranz) go off to a cabin in the woods expected a fun weekend which turns into a tale of how the five survive when right from underneath them they are being attacked by many nightmares being held up in some sort of strange historical cult.Horror movies have never been a favourite of mine because most of stick to the same plot lines of a hot couple who get killed which no one really cares for. This certain film starts off as a usual horror film but about three quarters into the film it takes a surprising turn when only two of the mains remain finding out about why they were at the cabin to save the world in some strange way. The way the characters even in horrible situations can joke has become a standard technique for Whedon and especially at the end when the world is said to end the two remaining characters carry on a conversation as if everything is fine only minutes later does the world end.The performances are very normal style horror ones because all we mostly see them do is either be covered in blood or screaming their heads off after seeing someone murdered in front of them. This film does not fail at showing use horror because the actors almost have red skin the amount of blood that is in the film. The body count on this film is a lot especially near the end when every character on screen is killed by some sort of strange nightmare. The bright spot in acting for me was the interactions between Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford who are the men running this horror show. They are funny but also tense especially when being killed at the end.The film is very enjoyable but with so many creatures appearing near the end of the film I just got tired of seeing so much blood especially since some of the dialogue was enjoyable to me because the characters were able to find the silly in what was happening to them. Shocking and Thrilling Cabin in the Woods is like no other horror film I will ever watch again I believe in my life.MOVIE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Richard Jenkins)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever watched a horror movie, you've seen characters headed for their doom after making an obvious mistake and asked yourself, 'how could they be so stupid?' What if your job depended on that very stupidity? Better yet, what if the world as we knew it depended on that stupidity? Five college students, Dana (played by Kristen Connolly), Curt (played by Thor himself Chris Hemsworth), Jules (played by Anna Hutchison), Marty (played by Fran Kranz) and Holden (played by Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams) are all packed and ready for some much needed rest and relaxation in a remote cabin in the woods (I know, the title was no help in predicting that). Separately, two men in a corporate facility whose nature is not fully explained are gearing up for a series of operations taking place worldwide and one happening domestically that determines the future of their employment. While en route to their secluded cabin, our college students stop for gas and are more than moderately spooked by the station attendant who tells them that tragedies have befallen more than one of the previous owners. Still they press on and the attendant, Mordecai (played by Tim de Zarn) relays that to the two men in the corporate facility (played by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) while they laugh at the man's ghoulish demeanor which he maintains long after the collegians depart.There's a good deal more to this story, but to reveal any more would give away too much. What I can tell you is that I enjoyed this movie immensely. The relatively unknown cast members serve their purpose and the more accomplished professionals, namely Whitford, Jenkins, and a largely unseen Sigourney Weaver add an entirely different dimension to a film that might otherwise be cookie-cutter from its inception. If you enjoy horror or enjoy a good parody, you will enjoy The Cabin the Woods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings, still give it a decent 7 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be redundant, but as my summary statement says, I had mixed feelings on this movie. I feel like this film was comprised of parts from different types of scary movies, none of them really blending quite right together into one movie. It was very disjointed, which made the movie hard to really get into. It had its moments though, and the comedy aspect turned out pretty well, it wasn't too over the top as some movies can easily be. This movie contains every cliché in the book, but somehow it's charming. I def wouldn't give it 10 stars, but I wouldn't give it 2 stars either. I loved the role of the 'pot head', he was great! Overall- A decent RedBox rental, especially considering some of the other crap you can get from a RedBox right now.</fullReview>

The movie starts out with the slasher movie story line of five friends going to a cabin in the woods bad things happen, then it goes in a turn the slasher genre never took. The five main characters had great development because new a few things we get to know them. For gore fans it is not as gory like the Saw franchise but it very bloody. For people who enjoy horror, slasher, comedy or sci-fi will like this movie. I give a 10 out of 10 because it was something new and different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Fran Kranz, Anna Hutchinson, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford and Amy Acker star in this 2012 horror film. This film tells of 5 teens, Dana (Connolly), Curt (Hemsworth), Marty (Kranz), Jules (Hutchinson) and Holden (Williams) heading to a cabin in the woods for the weekend and become attacked by zombies and creatures. That's not all, they soon discover they're part of a sacrificial test ran by technicians, Sitterson (Jenkins), Hadley (Whitford) and Lin (Acker) preparing for the end of the world. This is a pretty good horror flick that pays homage to popular horror flicks like, "The Evil Dead" and "Night of the Living Dead." There's great make-up effects and Sigourney Weaver also appears. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this flick is anything it's unpredictable and that's a good thing cause originality these days in ole Hollyweird is extremely rare! I had no idea whatsoever that the events that i was about to see were gonna take place. I love horror films and have seen quite a few strictly for the gore factor (Yes I'm sorta crazy that way i guess?) have seen some that have actually scared the bejesus out of me (Paranormal Activity is one of them) and last but not least hardly any that shocked me, unpredictability wise as this one had. 5 college buds head up to one of their cousin's cabin in the woods. Sure...I know same ol same ol eh? Low and behold we then see a group of what look to be scientists in a lab who seem to be controlling what comes up against the 5 pals whilst up there. They also seem to be laying down bets on the 5 on who will be the first to meet their demise and how they will fall.Eventually the tables get turned on them however, with thrilling CGI results. I suggest this film for any horror fan who thinks they have seen it all, cause quite frankly they have not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plot So Thick It'll Stick To Your Brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin In The Woods is crazily deep and provocative without sacrificing the campiness that we adore in modern horror movies. At first I thought (and as much was evident in a preview) that there were just two guys getting their rocks off by tormenting some kids. I, in fact, hated the idea. I thought it made things terribly realistic, almost too realistic to be horror. But on top of this were piled endless dimensions of frightening and far-out ideas. The best thing about the movie is that the plot has so many chances to completely screw itself over. To slip up and become immediately a "Good idea, but crappily executed picture." But it doesn't. Despite all the crazy and at some points zany outrageousness, this film still flies true and shocks to the core. You thought it could never happen. But this film is outrageous, without being stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was different....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I want to first state that so called "horror movies" over the last 10 years have been consistently awful. I never find myself scared. I saw The Woman In Black in theaters when it came out, and literally me and my friend were just making jokes during the whole movie about it. I didn't jump once during that movie despite the loud BANG noises that would pop up. Now this movie I did not see in theaters, I rented it, and saw it with that same friend I saw WiB with.Did I expect this movie to be scary? Well, no, but that's because no movie is scary anymore, not even the highly touted Paranormal Activity movies that people seem to be scared of. This movie just seemed like it would be an easy to grade movie. I thought just by the sound of the movie, it would be worth a 2 out of 10.I mean, think about it. Five friends alone in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. The jock, the burnout, the home wrecker, the scholar, and the closest thing to a virgin. TYPICAL, right?WRONG. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!This movie ended up being quite interesting due to the plot. We later find out in the movie that it is all a set-up. Also, the five friends basically have the power to decide what creature comes and kills them off one by one. Interesting, right?In the first hour of this movie, it looks to be a totally typical horror film. I mean really typical. Everyone seems to be dying quickly. However, two of them happen to live, and they discover the headquarters for the people rigging the game. Chaos seems to break loose throughout and the riggers get a little taste of their own medicine, and to make a long story short, everyone ends up dying. Like, everyone...on the planet.The acting was all right, nothing to hate or love if you ask me. And I found a few parts in this movie to be quite funny.Do I HONESTLY believe this is a 10???? No I do not. I simply wanted to bring the rating up from a 7.3 because I think it deserves a 7.5 or 7.6. Overall, much better than the typical horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is pretty good. It's better than the average horror movie because, as one reviewer hit it on the head, the makers of the movie decided to be unique and give the audience something they hadn't seen before. We have some douchey college kids who are heading off to a cabin in the woods. We're expecting status quo (kids getting brutalized out in the cabin) but we keep asking ourselves, "who are these strange older men in control rooms that keep coming into the movie?" But we ignore them and go back to expecting the obvious. But we couldn't be more wrong--&gt; It turns out this entire "cabin in the woods" trip is an intentional sacrifice to the Gods, where certain people have to die in a certain order. It's pretty cool, we get to see gore, some horror, some cool twists, a bunch of creepy/weird creatures, and the end of the world? I enjoyed it and I recommend it to those who enjoy horror movies and want a new twist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this in the theater when I thought it was just another kids in the woods horror movie and although that would have been predictable something about the trailer got me interested. However I never did make it out to catch this one and ended up seeing it on DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. In my opinion it's not going to be a classic, but it was an interesting spin on the typical slasher movie. It's worth the rental in my opinion. Not much true character development, however there were a few characters I would have like to see make it to the end instead of the ones that did. It's not a very scary horror movie as they cut to other scenes just as the horror builds which diffuses the building tension, but it's definitely unique and fresh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very entertaining old hokum which is more than a touch better than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For once I'll keep this short. It's always very difficult to find a new angle to an old genre, but The Cabin In The Woods, pulls it off. OK, so at the end of the day it is lightweight, utterly illogical, full of plot holes and more than just old hokum - it is 24-carat old hokum - but what's wrong with that? You might ask why a highly sophisticated, modern organisation using the last state-of-the-art technology with, apparently, unlimited resources at its disposal would have provide such straightforward means to ensure its own destruction and that of the world. But if such things are important to you - and, of course, they are in another kind of film - The Cabin In The Woords isn't for you and you'd be advised to try something a great deal worthier. There's absolutely nothing deep about this film, and it does trade in clichés, but that is exactly the - very amusing - point. If you like being entertained and intrigued, this is a film for you. That it succeeds using material which in other hands would result in a run-of-the-mill gore-fest garbage is testament to the skill and wit of its writers and director. It attempts a high-wire act and wins hands down. I won't say more than that. I do, and I enjoyed it a great deal, even though I don't like slasher movies, find that a great deal of sci-fi falls flat at the end of the day and haven't seen an original horror film for quite a few years. I'll say it again: if you like being entertained and intrigued, this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A twisting, pretentious, house.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods, starring Chris Hemsworth, seems like an intellectually frightening movie at first. In the preview you could see walls spinning, technological glam. I was aware of the fact that this was more of a "teen" targeted movie but it still seemed worthy.I have to say after watching this I enjoyed it. The acting is decent, but the story is better. The story carries on the ideas I got from the preview which are satisfying. Yet there are a couple of real "monsters" that haunt the film in the following minutes.Meet the "beast of pretentiousness". Maybe the directors/producers love B-Movies or maybe it was just a project gone wrong. Towards the end Cabin starts to get messy. Even that I can handle but when you mix that with cheesy CGI it really makes Cabin unrealistic. There are lots of great special effects but than they throw in one or two unnecessary computer animated monsters. It's just a waste.In addition a famous celebrity shows up who does not fit the part. She was literally put in the movie because of who she is not because she made the movie better. She plays nicer characters, better.Also there was nudity which is a waste in my opinion, this always ruins horror movies, boobs don't make something scary. Really I should dock it three stars for all of this, but because some people might like the b- movie aura I will give it eight. It was still fun to make fun of, and it had a great story.Overall enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't care for horror films and I can understand why folks don't like this film but those who feel it deserves a "one" are overly emotional with their reviews. Everyone has their biases but giving this film a "one" suggests not only a strong bias but an agenda, as well. Reviewers who give this film a "one" have shown an inability to apply any objectivity in reviewing this work and should be ignored, entirely. Perhaps the same should be said for those giving it a ten. It's a fun new twist on horror films and the brunette is very cute but it's really not THAT good. IMDb scores of "seven" or more are almost always worth a watch and that's why I rate this film a "seven".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare and unpredictable horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨They have to choose what happens in the cellar. Yeah, we write the game as much as we have to but in the end, if they don't transgress they can't be punished. ¨ I'm not big on horror films since I generally consider them to be very predictable and cliché. I can't remember what the last horror slasher movie I enjoyed was since the few I do enjoy have to do more with psychological scares. All these movies are the same, but to my surprise it wasn't the case with Cabin in the Woods. I had no idea what direction this movie was moving towards and despite not being a fan of the genre I was able to appreciate Cabin in the Woods thanks to the unpredictability of it and some interesting performances. The less you know about this film before watching it the better. Like the tagline of the movie suggests, this film works as sort of a satire of all the slasher films we've grown up with. ¨If something is chasing you?split up, ¨ is one of the taglines that is so cliché about these movies and it's addressed in this film as well. There are several elements that are sort of dissected in this movie and analyzed through satire and that's what I enjoyed the most about Cabin in the Woods. I didn't care for the scares (which aren't here) or the gore, what I really liked was that this film was making fun of the genre while at the same time paying homage to it so that fanboys would also enjoy it. It works almost in the same way that Scream did in the late 90's by making fun of the stereotypes of the genre. This film has an ending every fanboy will enjoy. It was a little too much for me since I'm not a big fan of the genre, but I still have to admit I was really surprised by this film. It is definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in a very long time.Despite the fact that the trailers give away a lot of the movie I will only give away the basic part. You have the five typical teenagers you see in most horror films decide to go spend a weekend at an old and mysterious cabin in the woods: the jock, Curt (Chris Hemsworth), the slut, Jules (Anna Hutchison), the stoner, Marty (Fran Kranz), the nerd, Holden (Jesse Williams), and the virgin, Dana (Kristen Connolly). The five play characters we are all familiar with in this genre. On their way to the woods they even run into an old gas station with a weird owner named Mordecai (Tim de Zarn) who really only lacks a sign in front of his forehead saying ¨Do not go into the woods if you want to live.¨ Once the teens arrive at the beautiful place they begin to party as they usually do, but later strange things begin to happen and they realize that they might not be alone in that place. You probably have seen this scenario a million times before in these films, but it takes a totally different turn and if you're a fan of the genre you will be in for a treat. Character actors Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford also give some strong secondary performances as they usually do.Cabin in the Woods combines a lot of gore with laughs. I can't say scares because there is hardly any. I like the way the film poked fun of its usual stereotypes and played with them while at the same time paying homage to several classic horror films. This was Drew Goddard's first film as a director and he really delivers. He had the credentials necessary considering he wrote and produced several Buffy, Angel, and Lost episodes as well as Cloverfield. He also co-wrote this brilliant and bizarre script with Joss Whedon, one of the best screenwriters in Hollywood (The Avengers, Toy Story, and Serenity). The script is smart although I must say that it was bizarre as well, but in a good way. Fans will have a terrific time with this movie, and those of us who criticize most slasher films for their predictability will be surprised by the twists taken here. It is a very original film which isn't afraid of taking risks or making fun of itself. The highlight of the film for me was Fran Kranz's performance. Most of the characters in this movie were really likable, as opposed to most horror films where they are hateful and forgettable. Cabin in the Woods is a very interesting and unique film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will just start by saying this... you need to go in with an open mind. After watching this movie I felt like it had many traditional horror movie sequences. However, the over all plot is what makes this movie so different. Doing so draws a line for most viewers and reviews which I am sure you will notice. And that line is either you love it or you hate it. I was one who loved it due to the fact that I enjoy traditional horror flicks which this movie contained a lot of. It also offered something fresh and new that no other horror flick has done. To say what that is would be a spoiler so I will not say anything further. But I will leave you with this... I could not help but be reminded of "13 Ghosts" when watching this film. Throw that in a cabin with your stereotypical Jock, Nerd, Slut, Bookworm, and Conspiracy Theorist and you've got an interesting horror flick.</fullReview>

It's a film that cuts down on the violence and adds touches of humor. The film acts as a spoof to the horror genre much like Scream does, but at a more extreme level.The Cabin in the Woods is a dream come true for any horror fan, but especially to those who enjoy horror films from the 80s.It's incredibly original and highly intelligent especially for a horror film.

		<shortDescription>A typically clever Whedon twist on a very tired genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big fan of Joss' work, took me a long time to get around to watching this but I'm glad I did. Very interesting film taking the great clichés of the horror genre and turning them around in a typically clever Joss Whedon fashion. We now understand why all theses nasty things keep happening to people in horror films (and why the Whore always gets it first and the Virgin sometimes survives), they're all set up in order to appease the ancient hellgods. One thing that did strike me is that the group very much remind me of the characters from Scooby-Doo, the Athlete (Fred/Curt), the Whore (Daphne/Jules), the hungry Fool (Marty/Shaggy), the Scholar (Velma/Holden) and the Virgin (Velma again). And just like Scooby-Doo they drive a camper van, encounter a creepy old man with dire warnings and it's all a set up with someone manipulating everything from behind the scenes. If only they'd brought their Great Dane with them everything would have been OK. Standout scenes, well Sigourney as good as ever. The Cabin itself is a dead ringer for that in Evil Dead 2. The array of objects in the cellar is very clever, did everyone notice Drusilla's doll Miss Edith from Buffy? Jules making out with the wolf's head is masterful, you keep expecting it to come to life and bite her but Joss defies our expectations. Love the 9 year old Japanese schoolgirls defeating the evil spirits, they're so sweet, what chance do mere hellgods have against them? It's a film that stands rewatching as you understand a lot more next time around, why does Jules, a pre-med student suddenly dye her hair blonde and start acting like a bimbo? Why does Curt, an intelligent guy suddenly start acting like some dumb jock stereotype? The merman gag is both funny AND disgusting, I'm sure Marty's flask is bound to become a collector's item. Your heart bleeds for Patience Buckner and you're a little concerned for the actress playing her when she gets knocked flying by Curt running back into the cabin, I hope that was perspective gag? So who's right? That's a tough one, we understand why the organisation seek to appease the hellgods, sacrificing the few to protect the millions but at the same time we feel for the sacrifices. But now the sacrifices have triumphed over the evil all over the world. Perhaps humanity no longer has to make sacrifices to placate the gods, perhaps the six billion of us armed with nukes have advanced to the degree that we can wipe them out without really working up a sweat? In the camper van Marty says that society needs to crumble and then begin anew and that's what happens at the end, his remark of letting someone else survive at the end is prescient, he's plunged mankind into a war but saved any future sacrifices. I'd love to see a sequel, Joss always wanted to make a post-apocalyptic series and this could be his chance. Ronald the Intern helps Marty and Dana into the Directors escape pod and they all survive to see the Hellgods blasted by a massive military attack. Cut to a year later with a much changed world which now believes in the reality of the supernatural. Ronald is in front of a congressional inquiry explaining the organisation's actions Ollie North style, werewolf Dana is now head of the supernatural faction which wants to make peace with humanity whilst the now zombie Director heads the evil faction which wishes to destroy us. But whatever happened to Marty? And why is everyone so desperate to find The Fool?Great movie with a great potential for more stories.</fullReview>

It then gets lame, and, consequently, boring.The direction is substandard; the juxtaposition of the two "realities" is handled in a clumsy fashion.If this screenplay had been "Scream 2" it would have been genius; a bit of fun that continued on from the first. Instead, a fair bit of someone else's money was wasted on 20% of a good idea. "The Truman Show" is nearly 20 years old and puts this movie to shame. It shouldn't be this way.5/10. Unless you have missed out on a couple of decades worth of movies, this one is pretty ordinary. 7/10. If you are younger than 30.</fullReview>

I'm sure we've all just about given up on horror movies these days, but "The Cabin in the Woods" is the proof we need to shake us out of our delusion."The Cabin in the Woods" is a delightful send-up of "dead teenager" movies, using the Cabin in the Woods set-up that's so popular in movies like "The Evil Dead" (1982), Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" (2002), and even "I Spit on Your Grave" (1978); I'm actually quite certain there's more - OK, a lot more - but it's 11:00 at night and I can't quite think of horror movie names right now. It also throws in heavy elements of zombie movies and slasher movies for good measure. (Who said original horror movies are a lost art these days?)The story follows five college students (Kristen Connolly as Cute Virgin Girl Dana, Chris Hemsworth as College Football Jock Curt, Fran Franz as Bleary-eyed Stoner/Paranoid Conspiracy Theorist Marty, Jesse Williams as Stalwart Nice Guy/Scholar Holden, and Anne Hutchison as the Slutty Dumb Blonde Jules) as they take a break at a remote Cabin in the Woods; note that they're all blatant horror movie stereotypes being lined up for an imminent slaughter. A night of bloodshed and terror ensues. In a parallel - yet brilliantly, brazenly inter-connected and constructed, and also equally important - plot-line featuring faceless bureaucrats, things quickly become a witty essay on Hollywood horror movie narratives. To divulge any further details, destroys the surprises in store for you.It's amazing the way that "The Cabin in the Woods" cuts between its two parallel story lines; witnessing this in action, I savored expert classical craftsmanship on the part of both Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon and their equally talented young cast members and film crew. Both are alive &amp; kicking, and one directly influences the actions of the other (this aspect of the picture is later flipped on its head late in the film). And did I mention that this is pretty funny, in addition to being occasionally gripping and scary?"The Cabin in the Woods" is genuinely scary in an old-school fright-fest way. It's also funny in a uniquely self-aware, post-"Scream" fashion that doesn't threaten to drift into full-blown camp territory. Even though it still exists in the post-"Scream" void of self-knowing horror movies, the movie actually reminds me a lot more heavily of Sam Raimi's "Drag Me to Hell" (2009), which also went straight for scares/jump scenes with a sly sense of humor under-cutting the action. And "The Cabin in the Woods" does have some impressive scenes of gory violence featuring - what else? - dead teenagers."The Cabin in the Woods" is a unique breath of fresh air for a genre that definitely needed a huge breath of fresh air.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, so I watched this movie thinking I was going to be watching a cheesy, poorly acted, boring, shoddy B horror. So completely wrong. It's original, intriguing and aside from a few obvious foreshadowing techniques I loved it and wish there was more like it. But I guess the point is to be different, and different it was.I'm generally a hard-ass when it comes to horror films, the fact is this isn't a horror film, it's more like a thriller / comedy / satire.Sometimes you can see where it's going but it doesn't matter because it's about the small details that come next. I'm not putting any spoilers into it because I really think this is something a lot of people should watch and IF you're a big horror fan... video games, movies, etc... you will love it. There are SO MANY references that your brain just shifts into overdrive and you end up excited about whats in the movie, not the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning parts leading up to where the bloodshed begins are absolutely hilarious, funnier than any other comedy I've seen. And I've seen a lot! But once it gets started, you have no chance as this movie DEMANDS your attention and you will give it. The characters are actually likable which is amazing for horror movies because most of the time you hate the characters and actually want them to die but not here. I mean, its still a horror movie so you still want to see somebody die but you actually feel connected to them, or at least I did. No spoiling it but a scene close to the ending is probably ever horror fans' wet dream! (you know what scene I'm talking about)Overall, this was one AMAZING movie and will remain my favorite movie for years to come!!!P.S. Look out for unicorns (haha, spoiler alert)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is fantastic; it's a film where you're picking up little clues along the way trying to figure out what's really going on. The performances overall are really good; the five victims all perform really well, the only one who was a bit pointless was that of Jesse Williams who plays the intellectual one. He didn't have much screen time and was a bit flat. Kristen Connolly, Fran Kranz and Chris Hemsworth were all great here. The best performances were from Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford; they provided a lot of comedy here and were a great choice for their roles. The script is outstanding; Joss Whedon has written a fantastic script that was both funny and really scary. As the film goes on you get a greater understanding of what is going on. Films where you're constantly trying to figure something out or what the film as a whole will mean are great and this is the perfect example of that type of film. Overall, this film really made me laugh but also gave me some nightmares. This has the right mix of comedy and horror which is usually really difficult to make a successful film out of. 'The Cabin in the Woods' is definitely going to be a classic among horror fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your average horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a nutshell, it is a story about a cabin in the woods and it is not a horror movie. Though I expected something similar to happen, it just took it to another level by the end. It is a tongue in cheek response to the horror genre.A part of the storyline is already understood by the title. The other part I cannot say without revealing the big secret and I am going to leave it at that.When I knew Joss Whedon was behind the movie, I had to watch it. There are satisfying amounts of blood, gore, graphic violence, nudity and sexiness but not enough horror and it is intentional. With its entertaining slapstick comedy on both cabin and the other parallel track and a crisp screenplay and runtime ensures there is plenty of entertainment to be had throughout. Features top special effects towards the end and the way the main plot twist is revealed in small parts from the beginning and how all the pieces fall together towards the end is intelligent but not mind blowing. It was also surprisingly acted well too.Not your average horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original? yes...somewhat entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw what this was from the previews, and yes, I still watched it. I gave it a 6, I think simply because it wasn't low budget boredom. This one is mindless entertainment, nothing more.The Cabin in the Woods is basically a way for a Horror movie fan to combine his undying love for the genre into one senseless movie and to frolic in the abyss of murderous zombies, bad jokes, and all the basic laundry list of all things slasher film. What makes this one original is there is nothing reality based in it, and just a fun original way to meld different elements of all sectors of the horror genre.If you want to see a good Horror movie, one that scares you, one that makes you think, then this is not for you. Most good "scary" movies contain things that scare people because there is a primal element that relates to reality, and the viewer is afraid because when they go to bed at night, the slasher COULD be looking in the window, under the bed, or in a closet. None of that in this one, well unless you are a conspiracy theorist that believes the government has rigged your house (or in this case a Cabin) to unleash evil slashers and zombies in order to please an ancient god.It is a fun movie. Admittedly, I enjoyed some of the aspects of it, but in it's totality as a movie... I am amazed a studio gave it a green light.How sad have we gotten as viewers when a good scary movie used to be things like The Exorcist, Halloween, and The Shining, only to evolve into giving rave reviews to this crap. Oh well, I guess the bar has fallen and given us movies like this that aren't scary at all and even at times attempt to be funny. It rather makes you want to escape....to a Cabin in the Woods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic twist to the horror genre, a bucket load of fun!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard very mixed opinions about Cabin In The Woods but fans like me always bank on Joss Whedon. He may not have directed the film but he clearly had a very heavy hand in the film because it reeks of Whedon and it rocks!! Cabin In The Woods takes the stereo typical often tired old horror genre and kicks it straight in the jewels. You could watch this film a hundred times and see something else...an homage to any number of horror films or little hidden easter eggs in the background of multiple scenes. You can easily find a little bit of every major horror film of the last twenty or more years in this movie. But it doesn't just spoof them and toss them aside, it weaves an intricate well told almost sci-fi story with solid performances, tongue in cheek humour, and a well made very old school ending and an INCREDIBLE evil villain cameo that made me cheer out loud (yes I'm that lame.) Is it a perfect movie? No. It did cram an awful lot into one movie and the old school ending may definitely come across as hokey to some but the movie is simply fun and thrilling and extremely entertaining.When I first saw Chris Hemsworth in Thor I immediately thought he was a one note actor who would never really go beyond Thor/Avengers but I admit right now I was wrong. I've seen him now in this and Snow White and The Huntsman and it turns out he was great in both. In this film he plays the jock type teen (who isn't even close to being a teen) and he plays the role well. He spoofs the characters but still makes it serious enough. Kristen Connolly is our scream queen, the "virginal" pure girl who always survives. She plays the role perfectly. She is sweet and nice but toughens up when it comes down to it. Anna Hutchison is the "hot blonde" of the group. She doesn't last long against the killers but then she isn't supposed to either. She serves her purpose though and her and Hemsworth have good chemistry. Fran Kranz (a Whedon-ite formerly of Dollhouse) plays stoner Marty. He was probably my favourite character because he was clearly smarter than the average horror flick stoner and surprises you in the end. He has great on screen charisma too. Jesse Williams (who I enjoy a lot on Grey's Anatomy is just okay in the nice guy role. He has good chemistry with Connolly but he is very underused and background fodder when it comes down to it. And finally I very much enjoyed the performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. Their dialogue with each other is perfect and keeps the pace going and they have some of the best, funniest and most clever lines in the film. Of course you also have the big bad cameo at the end but I won't mention who that is...except I was thrilled.This was director Drew Goddard's directorial debut and I don't mean to downplay the job he did but its very clear that Joss Whedon guided him a great deal. I don't know why he just didn't direct it himself. Either way it was very well directed and written by Goddard and Whedon together. Part of the film felt like an old school slasher flick like Friday the 13th but back when the series was in its stride, when it was truly excellent. Then you have a sci-fi feel to some of it, similar to that of the Resident Evil franchise, but you also have an original unique story that is done in its own way. Do yourself a favour horror fans and check this one out now!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOVED this movie ! What a breath of fresh air for movie fans! Saw this earlier this year when it first came out so I wouldn't be jaded by the opinions of others. So glad I did that! Finally,something that wasn't part 24 or a prequel , but a fresh New concept ! At times I was laughing hysterically only for a scene to reminded me it was a horror movie ! Quite a balancing act that is to invoke both humor &amp; horror in the same movie without you laughing At the movie instead of with it. Haven't had that type of fun since Drag Me to Hell ! Yeah the characters were the stereotypical types found in horror, but someone has to be killed ! Thought it was going to be the "typical " kids go in woods, killer hunts them down &amp; kills them off one by one, Boy was I wrong!, that was only part of the story. Loved how they had the parallel story going on in the control room as they watched how their "guinea pigs" performed ,sacrificing them in hopes of saving the world ! And once again the Japanese had the cultural and spiritual beliefs &amp; knowledge to come out on top ! ( Original , The Ring &amp; The Grudge !) Great variety of monsters, ghouls and things, each level down (or sideways) more horrifying than the next! The stuff nightmares are truly made of ! All in all it was a Great roller-coaster ride of emotions that had me questioning if it even did fit neatly in a genre box! It doesn't , but to Hollywood I say find some more Original stories ( not a rehash of this or even remotely similar ) and lots of us will be there for opening weekend ! Great fun , not too scary or gory ( Hostel ? ) Like I said our appetites are wet Hollywood ,So , More Please !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film but overrated...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard have done here have had nothing on their other productions eg. Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Alien etc.. The film doesn't live upto it's 7.4 rating. The storyline behind the bloody Horror has the typical teenage set-up behind it, with the usual favourites for the characters: the Jock, Blonde, Nerd, Virgin and of course the one that often doesn't care (in this film it's a druggy). When teenagers are often associated the following are often featured too: drugs, alcohol &amp; sex. Of course there has to be a scary set-up (in this case an old cabin in the middle of the woods) as well or it wouldn't be horror. The usage of mirrors is a clever thing that also appears in most well-structured horror's and in this film's case this one too. Death, is symbolised around the Cabin in ways through the painting on the wall and when the eagle dies as the group head towards the Cabin. The film for me goes straight into it a bit to quickly, Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard kill the characters off way to early and with the usual suspects-Zombies. It was predictable from the starting scene what was going to happen. I mean why did that eagle hit the invisible field/shield? It made the later scene with the motor bike jump totally predictable. The acting was OK and despite it's 7.4 rating I wouldn't of personally gave it any higher than a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>definitely not my favourite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy this film as much as I have other horror films. I found the plot line very confusing (constant cuts to a laboratory of some sort for reasons not explained till the end). In addition, I found the plot line, especially the beginning very stereotypical and cliché. Also, a lot of the characters are very stereotypical, as they all get killed in what seems to be a specific order. All of this makes the tag-line for the film "you think you know the story" seem very contradictory. I found the comedy elements to the film to not fit very well with the theme of the film, as it has in other horrors. The way the writers have tried to confuse the audience to what the true story is worked a little too well as I didn't understand what the reason for the monster being released and trying to kill everyone. I think the film tried to confuse the audience like The Sixth Sense did, but didn't succeed as well as they may have wanted. Overall I rated this film a 6/10 as I didn't enjoy it that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most creative and unique horror movies that I've ever watched.Just reading the title, I thought this was going to be so cliché just like all the other films in the same genre. But then, this movie had so much story in it than what's said in the title. It was predictable at first, you know, same old story, they die and whatsoever but then, you had those twists working out after. I actually didn't see the following events coming. As for the acting, I thought they were great. I love how the characters instantly know what's really going on and so they had to move. But they don't really know what's the reason behind it and that's the rest of the story.I had a really good time watching this one. It was fun and just like I said, very creative.</fullReview>

After the opening scene, everything was as I expected this movie to be, and I tried to figure out what characters would die first and what things would happen when they get to the cabin. Everything went mostly as expected, other than the whole monitoring part, until the twist, which for me is when Marty is seen alive. The first part was entertaining enough, and the second part very creative and original. I hate jump scares, and there was not so much of that. I was 99% sure Marty would kill the girl at the end, and it kind of bugged me that he didn't. This is still the best horror movie in many years.I was 99% sure Marty would kill the girl at the end, and it kind of bugged me that he didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five college students; three boys and two girls take an RV to a cabin in the woods to get away from it all. You have the jock, the pot head, the scholar, the slut, and the virgin. They get to the cabin and find strange things in a cellar, including a diary written partially in Latin. In the meantime, a group of people in a high tech place are watching TV monitors tracking the five unsuspecting kids. They can control the conditions of the environment, and Oscar nominated Richard Jenkins(for The Visitor) is the head of this mysterious experiment in terror. While in the woods, zombies appear, making the boys and girls stay rather unpleasant. The Night of the Living Dead meets The Running Man as more blood thirsty creatures arrive on the scene. The young victims are standard horror movie fodder, and Jenkins is well above the rest of the cast and the material. Sigourney Weaver also makes a brief cameo, thirty plus years after Alien. Overall, a little better than average.</fullReview>

Even making fun of clichés used in abundance in other horrors. I love this movie. It's quick, it's clever and it's fun (above all). Formerly, Wes Crawen was a man competent for innovations in the genre. And then came Joss Whedon. Judging by what he's done so far (both for the movies and television), he's here to stay and give intellectually a bit more demanding audience "soul food". Great work. Almost perfect.And there really can not be any sequel to this story. Watch and you'll know what I mean.</fullReview>

It's absolutely ridiculous and no tense at all.If you're one of those who find this movie funny...either you're 10 years old or you have brain damage! There's nothing funny - And I enjoy comedy a lot. Good comedy: not "hangover" type though. "Shaun of the dead", for instance...."evil dead" another good one. "Tucker &amp; dale vs evil" or Peter Jackson's "braindead" - this are great! Don't waste your precious time on this one.

		<shortDescription>Evil Dead meets Resident Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat through this, it's exactly what I thought, this is Evil Dead combined with Resident Evil, and that's what made this enjoyable to watch.This is one of those brain-dead horror movies where you feel absolutely nothing for any character while they get sliced and hacked to pieces in various ways by a bunch of redneck zombies, so it never takes itself seriously.5 stereotypes pile into a camper van/RV, and head into the wilderness to stay at a remote log cabin. Before too long they discover that the GPS won't work and they turn up at what appears to be an abandoned petrol station. So cue the Texas Chainsaw Massacre theme right about now, complete with animals preserved in jars and the obligatory none-too-pleasant country rube.Interspersed with the goings on with the young group, there are segments that flash to what appears to be a secret installation/lab that is overseeing the group with hidden cameras. So this is where you get that whole Resident Evil Umbrella Corporation-esque vibe.And as per Evil Dead, things really start to gain momentum on the first night, the group heads down to the cellar after the hatch suddenly "blew" itself open, and they come across a rather odd assortment of items. Each member of the group seems to fall into a trance like effect after randomly handling a different item, however, it's the reading of a seemingly very old diary and the Latin text within that creates all the chaos.From here things take a twist. Back at the lab, you find that the whole chain of events is being controlled through various means and the company has placed bets on which type of creature will be summoned to kill the group, based on their handling of a particular cellar item. So as it turns out the zombie family was just a fluke.As the survivors start to learn that all these events are seemingly orchestrated, (the term "puppeteers" gets used at times), it's revealed that all the sterile, sociopathic behaviour exhibited by the scientists towards their plight is all for the benefit of very ancient, underground dwelling gods, who need human sacrifice for their amusement and due to various TV monitors you find that the same pattern repeats itself all over the world.The bloodbath begins after the survivors discover the hidden lab and the zoo-like array of monsters and demons within and proceed to release them all. Of course these things, amongst them a werewolf, a giant cobra and even a murderous unicorn tend to kill everything they come across.The movie doesn't really break any new ground, and for a while it's a cliché bonanza. Truth or dare games, severed heads being thrown, people getting pulled through windows, ghostly voices etc. The only thing missing is an excessive downpour of rain, but when you think it's just another stock standard stalk and slash zombie flick, it turns out to be something a little different and it keeps you guessing for a while as you try and figure out why it's all happening and how everything fits together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why people are giving this movie one or two stars: it honestly is not that bad!OK, so it isn't going to win any awards, or be lauded in the top 100 movies of all time, but if you enjoy this movie for what it is - a pretty stupid horror-comedy - then you will not be disappointed.I think what most people seem to be having trouble with is the comparison to The Evil Dead (admittedly, a far superior film). The only comparison I really saw was the fact that it take place in a cabin in the woods. And what the smeg do you expect from a film that has the title 'The Cabin in the Woods'?!? OK, it has zombies/demons too, but these are totally different to the ones in Raimi's work. They aren't funny for a start.The biggest problem I had was with the sloppy CGI. Some of it looked dated, and some of it just dumb. But money was spent where it needed to be spent. The monsters/demons is where the good CGI lays. Luckily, the extra money seems to have been paid to the cast who all do a really good job (and a nice bit of eye candy too!)It had some really good atmospheric scenes with good amounts of tension, but when the actual shocks came, it was too little too late.Overall, if you go into this movie expecting big things then of course you will be disappointed. But watch this knowing that it is a tongue-in- cheek poke at the genre and you will have a good time. It's not the best movie ever, but it sure as hell (pun intended) isn't the worst either.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't exactly a horror movie - it's a movie about horror movies. It has horrific elements, but isn't traditionally horrible. It has comedy moments but isn't entirely funny.What it is mostly is a self-examination of the moronic desire for formulaic satisfaction of a certain kind of ur-human cretin - referred to in the film as the "Ancient Ones". You know who they are - they bay at the movie screen when the marines kick that alien ass, they hiss and throw popcorn at the comedy evil genius.If you believe the greatest concept in modern horror-movie production is the screening of badly-shot, poorly edited film purporting to be from a camcorder found next to a dismembered corpse then you should avoid this film.If you are the kind of idiot who was actually disappointed to find that this wasn't really just a film about a bunch of American teen mannequins being horribly murdered in the woods then this isn't your film.If you are a witless imbecile who finds thinking about a film while you're watching it makes your brain hurt then this film isn't for you.This film isn't FOR you: it's ABOUT you.

Things don't go exactly as planned for the characters or the audience.This movie is a wonderful and clever homage to the horror genre and it's clichés. Wonderfully paced, not taking itself too seriously and lots of fun, with a Joss Whedon feel to it (a la Buffy), this seemed to have a mixture of Scooby Doo, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the Evil Dead and Army of Darkness with references to countless other horror movies like Hellraiser, The Ring, The Wolfman and so many more.But it never failed to please. It rolled along at a good speed with cleverness, and managed to poke fun at the audience while creating a somewhat suspenseful, yet comedic, atmosphere leading to a mass of gore and carnage that was just pure entertainment!I enjoyed this one a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another clichéd, conventional backwoods horror ?. Or perhaps not?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title, the setting, the casting of the young protagonists, the one-paragraph synopsis ? All these aspects and more lead to suspect that "Cabin in the Woods" is just another derivative backwoods horror flick like there are thirteen in a dozen. Five of the most stereotypical college students head out to a rotten cabin the deep forests for a weekend of booze, soft drugs and premarital sex. During the first evening already, they stumble upon a cellar full of mysterious old relics and ? not so surprisingly ? unleash a type of evil that relentlessly pursues and eliminates them one by one. Yes, admittedly, this does sound exactly like the plot of "Evil Dead", so might this just be another passable and uninspired imitation of Sam Raimi's classic and a truckload of others? Oh hell no, because this is where the genius of writers/director Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard enters the scene. One brief look at the repertoires of both these men is enough to assume that they won't simply deliver such an inferior and unoriginal cinematic product. The aforementioned description may sound prototypic, but the opening sequence immediately state clear that the overall film certainly is not. "The Cabin in the Woods" opens with two aging men in suits ? wondrously depicted by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford ? babbling about random irrelevant private stuff when all of a sudden and totally unexpectedly the title torpedoes onto the screen in giant red letters! Intro's like these make my mouth water, as you know you're about to witness something very unique and unconventional. The further interactions between these men, and apparently a fully structured prominent organization behind them, run parallel with the unsuspecting students' trip. They observe and manipulate their every move and even place wagers on how the quintet will respond to a next ordeal. Meanwhile, the script also exaggeratedly puts the emphasis on how clichéd the set up, in fact, is. Each character perfectly fits into a specific category of archetypes (the jock, the nice girl, the bimbo, the stoner and the black model student), they point out themselves that they're heading to an area geographically cut off from civilization and they encounter the obligatory foretelling freak at the last gas station. The bigger picture behind all this remains mysterious and only unfolds in very small bits. Of course I will not reveal the denouement here, but you can rest assured it's something entirely innovative and unpredictable (and this comment comes from someone who has seen more than 3.000 horror movies). To evoke even more curiosity, I will still add that whenever you *think* to have figured out what's going on, Whedon and Goddard slap you around the head with another ingenious gimmick, sub plot or piece of dialog. Even though the duo accomplished most of their previous successes in the fantasy &amp; Sci-Fi genres ("The Avengers", "Lost", "Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"?), they demonstrate great knowledge on horror classics as well. The similarities with "The Evil Dead" are evident, but there are numerous other slick and witty references to genre milestones such as "Hellraiser", "Re-Animator" and "Ringu". Totally refreshing film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel like the high ratings on this film have redeemed me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've caught some crap from other reviewers and in the forums on this site because I like a certain two films: "Thir13en Ghosts" (2001) and "Darkness Falls" (2003). I gave each one a pretty decent rating. This has made me a BAD PERSON and a TERRIBLE REVIEWER.The high ratings that "The Cabin In The Woods" has received so far make me feel much better about myself, since this is basically a pretty mediocre movie and lots of people think it's a great work of art. It's sort of interesting in parts, but you can only plug so many homages into a single film without it feeling like it's just patched together from other people's films. I can't think of a single original scene or plot point in the whole movie.I think what disappoints me the most is that TCITW tries to be lot more than it can be. The two other movies (see above) I mentioned are pretty small and compact films, with moderate budgets and limited aspirations. TCITW tries to be a lot more. One of the most disappointing things about TCITW is the lousy CGI. It opts for extended CGI sequences that would require a lot of work (and money) to get right. And the move doesn't get them right, or even believable. You feel like the director and producers are saying, "Isn't this a great concept to have all these classic creatures in a single scene? Too bad we didn't have the budget to make it impressive on the screen, but the idea to do it was cool."So, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch this. Just don't expect a very scary (or impressively different) film.BTW, I'm a massive Whedon fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a bad motherf*****. Congratulations to the writers, for the story and especially for the ending. A very nice literally punch from inside the film industry. That I didn't expect it. It was actually a surprise. Not much leading from the film trailer keeping the story safe from unfolding to the audience. So simple, cynic, and real. Starting from a "big brother" basis the writers built a story with fresh words and content. The actors do their job fairly but for me the highlight of the film is the success of "telling" the audience from a fresh perspective what they already know, but most of the times they've seen it to what we call independent movies: 1)the suppressor has a time limit, finally he'll be overthrown, 2)we are not meant (as human species) to predominate forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could tell by now that Hollywood's incessant releases of teen slashers have overflowed the library of torture porn films. Why do film producers insist there be tits and outlandish sex scenes in films involving torture and gory deaths? Anyways that has become the niche of the horror film market, and Mr. Goddard and Whedon have smartly implemented the "genre" into this gem. The problem with this movie is that you actually care for the characters in this story. You just don't want them to die! But like the typical Hollywood garbage, it's formulated into the plot. But the writers bring the unconventional, giving the audience a fresh take of the genre. I feel like the writers are giving a middle finger to the movie industry.Even without the satire, the film alone stands as a good horror with some hilarious dialogue exchanged with Richard Jenkins and Brad Whitford as the "evil" corporation. Though you won't be able to ignore the wit that is within the script. This is an original film that must be seen by the masses that are stupefied by the crap of remakes that Hollywood produces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging from the movie's poster, I expected a run-of-the-mill bland monster movie with a few kids in an abandoned cabin, getting chased by the local monster. It starts with a cabin-horror story, yes, but the story builds up from there to bigger things. This movie truly offers everything - from love to sex to horror to sci-fi to humor (!), action, firefights, stunts, drama and suspense, from great acting to a real plot and ethical questions, an ending that isn't predictable and as a cherry on the pie a final appearance from no less than Sigourney Weaver! And the best part - it does ALL of these things right, PLUS blends it all so beautifully! A few minutes in, I could already tell I was in for a treat. Amazing. Best movie of the year for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure what I saw or what the director wanted to make. Was it an attempt to a 'different' slasher movie or perhaps a zombie movie or a conspiracy movie or what? For me it did not stood up to the hype it created and everything in this movie is not what it seems. Like the virgin girl who herself is not sure if she's virgin! I think they made this movie with scripts as they progressed. That could only explain it. Or it could be a result of all those social networking story writing games where one person starts from where the previous on left.On positive side, only 10 minutes of last 15 minutes is fun to watch. Innovation at its best :PYeah, I'm too disgusted (IMDB is not letting me swear here) and trying to justify what I saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People just don't get this movie. It's actually really well thought out and entertaining! Cult classic!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is a horror masterpiece. A cult classic worthy of being called one of the best horror films in decades. Cabin takes the horror genre and completely dissects it in front of the audience, and then throws them right back into one of the craziest finales ever produced on the big screen.Without a good script, an idea this crazy would not have worked. Thankfully, Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard penned a hilarious story that manages to make every character likable. Seeing as the majority of the characters are 'straight out of the book' stereotypes, this truly is an achievement. The pace moves very fast, and the opening scene does a fantastic job of introducing these characters we've seen thousands of times and making us already have a connection to them. Something most horror films struggle to do over the course of the entire two hours. This all plays into the comedic aspects of Cabin.Cabin is definitely horror tale, it also just happens to be hilarious.. There is no better place to see this than in a theater with a huge audience. For the short 90 minutes it runs for, you're going to be in stitches with laughter and completely horrified all at the same time.My theater looked really confused. Really confused. Some even left the theater. It's just one of "those" movies.Fran Kranz is the highlight of the cast, bringing most of the laughs. He's a stereotypical stoner character but with Kranz's pitch perfect performance (he went to stoner school to study for this role) matched with Whedon and Goddard's script, they bring us a character that truly transcends the entire movie.Tread lightly when you're reading up on Cabin in the Woods. You will have a better experience the less you know; don't expect a huge twist. The opening scene reveals what's hinted at in the marketing almost entirely and it's the backbone of the entire picture, and is an ingenious way of analyzing the horror genre.Regardless of your attitude towards scary movies, The Cabin in the Woods is an absolute must watch. It's one of the best films of the year and will be remembered as a classic. It acts as a full stop to the horror genre, explaining everything that came before it in one of the craziest 90 minutes of film filled with hilarity and genuine frights . Go see The Cabin in the Woods, you will not have more fun in a packed cinema this year</fullReview>

The first hour I was a little curious but mostly bored -- zombies killing, yay *twirls finger*. But once the insanity started I literally said YES out loud and chuckled a few times.I've had to watch the last bit a few times to keep track of all the different killers they let loose that you'd see throughout the horror genre, but the more times I watched the more I could place the antagonist/monsters/killers to movies or likeness' to other movies.The anal elitist movie critics soiling themselves in anger over this movie almost entertains me more than any other movie in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What went trough my head at the end of the movie. To bad they spent so much of the time portraying a standard slasher and had to rush trough the "good" part.It's like someone came up with the idea for this movie and in one sentence told the studio what to make.Because they rushed trough the end nothing got explained. Evil giant gods living inside the earth. Being satisfied with some rituals that keep them down. These "gods" must be huge couch potatoes watching TV (the rituals) and the idea is to just keep entertaining them so that they never get motivated to get up and do something else which would be destroying their own property for some reason? If you have any idea how huge the universe is, it also makes no sense. On a universal scale the earth wouldn't even be as big as a single cell organism is to us. Putting gods inside something smaller than a bacteria is just nonsense.Who created humanity? These same gods? Why did they let themselves be kept down there by some rituals? And why was that necessary in the first place? Or in other words, what was the point of humanity? Destroying humanity, and then what? The same deal with another species? Was there a forcefield around the cabin in the woods? Or was it an invisible wall? Would seem to me that a forcefield would not consist of honeycomb segments as was the case. Where did they get this technology from everything else looks like regular tech except for maybe the monster cube structure.Where is the sci-fi the trailer promised (except for the forcefield)? Never really a good idea to mix 'science (fiction)' and 'fantasy/magic'. Don't slap a sci-fi sticker on it if you don't even know the difference between a galaxy and the universe.Seeing all those monsters in the cubes reminded me a lot of the door factory in monsters inc.Still it was a somewhat decent movie. Now that I'm thinking about it: the biggest problem this movie had that they couldn't decide on the genre. It's not scary, it's not funny, it's not serious, it's not deep, it's not light. It's an 'in betweens' mess. But at least they tried something newish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turning Conceptual Horror on its head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this twice now and could watch this over and over again. The aim of this film was to take the elements of the conceptual horror and turn it on its head and succeeds in everything it sets out to do. you can easily feel the director/Writer Drew Goddard was inspired hugely by late 70's early 80's Horror, with the setting parallels with The Evil Dead are easily drawn. the twist within this film is that all the elements from the Undead to Conscious altering Mist is man made controlled in almost some kind of snuff "setting". the fresh concept of sacrificing 5 youthful characters to appease the gods was something I never expected. so in summary I would recommend this for fans of The Evil dead especially. but this is a treat for any horror fan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bright, Layered, Effective Effort That's Also Thoroughly Hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ingenious vehicle for poking and prodding the clichés present in almost every horror movie made over the last thirty years. Part self-referential tongue-in-cheek a'la the first Scream and part identity crisis horr-edy in the same ballpark as Shaun of the Dead, it adds a bevy of original salts and spices and emerges as something completely different. I was told to avoid spoilers like the plague, and I'd strongly advise you to do the same - it's not a premise that translates well to explanation, and half the fun lies in the viewer's slow internal realization of where it's headed. Brilliantly paced, unrelentingly funny, thoroughly unpredictable and boldly written, (with an ending so ballsy and appropriate, I wanted to stand up and cheer) this is one of the most bright, daring, original efforts I've seen in years. Great fun that may be directed particularly at hardcore fans of the genre, it's just opaque enough for casual viewers to have a ball, too.</fullReview>

I don't agree with all the reviewers here that there were many twists and turns as it played out just as I thought it would.Perhaps I wasn't in the mood for an old-school horror flick with a new twist but I was hoping to be blown away and I was simply entertained. I really did like this movie, but the trailers gave away the most significant twist. Why did they spoil the best parts of the movie? That and it was a cross between a true horror movie and some campy comedy - which I do enjoy, but was hoping for straight up terror.Anyway, I'm certain I'll watch it again because it was good and I love a good horror movie, I just probably had too high expectations.

		<shortDescription>An entertaining, thrilling and titillating bloodbath.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not easy to write a review about The Cabin in the Woods without giving away a fairly important plot point so stop reading after the next paragraph if you don't want to know too much. For that matter, don't watch the trailer either because that definitely gives away the game! The initial impression is that it'll be another standard teen romp that we've all seen a million times: Group of good looking teenagers go away together for a weekend of adventure, arguments and innocent(ish) sex, meet and insult a very obviously 'if I had an IQ two points higher I'd be a daffodil and I'm definitely unhinged' local man and it all goes belly up from there. However, this is co-written by Joss Whedon, the creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dollhouse, and 'standard' doesn't enter into it. If you like twists, darkness, a little bit of horror and the odd belly laugh and enjoyed the likes of Zombieland and The Cube, you'll probably enjoy this.******* SIGNIFICANT PLOT SPOILER ALERT ******* The five friends (two girls, two boys and one male geek) head off for a break to a cousin's cabin that none has visited before. Meanwhile, in a control room somewhere, a large production team places bets on an outcome, exchanges banter and launches a new, well, what is it? Game? Broadcast? Event? All will be revealed but what is very evident early on is that money and technology are absolutely no object when it comes to providing an entertaining, thrilling and titillating bloodbath in the cabin that is not quite the simple, decrepit wooden structure it appears.The younger, beautiful cast members are adequate but unremarkable cannon fodder, headed by the hunk of Thor, Chris Hemsworth. The real casting delight comes in the form of a 'surprise' character late on and, particularly, the ever-brilliant Richard Jenkins (Burn After Reading, The Rum Diary, Eat Pray Love) and Bradley Whitford (Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, West Wing) who are both effortlessly entertaining and add the weight of real talent and experience to the humour and panic they inject into the control room. Without Jenkins and Whitford, The Cabin in the Woods would still be fun but their presence, for me, makes it a must-see for non-puritans.From a deliberately predictable start, it rattles through to the suspenseful arrival at the cabin and then, shall we say 'when the doors open', all hell breaks loose in a mess of? Nope. I can't give it away. Just watch it! And more than once. Suffice to say, it's superbly written with nary a duff scene, a few genuine surprises (sometimes because the action has rattled along so swiftly you'll have forgotten about the set-up) and some laugh-out-loud dialogue.On a second viewing, you'll spot more clues in the opening titles and you'll want to revisit it for the reveal of all the possible directions it could have taken. The second viewing is no less entertaining but is a different experience and it's heartening to know that the Hollywood money grabbers are leaving The Cabin in the Woods well alone. When director Drew Goddard was asked at a preview screening Q&amp;A "Will there be a sequel?" he sardonically replied "Have you seen the ending to my movie?" Is it good? Hell yes! What's not to like about a film with thrills, blood, bodies and lines like "Good work, zombie arm." Another film review from The Squiss.

Bad Stuff starts happening, and over the course of this, with its countless(seriously, I can barely believe that all that happened in roughly 90 minutes... this is astonishingly well-paced, it never slows down and yet it doesn't overwhelm) beat changes, plot twists and unexpected situations, right up to the excellent ending, this satirizes(with plenty of meta) modern horror, as in, from the 70's and to today(and thus, it fits in a lot of strong language, bloody, gory, disturbing violence, a little eye-candy, sexuality and topless female nudity), a genre that it's unmistakably clear that Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon despise. Don't get me wrong, it's an awful lot of fun throughout, but you may want to keep that in mind. A portion of the audience I saw this with didn't seem to get into this... perhaps they were expecting an entry into the genre? I don't see how, from the trailer... and yes, that shot of a bird flying out of the Animus simulation and desynchronizing makes sense, and no, you shouldn't know anything about what's really going on in this other than what the previews hint. Anyway, unlike the Scream series, this doesn't go for terrifying its viewers half of the time, or any of it(there are some decent jump-scares, and it can certainly be creepy). It is mainly pointing out the stupid conventions of the medium, and there are those that will find it overly cynical in such. The acting is great by all involved. Characters are well-developed and relatively fleshed out. The FX are fantastic, as is the referencing and creative use of... let's just say, this is a remarkably stimulating experience. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it and of this kind of thing. 8/10</fullReview>

Well no it wasn't scary in the slightest,(except in the beginning when an old man storms out of the gas station, but that wasn't even meant to be scary) sound was used poorly and the effects sucked and the story made no sense whatsoever.2. Satire? Well it failed at that too, Tucker &amp; Dale vs Evil was satire, this was perhaps trying at it at some points, but it was muddled with actual attempts at horror.3. Comedy? All attempts of humor failed in my eyes, except for perhaps one joke, i did however laugh, but only because of how stupid it was, kinda like when a friend makes a terrible joke, but you laugh because it was so dumb.4. Interesting Plot? Alright, the plot was bloody ridiculous unless you happen to believe in creationism and Egyptian gods, the plot didn't make any sense at all, it was just stupid, like the whole film.This is the first time IMDb has given me such a horribly incorrect recommendation at 7.4 with 580+ reviewers, pure garbage this film is, don't even waste 2 hours on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>and most of them mention how they wish they could give it less. I am proud to be one of the many many people who created IMDb accounts just to warn people to avoid this crap. Easily the worst movie I have ever seen. The current IMDb ranking is an absolute lie. How can this many 1 star ratings not bring the overall total under 7? IMDb got paid apparently. I swear I am not a hater and I went into this movie with an open mind. If anyone reads this review and decides to skip this movie I will feel like I made a difference in the world. Don't believe the rating. Read the 17 (!!!!!!) pages of reviews saying this is the worst movie ever. Save yourself!!! run away!!!! Once again, 17 pages saying this is the worst movie ever. Believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't enjoyed a horror film with some comedy in it this much in years. Maybe the last time was when I first saw... Evil Dead 2? Re-Animator? I don't even remember.I won't say anything about the plot, because it would automatically become a spoiler, and please people, resist your urge to read spoilers about this film before watching it. You'll just ruin your own enjoyment. I'll just say that this is a funny, gory (important in a horror film), clever and original movie. I've read some comments about this being a rip-off of "Wrong Turn", "The Evil Dead" and such films.Well, those people totally missed the train, the bus, the balloon and other vehicles on this film. Sure, some scenes resemble those films, but on purpose. I cannot say what that purpose is, that might be a spoiler. I actually like the fact that the opinions are split, some people give one star and some give ten, at least it's not mediocre. One more thing: watch this at least 2 times if you can. Pay attention especially to the cellar scene in the beginning and the objects there. You'll know what I mean. Over and out.:)</fullReview>

Absolutely no idea how it has such a high rating it is probably the worst film I have ever seen, awful storyline, awful acting, awful everything.Something very fishy going on with the ratings for this movie, the producers must have opened 40,000+ accounts to give it a good rating to make people watch it out of hope they'd get back the money they wasted investing in such crap. I almost went to the cinema to see this garbage based on the ratings on this website!

		<shortDescription>It went from interesting to ridiculous...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are you kidding? This was one of the worst horror movies I have had to sit through.The story is about five people heading out to a remote cabin in the mountains, isolated from the outside world. During the stay in the rundown cabin, a cellar door opens up on its own, and the people go into the cellar to discover what is going on. Here they find a book from which one of them reads aloud some ancient Latin words. With these words read aloud, zombies are unleashed, as is something else entirely...What? Wait, let's back it up here. Can anyone say "Evil Dead"? This was either tribute to the cult classic or a shameless and utter rip off. It was everything repeated from "Evil Dead", but just added with some extra stuff.This movie's plot line and story was such a lame copy that it was an embarrassment to witness and a pain to behold. There wasn't a single scary moment in the entire movie. And when you finally are let in on what is going on, you just sit there is disbelief and shake your head at the ludicrous ridiculousness of it all.The characters in the movie were so stereotypical that it was bordering on being generic characters just copy+pasted into the movie. As in any slasher movie, you have a jock, a nerd, a virgin, party-lover, and a girl with no morals. Could it be any more stereotypical?But it wasn't all bad, there were some good parts to the movie as well. There was some really great creature effects in the last third of the movie. Plus there was zombies - anything with zombies is a notch upward in my book. And the scene when Sigourney Weaver entered, that was just the high point of the movie, the most climatic scene in the entire movie. And finally, as the movie ended, Nine Inch Nails was being played. Oh, and not to forget that in the last 20 minutes or so, there is a great amount of gore and mayhem, which almost, just almost, makes it worth suffering through the entire movie just to watch. That was actually some of the best parts of the movie all together, at least it was what caught my interest.This movie was nothing at all as to what I had expected it to be. And it was actually a rather boring and dull experience to sit through. A very anti-climatic movie, and once you are let in on what is going on there, the movie just goes from being boring to being downright ridiculous. I have nothing but respect and awe for the Great Old Gods, but this was just insulting.If anything then the creature effects would make it worth watching the movie, or the less than 5 minutes that Sigourney Weaver is in it. Or for the fact that you have references to almost every slasher movie throughout the last 30 years stuffed into this movie. The rest of the movie is just a waste of time and effort. I am giving this movie a 4/10 rating; 1 point for Sigourney Weaver, 1 point for the creatures, 1 point for the bloodshed and gore in the last 20 minutes, and finally 1 point as the base minimum score that must be given. Had it not been for those, I would have opted for a 1/10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? Again, another nonsensical movie. What started out as just another teen horror movie descended into a totally mind-numbing, makes-no-sense-film. None of the characters were likable. The cheap sex shots deserved a yawning and the whole plot was more convoluted than all the Matrix movies put together. Even Thor and Signorney Weaver could not put this Humpty Dumpty film together. The idea of an ancient god needing a sacrifice to prevent it from destroying the Earth? Come on, it was not even interesting enough to make it 'unique'. The only redeeming quality was when the creatures and monsters had their feast on the scientists. So my 3 stars The Cabin in The Woods was given, and that was way too liberal for what it really deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So nearly brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film having heard good things about it, but knowing absolutely nothing of the plot or concepts. 20 minutes in I was absolutely gripped.This film sets itself up as a fantastic parody of the increasingly repetitious and ridiculous teen horror genre. A predictable horror plot, with your stereotype horror characters behaving in the exact way we would expect them to, runs parallel to a brilliant 'explanation' behind these behaviours - the idea that horror films are essentially snuff films which are manipulated by 'puppeteers'. This concept that we are watching the creation of a horror film is perpetuated by throwaway comments such as that the puppeteers are not the only ones watching. And at the same time, the entertainment of watching the teenage protagonists die is ridiculed, as the puppeteers bet on outcomes, celebrate deaths, and orchestrate nudity for the sake of their own (and our) pleasure. This ridicule is not just aimed at the characters within the film, it's aimed at us - the voyeurs of this and every other horror film like the one being played out (how sick are we to get pleasure out of watching helpless, hopeless, characters die?!) The inclusion of brief glimpses of alternative scenarios playing out in different countries (in particular your stereotype Japanese horror scene), as well as the reference to common and more cult monsters, are an humorous addition to the criticisms the film makes. Genius. Hilarious. Then it loses it...As the film goes deeper and deeper into the reason behind the plot (which I won't go into), it becomes ridiculous and far too plain. What began as a (ok, not that subtle) clever parody on the monotony and depravity of horror films and their watchers, turns into a play of absurdity. The end scene which explains why each character was manipulated as they were was entirely unnecessary - anyone who is enough of a cinephile to understand and enjoy the clever characterisations does not need an explanation, and anyone who doesn't get it won't enjoy it any more for it being explained. Moreover, pulling the teenagers out of their 'set' into the real world, revealed a lack of any deeper characterisation than we had already seen, and as such destroyed the message the film was trying to put across.If I could, I would erase the last half hour of the film from my memory. Without that last half hour, it would have been brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror Film Will Never Be The Same Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with all the great things I heard about The Cabin In The Woods, nothing could prepare me for how great it really was. Hilarious, Twisted, and Insane, The Cabin in the Woods perfectly bends the genres of Comedy and Horror together and creates not only the best Horror Comedy i've ever seen, but one of the best Horror films i've ever seen and some of the most fun i've ever had at the movies. However, this is a really easily film to spoil and I highly recommend going in knowing as little as possible. The most I will say is that the last 20 minutes blew my mind. So stop reading this review and anything related to this film until you see it! It's too good to be spoiled and for anyone to spoil it would be criminal. All I will say is once you've experienced The Cabin In The Woods, you will never see a Horror film the same way again.</fullReview>

I know some smart person will say now: "the moral of the story is that by doing this the humans have given up their humanity and thus do not deserve to live!"

		<fullReview>If you think This movie is funny, I am sorry: You have a twisted sense of humor. You just want to "look cool" because you say you "Understand" the movie and the idea. That's arrogance. If you say this movie is a horror movie, well, you haven't watched horror movies lately. And you haven't watched old classical horror movies enough. Or you get scared way too easily ( suggestion for you: it is just a movie, OK ? It's not real life.. ). If you think it is original, gosh.. what can I do ? It's way closer to a mish-mash rather than something "Original". Besides, "originality" is something questionable, since all movies ( and books ) are related with other things we have seen or read.. So.. Going on: if you think this is a parody, I recommend you to watch "Shaun of the Dead". That's a real good parody of terror ( zombies ) movies. And it's funny ! Truly funny, not this S%$T ! This movie won't make you sleep, because you will either leave the theater within 15 minutes or stay in your seat crying and vomiting. Unless you're "different" as I mentioned before. This movie is awful. Is it meant to be a horror movie ? Fail ! There's no horror in it, except for the poor acting and direction. Is it meant to be a comedy ? Fail again; it's not funny. It's funny only for those who think are better than the rest. Is it meant to be a parody ? Triple fail: The satiric and humorous basis to build a decent parody are not present. The whole concept is too lame and the way the scenarios are divided is too clumsy. The audience can't recognize it is as a parody. There is no way to relate with it. Let's see; this movie was shot in 2009? But released only now in 2012.. Why ? Probably only to benefit from the success of "Thor" and "The Avengers". Chris Hemsworth is in it. But he was not Thor at that time.. What is this movie ? It's a mish-mash of the Truman Show, 13 Ghosts and The Cube with connections with "Evil Dead", "Aliens", "Hell Raiser", "Skeleton Key", and most zombie movies from John Carpenter. A bag full of references which ended up in nothing. Thank God I didn't watch it in a Theater, because it would be too embarrassing if my friends saw me leaving this movie. I would be the joke till the end of the year.. Oh, and the IMDb ratings are seriously wrong.. How can it have such a high rate ? Only the Ancient Gods know. The boring ones?</fullReview>

I don't know whether you have noticed that this film is full of originality and not your typical movie or should i say typical American movie that seems to live of remaking originals such as British and foreign movies. Get a grip Americans make up your own ideas instead of copying everyone else. I am not your typical reviewer and i rate movies my own way. I am also not your typical critic who only seems to review blockbuster or films with worldwide success and forget about the world of independent cinema. Please watch this movie and let me know what you think.

		<shortDescription>The Same Old Horror Film... or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Killer unicorns, zombie hillbillies and 20 foot serpent demons are just some of the delights on display for audiences of 'The Cabin In The Woods': the glorious pan-horror genre-exploder produced and co-written by Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy and Firefly) and directed by Drew Goddard in his feature debut.We begin, as we so often do, with five college students heading to the woods for a weekend of partying, drinking and, most importantly, not studying. The posse is made up of a college athlete, his ditzy girlfriend, a sensitive geek, the wholesome girl next door and a drug-addled waster. Getting lost on the way, they meet a creepy gas station attendant who warns: 'Getting there's not the trouble? getting back's what you need to worry about'. A cliché premise for sure, but there's a second storyline that's about to rip it apart faster than an attractive teen on Friday the 13th.Cut to a mysterious underground lair where a surveillance team monitor the students as they arrive at their destination. But they're not only watching them, they are controlling them ? releasing mood altering gases, spiking their food and playing with trap doors. They're also running a sweepstakes amongst themselves. What are they betting on? How their victims will die, of course, because there's a variety of options.As the cabin inmates get picked off one by one, the survivors slowly become wise to the murderous game they have become a part of: with only their wits and the will to survive, they must escape this nightmare Truman Show and break free from their puppet masters. Beyond that, I'd love to tell you more, but I won't. The second half of the movie has to be seen to be believed, and the less you know about it the more you'll enjoy it.What makes the 'The Cabin In The Woods' such a success is it's brilliant balancing of the two story lines, and the perfect placement of humour throughout. Even though Drew Goddard gets directing credits, this film feels like Whedon through and through. The keen understanding of genre, brilliantly witty dialogue, teen sensibility and wonderful subversion of convention are reminiscent of Buffy The Vampire Slayer at its very best.I'll end by joining the chorus of critics telling you not to read about 'The Cabin In The Woods', but to go out and see it: it's twists and turns need to be experienced first-hand, and with all its spectacle I would suggest catching it on the big screen rather than DVD. And please, stay out of the woods.Find all of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com. Follow us on Twitter @DohaFilm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Cult Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie catches your eye and instantly becomes a cult classic, this has happened with other films such as Donnie Darko, Evil Dead and Reservoir Dogs. Seeing the previews for this film I went in expecting an entertaining horror movie and nothing more. And briefly that's what I thought was be presented before me in the theatre then the real story started to come to light and I couldn't have been more thrilled.Since I refuse to give anything away that would ruin the excellent experience of viewing this movie, I will just briefly describe the plot. If you have ever seen any classic horror films like Evil Dead then you already know the setup to the movie. A few college kids go to a deserted cabin in the woods that they inexplicably were able to get for a weekend or so. Explaining any further about the beginning would just be unnecessary repetition of what you should already know. Needless to say after brief enjoyment some evil is unearthed and one by one the kids start to be killed as would happen in any horror movie of this sort. Up to this point I considered this to be the highlight of the movie which would have been been what I expected but what I didn't expect is that this was barely the beginning of what was coming.Joss Whedon who I have respected for years from his amazing television shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and more recently Dollhouse. He also was pitch perfect for directing the Avengers movie that was also released this year. Him along with his long time collaborator Drew Goddard have made a masterpiece of a horror film, if this film even belongs to a specific genre. The young cast is amazing but perhaps the standout of the group would be Fran Kranz who plays "Marty", who beyond being the funny stoner of the movie actually does have a really good role and it would seem hard to imagine the movie without him.Unfortunately it's hard to recommend this movie without giving away important plot points, so I'll just end with this, Try and find a way to watch this movie it is spectacular and will become a cult classic that will discussed for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The name of this movie says it all, it's an ordinary horror movie, probably a slasher taking place at a cabin in the woods."That was what I thought, and The cabin in the woods starts as a prototype of a slasher movie. The characters are presented as classic stereotypes, and as you easily can guess, the blonde dies first and the virgin seems to be the surviver. But you will soon realize that this is not an ordinary horror film. The area where the boys and girls are getting killed is totally controlled by some people, but in the beginning their intentions are impossible to understand.This 85 minute long masterpiece develops into a "comic horror adventure". As the time goes, you realize what the people that controlled the cabin and its surroundings were really doing, and why they did it.The Cabin in the woods is really surprising. It starts with some youngsters going on a weekend trip to have some fun, and ends with the destruction of humanity. It is in my opinion one of the best horror movies of the 21:st century so far and a future classic.And yes, the movie contains a unicorn.</fullReview>

Wow, how "artsy"; there are werewolves, clowns, pinheads, snakes, zombies, spiders, ghosts, and such.

		<fullReview>I gave this a 1 out of 10 because it is over rated yes its done well but it is just a rip off off evil dead and trueman show with ripoff bits from cube thirteen ghosts and other films I love horror films and i should like this but there something that makes me not like it maybe because its not serious it tries to be but its not its better than most b movies but still over rated and has some stupid bits in it also which don't make sense but overall disappointing most of the kills you don't see because of camera or its too dark i am surprised there was not a scene with the shaky camera view which most crap horror films try to rip off nowadays to try and get suspense which don't work anyway good job i did waste money and see this at the cinema. Will not watch again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Goes out on a limb but falls short of the grail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few clichés are as tired as the by now infinitely wearisome 'teenage college kids spend the weekend in a cabin in the woods' format.For some reason horror movie producers and directors still seem to think this format is workable, maybe even a trope. But that's not true. Show me someone who isn't bored of the 'cabin in the woods' setup and I'll show you someone who's been living the past three decades (if not four) living with an indigenous pygmy tribe in the remote depths of the Amazon jungle where they don't even know what a trope is. In short, dear Hollywood - we are pig-sh*t-sick of the cabin in the woods scenario.Thus, a film entitled 'Cabin in the Woods' is making a bold move with the movie-going public. There's an inevitable sense of foreboding. A sinking feeling that movies, and therefore society, are on the decline; that the brazen title of this latest horror outing is indicative of the 'couldn't give a flying flick' attitude of the powers that be; a cinematic microcosm of the mire we are expected to live in on a daily basis, to take on the chin, to accept as read, to swallow like good little boys and girls. Here is society personified in a film title and we know all too well what to expect. We pay our fees, bend over and drop our trousers as we've grown accustomed to doing of late.But wait! Something is amiss.Sure, we're looking at a group of teenagers going to a cabin in the woods for a weekend break. And sure, one of them is a muscular 'jock', another is a blonde, over-sexed bimbo, another is a pot-smoking know-it-all sarcasm vendor and yet another is the ubiquitous prissy virgin, annoyed that her friends have set her up with the token 'stud' and won't even allow her to bring her text books to the cabin. Sure, everything looks suspiciously familiar from the outset - even down to the grumpy local yokel and his serial-killer mannerisms. But don't let appearances deceive you.Cabin in the Woods inserts its tongue into its cheek from scene one. It recognises the clichés and sprains them. It gives the middle finger to sense and throws itself with wild abandon into the silliest, yet most original plot you're likely to see this side of a Tarantino picture.And then it falls sadly short, drawing up a few furlongs shy of an instant classic. The problems are not numerous, but jar nonetheless. Plot holes, for the most part. Questions unanswered and threads unresolved. The premise is inspired yet never fully realised. The characters contain potential but fall foul of the formula. Ultimately, in trying to parody a genre, Cabin in the Woods becomes its own target and sinks into a paradox of self-defeating ideas. In the end it morphs into something quite original but far beyond the initial mission statement, wading its way toward an inevitable conclusion having succumbed to those unoriginal scenes it seeks to mock.Ultimately, a unique horror, black humour of the deepest black with a sprinkling of eugenicist philosophy for good measure. You'll enjoy it, I guarantee. Whether you'll take anything away from it other than a smirk is less certain.Could have been a genre-changing catalyst, but succeeds only in adding a few new layers to a previously shallow sub-genre. Great fun along the way and no less worthy a motion picture for those failed and lofty intentions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Bunch of A list actors, tantalizing story line, heavy marketing and a blockbuster budget..?? whats the end result.. a total artificial, mindless movie about few young folks get trapped in a house in the woods. This house is supposed to be of one of actor's relatives.. bah....!! Are they so nut-cases and empty heads.. not to have checked the surroundings and the house itself. The so called watchers.. Top floor, middle floor and what-not floor employers betting on people's lives and the wrecker-in-chief pleading with hero/heroine about the destruction of human race.. a stupid unbelievable god-turned-evil background.. The director doesn't even care to justify or explain to the audience of what this all tamasha is about. Do we really have fun in watching few innocents slaughtered in an unknown woods which is so remote controlled by some bunch of hi-tech folks who seem to have the collection of weapons .. even the Satan or the Devil himself would be ogling with envy.. And.. gosh.. how can they go wrong.. how can they so irresponsible.. in allowing so obvious glitches to get away and ruin their shows.. only god knows.. because the director seems to be super excited in showing us some mambo jumbo and crazy special effects and a collage of super duper horrible creature mashed out of all the possible horror flicks in the world. And what in the hell is the Thor guy doing out here? he is not even the hero in this flick.. for all of his triceps and biceps and Thor like figure.. all wasted i would say. If you are horror fans.. I would think this movie would serve you like a chic comic show..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool disappointment :(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so disappointing. I wanted to see a Horror movie and what I got was a bloody Truman show/Last action hero Comedy within a Cthulhu mythos. Axe the comedy and you have great potential. I wanted to see a horror!! So I did not only see a movie I wanted to I now want to see a movie I can not. Frustrating. The movie I now want to see is the one which begins at the last scene of this movie. This movie is a prequel for that movie. OK, this movie is fun and maybe even cool, but it still feels like eating an all bread sandwich. I want some meat! A movie where ancient petty immortal Gods who love watching horror movies, rip apart a humanity who couldn't accomplish the simplest of chores, to kill a few dim witted college kids for there enjoyment(appeasement), is a great sounding movie. What I got was a new layer on an old onion, if that's what is good than this movie is great. I have heard this movie be lauded as 'smart'. A movie is not smart simply because it gives purpose for a genre. Smart would have been to be the first 3 hour horror/fantasy/action epic with viewers ranting its praises afterward. Now that would have been confounding. The presumed destruction and war which ensue after this movie ends are awesomely worthy of screen time. It would have been cool, to watch a horror/fantasy/action film with a beginning middle and end on the scale of a Lord of the rings epic. This movie merely wets the whistle. So what you get here is foreplay with no release. Enjoy first base its all you get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was one of the worst films I've seen in a while. I went in ready to watch a horror film, and it just seemed a bit of a joke, I wasn't scared throughout the film, which I usually am at horror films. The bits where there was horror was reasonably good, which I thought would have made a good film in itself, instead of all the humor from the other characters in the film.I wouldn't recommend it to a friend who likes horrors, but if their preference is black comedies, I would possibly recommend it. The main good point for me was that Chris Hemsworth does look good in the movie, and also the character of Marty made the film worthwhile to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ironic comedy detracts from any sense of thrill or horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS are included in this review. Many people will feel that if they don't like this film they will be criticized for not ''getting it''.Yes, yes we get the point...this is a post-modern satire on the clichés we always see in horror films, but it is not a subtle or sophisticated satire.Any point in the film where there is a sense of impending dread, the scene immediately cuts away to the Austin Powers style organization who are setting up the events. This means that the tone is constantly changing from horror to comedy. In so doing the film has no sense of real dread required to be a thrilling horror, nor is the comedy sustained enough for satisfying humor. The film is original and fast paced, but only because it has no narrative parameters. It is entirely anarchic in tone involving zombies, 60s b-film monsters, sci-fi, satanic gods, a Dr Evil style organization from a James Bond film etc etc. Any film can be original if it willing to just mesh together every genre with no real thought for continuity. The thing that keeps you watching is largely because you want to find out what the organization's motives are. The problem is that the answer i.e. placating evil gods....is just too ridiculous and superficial to be satisfying The film is simply too self-referential and self conscious to be genuinely thrilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed..Why all the fuss?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters I am really surprised by the high ratings.. I understand that these kind of movies have 'followers' but 8.2?? come on! I read other reviews pointing out the fact that its not a typical horror movie. Well I agree.. But I really don't know in what genre of films does this movie actually belong to.. the lack of identity is obvious and really annoying for me.. The concept is not bad. First half of the movie was interesting, lots of action, nice quotes, good and scary enough ''poppers''. After a certain point though I couldn't wait for the end. It was like the plot was evolving too quickly and the they had to fill the rest of the movie with chasing,blood,monsters etc. Everybody was claiming ''eveything is part of mythology or other movies'' but that DOES NOT make the film good. So what if you take characters of 100 films, put them together without a purpose..? Anyway I was really disappointed especially after seeing the ratings and some reviews. So don't get your hopes that high.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as mind-blowing as expected, but a great twist on the Horror genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looks like Buffy creator Joss Whedon has found a big screen playground all for himself!*I am making this as spoiler free as possible!*I was intrigued to see Cabin in the Woods, but not obsessed; unlike some people I didn't realise this has been in the works for some time now, and I merely knew "it does things differently". That's enough for me. I see a lot of films, an awful lot, and some times they start to look and sound the same. Cabin in the Woods is a Scream-esque homage to the horror genre, but less of a parody and more of an actual twist on the genre. Five young friends go off on a road trip to spend a weekend in a woodland cabin, but when they arrive they awaken evil and uncover the multiple layers of secrets behind it.It is very hard to talk about this one without giving away the linchpin of its originality. So I recommend seeing this, it is a gore fest full of Joss Whedon humour (seriously, fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Serenity should probably check this out!) and has a punchy subtext about every generic horror movie ever made. If you are a fan of your horror films, I'm sure you'll pick up on this.Some might see its deliberate clichés as exactly that, clichés, but that is in fact the point of the thing. Is that in itself uninventive? Well, that's up to the viewer, but Whedon always likes to have underlying ideas in his works, and doesn't beat you over the head with them. While I wasn't blown away by it as the hype was suggesting I should be, it was one of the more entertaining and original takes on the teen horror movie genre.In a nutshell, watch and read as little as possible. This review cannot express what goes on, but I can say that even watching the trailer gave away too much! Perhaps when the popularity dies down, and it becomes one of many random horror rentals, it'll shine all the brighter.Not as chilling or jump-scary as Woman in Black, but fun, gory and witty with its originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best horror film since when?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now when I was reading all the different reviews on this film I was expecting something that I have never seen any horror film do. (Well speaking about the surprise at the end thats about the best it gets throughout the entire film) Film is just any old typical teen horror films out there but with a twist of a battle royal feel but in a horror feeling. I have read that this film has been on the shelf for sometime since they released it. I feel that it should of gone straight to DVD to be honest. The dark comedy humour is the only savour this film has except for the bloody gore ending before the "GODS" hand destroys earth.Mainly I was more interested when Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford was on screen. They played the best roles in my opinion they kept it sharp and funny when they where on screen with great chemistry. The film does follow the horror genre with the dumb blonde first to go to follow in sequence who goes next.Your typical stoner dude does some really great one liners when he is on screen, Specially when they are going through the basement and checking out all the different objects that will summon what will come for them.The killings I felt where very lack in imagination of what the Red Neck Zombies could have done. But when the film got to the ending and you saw all the other nightmares that they could of had, I was more like really Red Neck Zombies over the Werewolf, Ghost, Snake (Even tho it looked so terrible) and all the others.Even thought this film is really saved by the ending. I feel that the ?10 I spent could of been saved for another film. This film is basically for a night in with your mates with a pizza and few beers where not much attention is needed.2/5 for my rate</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the stupidest film I have ever watched. Mixing horror with comedy and childish humour is like mixing being a rockstar with going to dance in a ballet formation... Like eating chilly with popcorn and chocolate.. awful.... This is a crisis.. The script is unexpected array of irrational apperancses of any kind of motives- sex ,horror which is OK but Humour and history engagement is just an absurd. Moreover Seageny Weaver is one of the tops of unfortunate things. She is the one to explain how things works and believe me it is so ordinary and boring like the story is from the first fantasy movies. May be the scriptors have tried to make the audience associate with the Alien or something else but that is so redecilous....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not redefine horror, as others have stated. It does not raise the bar either. It does raise the bile in my throat when I know the multiple **sholes responsible for this crapfest made a buttload of money. Their is nothing new here, no plot twist of any kind. If you saw the trailer you know what the jist is. Please, I beg you, I am not the arrogant type but as someone with decent taste in film, I have to take a stand here, save your hard earned money. Make Hollywood earn theirs by putting out some material that doesn't stink up the joint. I have to write ten lines on this stinker so here goes. Let's name some well done horror films. Go rent the new remake of "Dawn of the Dead", if you like gore/action. Rent "The Others" if you like a good ghost story with a nice plot twist. Maybe "The Changeling" if your down for a classic. Check out Peter Jackson's "Dead Alive" if you want some outrageous, campy horror fun. Silent horror you say? "The Cabinet of Dr. Calighari", from 1919 is a surreal masterpiece. Something newer? I had faith in Eli Roth for a brief moment with "Cabin Fever". The shine has now worn off, but still recommend the film for something entertaining. If you want a modern day "old fashioned" monster movie, check out "Jeepers Creepers". Foreign film? Anyone who has ventured down this path knows that their are several countries completely blowing us out of the water in the horror genre. "Audition" will make you cringe uncomfortably. Look up any of Hollywood's schlock from the past 15 years or so and find the original films (The Ring, The Grudge, Let the Right One In, etc.) Oh Hollywood you have sodomized so many great films.......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods lives up to all of the excellent reviews it has been getting. I smiled through the entire movie because it was written for Horror movie freaks. It was paced fantastically, there was no significant down time during the film. It was, all at once, funny, scary, clever, tense, and Meta-Awesome.Cabin in the Woods employs a movie-within-a-movie device to perfection. There is a standard slasher film with young adults travelling into the woods that is, all the while, being manipulated by an organization that must complete a cliché string of horror tropes in order to make a sacrifice to the gods.This Meta-Movie offers an explanation for why horror movies get made and why they have to follow a formula; if they don't then gods that previously ruled the earth will rise up and exterminate all living things. In the control room Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins act as directors for the Truman Show or the Hunger Games, attempting to choreograph the actions of people with free will. Most of the humor comes from the control room; Bradley Whitford is extraordinarily funny in this movie, I'm glad they cast him.The different layers are intertwined to perfection with a lot of little gems and rewards for horror fans. The tone of the movie is affective, and despite the humor and ridiculous plot manages to be tense. Must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Cabin in the Woods" was a very frustrating film for me to watch. While the movie did a great job in explaining WHY we keep seeing all those dumb clichés in hack 'em up movies (such as the bimbo who dies first and the dumb jock), it ultimately allowed itself to, in the end, be just about as dumb and mindless as a typical hack and slash film. It's a real shame, as for so much of the movie it kept my attention.The film is a twist on the usual young adults being murdered in the woods film because you soon see that all this is being orchestrated by a group of people working in a weird base underground. Exactly why and who they are isn't known until later...all you know is that these folks watch EVERYTHING that's happening to a group of victims and they even bet as to what is going to happen next. It's all very clever and the actual explanation is a mixed bag. On the one hand it does explain things pretty well but on the other, it just degenerates into a giant bloodbath that seems to value blood and chaos more than sticking with the underlying plot. The bottom line is that the film is a near miss...a film that almost works superbly. Instead, the ending just lost me amid the chaos. For my time and money, I much preferred "Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"...much more complete and enjoyable anti-hacker sort of film. This was a disappointment...as was seeing the gorgeous Chris Hemsworth...but without his usual blonde head of hair!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods was a really different kind of horror movie. Instead of using the basic pop-out scares and unsettling character traits, this movie has combined the use of a cursed object that teenagers merely find in the basement of a cabin in the woods. From the start of the movie to the end, I was excited and prepared to have my mind blown and my body thrown out of my seat as I'd experience this new kind of horror movie genre. The Cabin in the Woods was a completely new vision of the kind of horror that I love to be apart of. This movie contained the essence of a laboratory underground run by a secret organization who sells the picture of different haunts throughout the world. The movie was more seen as an experiment (literally) where different monsters locked in boxes underground get summoned by different artifacts that any stranger could find in their home or school. These monsters were designed to kill the people who summoned them so the cooperate office underground running the show, could have higher ratings. The movie was more than unsettling, it was a complete turn from a regular everyday scary movie that you would see with your friends. To me, it is defined as the start of a new legacy of scary movies since 2012.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods starts off as almost a stereotypical 80's horror movie as its name implies. However, as it frequently tells you, this has all been done before. It's almost perfect in that regard, but the climax really bothered me. It was the monsters. Instead of fighting amongst themselves, they all worked together to kill the humans. Most of the monsters weren't even the same species! Some of them were human! Why didn't the snake eat the monsters!? This is a very glaring problem! Also, and this is the biggest problem of all, Why the heck is there a button that opens all of the monster containment units at once!? Anyone with half of a brain would never allow such a button to exist! Plus,there was no password either! It's just flip a couple of switches and press a button! Who designed it that way!? That just ruined the movie for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Innovative and intriguing horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fiendishly clever "The Cabin in the Woods," a deceivingly insightful horror film that elicits just as many knowing chuckles as horrified gasps. Five teenagers head off for a weekend at a secluded cabin in the woods and they find an odd assortment of relics, but when one of the women, Dana (Kristen Connolly), reads from a book she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. There's far more going on however than meets the eye as the five campers are all under observation. This is no ordinary cabin in the woods, but actually a set for a diabolical scientific experiment. Beneath the cabin is a basement, and beneath that is a vast modern laboratory headed by technology geeks (Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) who turn dials, adjust levers and monitor every second on a bank of TV monitors. Goddard also takes on directing responsibilities, and his feature film debut demonstrates a keen eye for various genres, all incorporated seamlessly into this film. Laughter and satire are always close by, and I can't recall another film that's remotely close to its offering of thrills, spills and laughter. There are plenty of moments where you're kept on the edge of your seat, with surprising twists and turns popping up every now and then. Screenwriters Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard take the quintessential horror film ensemble of characters, and ridiculous scenarios and then inject a dose logical rationale, keeping it thoroughly entertaining. The idea of free will and our decision making process as people is explored. Do horror characters make choices because of the requirements of the genre, or because of their own decisions? This is not a perfect film by any means, but its's exciting because it ventures so far off the map for your typical horror film. The movie becomes kind of a greatest hits collection of horror movie techniques and clichés; twisting them around, while poking fun at them simultaneously. In a day and age where everything is a remake or a reboot, how refreshing to enjoy something completely innovative, and executed with great skill. Highly recommended and requires multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't really give it a 10 but hey...So some people won't like this much, not totally sure why unless you just purely like gore. This has a little more depth though and actually makes me happy in a "wow, that was really cool" kind of way that I don't experience much anymore, because you know what its like, you got your access to films 24/7 on the box via paid services or the normal network guys, your BBC and ITV and all the young upstarts on the block. You go to work, you know your stuff, you've got a Tesco club-card and you likely don't get that excited by many films anymore because there are only so many ways to tell the same story. You certainly know that a creepy teen slasher is exactly that...right?Nah mate, bets are off with this total out of nowhere oh-my-god-athon.I love some of the characterisations, the jock is there, but hey, notice at the start of the film, he's actually a nice guy as is his mate (the room swap for example). These people get manipulated into what the media normally tries to chuck at us, not normal people but what they want us to be in order to sell us rubbish and they do it sneakily.Yeah totally this treads the same path of parody to its source as did Scream, but just like that film, it does it very well and with a tongue firmly in cheek.The final half hour is just completely bonkers - the nightmare prison, that was the muts nuts. Not enjoyed anything quite so much since Braindead (dead-alive).oh yeah, sorry, its a film about a cabin in the woods and 5 bods go there for the weekend, ahh you know the story....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'm giving this 9/10 for a horror movie. But if you don't like the genre, then you probably won't like this either.This movie was well acted and produced, but what really set it apart from the run of the mill horror flicks was the high quality writing and characters with depth. The plot was also original, but the biggest selling point for me was the movie's wittiness/humor and how it was just plain cool.Cabin in the Woods has plenty of monsters and gore, but don't expect it to be scary or suspenseful. Then again, not every horror movie has to be scary- the bottom line is I was thoroughly entertained throughout the this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods... If I was looking for a weekend away this would not be on my list of places to go! However it befits the films nature, poking fun at the horror flick, and with some success.Although the parody was successfully encaptured by the Scream franchise The Cabin in the Woods manages to spruce up the formula with an original twist and a modicum of present day insight.The Cabin in the Woods, we soon learn, is a 'Truman Show' set watched by the masses and for what specific purpose - it is not first revealed. Goddard and Whedon have melded a horror story around the populous reality TV format and to a satirical degree probes at our human passivity to violence/death in the twenty-first century.There are some nice moments in The Cabin in the Woods, and although it works to a degree it seems rather benign. It would be unfair to say that it lacked horror because it seeks a more comical stride, but it lacks that vital punch. Kudos where it is due The Cabin in the Woods is inventive enough to not feel like a Scream-replica but its original setup does not have the matching narrative.</fullReview>

I love all the different kind of monsters and the way they are all presented each in it's own cage, it reminds me a bit of the Thirteen Ghosts movie.To begin with I found it a bit cliché with the college kids going to the woods and the rest as usual but the movie has a really nice twist at the end even though the movie shows you the entire plot theme right from the beginning.Thank god someone made this film I really enjoyed the monsters breaking out of their prison and eating every person in the movie hahahaha....nice one.I give it 9 skulls on the Mike Enslin scale because it combines the paranormal and the classic horror.

		<fullReview>It all comes down to what you expected when walking into this, and how stubborn you are about those expectations. If you;re looking for something that will give you nightmares and cause you to check the dark corners of your house(Paranormal Activity), this isn't it. This is something you walk into to be completely dumbfounded and dazzled for 2 hours, then come out and say damn that was crazy, then forget about it(like riding a roller coaster). And it's a mind-overwhelming kind of crazy, not a "omg there's so much blood and body parts" kind of crazy. This is a tribute to pretty much all horror clichés ever made, but with the most un-cliché ending. Let me tell you this: No matter how smart you are, you will not predict how this film turns out. As I said, go in for a ride if your comfortable with the horror genre, you will definitely be surprised, whether pleasantly, or unpleasantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can one take horror seriously anyways? This was a very enjoyable film to watch, certainly not worth 1 star. Don't expect it to be another "grindhouse" set in a cabin in the woods, because of a trailer, the high IMDb rating and the 'R' parental guidance rating. I couldn't see this movie lower than a 7 and, no, I am not 'smoking too much of what Marty smokes.' I just love those people who are writing reviews to say things like that... It is certainly not unpredictable, but it isn't too predictable either, it finds that perfect spot where you can predict some of what happens, yet the movie will still find ways to surprise you! Please don't take some of these hate ratings too seriously and give this movie a chance. And once you start watching at least make an attempt get into the movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most smartly entertaining, inquisitively unique, and surprisingly humorous horror films ever made. As should be expected from the writer of Cloverfield, The Cabin in the Woods takes you on a psychological thrill ride into a place of nightmares where Saw meets The Hunger Games and will surprise and intrigue you as you unravel the story. The movie throws convention aside and takes the genre to a new, deeper level. Fit to entertain all, there is plenty of blood and gore, a host of horrifying creatures, and an interesting and deeply rooted conspiracy. Despite its occasional quirks and flaws, it will satisfy any viewer who enjoys horror and/or thinking movies. 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun skewering of the horror conventions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five stereotypical kids, the virginal heroine, the slut, the dumb jock boyfriend, the stoner, the potential, boyfriend etc. head up to a cabin in the woods, to party, do drugs, drink &amp; have sex, unaware that they are being monitored by a secret organization that has the whole place &amp; the surrounding area, rigged so they cannot leave &amp; leave several options lying about for the kids to choose what horrible fate they will suffer, all unbeknowest to them. The fate the kids do summon upon themselves (again, unknowingly) is that of the long dead family named the Buckners, that lived in that cabin at one time many years ago &amp; who have been buried on the land. Rising from their graves, they brutally dispose of the kids. CABIN IN THE WOODS, as many horror fans know, had a somewhat nightmarish production history, originally set to be released by MGM, the film sat on the shelf some four years before finally being released by Lion's Gate. Unfortuantly while the film did moderately well in it's theatrical run, it didn't strike a cord in the way SCREAM did, with it's skewering of horror movie conventions &amp; clichés during the late 90's. THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is directed by the talented DREW GODDARD &amp; co-written &amp; produced by JOSS WHEDON creator of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYERS the series &amp; like SCREAM, skewers quiet humorously, the conventions of the horror genre. Both Wheadon &amp; Goddard are clearly fans of the genre &amp; I had a hoot watching them at work with their clever screenplay. As a die hard horror fan, I was able to catch all their on target jabs at the horror conventions &amp; it's many staples. Out of all the horror movies &amp; their villains they pay tribute to, it appears that THE EVIL DEAD is a huge influence, since the cabin, the plot (5 kids travelling up to a cabin in the mountains only to encounter an supernatural evil) a sequence where a root cellar door pops up all by itself &amp; the investigation that leads them to a book that will start all their troubles, is all reminiscent of that film. The gore is not as heavy handed as what I thought it would be, in fact, the film isn't as gory as many current horror items, though there are a few good moments. The actors were fabulous &amp; really made their roles fun to watch. The direction &amp; writing is very good &amp; the clever plot is a change from the usual psycho stalking kids in the woods scenario. Going back to the skewering of various conventions, I enjoyed how those in control found out that setting the whole thing up &amp; putting kids in a horror movie scenario might have been clever &amp; easy, but what is difficult is how in real life kids don't always act the way they do in horror movies &amp; this forces them to try &amp; control the way things happen to the kids, in particular putting them in area's of danger to appease their bosses, such as splitting them up, when the kids stick together when under attack &amp; when the slut character refuses to get naked out in the woods with her boyfriend, which is just not how horror films go, there has to be nudity, so they have to use a gas that clouds her mind &amp; she immediately follows one of the many horror movie staples &amp; gets naked. They also have devices to rig doors to shut by themselves. The reason they are really doing this &amp; trying harder than ever here? its to try &amp; up seat the one country that has been besting them for a long time, China! speaking of China, at a girls school, they have the ghost of a little girl who has a group of school kids trapped in their classroom &amp; is determined to kill them, unless of course they can defeat it. But when the kids at the cabin get smart to what's happening &amp; uncover their secret, they accidentally unleash werewolves, ghostly apparitions, alien creatures, demons, a Pinhead like demon (From HELLRAISER) with a odd music box, dinosaurs, giant spiders, giant snakes, scarecrows, flying demons, mechanical robots run amok, monsters dressed as doctors, sack wearing serial killers (who look like refugees from THE STRANGERS) clowns, half man, half fish mutations, killer unicorns, freaks &amp; squid monster loose &amp; these creatures are none to happy to be held in captivity &amp; will gladly show their captors just how much! &amp; just when you think things can't possibly get any weirder, SIGOURNEY WEAVER shows up as the director of the whole thing! unfortunately as she explains to the remaining survivors, the creatures mentioned aren't the things they have to watch out for, it's the ancient demon creatures who will rise up from hell &amp; destroy the worlds if the remaining survivors don't die! Highly recommended for fans of the genre only! If you are not really a fan (then again if you weren't you wouldn't be reading this review, much less visit the site for this movie) or are looking for a higher class suspense thriller like PSYCHO, stay well away from this! As for the other horror film fanatic's enjoy. One of the best horror films of the decade!**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genre bending, smart and fun?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are conditioned to believe that when we see the title for a film called "The Cabin In the Woods" that we would get a cliché slasher flick where the main anti hero, that is "smarter" than everyone else, teams up with the typical hot blonde, who ends up leaving the stereotypical jock for thus anti hero and survive after being chased around the woods for 90 minutes or so. Well, after seeing "The Cabin In The Woods" I can honestly say it was like taking a breathe of fresh air for the first time. By now this movie has had a lot of hype behind it. I am telling you personally, do not read any plot points behind this or watch any of the trailers, go in completely blind and you will feel like you just witnessed something truly special, while having fun in the process! It starts out as any slasher/horror movie does, 5 teens embarking in a motor home to a remote location for a fun filled intoxicating weekend. Yet, what unravels in the second and third act is something to twist the genre on its head, for the better. I am not going to get into spoilers because that would defeat the purpose of my previous statements about avoiding plot points. I will tell you that if you are a fan or horror, quality writing or if you just feel like watching movies now a days is the same old thing over and over again than I suggest investing the 95 minutes or so to go on a ride that I can assure you, you have not taken before. All the actors do fine work here as they know exactly how to portray the dialogue scripted by the likes of Drew Goddard (Cloverfield) and fan boy favorite Joss Whednon (The Avengers,Firefly). There is also a little surprise cameo at the end which will give fans of the genre a nice smile as they witness how the third act raps up in its ambitious conclusion. Its a great homage to horror films and a lot of fun as well, its not too serious, yet not campy either. "The Cabin In The Woods" gets a 9 out of 10 from me. I hope you take my review into consideration, if you do, simply sit back and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ingenious blend of genres</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the film that more sophisticated horror fans have been waiting for. It takes your stereotypical horror story of a group of archetypally based friends going off and getting terrorized by some horrific being or creature for one reason or another. One thing always seems to stand with this type of film. The humans are really stupid, and most horror films are fueled by an onslaught of bad decisions. Well, The Cabin in the Woods does the same, but puts a twist on it. A devilishly clever twist that completely transcends the horror genre. The Cabin in the Woods is unlike anything you have ever seen.All that you really need to know going into The Cabin in the Woods is that it is about a group of friends who go to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods to party, drink, have sex, etc, etc. Naturally, things get weird, but not what you would expect. If you can guess exactly how this film will pan out then major kudos to you. But, if you actually can guess whats going on in this film then you're probably cheating. The point is, The Cabin in the Woods is fiendishly unpredictable and completely unlike any horror film you've ever seen.And, to praise this film even further, it's just plain awesome. It is so incredibly smart and so deliciously clever, combining so many different genres and doing things with these genres that we have never seen before. I have to be really vague in how I express my absolute love for this movie, because you absolutely have to see it knowing nothing about what is really going on. This way, as events unfold you will be completely floored, just as I was. The film is constantly building towards some big reveal, hinting at little things here and there that suggest what is actually going on, but still being very vague and very ambiguous about the whole thing. This brilliant subtlety to the progression of the story is what makes this film so incredibly enthralling and a non-stop roller coaster of excitement.The Cabin in the Woods is a must see. It doesn't matter what you think going into the movie. You can expect it to be awesome, you can expect it to be awful. It doesn't matter. It is a one of a kind experience and you would be a fool to miss out on it. See this movie to experience one of the most clever films I have seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"In the end, if they don't transgress they can't be punished."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how these silly horror movies go: a bunch of stupid kids get together in some cabin in the middle of nowhere, and get killed off one-by-one by some kind of scary threat. It's become such a standard formula that it's become clichéd. So here again, we have a film where a bunch of stupid kids venture into?guess where? A cabin in the woods! You just know something scary will happen to them. The key thing that makes this film stand out so much is that this isn't just a normal cabin in the woods: it's really an elaborate trap being controlled by outside forces. The kids in this film are not so much zombie-fodder as they are rats in a maze, being herded to their doom by a bunch of guys in an operations center. Reasons for that are gradually unveiled. Just as the characters use the cabin in the woods as a clever ruse for their operations, the film itself uses the cabin-in-the-woods plot mechanic as a way to lure audiences into the standard horror movie setup. Then the film pulls the carpet underneath them.In spite of this setup, the film starts off looking like a typical horror fare. To break up the monotony of watching these kids go through the motions, the film cuts back and forth between the cabin and the control room, and it intersperses some amusing dialogue throughout. By the second half, however, the film takes some very unexpected twists and turns. The climax is an incredible explosion of bloody mayhem and jaw-dropping surprises. By the film's end, I swear that it is one heck of a horror film unlike no other.Because the film takes a standard formula and builds so much around it, I give it a lot of credit for its core concept and its execution. I was left wondering why the film never once bothered to keep the control room scenario a secret; surely, it would have been a heck of a mind-bender if the audience discovered they were being controlled at the end of the film, right? I realize one thing though: done that way, audiences might have given up before reaching such a revelation, because it would have really been just the same old clichéd horror spiel. It's actually pretty brilliant how the film shows all its cards right off the bat, because it keeps the audience invested for the whole picture. With its incredible climax, it all pays off and it never once feels like its pandering or being pretentious. The characters in this film are never all that deep, but they have some very colorful personalities, and it is easy to relate to most of them. Overall, the story is simultaneously original and awesome.The film looks slick and stylish, with good photography and editing. Acting is decent: Chris Hemsworth easily steals the show, given his recent rise in reputation, and he does play a good jock. Credit should also be given to Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz, and the rest of the cast is not bad either. Writing is pretty witty at times; the overall quality is good. This production has some good looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is alright.This film takes the standard horror formula and fills it with enough surprises, humor, and originality to turn something stagnant into an enthralling thrill ride. In fact, you could say this is one of those rare films that takes an ordinary subject and makes it extraordinary. As such, it comes highly recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Good)</fullReview>

The film is set out and shown to be a typical American stereotypical horror with the usual characters being stupid and overly confident in their abilities to do things. The plot is full of twists and turns that keep you interested and the characters are interesting.

		<fullReview>I think the film is okay because it is more of a comedy instead of a horror film but I wouldn't really say it was in the top five horror films I have ever seen. It shows blood from the set up because the credits were in red and the music to represent the suspense and build up tension. It was good in the way that it was five regular city kids who were mocking the country life, but they did not know that they were in out of their depth. It was how they were isolated in the woods you knew something was wrong and it was good how the audience can see them being watched but the characters don't know what is happening. The creaking doors created suspense and the use of mirrors is typical of a horror film because it often reflects something. In this case, the two-way mirrors reflect they are unknowingly being watched because in a two-way mirror, only one person can see the other and Josh Whedon, the director, has done this quite well to symbolise the foreshadowing of what's to come. So overall, I think the film was quite good but it wasn't the best because it had too many elements of comedy to be more of a horror film but I think it was well thought out by Josh Whedon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not really a horror film. There're some gore, bloodshed, especially in the end, but that's not the essence of it. The plot is original. I find it interesting. But don't expect much from this movie. Try not to be so critical and you might enjoy this movie.(Spoilers alert)One thing I don't like is the plot sequence. They could have done it better by arranging it in the way that creates more surprises. For example, in the first scene, they show two geezers talking in a place that looks like a laboratory. Then later there's some guy talking over the radio telling someone that the teenagers were leaving. This tells us right away that the teenagers were being controlled/monitored. I would have been more fun if there had let the audience find out about it at the same time as the teenagers. Then there's a scene where a bird was flying along the RV but then got hit against an invisible wall. This made the motorcycle jumping scene a no-surprise.Put the plot sequence aside, I really like the twist at the end. When the drug addict turned out to still be alive and came to rescue the girl. Then they went to the lab and released all the monsters in there. Then those monsters just killed everyone. It's a very satisfying moment for me given that those people were entertained watching people got killed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a big fan of horror movies but usually when they're combined with comedy (like in Raimi's style of horror-comedy films like Evil Dead series)then I can usually sit through the film without having to worry when the next loud noise is gonna rocket me out of my chair into the ceiling.The film is centered around 5 teens who are going to a "cabin in the woods" until evil undead come after them one by one, but a nice twist in the film is that they are all being monitored (revealed right at the start of the film) but only till the end we find out why.It has an almost unusual plot which nicely unfolds towards the end of the film. I really enjoyed the humour put into the film which definitely separates it from being just a horror film and in a funny way, explains why weird monsters start attacking random people in other films.A moment where I almost wet my pants was the appearance of the Mer-man which was good in breaking up the film from all the lovely goriness- just goes to show Whedon knows what he's doing! There's plenty of killing and blood but also some nice humorous bits and a good plot line drives this film through till the end and i highly recommend watching it even if you're not a horror fan.</fullReview>

You can tell that a lot of work and money has been put in to create such a visually dynamic film though personally for me, I think that the ending is not at all successful and is very abrupt and confusing in a bad way compared to the rest of the film.

Not many film's released over the years are able to successfully combined an almost 'chick flick' feel shown at the start of the film to a brain teaser ending making myself and I'm sure every other person who has watched the film still trying to make sense of the true ending, whilst still laughing about the humorous characters entertaining us along the way of the violent deaths that go on as the film progresses.The reason's I loved this film is because despite the violent events and awkward sex scenes that take place, this film makes people laugh, cry, jump, and mind boggles the brain whether you enjoyed The Cabin in the Woods at all. Although the film is argued to be clich e, Chris, Kristen, Fran, Anna and Jesse all keep us on the edge of our seats despite their stereotypical characters, and make sure the scenes never carry a dull moment.A genius, complicated film but a definite must see for everyone. You cannot simply love this film or hate it; Drew Goddard makes sure there is a little piece of everyone's favourite genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical slasher film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin in the woods is at first you think your typical slasher 5 teens going into the woods and getting killed one by one. Also with the stereotype of the jock, geek, whore, drug user and virgin but it turns out completely different to other types of films such as Wrong Turn. Joss Wheldon and Drew Goddard cleverly used these stereotypes to make you think it is an ordinary slasher where they all get killed off and at first I thought it was but then once you see the bird fly into a force field, my opinion changed as it made me think something different is happening here. 'You think you know the story' the tag line of the film fits it perfectly as it completely changed the film and how I saw it. The plot of film is complex to understand to what they are doing with the 5 students but it is amazing once you realise that they need to sacrifice the students to the gods, I felt it was an original idea as I haven't seen a film like this before. Joining together horror/ comedy and sci-fi as well it worked perfectly and I really enjoyed watching the film as I didn't really know what was going to happen next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden treasure "in the woods"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dollar movie theater is usually the supreme dictator on which movies I will see. However, whenever I can go to a movie theater and see a film for free, I will always take the offer. So last Friday, I decided to watch "Cabin in the Woods" in the Meacham Auditorium of the Oklahoma Memorial Union. Besides the fact that the film was a scary movie that had not been released to DVD yet, I was in completely in the dark. I thought it was probably going to be okay, but nothing to write home about. Instead, this movie exceeded my expectations. Written by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard, and also directed by the latter, the movie tries to fool its audience into thinking that it is the stereotypical horror movie. The premise begins with five college kids who fit the scary movie archetype: the pot head, the jock, the slut, the nerd, and the virgin. They all decide to venture to a relative's sketchy cabin to blow off some steam for the weekend where the audience presumes that everybody is going to die. However, spliced between the images of these youngsters traveling to their destination and getting comfortable with each other, are scenes of workers secretly watching all of the college kids' actions. These characters discuss how "everything" rests in the fate of the five young people. Allusions, to something bigger than the workers, leave the audience guessing at every moment. Yet, the movie still brings a light-hearted comedic flare to this frightening thriller. Some might even venture to classify this as a Dark Comedy instead of a Horror film. As someone with a rather eclectic sense of humor, I actually found this movie really funny, as did the vast majority of the college-aged viewing audience. The laughs were not only in the beginning, but they traipsed all the way until the very last drop of blood was shed. And there was a lot of bloodshed. The gore in the beginning of the movie is quite light. There are a few stabbings or chokings, or mild PG-13 violence. But towards the end, there was blood everywhere, literally. In one scene, there is an entire 6six- elevator lobby with vaulted ceilings covered from head to toe in blood and guts. It was so much gore, that it was kind of tacky that it kind of cheapened the movie, even if only slightly. On the other hand, the graphic language seemed to be appropriate in most instances. I am not someone who would usually endorse any kind of vulgarity. Therefore, I believe the sexual displays were not necessary. If I had just come close to a near-death experience, my first reaction would not be to run off a little ways and have sex. Those aspects of the movie made the characters seem really fake and stupid. Conversely, the explicit words, screamed in fear or rage, conveyed the eminent danger that the characters were in. It reminded the audience that the college students were fighting for their lives, even though the workers treated the whole experience as more of a game. Although this was a terrific film with excellent execution and a brilliant plot line, I could not in good conscience recommend it to just anyone. As someone who doesn't like graphic violence, gore, sex, or language, I cannot tell someone this is a good movie unless they realize that those elements are rather prevalent in "Cabin in the Woods." This film plays off of a lot of horror movie clichés and is rumored to be as much of a genre-bender as Scream was back in the day. College students and scary movie buffs would love it. All in all, this is now one of my favorite scary movies as long as people are aware that it isn't exactly family friendly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting film - expected more though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***WARNING! Contains some spoilers! (Well, I'd consider them to be spoilers anyway, little ones. Anyway, you've been warned)*** I have a mixed opinion about this film. At the beginning, I was picking up a few clichés (i.e. the GPS in the car not recognising the location, not being able to pick up any mobile phone signal, a seedy-looking cabin, 5 city kids going into the countryside) but the plot soon took a twist and I realised that it wasn't a typical horror film. Although I really despise horror films and this particular one had so many jump-scares to even count, I found it quite gripping and found myself wanting to watch until the end (even though I'd managed to identify another terribly predictable cliché - that they'd all die one by one). One element I don't understand is the "torture" theme, we were informed of a "torture room" in the cabin and I assumed they were going to be tortured in that room as their death, but the whole idea was just forgotten really (I wouldn't really have liked to see that kind of death, I just thought it was odd). As for the ending, what even was that? It all seemed to happen so quickly and I thought it'd end differently, but I was just left wondering what I'd watched. Good film, but I expected more from it. Definitely one to watch (but if you're easily affected by jump scares like me - I'd skip it if I were you)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>finally one of the hyped flicks of 2012 that delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it with the year 2012, so many flicks are hyped and most of them I just couldn't care, we had The Hunger Games which I found boring. We had Detention which was okay for the effects but just didn't deliver what I expected from it. So a bit of anger to plug in the next hype. The Cabin In The Woods. Luckily for me this flick did deliver.But I must immediately say that I can understand why people hate it. It is an ode to the horror genre and also they laughed it loud out. Why it is an ode, face it. I see things coming straight out of The Evil Dead (1981) like the zombies being awaken by a book. I see some kind of Box used in Hellraiser (1987). I do see elements of Cube (1997) towards the end and even a bit of Wrong Turn (2003). And there's even so much more like the white masks, or the way the killer zombie looked. When we go to Japan, that also rings a bell. So much of an ode.But it never gave me some jumpscene's. You can see things coming from miles away and on the other hand there are things that you say, wow, what a surprise. And even one actress is here to see as a big surprise. Naturally being filed under horror you do need like in the old school horrors the whore, the dummy, the smart ass and so on. We do have it here, we even had a bit of nudity from Anna Hutchison (Jules). And of course our female heroin.The acting did also give it an upgrade. They all looked believable but be aware that some do exaggerate because it's needed in a comedy/horror like this. On part of the comedy I didn't laughed it out that much, there's one scene with the titties that is funny but that's it for me.The effects are amazing in some scene's and the end, well, that's were people discussing about. You like it or you hate it. All horror creatures ever released are watchable in The Cabin In The Woods. I loved it and finally one hyped flick of 2012 did deliver. Never that gory at all. But still one to see as a horror buff.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0,5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overall a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin In the Woods is a twist on the classic horror film, it has the 5 stereotypical characters a horror film contains, the virgin, the alpha- male, the flirtatious girl, the drug-addict and the geek. It has a clever, unexpected narrative that gets a little confusing towards the middle, but as the story comes to a close, it is all explained and easily worked out. The film also has a sort of conspiracy theory to it, which makes the film intriguing and makes you want to find out what happens in the end.However i wouldn't say this film is much of a horror, it doesn't lack the gore, however it does lack the scares that make you jump, which i think let this film down a little. Overall this is a good film, with a fascinating story line, well worth the watch and i would recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find this movie very interesting. I've seen some other reviews about it, but I don't seem to agree with any. "The Cabin in the woods" is above the average, is more of a sci fi/ Horror to me. If you're expecting a terrifying movie, there are probably scarier options for you. People say this movie is very original, I'm sorry I just find it kind of similar to hunger games. Is more or less the same concept. You will know what I'm talking about if you seen both. Oh this movie brought some "look like" characters from other horror movies. That was cool. This movie could be a 10000x better, but overall and even though the acting isn't perfect and the director could have done a better job with it, this movie is fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Most logical Horror ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen tens of Horror movies, lot of them were more scary than "The Cabin in the Woods" but this film has something more than the others. First of all that's the logic. Most films don't describe logic of those all killings in the movie. They just happen. But the Cabin in the Woods gives us an explanation why could someone turn a murder into a spectacular show. When I saw the final part of the film I was like "wait, what was that?" and surprisingly I liked what I found out.Secondly you never disappoint while watching the movie. The initial victims are not the only people fighting for survival, but even guys from underworld - who watch the death scenes of major characters - have to stay alive. So, it's 1 of the most fascinating, interesting, attaching horror of past decade and highly recommended to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror fan's wet dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to review this film without giving things away. This alone should tell you that the movie is good. There is no cliché story and then a twist, so I can tell you the story and let you discover the twist. It's all twisted, so to speak.So let me tell you what this film isn't. It is not a prepackaged recipe that you know by heart but you still like to eat the end result. It is not a cinema starfest and/or an ego trip for some writer or director. The people in the leading roles are mostly TV series actors (except for Thor) while the people in the supporting roles are people we've known and loved for a while now. The film is not a bait and switch. Even if the explanation comes slowly, it does come. There are hints of what is going on all over the film even from the start. Nobody is dreaming stuff or is actually dead and doesn't know it or all that crap. What you see is what you get (even if it is not the same for the characters). There is no gratuitous humour or gore, but there is plenty of both.Bottom line: finally something original in horror movies. In a way, this is a meta movie: it explains all horror movies ever made and then laughs in the face of their predictability. "It's time to give someone else a chance" is a quote from the film and, I think, it was meant for the movie makers. All in all, a very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

I can briefly say if you don't like old style horror movies and enjoyed watching drag me to hell,hunger games,silent hill etc. you really should watch this one!it's worth your time. it's not just a teen horror movie full of sexual scenes,it has a good story and a great ending. i cant understand why lots of people commented so bad about the movie, are you serious guys? i was about to believe your comments,i'm glad i just didn't. so it's not for oldies i guess!</fullReview>

Every character is a parody of stereotypes in generic horror films and it is making fun of outlandish typical plots found in such film. I never thought I'll ever use the word original with a spoof movie but this movie is just that! If you are a horror movie buff(specially an evil dead fan), get ready for a ride filled with ingenuity, uniqueness and immense fun! Joss Whedon is fast becoming a guy to watch out for and follow in Hollywood whether he is writing or directing! He already made a name for himself with Buffy TV series and just continues to impress in whatever role he takes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A jock and his gorgeous, promiscuous girl drag their roommates and pot head friend up to a creepy, secluded cabin in the woods. Have we seen this before? Yes and no.The story is NOT your average slasher teen movie. It would be wrong to say there is anything brand new here, but the way it is put together and the quirky way it is executed is.Instead of some big reveal at the end the story unfolds slowly allowing the viewer to discover the background story in a gratifying way.A lot of the characters (even background players) are professionally fleshed out quickly and efficiently. This is all part of good story telling for me.Production values, camera, lighting all very good so even the moments of awful CGI can be forgiven.Don't let a sloppy review spoil this movie as the journey of discovery is half the fun with this great little movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but left me still unsure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hard movie to review without giving away to much. I came into this film expecting a typical, run of the mill teen slasher which I am not a big fan of. It most certainly wasn't that, and for that reason I was pleasantly(?} surprised.The movie finished and I really couldn't decide if I had liked what I saw or not. I didn't feel like my time had been wasted though, and I suppose I actually was quite entertained... but did I like it? I'm still not sure.The movie doesn't take itself seriously and is a lot of fun. It takes the chance to laugh at itself. Now, a film that tries to laugh itself will either leave you with that little smile and inner 'nod' to let yourself acknowledge that you 'saw what they did there' or it will fail miserably and the movies failure to tell the joke, becomes the joke. The Cabin In The Woods just about pulls it off.Keep an open mind, even within the realms of a horror or supernatural, you must keep an open mind. TCITW will take you on a journey from what you think the film should be to a place far, far 'out there'. This is a positive, I think the originality of the writing is what kept me entertained and one thing is for sure, TCITW is 100% original! I'm giving The Cabin In Woods a 7/10. I probably enjoyed it more than I didn't hence a 6/10 taking it just over a neutral score, plus an extra 1 mark for originality.This movie will split people, you'll either love it or hate it (or be undecided like me), but you need to see it to chose your side. There are worse things to waste an hour and a half on...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your average horror movie... with a twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has nothing going for it. 7.2 (as of 20/08/2012)? That's a complete joke. At the start you see some old men having a laugh and ignoring a woman at a facility. One word.... standard. You then get shown to two teenage girls talking about Dana's affair with a professor, and followed by her friend's boyfriend. The guy throws a an American football through the window and his friend (Holden) that he hooked up for Dana catches the ball over a car that beeps at him, too cheesy for my liking. After that they go to their RV and you see a friend Marty smoking from a bong that constructively comes out of his car to join the friends. I give props because that was something I wasn't expecting, a person being high. Yeah great! (sarcasm) Fast forward a bit and they stop at an unused warehouse because they need fuel for their crappy RV. An old man then starts spitting out what I believe blood furiously asks what they're doing and the group ask for directions to their final destination. The old guy tells them and he allows them to take the fuel, but calls Jules a whore. Curt is upset by that but is stopped by the group before any trouble arises. Curt throws his money at the old man and the group drive off. Back to the facility and you see that the people are waging for what creature is going to be appear tonight. I felt weird seeing it for some reason it didn't appeal to me as it could have. The gang finally arrive at the cabin and Dana goes to undress in her room but Holden sees through a window that is Dana's mirror so she can't see him but he can see her. At first it seems like Holden likes it (pervert) but then decides NEIN hold up now. The rest of the group make sure that there isn't any more of these types of mirrors, and Holden and Dana decide to switch rooms. I skip ahead to the "good" part. Curt and Jules get freaky in the dark woods outside about to have sex and a zombie stabs Jules in the hand and she starts to scream like a girl, proper annoying, at this point I was NOT scared just upset they couldn't find something that would make me jump. The zombie beheads Jules. Curt was in the midst of the attack and gets seriously injured and bloodied but somehow manages to run back to the cabin (absolutely unrealistic) to warn the others. Dana doesn't believe that Jules has "gone" until her head is thrown to her through the front door by a zombie. They separate and Marty sees a camera and realises they're being set-up. He gets murdered by a zombie. As the rest are able to escape the building. They are able to get back half way through and the cliffs begin to break because at the facility everything is controlled. Curt tries to jump the gap with his dirt bike but hits an electronic field which looks so bad as all you can see is a black figure and a bike falling. So it's down to Holden and Dana to survive. Holden drives the RV back (don't know what the point is) and gets stabbed through the neck by a zombie, (I don't know how the zombie got in in the first place). The RV crashes and Dana still manages to survive. Absolute mind boggle how a girl is able to survive a zombie attack. She's about to die while "amazingly" Marty returns and whacks the zombie off Dana, this adds to this movie's unrealistic factor. At the end we get told why they were killed. Overall I would score this a 6/10 because of exciting twist at the end that I didn't spoil because I know this isn't the synopsis but I wanted to share my feelings with each scene. The ending is quite good so watch it for a surprise ending! There are far more better reviews to come, HSRMJ. P.S I won't be doing more of these synopsis. Sorry to my loyal fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie in existence. Do not watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cabin In The Woods is, no doubt in my mind, the absolute worst film ever created. I saw it listed as a top horror movie or whatever on Netflix. If that isn't the biggest insult to the genre there is, then I don't know what could possibly be worse. It was such a disgrace, and I felt so betrayed by Netflix, that I have not used its services since. I was that angry. I feel like it was written as it was being filmed, and haven't the slightest clue what kind of person would throw away money by backing this ridiculous piece of crap. To whomever they paid off to defend this crappy movie, suddenly saying that it's a comedy or satire, just so you won't feel so embarrassed about how terribly stupid it is, is just as stupid as calling it a horror. It wasn't funny, it wasn't scary, not suspenseful, or thrilling, or good in any sense of the word. If you took all the deleted scenes from a series of half star films, and strung them together into a film of its own, it would still be better than Cabin In the Woods. The plot(s) was/were poor, if there even is a/are plot(s), and not just a bunch of random bad ideas thrown together like scrabble chips at a wall. The characters were so unbelievably annoying, unrealistic, and poorly portrayed. I have to wonder if the actors had any prior experience in acting other than playing a tree in the first grade school play. Come to think of it, did anyone associated with this garbage have any experience that isn't bad, or do they all just do mad libs, and turn it into a movie? What was with all the boring monsters? Did they realize their movie sucked, and thought more monsters would make it better, or was someone incorporating their fear of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase when all the masked villains go after them at the end? I have so many questions about this "movie," but I sincerely don't want to know the "answers," as they are probably all bs anyway. If somebody paid me to watch this, I would've walked out and demanded they get a refund. I watched it free, and wanted a refund of the time and energy I wasted watching it. If you thought for a second that this was horror while watching it, then I am positive that you're either the kind of person that only watches Hallmark Channel movies, or you only go to see G rated movies, and cry before the previews are even over because you're so sensitive. If you thought it was funny, then I would suspect that you are entertained by even the most mundane things. This was not entertainment. This was cruel and unusual punishment, and I would not wish it on the most disgusting human being alive. The only recommendations I can give concerning it, is the recommendation that all copies of it be destroyed, no one speak of it again, and everyone associated with its creation be banned from the entertainment industry. I cannot stress enough just how much this film angers me, how much I hate it, and how regretful I am that I was exposed to it. I give this film no stars. It is undeserving of the chance to earn any stars. I'm only giving it one star on this site because that is the lowest option available, and no, it doesn't even deserve a gold star because it tried. It didn't try, at all. Lastly, IMDb, the ratings I see here are ridiculous. If anything, it discredits you. If such trash can receive a high rating here, what other filth is being passed off as good?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All War is Class War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have concluded that, within this film, Whedon and Goddard are simply cleverly manipulating the horror genre. However, upon further investigation, we discover a thoroughly political film.First, a plot summary: a group of young people representing certain types must be sacrificed in a particular order every year in order to appease the old gods who slumber beneath the earth. If this is accomplished, the gods return to their slumber. If it is not accomplished, the gods will rise and destroy humanity.Halfway through, we have followed a standard genre pattern ? only we covered the ground quickly and we are at the point where another movie might end. All but one of the young people has been reported dead, and the office workers are having a party. Dana, "the virgin," is not dead yet, but she doesn't need to die to appease the gods.At the office party, people start drinking and flirting, while Dana is on TV screens in the background being murdered. The violence that is depicted here is the most realistic in the film. A young woman is being beaten to death by a large man.Initially, I thought this scene was doing something comparable to films like "Martyrs" ? causing the viewer to question why she chooses to view this sort of violence. If I am bothered by the juxtaposition shown in the film, what does this say about me and the pleasure I derive from watching this myself? But more is going on. The more sustained point of comparison for this scene is not the viewing of this film. This scene is actually targeting the ways in which we react to the deaths of those who are executed in the War on Terror. It mimics videos taken of people celebrating in Times Square when Osama's assassination was announced. This film is a criticism of the War on Terror. We don't sacrifice people to appease "the old gods" but we do torture and murder people in order to defend "freedom" or "democracy." We still sacrifice people to save the world. And we celebrate those deaths when they occur.Sceptical? Consider this: at the end of the movie, Marty and Dana are confronted by the Director of the operation. She argues that they need to die or humanity will be destroyed. Marty replies:"Maybe that's the way it should be. If you gotta kill all my friends to survive, maybe it's time for a change."Dana agrees with Marty and states: it is time to "give someone else a chance."The connection to the War on Terror is that we are led to question what "humanity" is and who gets to define who is "human." This conclusion is prompted by earlier events, when the office workers bet on which monster(s) will be selected. Later, somebody tries to cash in on the prize by pointing out that she picked zombies. A manager responds: "you had zombies. But this is 'Zombies Redneck Torture Family'? They're entirely separate species. It's like the difference between the elephant and the elephant seal." This is critical. The Buckners are more than zombies. They are a family of low-income uneducated people. The Buckners, and then the rest of the monsters, represent the global poor. These are the people whose humanity we refuse to recognize.Perhaps Marty and Dana are right to reject the option presented to them. In our world, it is not humanity that will perish should our sacrificial system collapse. It is those who have imposed an hegemonic and exclusionary definition of humanity, and reaped the rewards they gained from sacrificing others, who stand to fall ? all others will gain.A final point about the office workers: generally, in horror films, when we become aware of hidden cameras the identity of the watcher is a secret and, when revealed, this person usually ends up being a sexual predator/sadist/psychopath. Here, we know the identity of the people behind the cameras from the beginning ? they are regular office workers. They don't enjoy their work but it needs to be done. Cracks appear momentarily, like when a manager expresses sympathy for Dana, but they are quickly masked by calls for alcohol. Like the rest of us, confronting what we do and our complicity in violence (even if we believe that violence is justified) is too difficult to do ? let's get drunk instead.Truman matters here. He is new to the job and asks the same questions that the audience has so we identify with him. Like us, he is a good person. He displays integrity. He states that he has been prepped on what the project entails but has trouble accepting it. Consequently, when everybody is joking or partying, he is conflicted.However, crucially, Truman holds his post. He questions things but still sides with the project managers. Here, the film exposes the truth about the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves. We do not participate directly in the enslavement of children in sweatshops, or in the slaughter of Afghanis, but we do know that these things happen with our indirect support. Yet, rather than changing what we do, we simply question things? and this allows us to feel like good people. We are Truman and even if we express discomfort with what we do, we still do it very well.This film exposes the War of Terror for what it is: the violent defence of the propertied classes against the global poor whom we sacrifice in order to sustain an order that privileges the humanity and opulence of a select few. We are all implicated in this. Consequently, Marty and Dana conclude that we must cease the violent sacrifice of others, which sustains the order of our world. And if we do this and the oppressed rise up, we should not think twice about the fact that they may destroy us to make the world new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grand Fusion Of Lovecraft And Clive Barker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>H.P. Lovecraft often referred to in his books about beings called the "Elder Ones" which existed before man ever walked the Earth. He also mentioned an entity known as "Cthulhu" whose name could not even be mentioned by humans as they did not possess the vocal anatomy needed. By fully canting this entity's name, it would be awoken from its primordial slumber and begin to devour all life. In this film the Elder Ones are called the "Ancient Ones", and they have to be appeased from time to time by a ritualistic human sacrifice in order to prevent the destruction of the world. This film has some awesome special effects that has to be seen to be believed. The special effects are by AFX Studios, and close to a 140 people were working on these effects. The special effects really kick in during the last 35 minutes of the film, so if you want to skip to the special effects, just forward an hour of the film.The plot of the film closely resembles Sam Raimi's Evil dead film, but it ends up very differently. College students Dana Polk, Holden McCrea, Marty Mikalski, Jules Louden, and her boyfriend Curt Vaughan go to a remote cabin in the woods for a vacation. During the night, when they are partying, the cellar door unexpectedly opens and they all go in to explore. What happens next is for you to find out! The casting of the film is dubious, but the special effects more than make up for the dull cast. Chris Hemsworth the only notable actor is totally wasted(no pun intended!) in the film. Movies Based On H.P. Lovecraft: From Beyond, The Dunwich Horror, Necronomicon: Book of Dead, Dagon, The Unnamable 1&amp;2, Cool Air, Re-animator Trilogy, The Thing On The Doorstep &amp; Dreams In The Witch House(Masters Of Horror TV Series Episode).Movies Based On Clive Barker Books: Hellraiser, Lord Of Illusion, Raw Head Rex, The Midnight Meat Train, Nightbreed, Candyman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People are weary of the same tired formula that's propelled horror movies since the slasher renaissance of the early '80s. With this in mind, writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard set out to pen something unique?something that would utterly shock audiences and absolutely lambaste the conventions of the modern horror film. With The Cabin in the Woods, the ably accomplish this task. The otherwise mundane title nicely hides the fact that moviegoers are in for an experience so unorthodox?and, at times, so downright bizarre?that they'll likely stagger out of the theater scratching their heads in an attempt to make sense of what essentially boils down to one hour and thirty-five minutes of unadulterated chaos.The Cabin in the Woods is a tricky little number to review in that I can't really discuss the plot in much dept because of the very great risk of ruining some of the more shocking revelations that define its second half. Still, right from the opening credits the movie doesn't hide the fact that it's trying something new. Viewers are thrust into a sterile setting that finds two lab technicians chattering about trifles that don't mesh with what anyone setting into their seats would expect. This is a good thing, as it sets the tone from the beginning: "I'm going to be straightforward with you, dear viewer," the flick suggests, "but don't think I won't pull any punches along the way."After the initial confusion tapers, the standard horror routine plays out: a group of college-age supermodels descends on a rickety cabin in the middle of nowhere. They're primed and ready for a weekend filled with booze, drugs, unprotected sex, so on and so forth. They also exhibit the personas one would expect in just this sort of offering: there's a jock, a slutty vixen, a stoner, a goodie-two shoes who's hesitant to do anything remotely dangerous, etc. The usual hijinks occur for the next several scenes, and then we're catapulted back into the lab environment and given a deeper understanding of what's really happening. From this point on, all hell breaks loose (almost literally).While the charm of the movie's originality is undeniable?and it's penchant for juvenile humor is greatly appreciated?there's something a little forced about the whole thing that (in my mind, at least) doesn't elevate it to the echelons of cinematic gold that movies like Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil are able to obtain. As stated earlier, Cabin is meant to vaporize all notions of the modern horror movie, and it mostly succeeds. Surprisingly, the complex nature of the plot eventually begins to backfire. You'll find yourself trying to connect dots that are much too difficult?or, even worse, can't?be connected, and there's the sense that a crucial narrative element is absent.In fact, I'm still trying to pin down what this is, exactly, and this is problematic.This can be forgiven, though, when the comedic-gratuitousness of the third act hits the fan. It's unrestrained brutality, our worst nightmares made tangible in the form of a brew-ha-ha that will leave you speechless. If ever there were a slam-bang ending, what we get with the finale of Cabin is just that.So, in that regard, the movie is a success. Still, there's the sense that it could have been put together just a little more effectively, and that might be what ultimately defines this fine exercise in reworking a genre that's suffered from tedium for far</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I detract points from this only because Bradley Whitford's death is too quick, and comes too late (has there ever been a more smarmy, pompous type?). But, seriously - thanks to the Whedon wit, this is a really fine and surprising horror film. It is well-paced, well-directed, and well- acted. More importantly, the story holds up, as unreal as it is. The genius of the film, in fact, is how it presents exactly how realistically such an other-worldly scenario would play out, with arrogant humans at the controls and partying a wee bit too early. There is slasher gore, which I detest, but it's strangely just fine, as the sheer creativity of the array of beasts at the end overrides gore. A personal satisfaction: Sigourney Weaver getting axed by Zombie Patience. As much as I adore 'Alien', she is a crummy actress who has somehow been perceived as a good one, and choosing her for that dominatrix role was brilliant. It's been a long, long time since I feel like I can heartily recommend a horror movie. Thanks, Joss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can't make one movie that will appeal to everyone. Even within a genre there's always going to be people hating or loving something that the majority thinks is obviously the complete opposite. This isn't "true" horror, it does have a lot of comedy, it also has a lot of wit. There are quite a few nods and there are many little things "hidden" in the subtext or out in the open for people to discover. Even simple things as the "running upstairs" cliché gets a spin (or at least I think it does. But with Joss Wheddon on script duties, I'm pretty sure this was no mere accident).Talking about clichés, you do get a few, but those clichés are there and they are always getting a spin that works. It doesn't look like Joss tries to make it work. He just makes it work. And while I did stress out the comedy factor, this still pulls some scares and does get dirty and bloody. Not for the faint hearted then.This warrants repeat viewings, just to catch even more hints, jokes and just pure Wheddon magic (for me at least). I went to watch it with high expectations (the buzz surrounding it) and I wasn't disappointed in the least!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so all that i had heard about this movie was that some teens get trapped somewhere in the middle of nowhere with someone controlling they're fate... so in my head almost every horror movie ever. This was not the case however. Before watching this i thought they could'NT make zombies creepy... oops. That part where the zombie is walking in the background just about made me yell at the screen. I have always been a werewolf fan so when i realized that every Urban legend monster ever was in this I was on the look out and i was not disappointed, again the background scenes are almost as much fun to watch as the main movie. I think they could have done a better job with the ending but if the writer wanted to end it as everyone dieing then they gave us such a good movie its completely up to them to end it they way they want. I always look for comical stuff in horror films and this movie is full of it so if your looking for a awesome horror/fun movie this is it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two babes (Kristen Connolly and Anna Hutchison); two hunks (Chris Hemsworth and Jesse Williams); one stoner (Fran Kranz); a weekend in a creepy old cabin by a lake: sounds like all the ingredients for a typically gruesome teen horror, doesn't it? Well, that's precisely what Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard want you to think, except that there is absolutely nothing 'typical' about this film.The initial set up will be familiar to most, but with the early introduction of a group of sinister scientists keeping tabs on events at the cabin (via some sophisticated surveillance equipment), it soon becomes apparent that things aren't as they might at first seem. As the film unfolds, Whedon and Goddard seize every opportunity to play with the conventions of the genre and mess with their viewers' expectations; the result is a whole lot of demented fun, something that I can only describe as 'The Evil Dead meets Lost'.To give away anything further about the plot would be to ruin your enjoyment, so I'll keep schtum and leave you to discover the secrets of The Cabin In The Woods by yourself. Suffice to say that the film delivers all of the standard horror movie clichés (a dark cellar full of bizarre objects, sex in the woods, a creepy gas station attendant, etc.,) but what it does with them takes the film into refreshingly new horror territory where the standard rules of the genre simply do not apply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining vision of hell on earth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched The Cabin In The Woods, I knew nothing about it and it was a real surprise.I've watched a lot of horror films over the last 35 years and this one combines elements of some of my all-time favourites such as The Evil Dead, Hellraiser and Suspiria. While I wouldn't put The Cabin In The Woods in the same bracket at those classics it's not that far short.The cast, including Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins, seem to be having a fun time in amongst all the nonsense, and the cameo at the end introducing The Director put a huge smile on my face.Once hell is released on earth, and all the monsters/demons/zombies are released from their cages/rooms. it really is great to see such a horror film fanboy's wish-list of mayhem and destruction on screen.While it's a real mishmash of films gone by, The Cabin In The Woods certainly one of the most entertaining horror films of the last decade, and well worth a look for horror fans who appreciate a fast-paced action-packed film, with some WTF moments and plenty of laughs along the way.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of this review is "no spoilers" not only because I won't spoil anything for you, but also because you should definitely go into to this movie, knowing as little about it as possible.What you need to know is that this movie is WEIRD and it will divide people, some will love it for being so different and crazy, others will hate it and just think it's stupid.If you want to get the most out of this movie, don't label it a horror, Slasher, comedy, thriller, adventure film, because it is none of these and yet it has elements of many different genres.You get a feeling of classic Whedon with this movie, and if you like what he's done in the past, you will most likely like this one as well. It often feels like one of the crazier episodes of "Buffy the vampire slayer" if it had been a full length movie, that is all you need to know.This really is a great movie, but you have to be able to let the movie step out of the box you normally define genre movie by, and just accept the weirdness of this tale. If you do then you might just love it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of such genre. I have enjoyed "The Others", "The Ring" and etc. But this one was so boring. No horror. The idea was good but poorly played. For year 2011, something like this is completely out of line.The only good thing was the very end when the hand came out from earth, so you could verify the reason for killings and identify the "costumer" for whole the sacrifices. Also, at the end, Weaver act was not logical. If she knew that something bad happens if the fool boy is not killed, then she should do that herself. instead, she was trying to tell the story behind the killings, and she died without a good effect. Another strange point was when the boy told "we should stay together" but a gas was sent into the room to change his mind. This was ridiculous!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about a group of teenagers going to a cabin for the weekend. The cabin is in hands of a company engineers who creatively want to kill these teenagers. They keep an eye on them with cameras.Now I like horror movies, this was not a horror movie. It was more a comedy than a horror. Yes, there were zombies, big snakes and even a Pinhead like character in it, but they did not really scare much. I more liked the two engineers dancing in the beginning of the movie. That was funny.The special effects were awesome. The story was not what I expected and that's a plus. I really got surprised all the time. The movie goes to places where you don't expect it to go. That makes the movie not predictable. It's like the movie makers deliberately wanted to make the movie unpredictable. Like they have studied what is predictable and what isn't so they could write a script around it with a so called horror genre beneath it.Acting was OK, not really that great. This blonde girl acted from the beginning very confusing; saying this and meaning that thinking it is funny. No, it is confusing. Then seeing Thor driving with a motorcycle against a wall, was killing. Movie was entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The short: B grade with A grade production; different; great writing; lacklustre ending (you'll see what I mean).The long: Starts great, very inventive, funny etc. Some plot holes here and there, but they're more than made up for with the writing. A very different take on the horror genre that parodies itself as much as it tells a (semi) serious story.The direction is excellent. I don't know if that's the work of the director (never heard of him before) or Joss Wheedon (overrated), but, it's done very well. For the most part. I'll get to that later.Starts off with some young (although not overly hot, unfortunately) young-uns off into the wilderness for some weekend away. The "horror" build-up is done very well. Great direction. Great jokes. Usual clichés etc, but done very well, and lightheartedly, which works so well that you don't really notice them. It's also got a seemingly bizarre subplot spliced into it, so it keeps you guessing for a while.The first real let-down is the choice of baddies. Although the idea is handled very well, they really fail to create any tension, which drags the film down significantly. The parody of horror films is excellent. Because of the way the writer is revealing bits and pieces here and there, you know that something is afoot, and the zombies (I know, I spoiled it) just don't work well. I'm not sure what would have worked better, but it's not scary, which unfortunately serves to let the film down. The writer (director and Wheedon) are treading the line between the story and their upcoming twists, but they didn't put enough into the horror part of it. You start to see the first signs of the B gradiness (of the story) at this point. I figured out what was going on about 2/3 of the way in, which wasn't too hard, but there's enough interesting twists to keep you entertained nevertheless.The ending though? It just fails to gain the tension it should have had. It's not that it's overly different from the rest of the film in tone, but that's the problem. It should have really kicked into high-gear horror mode at this point, but it stays kind of casual and flat. They really needed to hype up the scare factor and the mood, but it just kind of sails along a bit too casually.Different film, well made, great writing, 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior comedy horror movie. 85%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're after a horror movie, this probably isn't for you. It's way too arch for that. The genre is mercilessly battered to a pulp in this movie. So, if you enjoyed movies like "Scream" or "Evil dead II", this will be just the ticket for you! Might I also recommend "In the mouth of madness" as a good example of a postmodern horror movie?Anyway, seeing this movie's title might lead you to have certain expectations as to what it's like. These are met...but with a twist. Even the opening scene is a spanner in the works...people in lab coats or whatnot. So, basically, you get two different settings...the young adults in that cabin in the woods, and some mysterious people in a high tech facility who are in some way connected to their fates.The movie does meet certain horror movie clichés...gore happens, as does a sex scene where you get to see boobies and everything!!Anyway, where this movie sets itself apart from its brethren is the whole 'high tech facility' component to its story. The workers there function - you could say - as a Greek chorus on what transpires in that cabin...which is in the woods (for those who weren't concentrating!). Perhaps they could also be stand-ins for the kind of people who make horror movies...the ones parodied in this movie. In any case, they provide a meta-narrative for the genre as a whole...or a meta-explanation for the raison d'?tre of the world depicted in any such horror movie. If you think horror movies are just an excuse for the ritual sacrifice of pretty young things, well, this film has something to say on this.If I do have some quibbles with this movie, they are minor...like the mysterious guy you see as the pretty young things leave in their van for that cabin...which is in the woods. He seems pretty redundant. There's also a scene which I think overplays the whole "high tech" aspect to the story...I'd like to pretend that the horror story could be real (!) but the bit with the eagle near the start of the movie just made me think that this was set in some alternative universe. Lastly, you see a name actor near the end of the movie. It's entirely self-conscious...the acting and the use of the actor.As Joss Whedon is a major player in the making of this movie, you do expect a lot of liberties to be taken with genre forms. Fortunately he delivers. The dialogue and situations are frequently funny and the performances are engaging. And it is so whilst picking at the scab of the genre's conventions.For some reason I thought that Fran Kranz had an Owen Wilson vibe to his look/performance. He plays the stoner "Marty". I like how his comments in the van at the start of the movie bookend with what happens at the end of the movie. Anna Hutchison (as "Jules") has a "That's just wrong!" scene...she's quite the foxey lady though! I did get a laugh out of the comments concerning the outcome in Japan. My pop cultural references didn't extend to knowing the deal with the Sugar Plum Fairy. Must have missed that episode.Anyway, I think this is a funny movie with repeat viewing potential. I missed the start of it and watched the start of the next session to catch up on it...some of it still made me laugh.</fullReview>

When five friends plan a weekend getaway to a secluded cabin things start off as planned. While relaxing at night they hear a strange sound, when the go off to investigate all hell breaks loose. One by one the friends begin to get killed off, then things start to get out of control. I have to admit that based off the few previews I saw this was not what I expected. I did enjoy it and it was a fun movie to watch though. The thing that kind of depressed me though is that this type of thing may not be that far away from reality. While there is the clichéd slasher movie aspects in this it is not your typical slasher type movie. This one had equal parts comedy and horror. That combination may turn off a lot of horror fans, but to me that made it a really fun experience. If you are looking for a true horror/slasher like "Friday the 13th" this is not it. If you are looking for a good time and a horror you can laugh at then this is what you are looking for. Overall, a very fun experience. A comedy/horror that is worth checking out.

		<shortDescription>Refreshing take on horror...Or horror/comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What this is, is a refreshing take on the horror genre because of the twist in the movie. You can see the twist sort of in the beginning but you won't entirely know exactly what is going on until it comes close to the end. This takes the very generic aspects of horror slasher flicks and sort of takes jabs at it in a fun way. Even all the college students are very generic to the horror genre. The pop culture horror elements are in this but not so it can head in a very generic slasher flick direction. This has been done before but it doesn't seem outdated at all so far. But it all has purpose, well majority of it. I can't really talk much about this movie cause it can ruin it for the viewers. But what I will did find a bit shocking is how the movie is a bit more humorous than scary. It's not like "Shaun of the Dead" funny but some situations are so awkward it gets pretty darn funny. Now I wasn't laughing hysterically throughout this movie but the humor actually blends in pretty well with the horror aspect of it. What first leads to a generic slasher flick with all the generic slasher flick elements leads to much more. I rarely watch slasher flicks more than once but this one I might see again. It's a good thing the trailer didn't give much of anything away which is rare for trailers now a days.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable tongue-in-cheek analysis of the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before somebody told me that this movie had more clockwork beneath the surface than just a goofy horror movie, I had no intention of seeing it. When I finally did get to see it, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome.What you get when you see this move is a critical analysis of the whole horror movie scene. Even the title "Cabin in the Woods" is a cliché ribbing of generic horror films.The major difference between "Cabin in the Woods" and other horror-movie parodies such as "Scream" or "Scary Movie", is that this one does it with a sense of flair and imagination that it adds a new level to seeing a film, by asking the question; "What if there's more to the story than meets the eye?" The characters are stock as far as horror movies go. There's a jock, a promiscuous young woman, a pure and innocent girl, a nice guy with strong morals, and the quintessential stoner.When you watch this film, pay attention to the imagery used, such as the symbol which appears on a necklace and on the floor of the stone chamber. This and other symbols tell us that there is more going on in this movie than is ever told to us.Best thing of all about this movie? It actually gives you some thrills! It still managed to be a genuinely eerie movie, even though it is really just slanting the entire genre.The actors, whose rolls don't necessarily need to be acted to perfection, do a decent enough job. These are not rolls that were meant to be played with 100% conviction and seriousness, and that does come across.The basic story is, Five teenagers take an RV to an old run-down cabin and get more than they bargain for. And the cows go moo, and the guy gets the girl, and blah-blah-blah you've seen it before.Don't go into this movie expecting anything, but do take it all in. This is not the kind of horror movie you pop in while trying to fumble through your dates sweater buttons. Sit down, and watch the movie. If you enjoy films as much as I do, you will appreciate this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a pretty well done ode to the classic kids in the woods horror genre that has been done to death. We all know the plot and the characters of the film and instantly recognize what they shouldn't be doing. At the same time it's an interesting send up of formulaic horror films and pokes our culture of reality television and faux drama in the eye.Certainly, a different spin on the classic group in the mystery machine, goes off into the woods. However, it also had a lot of similarities with that same sort of Scooby Dooesque ending, where you are waiting for the unmasking, to see it was actually old man Hawkins, who wanted to scare everyone off, so he could sell the land for fracking.check out our full review at 3guys1movie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The stoner's collapsible bong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clever not so much in the obvious way it is put together - self-aware horror laced with commentary on the process - but in terms of dynamics present in the work. We need to trace that all the way back to the authors in control of the thing.Three-layered structure is pretty ordinary these days. The base layer is a blatant Evil Dead scenario with teenagers spending the weekend in an old cabin in the woods. From their end, until a certain point, they experience around them the typical supernatural horror film, where reality is chaotic and reading out loud the wrong incantation in Latin means things go bump in the dark.The twist; a second level where things going bump are controlled from. This is where the audience gets together to hedge bets before the big screen playing our film, it's also the writers' level where plot and effects are decided, where all the clichés of the previous level are contrived to happen; the slutty behavior, the illogical decisions, the panic, the voices dictating action. There are many stations like ours we come to find, each one supervising its own horror film and similarly attempting control of the outcome. There is talk of another level for the Director. We find out that all the other stations have failed, even the Japanese (!), and it falls on our guys to see through their horror film.A third layer is ancient evil lurking in the bowels of the earth and imminent world destruction, you should know this is all effect.Now this sort of structure where an audience decides upon violence that we have paid to enjoy is so commonplace, last year it was the subject of the latest Hostel installment. There is little fun here.No, all of the fun is watching the thing collapse upon itself. Superficially, it is all about mayhem that comes from loss of narrative control. My ongoing project is a study of film mechanics, in the assumption that every effect and device in the way we imagine stories is semi-consciously modeled after functions of the mind. So it's important to me to get to note why this works the way it does. We'll need to follow this a bit more closely.Now the collapse is the direct result of something really contrived happening which the writers in control of the film either overlooked or could not solve; an ordinary plot point goes awry, the most predictable victim has made it through, and in the most outrageous manner, by single-handedly tearing to pieces an all-powerful redneck zombie. You will note this narrative glitch as an actual glitch in the electronics in the second floor. You will also note the stoner carries with him a bong, a bong that collapses in three layers to become indistinguishable.So this is the stuff that movies are made from, one of those purely cinematic illusions hat hinge their entire effect - a good time - on having you buy the most incredulous action - think Tom Cruise in MI4.And since the deeper drive here is a battle between chaos and order, between instincts and control of them, between a narrative and authorship of it, you should not fail to notice that chaos in the film runs rampant not because the physically impossible was achieved - stoner tears apart redneck zombie - but because the mind responsible for a coherent story lost focus and wandered.So of course the film breaks and all sorts of fragments from monster stories are unleashed. The collapse means a helluva time for the viewer but an end of the world inside the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Funny, and a lil' scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie. I saw it, and I enjoyed it.Cabin in the woods is about a group of kids who decide that it'd be fun to hang out in a cabin in the middle of the woods. Already on their way there, they discover some unnerving informations, but like all horror movie teens, ignore it.What follows is a funny, conscious, and fresh take on the horror movie. Most horror movies with teens usually feature a psychopath murdering away at teenagers who are ignorant as hell and don't stand a chance.I'm not saying that this isn't, and I'm not saying it is, but I am saying that it is worth checking out. It has a great cast, great acting, clever writing, some genuine thrills n' horror, and makes some twists and turns that you don't see coming. Definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked the first two scream movies two films that pushed how far the horror genre can go by making fun of it by pointing out its flaws.Cabin in the woods bring a total different approach to the horror genre by answering all those horror movie questions that were left unanswered in this very ingenious and fun way.Joss whedon and drew Goddard have balls by doing this film now I feel I won't see or perceive horror movies the same because this film just set another bar line for future horror films to achieve.This film is funny,edgy,scary and a little mystical.I loved the whole "A tale of two cities" concept there is chaos occurring here then there's calm just relaxed just doing my job tone.the acting from franz kranz,richard jenkins,bradley whitfordand anna hutchinson make that conecpt come to life.The last 15 minutes of this film are jaw dropping every horror movie you can image put in one all at the same time I found myself howling with laughter.I think everyone who knows about horror movies should put cabin in the woods on there bucket list</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler Free Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please note that this review is spoiler free. We do not discuss any plot details in this review.It's very difficult to write a review for a film like The Cabin in the Woods, when discussing the best, and most exciting aspects of the film would ruin it for those who haven't seen it. Therefore, in order to maintain the integrity of the movie, this review will not be a critique of the plot, but of the other aspects of the film. That being said, go see this movie right now, then come back and read this.The story of the production of The Cabin in the Woods is filled with almost as many twists and turns as the film itself. Filmed in 2009, the movie was originally set for a February 2010 release, however it was delayed due to the studio wanting the film to be converted to 3D, despite objections from director Drew Goddard and writer Joss Whedon. Fortunately, this idea was ultimately scrapped, but the movie was indefinitely postponed due to MGM's financial situation. Lionsgate decided to pick up the torch and announced they had purchased the film in July of 2011, and after being well received on the festival circuit, it finally got it's release April 13, 2012.Normally, when you hear about movies stuck in situations like this, it either means it isn't very good, or it will never see the light of day. Fortunately for everyone, neither of these reign true for Cabin in the Woods. It's a fantastic blend of genres, and although it would traditionally be categorized as a horror movie, there's much more to this film than your typical horror faire. Combining elements of comedy, science fiction, action, and horror, this one's going to be tough to place on a shelf at your local Blockbuster, that is if your local Blockbuster still exists.It's with this mashup of genres, the great story-line, and solid script that make this film something unique, and a much needed breath of fresh air for horror buffs like myself. Whedon and Goddard's script is clean and crisp, and provides just enough witty dialogue to give the film an almost light-heated quality, that let's us know we don't have to take everything in the film too seriously. That's not to say there aren't a few moments of cheesiness, but with a movie like this, you have to wonder if those few lines were intended to be that way.If you think you know what's going on in The Cabin in the Woods before you see it, you're wrong. It's not just a horror movie, it's every horror movie. Every great horror movie has comedy, and every great horror movie dispels the clichés of the genre. This film does that so well, that by the end, you're not even sure what you just saw could even be considered horror. Go see The Cabin in the Woods, but don't read anything about it before hand. Don't watch any trailers, or go to the IMDb page and you'll walk out of the theater surprised, shocked, and wanting more.Adam FilmPulse.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really into horror/thrillers like most other reviewers here. I watched this movie as a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work. I liked it, the storyline unfolds neatly, and all of the 'what the hell is going on' moments were duly explained. The special effects are amazing. So far I haven't found huge storyline loopholes in afterthought.But, I'm not seeing the twists and surprises everyone else is describing. Joss Whedon's projects are usually so original next to each other, and I kept expecting the conclusion of Cabin to blow my mind, and go somewhere I never would have expected it to take me. I found the ending rather predictable, and pretty reminiscent of another of Joss's shows. I know it's hard to create meaning and depth in 90 minutes compared to a TV series, and maybe it's not expected in a regular thriller, but the ending felt forced.Overall I enjoyed the movie, even not being a fan of the horror genre. There were no cheap thrills, the graphics were good, the genre references are appreciated. But it's not the work of art I was expecting.If you want a good horror film, or want to see some truly bloody scenes, then you'll enjoy this movie and it's probably one of the better ones. If you're wanting a Whedon masterpiece, you might be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I literally hated this movie so much I had to come here and write a review. IMDb you fail... why do you say this movie has over a 7 star rating? I never write reviews.. so the fact that I am right now says a lot. Don't watch this repugnant movie. You'll be confused until nearly the end and then when it does make sense, you'll be so mad you spent that much time watching it to find out. The silly attempts at humor are sad. The crazy attempt at scary things is plain sad.... The attempt at the animation and the monsters are very very sad. lol. It literally looks like they almost copied Hunger games idea but made it way worse by turning it into a really bad horror/comedy/thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Horror Film Yet!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watch the trailer, I thought the film is bad. I was wrong. When I watch it, it was very awesome and creative. It's really rare for a horror film. This is the list of "why I like this film": 1. The characters are tough!!! The main characters are stabbed, got beaten brutally, bitten by a monster and got caught by a swinging bear trap and still alive.2. Many monsters are shown in the last 20-25 minutes of the film. Yes, there are. It has werewolf, giant vampire bat, giant snake, zombies, clowns and many more. We just don't know what it is. We just see the trailer, showing the Buckners (the killer zombies) and the killers wearing a mask.3. There's a lot of stories.Story #1: Five friends go to the cabin and have fun, but got attacked by a family of killer zombies.Story #2: Facility members planned all of this killings for a ritual to the Ancient Ones, so that the world will not end.Story #3: Two of the friends survived and go to the facility, then, releasing the monsters, causing a gruesome massacre to the members.Story #4: The two met the Director and the ritual needs the following kinds of persons: A wh*re (Jules), an athlete (Curt), a scholar (Holden), a fool (Marty) and a virgin (Dana).4. Most of all, the film has laughs throughout and most of the violence and gore are after the first 40 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>whoever thought this movie was good was probably as high as Marty (the stoner kid in the movie). I was bored watching this and didn't understand it. I love horror movies and this was just bad. It would be better if it was thought out more. I kinda liked the concept, it was different. It was still just bad. Definitely would not recommend anyone to watch this. The start of the movie makes you wonder if you are even watching the correct movie, i had started this movie a couple of months ago but turned it off since i was confused. Some of the monsters were pretty cool. I didn't like how they portrayed the unicorn as a bad character, that saddened me. Sorry, i don't know what else to write, damn thing is making me write 10 lines worth, but i just wanted to get to the point, since there is not much to say about this movie other than it being awful, and a waste of time to watch. I would rather watch paint dry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Send-Up of All Things Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at the negative reviews, but I am. As one well-known critic so aptly described it, this film is a "final exam for fanboys." Some reviewers seem to have failed the test. "Am I missing something here??" Yes. Yes you are.Subtext, folks. An item that seems to be vacant from modern-day slasher flicks (re: torture porn), and Joss and Drew know it. That's why the layers to this movie run so deep. And that's why there are so many low ratings, because those horrible movies have left our expectations so low that fans have been trained to look only at the surface level. Gore. Screams. Pain. Torture. Psychopaths. No motivation besides sheer insanity.What about the puppeteers pulling the strings? How much of this is absolutely scripted before the writer even sits down with the pen? How much control do the writers actually have? Is it possible to do something completely new, or is everything written already? I'll say it again: subtext, folks.I'm sad for this movie. Because there is so much that can't be given away, the marketing department was left with very little to sell this movie. People weren't sure what to expect when they came in. I like to think that many people like me expected nothing but the unexpected. Sadly, I now honestly believe that many a fanboy came into the theater to see yet another horribly acted generic cabin in the woods story and were left sorely disappointed when the true intent of the film went over their heads. They got a cheesy version of what they paid for, but missed the point: the bad part of it was done that way intentionally. This is Joss Whedon. You should know better by now.Look deeper. See this film for what it is: pure genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has to be one of the best Horror/Comedy movies i've ever seen. However, this isn't your "typical" Horror movie. Whenever I saw previews for The Cabin in the Woods, I would shudder in a tiny bit of fear AKA I needed to go see this movie ASAP. It looked like a fairly typical horror film (which I love), but boy was I wrong. This movie was far from typical.Five friends ? Dana (Kristen Connolly), Curt (Chris Hemsworth), Jules (Anna Hutchison), Marty (Fran Kranz), and Holden (Jesse Williams) ? take a trip to a cabin? in the woods (surprised, right?). It doesn't take too long for the fivesome's mini vacation to be rudely, and might I add violently, interrupted. By who (and/or what)? Why? You most definitely need to find out for yourself. You won't be disappointed, I promise.I loved The Cabin in the Woods. It was so different from anything I've ever seen. I thought it was the perfect mix of horror and comedy. Yup, that's right? it was funny (and not in a this-acting-is-so-bad kind of way). The movie subtly pokes fun at the corniness you find in some most horror films (not to the point of a spoof like Scary Movie though) and I thought it was hilarious. There would be intermittent jabs at the right moments when you'd normally be thinking to yourself: "Oh, how typical?" Nothing normal or typical about this movie though (and I mean that in the best way possible). While I'm emphasizing the movie's humor, I don't want to desensitize its horrifying moments (because believe me, there were quite a handful). I was very much on the edge of my seat at times, wanting to watch the movie through my fingers (I didn't though).I don't want to say too much about the storyline, but I was completely thrown for a loop (from the very beginning to the absolute end). The trailers certainly don't give any hints as to what's really behind this movie, which I absolutely love. I mean, the movie was directed by Drew Goddard, the writer for Cloverfield (another great movie), so I shouldn't have expected anything less. Keep 'em coming, Goddard (apparently I'm a fan).Acting-wise, I think everyone did great a job. Everyone played their stereotypical horror film roles to a T, whether it was the jock, the dumb blond, the virgin, the pothead, etc. The actors did well when it came time to fear for their lives, but they also did well when they needed to poke fun at their own characters in funny, not corny way. I think my favorite character was Marty, who played the stoner. He certainly provided plenty (sometimes much-needed) comic relief with his drugged up, philosophical rants.Overall, I give The Cabin in the Woods? I'm gonna do it? 5/5 stars. This movie kept me engaged the entire time (whether it was through fear and/or laughing) and I couldn't stop raving about it after I left the theater. This will definitely be a movie I'll be adding to my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Horror Movie to Surprise Me !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know where to start, this movie was great.I was not expecting that and I still cannot believe the director attempted something like this. This is a movie that puts all the horror genre upside down.So when I read bad reviews with stuff like that : "of course, a young bunch of teenagers (sexy ones) get into the woods and there it begins.. they start dying... Wow... never happened before.."Well man, you went full retard. You understood just about nothing about it. Even the movie poster tells you "You think you know the story ? Think again"...This is what I said to my friend : This is not a movie, this is, by itself, the backstage of every single horror movie ever made. Think about any horror flick, and the Cabin in the Woods will explain the "why" and "how". Makes you all see it differently.So in the end, this was extremely fun to watch. Never got bored. One of the best movie I have seen so far. I can only recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, Original, Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on this site - I registered especially to write this about this particular movie and after seeing all the hate reviews. IMO, this movie was OUTSTANDING! It's brilliant and hilarious! It's everything you could expect from Joss Wheddon and much more! And the reviews actually prove it, even the negative ones. Those who gave only 1 star never understood what was going on at all and what the whole point was.All in all, the most important thing is this - this is not a horror movie. If you expect to see an ordinary horror movie with a tiny twist to make it different and to fit the advertisement, correct your expectations, because you're going to be disappointed. If you expect horror to be mixed with comedy like many other movies has done, okay, you're on the right track, but still very far from the truth.This movie is completely different. It's horror, mixed with comedy, mixed with scifi, mixed with mystery, mixed with epic movies. And I don't mean it's one of those mish-mashes that don't work at all - everything here fits in its rightful place to deliver an outstanding genre-bending experience! Also, make sure you are a fan of at least a few TV shows. If you don't watch TV and you only watch movies, than this won't be for you. People doing movies approach things much differently than people doing TV shows. So if you like characters that you don't care about because you don't meet for more than 2 hours, if you don't like too many ideas and jokes in one place because it's too complicated for your brain, if not top-level CGI is enough to ruin everything for you, don't watch this.I'm deliberately not commenting on anything from the plot, because this would be a spoiler. The trailers gave enough spoilers already, that and the not top-level CGI are the only negative sides of this movie. But they are not that important at all to take away even 1 star from my rating! I'm giving all 10 with a clear conscience.Now, abstract yourself from all expectations you have and start watching this movie with an open mind. I'm sure it will help you view it in a much better light, but only of course if you're into smarter stuff - if you prefer dumber movies where everything is clear and obvious even that won't help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is original. The acting is not THAT BAD. What is bad is labeling this movie as horror. There was absolutely no horror in it.Throwing 500 monsters in a shot is not horrible.It's just stupid. And as for the reviews that gave it an almost 10 score for being a great HORROR movie...you guys really don't know what the horror genre is all about. I'm almost guessing you're all 12-15 years old. Because this movie is a shadow of what "horror" movies are about. The sci-fi label and comedy part are OK. The movie was funny.But labeling it as horror ruined it somewhere in the middle when it finally hits you:"i'm not going to see horror...this is a movie based on the reality show craze we've been in for the past few years". And you only watch it to the end because you're wondering who the audience is...vampires...freaking mummies...no...the end is even more stupid :) Voting 1 because it's not horror.And giving bad horror movies good ratings will result in more bad horror movies. No thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To tell you what this film is about is to spoil it. Basically we have 5 college kids go to a cabin in the woods. You can guess where it will go from there, but there is a side story that hints at something strange and new. The Cabin In The Woods is a perfect deconstruction of the predictability of horror and actually gives an explanation as to why the genre is so predictable. The characters are excellent with each one being a real human being and not just a cliché. The humour is so well written I was in hysterics. Jenkins and Whitford make an excellent double act that I want to see more of. The effects, gore, action were all spot on and I could just gush continuously about how awesome that end was. All I'll say is that I had massive expectations and knew more than I wanted to about the film, and I was still constantly surprised and wowed every few minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely not some average horror flick. Watching this movie is like riding a horror-roller-coaster. Two third of the movie is almost like another slasher movies, but with more entertaining humor, I have some LOL moments at the time. But the last half hour of the movie, when Marty &amp; Dana goes deep in the control room head quarter, the ride is getting faster and faster. With all of the evil creatures, ghosts &amp; goblins running around, I was speechless. This is the only movie that i've seen where all kinds of evil creatures perform such an amazing orchestra of destruction. really classy &amp; brilliant! And when the ending where Dana said she was sorry for almost shooting Marty, than humanity restored (and than vanished after that of course....) I must give credit to all of the actors, especially Fran Kranz , he fits right in with the character Marty. Another credit goes to the team in the control room, they somehow give a cheerful color for this dark movie. If you're a fan of horror movie, you MUST NOT miss this movie! You'll have a lot of good times. well, I did.For This amazing horror-roller-coaster ride, I give a verdict of: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thanks Josh Whedon... A work of Sheer Genius!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will keep it short because the less you know about this film, the better it will be. How refreshing to watch an horror movie that doesn't fall into the same trap that most do these days? That trap of starting out with a good idea that ultimately falls flat on its face or just runs out of steam towards the end. To many horror flicks fall into this trap and this is were 'Cabin in the Woods' excels and turns the genre on its head. It starts out like the most boring, clichéd, run-of-the-mill story 'five teens head out for a weekend at a run down log cabin' ...Yawn, but thats exactly what Josh Whedon the director wants you to think. You cant really say to much without spoiling it but I will just say, if you like horror movies that keep you on the edge of your seat, by the end of this movie you will have discovered how many 'edges' your seat can actually have! An absolutely outstanding movie that will change the genre for good, I hope. (I cant wait to watch it again with a friend who doesn't know what is going to unfold before his eyes) I cant believe all the negative comments this movie receives on IMDb. To describe this movie in a sentence, I would say... 'Cabin in the Woods is The Inception of the horror genre' and the absolute saviour of horror movies in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Whole Life Is A Complete Lie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will be the first movie review I write, and I only do so simply because I feel that this movie deserves as many accolades it can get. Especially since it was begrudgingly given cinema screen time by the distributors, who really wanted it to go straight to DVD. In fact, the distributors were so reluctant, that they gave it permission to air at ONLY one cinema in Melbourne, which is ridiculous! We had to drive an hour to get to that one cinema.I love watching movies, and even more so, I love horror movies. I live in hope of being able to watch a decent horror movie, but these moments are far and few in between. I think the last time I was scared in a movie would have been when we went to an international film festival and saw Ringu. And so I was super excited to find out that Joss Whedon made a horror movie.Up front, I will confess, I am a HUGE Joss Whedon fan so I probably do have a certain bias. However, even if Joss had no part in it, I would have still loved this movie to death! It has one of the most creative and imaginative plots I have seen in a very long, long time. This movie takes all those typical horror movie clichés, that we are all familiar with (teens, alcohol, drugs, creepy old guy, cabin, woods, etc) and all the horror movie rules we are aware of (don't walk backwards, don't separate from the group, etc) and makes you comfortable, thinking you know exactly where it's going, because you've seen it all before, right? WRONG!!! What it actually does, is make you reference and question ever other horror movie you've ever seen, and wonder if this is what was actually happening in the background!I actually did say out loud "My whole life is a complete lie ...!" as the story unfolded before my eyes. There was no point in time where I was not surprised, and I am a horror movie veteran. It has every single imaginable horror in it, all your favourite beasties, the old and new, and yet, despite the terrible things that are happening to poor hapless humans, Joss and Drew are still able to bring levity to any situation and make you laugh unexpectedly.HOWEVER, herein lies the problem - I don't think that this should actually be classified as a "horror" move. When asked about the movie, I really struggled to describe it as a horror move, because it wasn't really about the horror, just as Zombieland wasn't really about the zombies. Yeah, there's gore, and blood, and stabbing, and monsters, but that's all circumstantial. I think this is where people have been misled and this is probably why there are so many 1-star angry ratings. Personally, I could have easily given it 10 out of 10 stars, but to be fair, to balance out my undying devotion for anything from the Whedonverse, I felt I had to deduct one star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods isn't one of the best horror films you'll ever see, but there aren't many genre films that are more novel. There are any number of horror movies that are undeniably scarier, or more insightful, or better directed, but at least compared to other films from the last ten years or so, probably none that are more original.Ironically, the film's originality actually derives from its awareness of horror stereotypes and its willingness to play around with them. Anyone who has watched a handful of horror films?especially so-called Slasher movies?is familiar with these stereotypes, and will probably bring certain expectations into the cinema with them to watch The Cabin in the Woods. But even as it celebrates these stereotypes, the script (by genre favorites Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon) uses them to invert the audience's experience. Everything from the cast of characters to the jump scares to the setting and expected resolution are played according to formula?to a point. But then the formula is slowly shot to pieces, exposing several unexpected subplots that turn a very conventional horror movie into something very unique indeed.The less one knows about the plot going in the better, so I won't say anything more about the script. The direction and production values are, however, excellent, and the cast (which includes Kristen Connolly, Anne Hutchison, and Chris Hemsworth) is wonderful, and the actors all totally sell out for their roles. The result is that characters that fit all the horror archetypes?the Jock, the Bad Girl, the Nerd, etc?are also believable and distinct individuals with their own personalities. Connolly is especially noteworthy in her portrayal of Dana, the obvious Final Girl, and this could easily be a breakout role for her.None of which is to say that The Cabin in the Woods is perfect. The big reveal is a shocker but also undercuts any underlying morality the film might pretend to have, if it were trying to do anything but put a novel twist on tired conventions. The dialogue is sometimes a bit too much "on the nose," as though Whedon and Goddard didn't always know when to let a train of thought go while they were typing the screenplay. And while the trailer doesn't really indicate it, the film is as much a comedy as it is horror, and the transition between the two emotional highs isn't always seamless.But fans of the horror genre will want to see The Cabin the Woods no matter its weaknesses, because the film is, if nothing else, a strikingly original reinterpretation of a formula that badly needed it. Time will tell if The Cabin in the Woods is really the best horror movie of 2012, but it will almost certainly reign as the year's most unique genre entry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Watch If You Are Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A LOT OF SPOILERS, AND QUICKLY.** A quick note to address the oft-repeated criticism throughout these reviews: Don't watch movies smarter than you."I don't understand why they showed those Japanese Girls! This movie was stupid!" "Why were they controlling those teens? I don't get it!" "Why did they all need to die slowly and horribly? It's so stupid!" Sorry, a movie doesn't suck because you weren't smart enough to get it. If you think the acting was amateurish, or the plot was full of holes, or the director made a mess of things, or the lighting sucked, or any criticism of the actual MOVIE, then good on you. You're a discriminating consumer who knows what (s)he wants. On the other hand, if you didn't "get" the movie and didn't understand what was going on, that's more a comment about you than this movie. This wasn't The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, people. It was a completely comprehensible movie that required only a few watts of brainpower to follow.On to the review: The Cabin in the Woods gets 9 stars because I don't like horror movies. Yes, it is. Stop saying it isn't. This movie is the definition of horror movies. Isolated locale, terrified victims being killed in gruesome ways, blood and gore, zombies and sharp, stabby things, nubile teens and monsters - yep, it's a horror movie. Joss Whedon style.What's Whedon style? The curveball, ho-hum office banter beginning that only makes sense later. "I'm still on speakerphone." Lots of in-jokes for horror fans. A kick-ass hot girl who doesn't know the meaning of the words, "Just show us your boobs and die, like you're supposed to in a horror movie." And a story that is working on multiple levels simultaneously.Example? When the bird hits the force field as the camper crosses the threshold, it's saying something. You know immediately the teens are trapped. You know this isn't just about some lunatic with a chainsaw or an ancient curse. Joss's fans just got a wink, letting them know something Whedon this way comes. And you just KNOW one of those teens is gonna follow the birdie. One quick zap, and it's chock full of exposition, foreboding, 'hint, hint' and humor, and a quick hello from an artist to his fans.The Cabin in the Woods works because there are enough layers to please almost everyone - plenty of slice and dice for the gore fans, impish humor of the camp fans, unnameable horrors for the Lovecraft fans, hot girls and cheesecake for the 14 year olds who sneaked in - and they never bog the movie down. It moves along, escalating nicely, the progression logical in hindsight and plenty creepy for the nonce.The story is about the answer many viewers of horror movies never receive to their oft-asked question: "Yes, but WHY?" The answer: Because if it doesn't go down exactly like horror movies should, the world will end. A few die so many may live. Not especially original, but this is Hollywood and this is horror: nothing is original anymore.The cast is great, with Kristen Connolly a perfect Whedon girl: sweet, sexy, tough, intelligent, "Excuse me? WHO did you just call an ingénue?!" She fights even when she's losing badly and manages to keep winning the ultimate prize: survival. Whedon alum Fran Kranz as the philosophically conspiracy-minded stoner hits all the right comic relief notes, acting as the audience's avatar many times. Anna Hutchinson, Chris Hemsworth, and Jesse Williams fill out the soon-to-be-dead list of normal, organic roles nicely. There isn't a "No one would tolerate this asshole for five seconds in real life" in the bunch. They're normal, mundane, run-of-the-mill. They're us, which adds a little sympathetic chill to their deaths.The villains in the movie aren't the monsters, or the teens, or vice (or something similarly corny). In truth, the villains are us, the people in the chairs, watching the spectacle. We are represented by the puppet masters in their enclave, manipulating the environment to turn the screws and up the heat. They've lost whatever it is that would fill a body with outrage over the things they're doing - even to save the world - and it's all just a day at the office to them.It is to these people Whedon and Goddard are their cruelest. The REAL horror and splatter and viscera starts at the end, the payoff to all the buildup we've been watching, an orgy of monsters rampaging through the enclave, giving the bad guys their comeuppance. It's the catharsis we've been craving, the once-removed self-flagellation for having been spectators to this horrible tableau, purifying the wicked in blood and death, restoring balance - for the scant amount of time remaining for there to be a world where balance matters.And here's the kicker: you don't even have to "get" all that to enjoy this movie. You can simply root for the good guys to survive and the bad guys to get theirs; you'll get satisfaction with both. That's the fun of Joss Whedon; he's never up his own ass with his cleverness. There's always enough to enjoy even if you don't want to join his hipper-than-hippos club.But you do have to be minimally intelligent. Despite what one hater (who clearly just wants to rebel against 'whatever') thinks, this is not Scary Movie. It's Evil Dead on meth and peyote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you a guy who likes old school horror movie and want to take out a girl who likes the over-the-top-close-to-comedy horror? Well, if so, you got a date!If at the beginning we're not sure about the mix of old fashion and the «modern-and-digital» touch, the outcome is good enough to support expectations. Somehow in the spirit of reality show (I could not stop myself thinking about Truman show all the movie long), the least we can say is this is in the taste of the day. The old horror elements are well done despite the fact that some of the intense scenes (the fights with the zombies, for instance) are a bit too shaky (read here : we don't see clearly and the sound is in a «patchingwork» use). The last third of the movie takes a surprising turn and the refreshing effect of all of it worth the time if not the patience (I say that because after a while in the wood, you may feel that the movie tramples but what happen next makes you forgot (and forgive) about). And what to say about the orgy (not sexually) of freaky monsters (I don't want to say too much, just in case...).At the risk to repeat what I mentioned in the summary, it is in the Rodriguez style. Maybe a bit less spicy than Planet Terror but how far better that Machete! Horror fans, it's for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is perfect beginning to end, if you are a fan of horror film genre and have an IQ above 80 you will LOVE this film.To call this film a spoof is selling it short, this film deconstructs the horror genre, analyzes it, and then builds a master piece film from the ground up. The film is a mix of a lot of things; it pays homage to the old horror films before it, plays at the clichés of the genre in a funny way, and genuinely tells an original, fun, and interesting story.To people who claim the film is terrible, I'd have to say you really missed what this film achieved. I guess if you not a fan of the horror genre and you just go into this film blind it could seem like a standard slasher flick...but trust me it is so much. Everything in this film is a reference to either a horror film, the horror genre, or film making as a whole and that could go over a casual viewers head.The film at it deepest level is a film about film making (meta). Joss' writing is at the same level it always is...perfect; blending humor and horror seamlessly. The whole film is a metaphor and you won't fully understand the whole picture until viewing it a few times.</fullReview>

If you're a fan of horror or just a fan of good cinema with an open mind, I'd recommend this movie. It is a horror movie, but not a straight-up one, there's a little spin put on it that makes it a bit different.When you watch horror movies, or movies in general, there's this thing called suspension of belief. Some reviews are complaining about how it's not realistic? Comparing it to reality? COME ON. It's creative, well- written, well-directed, and something different.Some people calling this the worst movie they've ever seen, but they probably have NOT seen much movies.

		<fullReview>I loved every second of this movie. I'm a lifelong horror fan and have seen 'em all, but I was not prepared for the extreme awesomeness that is "The Cabin in the Woods." I went in not knowing much about it except for the fact that teenagers visit a cabin in the woods. I was hoping for a few creative kills and a decent body count cuz let's face it, that's all a horror movie is worth nowadays. That being said I wasn't expecting much, but what I got was unlike anything I have ever witnessed on screen in my entire life, a solid, funny and gory masterpiece. So why did I not give it a 10 if it was soooo good? Well, for me the final climax just wasn't long enough, that's it. I wanted more and I wasn't alone. The buzz in the seats once the lights came up was pretty wild. More like the end of a rock concert than a movie. This is a MUST SEE for any horror fan like me whose sick and tired of being let down by the crap they feed us now. This film was made by horror fans for horror fans, FINALLY. A breath of fresh air that will not soon be forgotten. Bring on the sequel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart &amp; funny Horror deconstruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror/comedy is a difficult thing to get right. For every "Evil Dead II" there are a dozen movies that try and fail. Genre deconstruction is even harder to do well. It usually ends up being dry and at the very best, clever without being effective. "Cabin in the Woods", however, succeeds on all levels. The direction is tight, fast and tense where it needs to be, and yet has a deft comedic timing almost unheard of for a first-time director. Of course, the script, by director Drew Goddard and producer Joss Whedon, is so sharp and funny that it would have been difficult to ruin it completely. But quite the opposite - the direction gets every last laugh, thrill, and thoughtful subversion of expectations just right. The acting is note-perfect from top to bottom, with each character being asked to play the archetype expected of their role in the film, as well as the self-aware humans they actually are. This high-wire act could have fallen flat, but instead becomes one of the most effective parts of the movie. Likewise, the makeup and special effects are scary and brilliant in their own right, while also walking the fine line of parody but never quite stepping over it. This is one of my favorite movies in years, of any genre. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

It is not scary at all, it is not complex or intelligent, not even funny. The story loses every chance to be plausible. One is always waiting for the film to make some sense,and in fact, if it ended at the middle point it would be an usual and graceless terror movie, but anyway it would be better.

I know the trailer promised that but guess what - IT LIED. You will not experience gripping fear or be scared or want to crawl into your mommy's bed. You might pee your pants when you see the unicorn though.Cabin is the perfect "bad movie night" movie that you watch with a bunch of friends, a bowl of popcorn, and just laugh and have a good time. It doesn't take itself too seriously and you shouldn't either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is simply the best comedy I have seen in a long time. Far from a horror film, this movie plays on common stereotypes in the horror genre in order to deliver a witty and original experience. The best joke in the whole movie is the advertising -- it's advertised as a standard teenagers-in-the-woods horror movie, while it's actually a great comedy. This movie has everything -- from Lovecraftian end-of-the-world scenarios to Romero zombies to "modern" zombies, and a whole slew of other things. Characters are represented as stereotypical horror movie characters, the monsters are stereotypes, and the film overall is filled with wonderful references to horror movies including Hellraiser, Evil Dead, and the J-horror genre in general. Anything in this film that is sub-par is intentionally sub-par, so to satirize the horror genre.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not recommended.You've heard the one about the jock, the hottie, the intellectual, the stoner, and the virgin who decided to go have some fun at a remote cabin in the woods. Five go in, and...Well, you've certainly seen variations on this horror theme before, including Friday the 13th, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, just to name a few examples from this overworked genre. Let's face it, whenever nubile teenagers go for a quiet getaway in the deep dark woods, there's got to be danger a mere step or two away. After all, it's not called the WILDerness without good reason. Now I do enjoy the synthetic scare of sitting in a darken theater and jumping in synchronized midair movement along with my fellow moviegoers, as long as the film follows these three basic rules of suspense: Rule No. 1. It builds suspense. ( Usually this is the case in many films, an easy accomplishment with sound effects, sudden staccato music shifts, and darkness all around. ) Rule No. 2. It stays logical until the end. ( Rarely does the end achieve that goal since its beginning phase sets up the heightened tension and higher expectations only to disappoint by the film's gruesome finale. ) Rule No. 3. It doesn't glorify gratuitous gore for violence's sake ( Never happens nowadays, especially if the filmmakers want to see any possible profit ). So, I decided to kill some time and went to see what I thought would be another predictable slasher movie, with perhaps a bit more wit and spine-tingling tension, since it was penned by Joss Whedon of Buffy fame. Well, the film wasn't so much predictable as it was forgettable.Yes,I can now report that The Cabin in the Woods doesn't meet many of those criteria. ( In fact, it only manages to register with the first rule of horror films. ) But the film is still a noble, if disappointing, effort to expand the realm of this genre. It is a spirited diversion and when it stays within its own terror-filled perimeter of the horror school of filmmaking, the film stays effective. Too often, the filmmakers continually undercut the elements of suspense by relying too much on the contrasting images of sci-fi technology.Co-written and directed by Drew Goddard, The Cabin in the Woods brings together the collective teenagers as the typical sacrificial lambs. The lambs for the slaughter are played by Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, and a younger Chris "Thor" Hemsworth, all who have since achieved some fame in television and motion picture projects. ( The film, made in 2008, has been held up for release due to MGM's bankruptcy issues and has finally made it to the big screen after much delay. ) Also in the film are Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, both fine accomplished actors who may bring some stature to the film, but essentially are wasting their talents here. The multi-purpose script shows no real purpose at all. The screenplay tries its darnedest to be hip and innovative in its approach to elevate the horror genre with some comedic moments and action segments. The Cabin in the Woods contains many plot twists and turns ( too many ) which will be more effective for your filmgoing experience with less prior knowledge about the film and its tiered structure. So you'll hear no spoilers from this reviewer except to saw that I was more shocked by the film's positive reviews by the critics that from the antics on display.As the film rambles to its forgone conclusion, Whedon and Goddard throw every possible horror cliché at their movie-going audience, making the film becomes more laughable than scary, particularly with an uncredited cameo that makes the whole enterprise seem even more absurd. The Cabin in the Woods wants to be seen as a clever send-up to all the horror films past, a cagey deconstruction of the splatter film brand of filmmaking. But due to its multi-layering of convoluted plot devices and an uncanny knack for pop culture insights, it just doesn't work. When doing a mash-up of horror and sci-fi staples, both styles of film suffer under their own weight and individual identity. The Cabin in the Woods becomes a bit of a bi-polar mess, a sad little parody of itself. Unfortunately, the joke is on the moviegoers who become the sacrificial lambs that pay full dollar to see this kind of anticlimactic junk. GRADE: CNOTE: The movie poster shows off the gamesmanship and mystery that are an essential part to the film's success. With a side wink to the Rubik Cube phenomenon and a deep appreciation of the work of M.C. Escher, this marketing conceptually targets the right film audience and becomes intriguing art as well. The poster far exceeds the movie's overall effect. Checkmate!NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot in 2009 but later shelved for three years due to MGM's bankruptcy, THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is finally here after being picked up by Lionsgate. And I must say, not since Wes Craven's SCREAM has a horror genre so wickedly subversive and so twisted as this long-delayed shocker. This is the kind of movie where the less you know about the detail, the better. Written and produced by none others than TV's Buffy the Vampire Slayer Joss Whedon and directed by first-timer Drew Goddard (writer of TV's Lost), THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is no doubt one of the most original horror movies ever seen in years. But as original as this movie is so playfully displayed here, it's a shame that it's also a heavily uneven effort frequently ruined by preposterous outcome...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a spoof than a scary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ha,ha, I get it, you're making fun of horror movies and how they all seem to be very similar. But as a horror fan, I dare say that all movies of all genres follow a familiar pattern, which the audience recognizes and responds to. It's just so easy to pick on Horror, because there are a lot of bad horror movies out there. This was already done, far more effectively in my opinion, by "Scream," which clearly laid out the rules of a horror movie. However, "Scream," despite making good-natured fun of it, still closely followed the rules and made for a very enjoyable, scary experience. This movie made me jump a few times and had a good build-up at times, but when it kept going back to the scientists having a blast, it takes you out of the moment and it's not scary anymore. And once the virgin and the pot-head find their way into the control room, it became completely ridiculous. I'd prefer it, if they had just given you the scary stuff throughout the movie and then have the big twist revealed at the end. Then it would have been a little like "Lost" but at least I would have gotten my scares out of the way and been content.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WAY overpraised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The steup is familiar--a bunch of college kids go to an isolated cabin in the woods. They are the familiar clichés--an oversexed jock (Chris Hemsworth), his sex-starved girlfriend (Anna Hutchison), his best buddy (Jesse Williams), a stoner (Fran Kranz) and a sweet girl (Kristen Connolly). They get there but are watched over by two mysterious men (Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins)--but why? I won't spoil it by revealing the twist.I had high hopes for this. It was praised to the high heavens by critics and the opening scenes at the cabin deliberately (I think) look just like the scenes at the cabin in "The Evil Dead". And (for once) we have good actors playing these clichés and good dialogue (with some humor that is actually pretty funny). But the fun quickly drains away. After you find out what is going on it stops being fun and just gets pretty sick and disturbing. The movie seems to think it's much cleverer than it actually is. This does NOT rewrite the horror genre like "Scream" did in 1996 (although a lot of critics think it does). Also, for a film that seems to praise itself for being so clever, they throw in a REALLY pointless gratuitous topless nude scene which was NOT needed. It redeems itself somewhat towards the last section which gets REALLY REALLY gory and has a cameo by a respected actress (my audience laughed and applauded when she appeared) but it doesn't save the movie entirely. It's not a total loss--it's just not as clever as critics seem to think. ALL the acting is good and you care about the characters--but that's about it. I love horror movies but can only give this a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could be the best parody i've ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... instead unfortunately it is listed as horror film?!?!?! So I can not give it more than 1 star. I went to see the movie just because I found good reviews here in IMDb, so with this review i just want to help other people not to make the same mistake.The film was so awful that after leaving the cinema i heard a guy suggesting to his friends that they should take an "oath of silence" about it, that nobody should ever know that they watched it. If it weren't for the last 15-30 minutes, the movie would be an ordinary pop-horror film (like scream), where things appear suddenly or without expecting it you would hear a very loud noise (so that it'll make you jump from your seat) etc. Added to that, you have some elements of splatter, cult, sci-fi and bad-acting-American-college-stupidity movie. (NOTE: i have nothing against the American college life, i'm just referring to the way it is presented in movies)But then, the last 15-30 minutes come... I do not want to spoil anything for people who still want to see it, so i will just say this : everything escalated to such an outrageous ridiculous point that 90% of the spectators in the theater burst into laughter!!! And I saw this movie in a crowded cinema of 200 seats!!! After the first wave of laughter, people stopped being embarrassed/self-conscious and started expressing their thoughts out loud with a result of listening someone from the audience say for example : "Oh crap, even "the thing" from Adams family is guest-starring here". The end of the movie naturally found everybody in tears from laughter and me wondering if i should give more stars to other films i've rated badly in the past, because "Cabin in the woods" was either the best parody i've ever seen, or way beyond worse than everything else i've seen in my life.So, if you want to watch a good parody, definitely go and watch this film. It's very entertaining (in a foolish way) and you'll feel your head lighter when you come out of the cinema. But if you're searching for a good horror film and you're considering "Cabin in the Woods" my advice is NOOOOOOOO!!! Better watch a cult flesh-eating-zombies film or a splatter/psychological horror movie like "Saw".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the "Truman Show" but not a good show.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starts off with the usual horror cliché of five young people, who will be killed off first, characters going to the cabin by the lake. The presents of Richard Jenkins in a control center lets you know something isn't right.Seems these only child orphan lambs going to the slaughter get to choose their path to demise. In a hokey series of scenes in the basement they unleash the dreaded Buckner family of Zombies. (The leader, Bill Buckner is best remembered for booting a ground ball and killing the Red Sox fans hopes and dreams.) If you know she is in it, you're waiting for Sigourney Weaver. By the time she gets there to explain it all you don't care.There's the usual change of rules that occur too late in the story. This time it's OK for the virgin to survive if she suffers enough. The audience suffers even more then the good looking cast that is given very little to say or do but run for their lives.It's contrived. You often feel the hand of the writer and you see it at the end when it's supposed to be the hand of some angry evil God. The villains are dispatched by the monsters not the young survivors. It doesn't work as a horror movie. It falls short as a comedy. It is not a thriller. It has some moments but it's not worth your time or money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is terrible!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, it starts off like any other mediocre horror movie, 5 youngsters go off on a road trip out to the sticks where they stay for the weekend. staying in a cabin where they planned to get drunk, had sex and smoked weed The only good aspect of the movie was the fact that there was some sort of organise plot to engage these kids into what looked like game viewed by the public. This got me interested as it look like something I haven't seen before.... Anyway, they all got drunk and end up down the basement(shocker) and end up fiddling with antiques that activate certain monsters that come up from underground, the monsters then have to kill them in order to pass the assignment, one of the female youngsters found a book with an old gruesome tale involving a family chopping a girls arm off. This activated a zombie family that came up from underground created by god knows who as they weren't man made. A couple of them get killed and 2 survive, those 2 manage to find a hidden underground facility, a lift that took them to a number of rooms, each room had a monster in it and still at this point was completely unexplained. The monsters involved a giant snake, clown, unicorn....etcThese monsters escape and go on a killing spree, signer weaver comes out at the end and says one of you has to die, other wise the so called gods will "come alive" and kill everyone in the world and reclaim it.WHAT GODS??Honestly, am I the only one who has no clue what or who these goods are because they were not explained properly at all, what was that facility?, how did it come about? who created them stupid monsters? who the hell came up with a mermaid guy and a girl with a teeth face...RIDICULARS!! how did the gods contact the facility people and ask them to " give us 5 people every so often to kill and we wont destroy your world". Awful storyline....should have gone to see battleship</fullReview>

Not sure how but I am certain this movie was promoted using scripts or bots to get its rating go up. This is ABSOLUTE 1~2 rating on IMDb, worse than any as seen on TV cheap horror movie. I mean the movie is so bad I was one of many people who walked out of the theater and actually got a re-admit ticket from AMC.Absolutely terrible movie. The 10 star reviews are FAKE, I wish I could give it a 1 star.The movie actually starts off good with a few moments that excite the viewer, the actors do a good job probably I would give them a 6/10. The special effects gets a 6/10. The setting and camera guy also get a 7/10. The story line and directing however is absolute 0/10 but IMDb does not have a 0/10. I seriously thought this is a joke, I thought they would stop the movie and someone would walk in the theater and say "HEY you were punk'd!" but it kept going and getting worse.</fullReview>

But, seriously, as a fan of horror films, I am pretty well justified that there's no medium film in horror genre. Either perfect, or pure crap. And it belongs to the second part! There isn't even a single scene in this film that I liked. The film revolves around an idea that serves the needs of school children, who have been bombarded by horror stories they have no idea about, and always mistake them with ancient legends. Anyway, it was a waste of time.

		<fullReview>Is this some kind of a joke? Are there cameras that filming people's reactions and laughing at them or what? It was AFWUL! It was neither scary nor funny. I hated myself that I didn't leave the theater after the first 15 minutes.The only scary and the best scene of the movie was the guy appeared suddenly at the old gas station. The movie is that bad...Too bad I can't rate it less than 1.t was predictable from the start (why did that eagle have to hit the invisible boundary to the cabin? It made the later scene with the motor bike jump completely redundant). The acting was poor and even though the film may be satirical it is still painful to watch.The only thing I do like is perhaps the idea of an ode to all horror films and horror characters, but if it is a parody than that wouldn't make sense.I am just so surprised that this film currently has 7.9 / 10. Am I missing something here??? Unless you are from the new generation who loves nonsense bloody scenes and find them funny and somehow scary; STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Satire or What You Thought You Knew About Horror Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know? I was going to really trash this movie. I don't usually, but when I expect good ol' fashioned horror and get a comedy instead, it's hard for me to not feel disappointed, even a little cheated. Then I read the review that was randomly chosen to appear on this page, and I finally got it: this is a parody. Not a completely silly (not to say dumb) comic parody like the Scary Movie series, but an old fashioned satire like Scream.The movie starts off like your usual teen horror with all the elements present. A bunch of friends going on vacation, get slightly lost, meet a creepy fella in a deserted gas station, fail to recognize the warning, reach the isolated place and start getting butchered. Their roles are even as stereotypical as can be (Jock, slut, nerd, stoner and good-girl) but are portrayed in a very satirical way (the stoner is the smart one, and the jock reads?!). Then, as time goes by, it adds pretty much every element of every sub-genre in the wide spectrum of Horror (cult, sacrifices, zombies, ghosts, monsters, cat and mouse chase, being trapped, pretty much everything you can possibly imagine...) This movie obviously set out to not meet the casual expectations, and did a fine job at it.If you're looking for a good scare - stop. There isn't a scary scene in this movie, not one. However - if you're looking for a good laugh, you've hit the jackpot. Almost every time the stoner (superb acting by Fran Kranz) opened his mouth - I ended up laughing, sometimes hysterically.And of course, the All-Star monster assembly, which appeared as if it were taken directly from a Family Guy flashback scene. I thought it was ridiculously absurd, until I realized that was the point.I don't like writing spoiler reviews, but I can tell you that I don't think there's a way to spoil the ending. This movie isn't about surprising twists, impressive dialogues or a smart script. It's as I mentioned before, a clever satire meant to make fun of the Horror genre.Since I'd been disappointed because I expected something else, I wasn't really sure how to rate this. It's a hilarious comedy and an excellent satire, but it simply isn't a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the WoodsWhen spending time at a cabin in the woods it's important to remember the essentials: beers, babes and bone cutters.Unfortunately, the co-eds in this horror-comedy only brought 2 of the 3 basics with them, so there'll be plenty of gangrene.Dana (Kristen Connolly) and her friends (Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams) decide to stay at a shack in the sticks owned by a distant relative.After settling in, the group uncovers a stash of scripture in the cellar that, when read aloud, brings the dead to life.While carnage ensues above, beneath the cottage is a clandestine control centre, where loquacious technicians (Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford) manipulate the group's emotions.An abnormal fabrication of screams and laughs, Cabin in the Woods infuses sci-fi with the slasher genre and toys with its archetypes.However, the scariest thing about a cabin in the woods remains: no Internet.

		<shortDescription>Standard slasher horror with a twist!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started out watching the film believing it would be a standard slasher horror film but I was surprised and didn't expect the sudden twist at the end. The film starts out with 5 students going to an "uncles" cabin for a fun weekend. But through clever foreshadowing we can see that it isn't the case. The man at the gas station warns them as well as them seeing various signs in the basement of the cabin that something was going to happen.As they start to slowly get picked off 1 by 1 I thought it was just going to be a boring cliché horror film but when the two characters descend into the grave and discover the lifts full of "nightmare creatures" it put me on the edge of my seat! When they got released from the lifts it was great, so much action and interesting monsters it really flipped my perspective on the film upside down. I was really entertained by the use of a unicorn and how the scientist who wanted to see the merman so badly got killed by it! I thought the twist with the explanation of the gods to be rather far-fetched but hey it made a great film! Overall I think The Cabin In The Woods was definitely worth watching, it may have seemed boring at first but it really becomes interesting as it progresses into the later stages of the film.</fullReview>

Where SCREAM aspired to deconstructing the mythology of the slasher flick and reconstructing it as a self-aware parody, CABIN sparks the target in a much more holistic and satisfying way - subverting the entire modern horror movie genre in order to achieve it's ends. Clever, smart, it absolutely takes the stereotypical set-up and characters for thousands of by-the-numbers slasher/horror flicks and turns them upside down and inside out. It's funny, subversive, unpredictable. An intriguing, perplexing roller-coaster ride with vats of gore and a cracking conclusion. And Sigourney Weaver.What's not to like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty meh. Watchable, but nothing to write home about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a movie that promises to change a genre, the viewer is left rather disappointed. The underlying premise is obvious from the trailers, and certainly even more in your face obvious from the first 10 minutes of the film, leaving any and all chances of surprises and twists well in the realms of never never land. Thankfully however, the film doesn't seem to be attempting to surprise you; but with less than mediocre comedy and not really much of a lot in the way of horror the film is left rather flat and 2 dimensional. Certainly not what I'd call even in the ball park of a game charger film. ** SPOILER ALERT ** I did feel somewhat insulted when we were told that all the events were part of a yearly ritual, and more over, a ritual that they clean up after; then when they let all the monsters into the facility through the illogical elevators that honestly, lets face it would never lead into the main facility, the clean up crew which is apparently responsible for putting these creatures back in their boxes every year is just some guys with guns whom are quickly slaughtered. That is thoroughly insulting to the viewers intellect, and quite frankly lazy writing. ** SPOILER ALERT **All in all the movie is watchable, but it's nothing to write home about. It's the sort of film you'd watch at midnight on a Friday or Saturday evening just because it's on, and you have nothing better to do; but not the sort of movie you'd pay good money to purposefully see as a rental. If you're looking for a scary DVD there are plenty of other, better options available to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods - Catch It (A-) The Cabin in the woods is a smart horror movie rewriting the horror genre and showing how much people love to see other people in torture. Over the years people have forgotten that we're not any different from the people we see in movies like Hostel, the Tournament or now Cabin in the Woods. where people pay to see other people in torture just like us. As it's obvious from the name Cabin in the Woods, it's about a Cabin isolated in the woods visited by 5 friends representing our modern characterized social stigma on today's generation. The Athlete "Chris Hemsworth", The Whore "Anna Hutchison", The Scholar "Jesse Williams", The Fool "Fran Kranz" &amp; The Virgin "Kristen Connolly". The movie doesn't hide anything from the start as it's begins with the people sitting in some laboratory watching 5 friends getting ready to leave for vacations. This somehow nicely allowed to bring humor in horror and made it really funny at times. This is called smart writing. The performances by all five actors Chris Hemsworth, Jesse Williams, Anna Hutchison, Kristen Connolly, Fran Kranz and others in basement are good. In my opinion the movie is almost great till the end. In the end the reason behind all of this torture suffering or sacrifice gave it a supernatural twist from the psycho/scientific one. But anyways On the whole, the movie is really twisted and entertaining. Must watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good watchable entertaining movie. But that's all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is my first review it's certainly not the best film I saw.I want to write something about this one because I disagree with lots of people en certainly the critics.A week ago I read a critic review here in a Belgian newspaper which stated this could become a cult classic. Reading that review and seeing the IMDb score made me wanted to watch this movie immediately. My thoughts; "A horror movie which gets 8 out of 10 on IMDb just must be very good". So I went to the theater and waited to be surprised. (I might also have to say Horror movie is my favorite genre and I already have seen a lot of them.) So, okay this one should be it, it should crap the *** out of me. So I was very eager to go and see this one. This film started like every teen horror movie I ever saw, full of clichés, as well as decor, characters, sound, music, as the acting itself. Or was this slightly better? Maybe but I didn't really noticed that. I was sitting and watching but merely waiting until something would really happen. And okay at some point something did happen. But nothing we haven't seen before.To say that the changing plot of this movie lifts this movie to an other level, yes OK, but not to the next level of 8/10. So for sure not to a cult level. It just becomes a average slightly good movie. Good entertainment but I never got scared. A good Horror should scare the *** out of you. Instead it just became a good watchable entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to tell if The Cabin in the Woods is either a commentary on horror movie clichés, a celebration, or a kick in the crotch. All I can say that within the confines of most horror movie conventions, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. It starts with one dusty old idea and then builds and builds and builds, opening up a mystery that is either brilliant writing or wretched excess. That will depend on your point of view.The movie begins with a gimmick that is about as tired and creaky as the title structure. Five college kids board a van and take a road trip into the woods to spend the weekend in a run-down old cabin. The characters are standard issue: Curt (Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth) is the hunk; Jules (Anna Hutchison) is his sluttish girlfriend; Dana is the virginal brain (Kristen Connolly); Holden (Jesse Williams) is the emo smart guy; and Marty (Fran Kranz) is the wisecracking pothead. Every horror movie convention that you can name occurs on this vacation, right up to and including that creepy guy at the gas station with bad skin, crazy eyes and a mouth full of chaw. He's there to warn them that . . . well, you know.To say that the kids are stalked one by one won't be giving anything away, neither will the information that Dana finds a dusty old book in the basement containing a text written in Latin (and, yes, she reads it out loud). That sets into motion terrors that one of the witches in Shakespeare's Macbeth referred to as "something wicked this way comes". The kids are taunted and tormented by what the old book brings to life, and by what they begin to discover about their surroundings. There is a reason for everything going on in that cabin. There is even a plan set in place and a specific reason that they have all been summoned here.I must tread very lightly in describing the rest of the plot. Something else is at work behind the scenes that has led the kids to the wood in the first place. What is happening around them (and why) is a secret that other critics have been very quick to reveal. I will not. All I can say is that when the kids discover what is happening, it opens up a Pandora's Box of every single horror movie convention that you can imagine. The plot takes the characters into the haunted cabin and them throws them down, down, down, down revealing layer after layer, leading to a third act that is as gory as it is entertaining.The movie becomes kind of a Greatest Hits collection of horror movie clichés, and that's not a bad thing: We get the crazy old hillbillies, zombies, ghosts, human sacrifice, werewolves, killer clowns, giant bats, ax murderers, snakes, mutants etc. There's even a unicorn and a merman (don't ask). All of this is, of course, soaked in buckets of blood and volumes of gore. Most of this had me laughing and had me so relieved that the script was so wild with invention. Yes, there are clichés, but they are clichés at the service of something I hadn't seen before. This is the movie the Scream should have been. That movie could only do about a third of what this movie is able to accomplish. If the movie it successful, I think it will be a game-changer.I got excited during the opening credits when I discovered that the movie was produced and co-written by Joss Whedon, the creative mind behind hits like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Firefly" and the upcoming Avengers. He has a wonderfully creative mind, and knack for taking old clichés and refitting them with a hip sensibility. The movie was directed by his longtime writing partner Drew Goddard, and what the two have constructed is a movie that takes an old horror movie and breaks it open, allowing all of the tired old conventions and clichés to come spilling out almost all at the same time.Something tells me that Whedon and Goddard have spent many evenings pouring over recent horror movies. They are exasperated and disappointed at a genre that has degenerated into a half-wit series of torture-porn nonsense. They have created something original, something new. Yes, there are loose ends, and yes the ending is patently ridiculous, but the journey getting there is better than any horror movie of recent memory.</fullReview>

Another point from above, the Eagle flying into the force field was a terrible idea to include right at the start of the movie. Some of the CGI was also poorly thrown together by what looks like a 15 year old on a home computer. All in all just about scraped a 4/10 for me and that was only due to the imaginative plot. Remake this movie with a much better cast and director and there could be a hit.

		<shortDescription>Horror movie about some teens that go to cabin and find out there's more to it than they ever knew.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I don't want to say too much as it could ruin things if you haven't seen it yet. Let's just say that if horror was a business then this is how it shouldn't be run (you'll know what I mean when you see it). I will say that all the hype over this movie is justified. There's a few surprises and things that get you guessing, some good humor and some horror movie clichés but they are there for a reason. This film has everything in it (literally). It's very well done and and now I know what HorrorBid and Horror-Movies.ca meant when they said "it's the best horror genre movie we've seen for years"! It had me saying "I'm going to buy this film on DVD! I need to own it!". Do yourself a favor as they say, see this film! I give it a solid 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It boggles my mind how crap like That's My Boy is granted a major theatrical run in Australia, yet a horror-comedy as inventive and entertaining as Cabin gets relegated to small, art house cinemas who thankfully save it from a straight-to-DVD release. The mainstream audience would've flocked to this Joss Whedon-produced flick like seagulls to hot chips; it's scary, extremely amusing and, best of all, intriguingly unpredictable. With tongue firmly in cheek, writers Whedon and Drew Goddard (who also directed) deliver a cracking meta-narrative that piles on twist after turn after OMG!-moment without ever being convoluted and always landing on the right side of fun. The dialogue is whip-smart and hilarious ? a speakerphone conversation had me in tears ? and the acting is well above par for a movie in this genre. The five teens (including Chris Hemsworth) who spend the weekend in a cabin in the ? wouldn't you know it ? woods, are knowingly stereotypical and oddly distinctive all at once, whilst Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins wipe the floor clean with their utterly perfect and highly memorable performances as two straight-faced office workers in an unusual line of business. Throw into the mix a smattering of enjoyable violence, a neat A-lister cameo and a bonkers climax worth the admission price alone, and you've got the biggest film-distribution fail in Oz for 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror, with lots of cool thrown in. :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, this amazing movie gets released, ever since I saw an early promotional image I wanted to see it, also the fact that it was written by Joss Whedon sparked my interest, so its terrific that it has finally been released. I had read the official novelization of the book before I saw the movie, so I knew everything that was going to happen, but that didn't take away the awesomeness of it, some reviews say "turns the genre on it's head", and I must agree, The Cabin in the Woods indeed is unlike any other horror film you've seen.This may sound strange but I think this movie takes a lot of the good things from good horror films and tweaks them, and puts them all together into one big puzzle that may or may not make sense, but is a hell of a lot of fun to watch, pretty much from the first scene to the last it's a feast for the eyes.The cast is great, the lead actress is nice to watch, I haven't seen her before but I still liked her, and Chris Hemsworth continues to stand out, Anna Hutchinson is also pretty great, as usual, I was a fan of her Underbelly days so it's great to see her on the big screen, and of course it wouldn't be a cultish film without the presence of Sigourney Weaver, who everyone knows can make any film cool. It's kinda hard to say much without giving a lot of the story away, but it's definitely worth seeing, it's horror-cool with a massive amount of humor, it's just great. :)Love love love it. ^.^</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn funny, original, anti-cliché, but not really scary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin In the Woods is a truly humorous movie. Besides, it has so many moments of surprise, but it hardly would frighten you through the whole 135 minutes of movie length. It is creative, because except a few times, it won't give you a single clue of what could happen next, and that is what makes it enjoyable to watch from beginning till the end. Even the ending doesn't follow any Hollywood-sort of clichés that one may expect (which some could find boring and disappointing)Visual effect are just great and in-context. Monsters are funny which serves the line of humor running throughout the movie. The only weak point is probably the main actors' acting . They are not bad, but it feels like that they don't put so much effort in bringing the best out of their characters. I doubt if this was a screenplay problem as Josh Whedon's characters are usually very well defined and understood by audience; something that does not happen here (except for the secondary characters).In conclusion, The Cabin In the Wood is a very entertaining movie that is worth to watch, if you're not looking for something to really get scared with, and it's a good movie to own, as its originality gives you the option of bragging for your friend: "I have a funny horror movie, do you wanna watch?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been awaiting this release for sometime, and considering my reluctance to watching slasher type movies, I was surprised by the depth this film travelled. Amusing in places and also twists that left you trying to figure out where the movie was headed. I am sadly the type who sits and figures out the plot very early on, and maybe this is due to my movie addiction, but sitting there I was surprised at every turn this movie hit me with and the crescendo of an end that left me wanting more. The casting was good. Chris Hemsworth though needs to be offered juicier roles as this movie doesn't stretch him enough. The Cabin in the Woods I will admit now to being one of my all time horror favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you expected The Cabin In The Woods to be scary then you are in for a surprise.What it does have is humor and an incredibly imaginative story that keeps you guessing.Its certainly no raunchy gore-fest, although it has its moments (particularly the one in which the motley crew of monsters are unleashed).The monsters are well designed and vaguely reminiscent of some horror movie classics, and the people controlling the terror adds a new level of depth to the film.Overall, TCITW is a good source of a few good laughs and a few more at least mildly shocking visuals. The characters are believable and entertaining. I will certainly be buying the DVD when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Breakfast Club" for a new generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A note on spoilers: The Cabin in the Woods benefits from the viewer having as little information as possible going in. Not because it contains any big plot twists (though the final resolution seems to take many by surprise), but because it works best when it can slowly, but steadily, tear down all preconceived notions about horror films.(If you haven't seen the film, stop reading now.)You have a pretty good idea of where the film is going at all times, and it doesn't throw any big curves at you. Rather, it continuously veers ever so slightly, forcing you to repeatedly adjust your expectations. In other words: This film takes the path less traveled, but you never lose sight of the main road. In the end, it ends up where you thought it was going all along... or does it?Much has been said about the "metaplot" of the film, which is an obvious metaphor for the horror film genre. As the creators Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon has said, Hadley and Sitterson in the control room are stand-ins for the creators themselves, which means the old ones represent the horror film audience.In the end, when the incomplete ritual leads the old ones to destroy the world, it's a tongue-in-cheek prediction of audiences panning this and other movies that doesn't follow the horror film conventions perfectly. More pointedly, as admitted by the creators, the ending is a critique of the horror film genre, basically saying that the genre in a rut and the slate needs to wiped clean, so fresh ideas can have a chance.Is the horror genre stuck in a rut? With the genre being been flooded by a steady stream of torture porn flicks for the last decade, it is no coincidence that in CITW, Maintenance (whose job is to be non-creative) bets on the Zombie Redneck Torture Family every year - and wins every year, too.But the horror film metaphor is not the only metaphor in the film.Drew Goddard has said, "the questions that Cabin raises all involve the treatment of youth in our culture. (...) We've always idealized youth, and then destroyed youth. That has happened since the beginning of time, and I'm fascinated by why we do that."I'm amazed at the number of reviews I've seen (especially from the professional reviewers), which describe the five protagonists as perfect matches for the five horror stereotypes, when the film repeatedly shows that they're NOT, even as the adults in the control room try to coerce and manipulate them into their predetermined roles. Curt, the "jock", is on a full scholarship and as Marty notes, would never insult his friend, even when drunk. Jules is neither dumb nor blonde, except at the behest of the manipulative adults. Holden is as much an athlete as Curt. Marty may be a pothead, but he's no fool. And Dana is not a virgin, as the director begrudgingly admits in the end.In the end, Cabin recalls The Breakfast Club: "You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out, is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess, and a criminal."Goddard again: "There's this need to marginalize (youth), and put them into different categories so that their voice is not important. (As I get older,) I find myself dismissing youth. You have to realize that the youth cannot be dismissed. At the end of the day, they're not going to care what we do to them, and yet here we are trying. That struggle is at the heart of Cabin."In other words: When the film declares that a civilization that inflicts such horrors on its children is not a civilization worth having, civilization is not just a metaphor for horror films. Civilization is a metaphor for civilization.Obviously, that is an audacious proposition. As can be seen right here on the IMDb message boards, many viewers have been left angry and confused, while other dismiss the metaphor immediately, focusing only on the more palatable horror film metaphor. But follow the Cabin's example, and entertain the idea for a little while. Even if you're not a youth, but an adult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of the horror genre at all. However, I am a big science fiction fan and I had read enough about this film for it to intrigue me.Yes, there was some gore, but it was relatively bearable. Much of it is shown fleetingly or at a distance. Yes, there are a number of shock surprises in the movie, one aspect of horror films that turns me off. Like in any horror movie, you have to steel yourself for the problem that pretty well anything can happen to anyone at any time. Yes, there are a number of unexplained plot holes large enough to drive a truck through.But despite all that, the movie -- whether accepted at face value or as a metaphor -- was interesting and worked beautifully.

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is not your average horror flick. Whatever preconceived notions you have of this film will quickly be turned upside down during the film's running time. Fans of the horror genre will do their nut with this selection, owing to the ubiquity of blood and guts, genuine scares and a bizarre supernatural finale.The script appears formulaic, what with scantily-clad college gals, the jocks, the token black guy and the stoner. That's where this film turns convention on its head: it is not what it appears to be. The brains trust behind this film includes the likes of Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (Fans of the horror genre may recall 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer.')The stars of the show are Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth and Anna Hutchison.The film kicks into high gear with expectations of the group of 5 college friends enjoying a weekend getaway in a remote locale. What happens there is beyond expectation. Horror fans will be perplexed throughout the film's duration and thoughts of 'The Truman Show' and 'The Ring' are likely to be conjured up. Banish them, because The Cabin in the Woods is nothing like what you're expecting. Prepare for sheer horror, because you're going to get it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmmmmm...what do I say about Cabin? Is it the most brilliant horror movie ever made? No. Is it the worst trash ever? No. So what is it?It's a twist of a script that doesn't just explain itself from the beginning. Thats why the reviews are so mixed. If you expected and enjoyed straightforward movies like Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek this ain't it. Definitely not a serious film. But.....even if you enjoy horror movies with a twist I found it lacking. The reveal near the end wasn't worth the 45 + minutes of "huh whats going on?" It was very funny. I found myself cracking up quite a few times. The jump factor is also good along with some creative CG. All and all the movie is just OK entertainment. Reviewers who call it groundbreaking must be teenagers who really haven't been around the block with Hitchcock and Corman.It does however remind a lot of a film I watched awhile back and really enjoyed which was called Waxwork. A fun campy horror movie not to be taken seriously and no CG. Check it out if you liked Cabin in the Woods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TCITW is a much-needed refreshment, in a genre that is dominated by clones. It's a sort of tribute to all types of horror films, a semi-parody, and a wild, imaginative, unpredictable ride, all rolled into one. All those who pathetically attempt to trash this film, futilely trying to find something to nitpick about, have to be out of their silly little minds. There are plot-twists, there's an original premise, violence galore, and a wonderful finale. What do you want more? A B-J from the movie? So if you're a deluded creature that is forcing yourself to hate this film just because another great horror film was finally made, and that annoys/upsets you for some reason, be my guest: I can smell your desperation from a thousand miles away. Haters of TCITW are the same people who rank "Avatar" as a masterpiece.For those of you who knew the essential premise/plot in advance, you only have yourselves to blame; I never watch trailers, nor do I care for the very staged/scripted/moronic interviews with actors/directors while they're hyping flicks, talking about what an "honor it was to work with him" and about how "generous" their co-stars were. Hence any movie can surprise me - provided it does actually have surprises. I knew absolutely nothing about TCITW, aside from the spoiler-devoid movie poster and the unusually high IMDb rating (for a horror flick), which actually made me suspect that this might be a major piece of crap, given this site's track-record i.e. taking into consideration how the average movie-going zombie "thinks" and votes.Even the obligatory comic-relief sidekick isn't half-bad. I can't remember the last time that an annoying buffoonish horror-film clown had an iota of a quality gag coming out of him. This one is interesting and actually serves a purpose in the story. And he doesn't spit one-liners all the time, smirking like a cretin, but actually shows real fear when a situation calls for it.TCITW gets a point off for the absolutely ridiculous wolf-kissing scene, and for including the vastly overrated, amazingly ugly Sigourney Weaver. As if it weren't bad enough that she infested four "Alien" movies and "Ghostbusters". Retire the damn nepotistic 6-foot witch already! Let her play mothers of trolls in half-a**ed fantasy Disney flicks.I would also have edited the movie in such a way as to give the viewer more time to believe that they're actually watching yet another "Evil Dead" re-hash. The introductory scene with the lab people gives away little, admittedly, serving more to confuse than to reveal anything, but it does hint that the events surrounding the five "teens" aren't what they seem. I would also have taken out the invisible force-field bird-disintegration scene; that way, when the "hunk" runs into it his demise would come as a total shock. In fact, I wouldn't have revealed the existence of the underground labs until the first half-hour is over. But this isn't a major criticism; no movie is perfect. There is definite regret that the movie finishes just as the end of the world is starting, but I suppose that something does have to be left to the imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its not like anything you ever seen ...its worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been reading some critics reviews together with few user reviews.Well the opinions are divided to those who loved the movie and those who hated it.Were do i stand? The first category loved the originality of the movie,the twisting in the plot and the combination of the horror with some taste of humor.II agree that there IS a change in the plot were you find yourself watching a hole different movie (wich doesn't comes as a surprise if you 've seen the trailer).So no,its not a classic horror movie about 5 typical youngsters who go die in a lonely cabin in the woods the type of Texas chainsaw or the hills have eyes as it appears at the beginning but it ind of made me wish it was.So in the first part,while you are watching another cliché (made this way on purpose ,but still)you could easily get bored if it wasn't of the sexy "performance " of the not-so talented but pretty skilled Anna Hutchison and the presence and only of young "Thor" Chris Hemsworth (girls,i know you love his eyes).Then..the stupidness starts.There is no real explanation behind anything that happens in this movie none that makes any sense (on my opinion even fantasy movie must have some rules,some boundaries or some explanation behind the actions of the characters or the incidents based in logic).Ghost zombies set free and start killing not to feed or to get revenge or any other hypothetically acceptable reason other than kill for the sake of the story.The lab scientists placing bets while watching fellow humans getting killed and having a party after-wards without any remorse or any feeling at all(even the worst kind of man would react some way viewing this .Even after years of being part of this doesn't make you heartless monster ready to bet and party on someones death or is this suppose to be a joke i did not get ?).All the mythological monsters suppose top be real? Has anyone noticed the buttons of the monitors on the lab?The devises look like the first computers with the huge buttons and levers..in a modern lab like this?!!!!Again..is there something i don't get?And this are just few that come to my mind.The movie is neither funny ,fun or scary in any way.A piece of bad acting,bad writing.The music is..was there any?It even gets too predictable at many points.I wouldn't have given it a 1 but again cause of the high score..Then again what reason is there for me not to give it a 1?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What can I say about this movie without spoiling!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try to, for this is a complicated horror movie. This is the type of movie for any person who says that they don't make original horror movies anymore. The trailers for this movie are an abomination, but yet they aren't. The trailers are good enough not to give away anything that the movie contains, and the movie contains a LOT of stuff to keep away from a two minute and thirty second trailer. But, still, don't watch trailer. Why would you do that? Don't, you need to go into this movie with no previous knowledge of what this movie is about, or what it contains. If you do, then this movie is just going to seem like a normal horror movie. If you have no knowledge prior to seeing this movie, then this is going to be the greatest horror movie of, quite possibly, the past ten years. It's so fresh! It seems so clichéd but they use that to their advantage, and it makes the movie ten times more fun! You have to go see it, and if you don't like it, then you are not a human being. You are Lil Wayne!I'll try to start off with a little plot synopsis, though what I'm going to say is not going to make the movie any less awesome with it's story developments. The simple plot is the most clichéd thing you will ever hear in your entire life. They make this sort of movie in low-budget, big-budget, 3D, 2D, terrible, REALLY terrible, decent, comedic, on the Syfy channel, in the theater, with good CGI, with TERRIBLE CGI, with puppets, etc. This movie takes that simple plot and turns it into one of the most awesome stories ever in a horror movie. I haven't even explained it, sorry. Here we go. The movie is about five college kids (okay...), the whore, the jock, the scholar, the innocent one, and the stoner, or, who I like to call, the hero (sounding very cliché). They decide to take a trip to this cabin in the woods where they can spend a weekend to party and get drunk and have sex, (this movie is going to suck.) Just the first ten minutes of the film, just by the first ten minutes, I thought the movie was going to be terrible, just by the opening. Although, the stoner does have so funny moments in the beginning, but nonetheless, I was very unimpressed. Then, they get to the cabin, and they play the very famous game that everyone has played, Truth or Dare. THIS is where the movie gets fantabulous! This is where you-know-what hits the fan, and the movie kicks off into one of the most fun experiences I've ever had. I heard this movie was made back in 2009, and it has just been sitting on the shelf for the past four years. The actors in this movie are quite unknown, and I'm sure back then if the movie had been released they would've been, too, but the only known actor is Chris Hemsworth, who is known now. Most likely, you are never going to see them in anything MAJORLY major like this movie again. There are two that I would like to see in movies, especially together, for they had great chemistry despite their totally different characters. Kristen Connolly, who plays the innocent girl, and Fran Kranz, who plays the stoner. They both have good chemistry together, and I think that they would work well in a comedy together. I like the rest of the characters, as well, but they were my favorite. I was rooting for all of them. Chris Hemsworth is convincing as the jock, but we could've figured that. Anna Hutchison is convincing as the whore, but anyone who wears skimpy clothing can pass off easily as a whore, but either way, she did a great job. Kristen Connolly is convincing as the innocent girl, trying to avoid trouble and being her innocent self. The rest of them are convincing, especially the stoner, Fran Kranz. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, who's roles I will not spoil, stole the movie in every scene they were in. They were a funny pair. As I said before, this is the most clichéd story in Hollywood B horror movies. I thought this movie was going to suck as I watched the first twenty-ish minutes, but once they got to the cabin, that's when things switch into awesome mode. They take all of the stuff from those types of movies and use it to their advantage, and the result is a set hilarious scenes in the movie. This movie had humor in it that just made the movie better, and from the trailers (which you should NOT WATCH!) it made it look like a serious movie, which it was. It had a lot of funny one-liners, too, especially from the stoner. He made the movie. The movie is so awesome because it treks so far off the normal path. The movie starts off normally, and then they play Truth or Dare. BAM! It hits you with a twist you are not expecting. Then, once you are starting to understand what's going on...BAM! Another twist, and then, once you are starting to understand what's going on, yet again...BAM! The movie is so amazing in it's ENORMOUS story developments. Then, when all the twists are over, and it's pretty understandable, all of the depths of Hell break loose, quite literally. If you want to see a movie where Hell breaks loose, no joke, go see this movie. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE just in front of your eyes. Then the movie ends, and the price of admission to this movie is worth the last thirty minutes. It will blow your brains apart. It's so awesome.OVERALL, I see this as a fun movie, go see it.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How much of a surprise is "Cabin in the Woods"? Well even its fairly basic title masks a much more elaborate and smart horror film, one where writer-director Drew Goddard (writer of another awesome horror film "Cloverfield) and his writing partner Joss Whedon (one of the great geek kings, both for creating "Buffy" and currently directing "The Avengers") have tweaked and twisted the genre to do as they please.It starts off predictably enough with college kids heading off to a relative's cabin for a weekend of fun. Smart-girl Dana (Kristen Connolly), her bland possible love-interest Holden (Jesse Williams), sex-pot friend Jules (Anne Hutchison), Jule's jock boyfriend Curt (Chris Hemsworth), and the lovable pothead friend Marty (Fran Kranz) all pile into the RV and on the way up meet the creepy old gas station attendant who warns them about the cabin. Fairly straight-forward horror so far, right? But why does there seem to be a force-field around the cabin? And who are these big brother scientists (played with both seriousness and harsh humor by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) who seem to be watching them, modifying the things around them, pushing them to make choices? The desensitization toward violence and bloodlust of the scientists will remind you a lot of "The Hunger Games" but "Woods" is actually laying in wait to unleash a wild and crazy mash-up of horror clichés that pull the audience one way then another and, by God, I sat there with a smile on my face the whole time, waiting to see where Whedon and Goddard were willing to take me next. Plus it's sexy, it establishes a terrifying mood, it's eccentrically funny (Kranz is right there with Jenkins and Whitford in the laughs department), and the blood is here and then some. It has all the horror movie conventions, yet does something unique by subverting where you think the plot, the characters, and basically Whedon and Goddard are choosing to go.</fullReview>

Overall, I would say it's a little over-rated, and not quite all that, but to horror aficionados it will be very entertaining. At least it is something different and creative than ordinary horror fare, even if the ending is flat and lackluster in my opinion.It has great special effects for sure and the actors are serviceable, if somewhat nondescript and uncharismatic. It is a movie filmed with some style, but if you don't go with it or find that quirky style appealing, you may dislike this. I enjoyed it in any event, with the caveat I'm an enthusiastic horror fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the worst movie in the decade, IMDb rating FAIL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems to be a joke of IMDb is one of the worst horror movies I've seen, is one of those cheap budget films less than a dollar. The rating you have, is people who see the new horror as something funny. They have no idea what the horror, it seems that they put 10 stars on so no panic. This movie wants to get out of the conventional, and stereotypes of horror movies. But fails completely. First with the typical characters, the athlete, the fox, the nerd, the virgin, and smart guy. It starts well, but want to take a dramatic turn when the viewer sees that behind everything there is someone who pulls the strings. Another error, unmemorable performances. Bloodbath for high school kids. This movie sucks, I lost 1 ? hours of my life watching this crap. Enter IMDb waiting for recommendations and watch horror movies I get. garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird movie?....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really understand why it has a good rate...8,2? Really? I went to see this movie and I didn't read any reviews or anything I just watched the trailer. The beginning was good, the dialogue are funny and all but...I was so disappointed by the end... it's not a horror movie at all. So I have read some reviews here and still don't understand why it is a good horror movie???!? Maybe it was a funny movie, okay, I admit that, but no a good horror movie... It wasn't that scary and I'm a pussy when I watch a horror movie! Plus, at the end I got so confused. What's the thing with the gods? That was a little bit weird... It looked like they didn't know what to put in the end and that's what they got...gods ending the world. Entertaining and funny yes! But not horror at all and disappointing ending. At least, Joss Whedon will convince me that he is a good director when I will watch The Avengers, because I'm pretty sure that this one will be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scooby Doo, Where Are You!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a cabin in the woods where stereotypical young adults go to play truth or dare, roll funny cigarettes and fight for their lives (and maybe solve a mystery). I wasn't hyped about this basic story that promised a twist, so therefore I wasn't disappointed. I was looking forward to seeing some quality horror and that I did. I'd say the film started on a high note, with good cinematography on display, but then, ironically, when the action started the mood went down. What a bland snoozer the music score was, I tell you. Well, at least it wasn't annoying.For my money Chris Hemsworth gave the best performance, a real good performance. In Thor (2011) his two note, angsty gimmick got old real fast, but he's not doing it in this one (though he's obviously doing it in Snow White And the Huntsman (2012), to which's trailer the Cabin In The Woods audience were introduced). Hemsworth's character, Curt the jock, is the glue that keeps the narrative and especially the dialog together. When he's not around the limitations of the others are highlighted. This has to do with writing as well. As long as things weren't (or didn't appear to be) horror/sci-fi, the characters acted like real people. When the zombies came out, it seems the writers put the breaks down to avoid "bloopers" from anyone but Marty the fool. Too self conscious? Not surprising, the Japanise "sub plot" got the biggest laughs, not the stoner gags.As for influences, apart from the usual suspects, there's a couple of similarities with my favorite sci-fi actioner They Live! (1988) and I also picked up a slight resemblance with The Osterman Weekend (1983). No, I won't go explaining these in a spoiler-free review. Mentioning them won't certainly spoil anything, quite the opposite, since I'm not going for the obvious. Why did I call for Scooby Doo so loudly? I wanted to call for something extra (not necessarily Scoob because it wouldn't be safe for him in this film). What we got was just OK. Instead of throwing in everything but the kitchen sink and try to play the horror fiction encyclopedia, they could have utilized one aspect to its fullest (like the trick mirror) and go easy on the theory.The monsters weren't scary, which is a big minus come to think of it. There's a creepier atmosphere in the 70s Hammer films that brought Dracula to modern times. I also prefer I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997). Imagine 90s Jennifer Love Hewitt in Kristen Connolly's role. Now you get it. Action? You came for the slasher action? It's there, arriving just a wee bit late and then not delivering all it could. Not the best of CGI. Mainly it doesn't deliver sense of danger. Some of the action in the last round had something else going for it, though, a dreamlike quality that will probably not transfer on DVD (or Blu-Ray).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>only if you have a taste for the alternative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the response from this movie is just awesome and I love that there are so many people that hated it. it's so perfect because it seems to me that apparently the "ancients" really were a pretty accurate representation of American movie-goers today and their insatiable taste for the lame. huge organizations going through all this trouble and money - every year - to entertain the "gods" (the American public) with cookie cutter story lines, nudity, cheap tricks and absurd gore and all the while providing the classic formula: young people + the occult + death of hated/envied young "**ores and jocks" + favorite heroine virgin. Same boring plot every damn year/movie, but they LOVE it, they eat it up and can't get enough. OTHERWISE the "gods" ? the people - FREAK THE F OUT -- quite like they have done in response to seeing this movie ---- wanting their money back because they didn't get their typical horror movie formula that they demand. (which, btw, those negative reviews actually probably have been convincing a lot of curious alternative-thinking people into seeing it after all.) speaking of which, the trailer IS very misleading and has clearly tricked a lot of people who wouldn't normally have seen it, into seeing it. which is a quite brilliant marketing strategy in my opinion, but anyway, in this case if you like the story and the look of the trailer, you probably will not like this movie. if you see something is very "off" in that trailer and you know that joss wedon would never poop out a movie like that, and if you enjoy satire, you'll enjoy it. I loved the movie, not for the social commentary but just because it was different and entertaining and creative. That being said, don't go see this movie if you tend to dislike weird/different "out there" movies and prefer more popular things or if you're just not in the mood to risk your money on something different. there's nothing wrong w/having taste in other things and you'll have a better time and feel better about spending your money if you see something less risky. Hunger games is pretty safe and it's a good movie, see that instead! you'll see what the hype is all about. But if you have a taste for the alternative and look for something different, you'll like cabin in the woods, it's definitely something unique. if you're uncool enough, you'll love it and you will probably find it to be pretty funny. it is a dream come true for sci-fi/horror nerds. Besides, the last 15 mins is so great, I cant see how anyone could disagree with that, but whatever. To each their own. you either get it or you don't, it's as simple as that.it is really sad to see how much our culture has become so numbed and uncreative... and saddest of all so UNWILLING to keep an open mind and experience something different. for that reason i LOVED the end --- I'll try to say this w/out giving anything away --- but the 2 kids basically saying "forget the typical audience, things need to change, you're either ready or you're not" kind of a thing. idk...clever stuff.</fullReview>

Curt - the main character is kinda cute - that's what my girl thinks and I guess she's right other then that really bad bad movie.

		<shortDescription>Rejuvenating spin on the horror genre. Funny, scary, gory and loads of FUN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a preview screening of this in London last night night.Its one hell of a fun and radical ride. Notice IMDb has only a two sentence synopsis for this film? Its for good reason. The least you know about the plot the better. In fact don't even read reviews...wait, you can read my one though! Just know that this is a horror movie that is scary, funny (in tone with Evil Dead 2, Zombieland and Scream) and very gory with an outrageously inventive script that makes this a refreshing and rejuvenating take on films with suggestive mundane titles such as...well, The Cabin in the Woods. Its not necessarily unique as all of its parts have been done before in past films but what is unique is how ingeniously it fuses those genres together. Even naming the different films its inspired from would be spoiling the fun.The performances by the 5 stereotypical friends are very enjoyable. The comic relief hippie , the sex driven couple, the shy dude and the shy girl. What raises my eyebrow a bit is that the actors look older than the ages they are meant to play but these are experienced and mature actors and so they probably deliver better performances as 19/20-ish year old than most 20 year old actors would. Chris Hemsworth, for instance, is 29 and though he doesn't look like a 20 year old, he acts it and his charisma more than makes up for that optical failure.There are a few surprises along the way including a nice cameo. Horror enthusiasts might also delight in picking up several horror references. You may or may not predict the ending, if you don't, good for you. To be honest the ending wasn't such a big revelation to me as it was intended to be but the roller-coaster journey ride made it all worthwhile.Its the perfect film to see with a lively Friday/Saturday night audience from which you'll hear both laughter and girlie screams aplenty (at least that's what I got from my audience). But just go and have a real fun time with this however you choose to see it.</fullReview>

The premise interested me but as other reviewers stated the switch been the cabin &amp; the corporate world left me slightly confused as to how to feel as every time any tension was built up it was quickly dissipated by the wise cracking suits. The ending of the film &amp; the reason for the journeys the participants are on is frankly ridiculous &amp; left a somewhat farcical feeling in me at the end. There are some interesting moments &amp; some nice homages to previous horror movies both in the US &amp; Japan , but overall I felt it could have been so much more &amp; felt like a missed opportunity to do something different. If I was you I would rent the evil dead again, but if its a free screening then why not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in the Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard the title I assumed it was a remake of some classic scary movie, but I investigated and found it was an original story, and I was also glad to see that the critics gave it a pretty good rating, four out of five stars, so I was hoping it would be a suitable amount of stars when I watched it. Basically five teenagers and college students, Dana Polk (Kristen Connolly), Jules Louden (Anna Hutchison) and her boyfriend Curt Vaughan (Chris Hemsworth), Holden McCrea (Jesse Williams) and Marty Mikalski (Fran Kranz) are heading for a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods. They are completely unaware that technicians are watching their every move and listening to their every word, because they are controlling what happens to them as they stay in the cabin, and they are not the only ones in the world, these technicians are creating bizarre scenarios in other countries such as Japan and Germany. The technicians are pumping in mind enhancing and influencing drugs so they will do things like be aware of things and have sex with each other, and they set up a diary in the basement so that one of them will read the pages and summon the Buckner family, all are dead and have become killer zombies. The events the teenagers are getting up are obviously being filmed, it is for the benefit of who the technicians are working for, like a reality show, so they are pleased to see Jules and Curt go outside to have sex, the sight of her breasts, and then them be attacked by the zombies, they kill Jules while Curt runs back to warn the others. Marty who is highly influenced by marijuana had paranoid suspicions before the strange things started happening, even finding hidden cameras in the walls, and he is sure that something is manipulating them, and then the zombies take him away. Dana, Holden and Curt get in the RV and plan to get away driving, heading through the tunnel that goes through the near hills, but the technicians set an explosion that collapses the rock into the tunnel, and then Curt thinks to use his motorbike to jump across to the other side of the raven, but an invisible security force field causes him to crash and fall to his death. Dana is sure now that Marty's suspicions were correct, and Holden is killed while driving in the RV back to the cabin, and crashing into the lake Dana gets away, the technicians are happy that they have completed their job and she is the last alive to be affected by fate, but in fact Marty is still alive. He finds her and shows her his discovery under the cabin of a secret trap door that goes down to an underground elevator, Marty has been immune to the technicians' attempts to influence him because of his high marijuana intoxication, and in the elevator the two remaining survivors pass numerous trapped monsters, all made to kill. Dana realises that the zombies up above were sent because of release activation, it was one of the objects in the cabin that determined they would be attacked by zombies, and when she and Marty reach the ground floor they explore the facility the monsters came from. The two of them get close to being caught by the security, but a large button is activated by Dana that releases all of the trapped monsters from their chambers, these include a psycho killer, a giant snake, a ghost, a merman and many others, and they start attacking the workers of the facility, including Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) and Wendy Lin (Amy Acker) who had been watching the cabin. After Dana unintentionally stabs technician Gary Sitterson (Let Me In's Richard Jenkins), she and Marty find a temple with large stone tablets with figure carvings that fill with blood when each intended victim has died, and they meet the Director (Sigourney Weaver) who explains that the technicians have been killing people across the world in sacrifice to appease the Ancient Ones who slumber below. She says that the certain archetypes are the ones who must die in a certain order, Jules was the whore and died first, Curt was the athlete and died second, Holden was the scholar and died third, Marty was meant to die fourth as the fool, and Dana as the virgin would have her fate decided by natural cause. The Director says that if this ritual is not carried out and there is no sacrifice made then these godlike creatures below will awake and the world will end because of the vast destruction by them, and she says that the rituals elsewhere have failed as well, so she gives the Dana choice to kill Marty and save the world, or face doom. In the end interruptions cause Dana to not give the theory of saving the world, the Director is killed by one of the zombies, Marty forgives Dana for threatening to shoot him, but they accept the fate the world will face, and see an amusing side that the earth needs a new race, and soon enough a giant hand crashes through the earth and crushes the cabin. The cast of young stars are fine, particularly Connolly and Kranz, and Hemsworth in his short time, and the actors playing the people watching are terrific being sadistic and enjoying their torture, the simple zombie attacking premise was good, villains watching them made it more interesting, but it got really good when you realise that the zombies are only one of the possibilities for how the victims could have been killed, the rooms of monsters was clever, and I wasn't expecting to see Weaver in it, overall it is a most worthwhile horror thriller. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, it was such a ride...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this slapstick comedy horror sci-fi film has many things to consider. The first opinion I can give is that Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard put on script and on screen lots of classic horror influences. So that makes "Cabin in the woods" a must see for every horror fan. Imagine mixing together Evil Dead, Jeepers Creepers, Cube, The Truman Show, 13 Ghosts, The Ring, IT and Braindead.. surely we find ourselves placed in one or another of these movies in several moments of the film, which could have been a mess.. or, in this case, useful to tell a different story, yet so familiar to us horror lovers. I think those references were put together on purpose, as a huge tribute film, certainly with sadistic humour, a few scary jumps, and not so many, but good gory scenes. I didn't like the ending, though; too much plot ambition and some holes in it. I think it's normal since the whole film worth the watch just for those elements. It's gritty, thrilling, entertaining, a little creepy. But mostly, cynical. Love cynical movies!!Still, Cabin in the woods is sooo weird. Ludicrously weird. That's good news for us fans. You'll finish watching it and asking -WTF did I just see? The final scenes are naturally misguided by an overthought plot. Not everybody can "do a Nolan" script. But that's a little flaw in an intriguing, well-delivered film. It has a virtue, too. It makes you try to predict what is going to happen next, and you'll never guess it. That's the definition of a good thriller. Especially in the first parts where you are forced to think what's the connection between those weird guys at the control center and the boys in the cabin.You'll like it, dislike it, and WTF about it all in same proportions. But certainly remember it as it is: a fresh cynical horror film with old elements. Cheers from Argentina!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept is original but the screenplay fools you into believing you're seeing a remake. During a college break, Curt (Chris Hemsworth), who has practically halved since 'Thor', invites four of his pals to his cousin's cabin for some R&amp;R. They declare the cabin to be 'beautiful'. The audience disagrees. We've seen Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' films. No sooner have they settled in, do strange things occur; things which would make rational people hysterical, but simply make these folk ask the searching question, 'What was that?' Here's the interesting bit: they're being watched. Not by zombies or other nightmarish creatures (although these do appear), but by ordinary people. It's their job. Think of it as a warped variation of 'The Truman Show'. I'll call them the Atrocity Bureau because that's a good name for them. The AB control everything within a several-mile radius of the cabin: the climate, geography, amount of pheromones in the air, undead ? everything. The AB watch Curt and co. and then have them killed ? by zombies, giant bats and snakes, and a whole manner of other nasties, most of which have been invented for this film. As they've become sanitised to their bestial business, they take bets on who'll die first. Why do they do this? Because it makes the Gods happy, that's why. The Gods were deities who once ruled Earth. They have this modus vivendi with humans which says that they'll remain dormant if the AB, Earth's oldest institution, every once in a while offer them a ritualistic sacrifice: human blood. Sounds like a great deal, if you ask me.The dark humour doesn't work; a straight horror might have been more effective. It's a stalwart first effort by first-time director Drew Goddard, though the tone of his TV associations ('Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Alias') is inherent throughout. 'Cabin' is TV-grade horror, which means it's horror without the roar.An excellent detail was to make the AB multinational. For once it's not just an American phenomenon. The East/West political subtext adds an interesting dimension. The main rivals are the Japanese, whose 'contestants' outsmart their AB. Instead of succumbing to individualism, they use solidarity as their weapon. I know you shouldn't judge a horror film by its discrepancies, but as no one is here to correct me, let me ask: Why would the Gods, i.e. omniscient, omnipotent beings entertain this unlikely arrangement? Are they Greek? It's preposterous, but that's not to say it isn't entertaining. It's entertaining alright; just full of absurdities and rather flimsy at the finale. www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

Chris 'Thor'Hemsworth did this one back in 2009 but was not released till now. maybe because to now capitalized on his new found popularity. he was cast very nicely as the 'The Hunky Guy'. One of the archtypical representative of all the so-called scary movies requisites.The lovely Kristen Connolly who here represent 'The Virgin'was more than just nice 'eye-candy' to look at. She did an good job acting this role out for what it was worth.The other teen actors, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams and Anna Hutchison were OK as the rest of the representatives of the typical teens. Only I had a problem with Jesse as a nerd. He no way looked like your typical nerd.Ha-ha Anna was nice but not as beautiful as Kristen. And Fran as 'The Pot-Head' milked the drug thing for what it was worth. Nice Bong though! (Ha-ha) Great character actor legends, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford did a very good sarcastic take as the supposedly villains of this piece.Amusing and somewhat funny too.And last but not least, Sigourney Weaver appears at the end as the head-honcho. She seems to be making this her norm because she did the precise almost identical role in Paul(2011)!!? In that one she also appears at the end as the head-honcho!!? And also, in both she dies!!? Ha-ha! My buddies who I went to see this one with, said it was good, but only good for one viewing and that's it. I disagree. It's worth a couple of viewings and then it's done! (Ha-ha)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. It was a fun spin on the clichéd American slasher setup. I don't want to give anything away in this review, and as with any film it's best to go in knowing as little as possible so you can be surprised, but the film doesn't depend on its twist, and a lot of what is going on is made clear from the very start. At one level this prevents any feeling of exasperation from seeing the familiar clichés trotted out, but part of me thinks that they should have had the courage to completely hide the twist for a lot longer. For one thing, this prevents the movie from building up any feeling of scariness until the last half hour when the events take a leap away from playing out the standard slasher movie script. I watch a lot of horror films, and seeing the references and riffs was a lot of fun, but by the end the movie really delivered on the chaos and action that I wanted to see. I'm only marking it down because of a few lapses in logic towards the end. It's a pity they had to be there, and they could have been eliminated from the script without too much trouble. It's especially disappointing as so much of the script depends on the gentle mocking of the contrivances of other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might seem novel, but I'm certain most Whedon fans won't be surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joss Whedon proved with Buffy that he has a knack for combining conventional horror tropes with a heavy dose of action and making something the masses could consume like popcorn. Cabin in the Woods is no deviation from a style that one who follows Joss Whedon's work might be accustomed to. It is both nothing you'd expect from a conventional horror movie, and everything you'd expect from a Joss Whedon project.With a storyline seemingly ripped from the Buffy-verse these Whedon-esque clichés may seem novel to casual movie goers, but they are concepts no Whedon fan will be surprised to see. The long standing working relationship between Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon is no secret as the two have collaborated on many projects; however, Drew Goddard's only input may have been to mislead the audience using a surrealist approach while establishing some basic horror truisms. The characters and the dialogue are completely flat;nonetheless, that is something I would expect from Joss Whedon as I don't find him to be a very capable or compelling writer. Drew Goddard's direction compliments Joss Whedon's writing nicely, but I can't shake the feeling that Joss Whedon had a heavier hand in its direction then we may be led to believe.Cabin in the Woods is good popcorn fun, and for viewers new to Joss Whedon's style its storyline may seem fresh and even innovative. At its core Cabin in the Woods is an action movie in horror movie's clothing - much like the Buffy television series. While Cabin manages to float on some sharp ideas the execution is nothing special, and nothing new, and does little to breath new life into the action or horror genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What did I just watch?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland So absurd, it works; with maybe the most shocking aspect of "The Cabin in the Woods", the new Independent Slasher film from director/co-writer Drew Goddard (Cloverfield), being how this intriguing film had been shelved for almost three years. Beginning as a horror film 101 story and then progressively becoming odder and odder, Goddard seems to have found a new angle in the genre, simply by making a film which is entirely predicated on keeping the audience in a state of confusion, all the while keeping the entertainment level high throughout. And I enjoyed nearly every minute of it. But as much as I enjoyed this odd little horror film, there will undoubtedly be some who will absolutely hate it. Hate it, simply because in the midst of watching the movie, there will come a moment when one must throw out everything they think that they know about the horror films of today; and almost shelve their belief, as it were. And truthfully, that sooner it happens, the more you will enjoy the movie. Maybe the greatest compliment I can give "The Cabin in the Woods" is that its wide audience appeal, while hard to explain, does definitely exist.Synopsis: Directly referencing Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead", "The Cabin in the Woods" starts off as a pretty routine Slasher film, where 5 teenagers (one slut, one jock, one nerd, one pothead and one good girl) go on vacation to a cabin in the woods (for some reason). It then takes one wildly outlandish turn after another, until it erupts into its gruesome, scary, very smart, funny and (most importantly) fresh climax, that no fan of any genre will see coming. To give you an idea of what I mean by "outlandish", there is a scene where a unicorn actually impales a man; and it's played for laughs. Yeah, it's that kind of movie. In saying that, "The Cabin in the Woods", in the age of bad Slasher remake after bad Slasher remake, is one of the most original horror films/horror satires there has been since "Scream". Blasphemy, I know. But the fact is, aside from being a film that is punctuated be being released at the right place during the right decade, "The Cabin in the Woods" is a film well worth checking out.As far as the superb comic timing goes, it does work here on a very self aware level. And this self awareness (or continuous winks at the audience) are so well constructed, that when the violence and overt sexual references do occur, and the film becomes cluttered with satirical references that may be lost on many, the supremely clever sidebars constantly keep "The Cabin in the Woods" engaging.Side Note: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and consummate supporting actress Kristen Connolly have substantial roles in this film; as well as the always wonderful Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) and a surprise cameo by?well I won't spoil it. But the acting, excluding Jenkins (who is superb here) will not factor in on whether you loved or hated "The Cabin in the Woods", so this aspect really isn't worth discussing.Final Thought: I am not going to say that this was better than last year's surprise horror film "Insidious" or than 2009's seldom seen "House of the Devil"; it's just different. And again, this type of horror film isn't for everyone. Some may find that the plot twists here so off-the-wall that they may tune out all together. In fact, "The Cabin in the Woods" will work more for camp horror fans, than for the blood thirsty Slasher lovers, pretty much because it isn't a straight forward Slasher. BUT, as far as satires go, it may only be a notch or two below a film such as "Shaun of the Dead". What I mean by that comparison is that, "The Cabin in the Woods" displays one of the only instances that show a successful horror flick, which audiences can laugh with and not laugh at.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

		<shortDescription>eh, it was OK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers below:I went into this movie with very few expectations. I had not seen the trailer and I had only heard about it when I decided to go to the movies and checked what was playing. Seeing the high rating at IMDb and rotten tomatoes I decided to give it a shot. I am not a huge fan of horror movies, but I do enjoy things which are creepy/psychological. I avoid movies if I think there is a lot of gore, and at the beginning of this movie I was a bit worried about the gore factor, but there is, in fact, very little gore. Someone said it should be 17+ but I am not sure why. The "Nightmare on Elmstreet" movies are way more disturbing and I saw them when I was a kid. Yeah, there are some boobs in this movie...big deal. Otherwise I think it's OK for teens who like horror movies.I cannot for the life of me understand people who said the ending was a big shocker. As soon as blood was poured through that outline of a figure it was obvious to me what was going on. That was pretty early in the movie. I found the ending to be a bit of a let down, as there was nothing really surprising or mystical. In fact I thought it was just cheesy. (Spoiler!) When Richard Jenkins' character said "kill him" I really hoped there'd be someone around the corner who could be killed, someone who was controlling everything. So...what was really there just seemed dumb. And we never found out who was "upstairs," that would be interesting. The last two characters' attitude towards everything at the end was also pretty comical. Maybe that was the intention - this movie kind of shows people's weakness and unwillingness to sacrifice, instead of the willingness to sacrifice which is shown in war movies.This is more of a bloody comedy than anything. It might be similar to "Zombieland." I guess it is also like "Cloverfield" as some people have already said. Some of the details were amusing - the room with all of the objects, each connected with a horror character, was neat, and seeing them all together in different boxes was also impressive. I also found that invisible grid (and (spoiler!) the scene with the main "athlete" character, when he tried to jump to the other side of that canyon or whatever you'd like to call it) to be interesting. The rest of it was so-so. I would say it is a watchable movie and somewhat new in its approach, but it is not really a horror movie. Thriller, yes, but not horror and not really psychological either. It is kind of funny to see this movie come out at the same time as "The Hunger Games," because it seems like there's something similar between the two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not funny, and it's not scary... So?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite looking forward to seeing this one. I stayed away from any reviews or synopsises in order to experience the film as ignorant as possible ( I'd recommend this for all). All I did know was that Joss Wheden was behind it and it did something interested with a genre that's had several leg transplant surgeries already.Based on that small amount of info, I admit I was expecting a good deal of lampooning and perhaps something I hadn't seen before. I got this - to a degree. But it's nothing near as satisfying as it should be. This is principally because it's trying to do a lot with playing to genre conventions, while also tearing them apart, is a lot to do in the running time. While I understand why they had to include the set up, due to its pace it feels severally undeveloped and ultimately takes you away from the more interesting 'twist' stuff the film has going for it. This is evidenced in the final 20 minutes, which I found both significantly more fun and developed that the first hour. Had the focus been here throughout it could have explored an interesting premise without skirting around plot and character devices. But hey, maybe next time eh? An enjoyable hour and a half, but not the game changer I was hoping for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let's open up the blender and put in some of the following: - every stereotype for slasher/horror-movies we can find - a dash of Natali's Cube - a little bit of Clive Barker... including Midnight Meat Train... and the let us all hope the Joss Whedon is the one pulling the strings...So, what about the outcome of this experiment? very enjoyable, stuffed with everything you could want to see in a horror-movie plus lots of extras... an evil unicorn? :-)what did I miss? Surprises and the proper time to really enjoy everything... it felt like a roller coaster ride, rather than a horror movie... things happen predictably and fast. Furthermore the two parallel layers spoil each other a little too much. Think of something like the French one "martyrs". Its strength was that it felt like two different movies in one with a painful twist in the very last moment. If CabinInTheWoods would have been able to achieve something like that, it would have certainly blown me away. That's why it's for me only a 7 and not an 8.5 ;-) I want to apologize to Drew Goddard for not being able to praise him enough for this one, since I cannot relate to his work (yet?)... maybe his connection to the total randomness in his collaborations with J.J. Abrams in the past have spoiled my image of this movie. Changing the rules of a universe to keep the audience watching AND CONFUSED is like cheating... On the other hand: CabinInTheWoods sticks to it's own rules from the first to the very last moment. Thank you for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takes a basic horror movie plot and makes it completely original, this could be the one that saves the dying genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! I'm surprised. Genuinely surprised. I watched the trailer for this film and wrote it off as another cliché slasher flick meant for 16 year old kids to make out to on a Friday night. I told myself I wouldn't go see it, as it would be a waste of money and I'd leave the theater disappointed in yet another failed attempt at a horror film. But, after a few more viewings of the trailer, and after a few friends raved about it, I decided to hit the late showing one night when I was wired with nothing else to do. From the near-perfect opening scene, I knew this movie would be more than I expected. And it proved to be just that. From start to finish, this is a pulse-pounding, terrificly acted, well-written and ultimately great film. Not just a great horror film, but a great film in general. There are so many twists, turns, and curve balls thrown at us that you can't keep track. The special effects and makeup is top- notch work, and this is the first movie I've seen in I don't know how long that actually had an effective jump scare! I know, I couldn't believe it either. This film is truly great because it takes every tired, played out genre cliché and breathes new life into it, making for an entirely original and thrilling movie. This one is highly recommended. If you're a fan of horror films but have been disappointed by every single one since last year's Insidious like me, then you will be floored by this flick just as I was. If you're not really a horror fan, you will still find yourself falling in love with it because of it's sheer originality and brilliant screenplay and performances. Don't miss this one folks. Overall: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't insult me. I'm a true horror fan and I LOVED this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the reviewer who said 'if you're a true horror fan over the age of 15, you will HATE this'... how wrong you are. Maybe you forget the pure joy of sitting in the dark and screaming and laughing? I LOVE movies and I LOVE horror. I am a true horror fan. I am 35 years old. I have a degree in film and cultural studies and I am passionate aboute the craft. But not just the craft of making art, also about the craft of making excellent popular movies. This is a great example of the latter.FYI, my favourite horror movies include 'Martyrs', 'Rec', 'A Tale of Two Sisters', 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Shining'. That said, I truly enjoy a balls-to-the-wall well-made horror gong-show and this is that movie.Is it perfect? Of course not. But it IS the most entertaining, risky mainstream horror in recent years. Yes, risky. 90% of mainstream US horror these days is so by-the-numbers-cell-phone-brigade-friendly it makes me want to cry. TCITW turns that on its head; I can honestly say I had no idea who would live or die and what the hell was going to happen next. It is genuinely funny, and even for someone who had pretty much deconstructed the trailer, the third act was not what I was prepared for. I knew something twisted was coming; who didn't? But the execution was excellent. Unicorn disembowelling?! You think the filmmakers threw that in there for any other reason than to be ridiculous? We are post-post modern now. Embrace this for what it is - a whacked out, well made and knowing horror-comedy that pushes all the right buttons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh take on horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror films today have been very predictable and and often a little too concentrated on making people jump than having a unique storyline. Paranormal activity 1,2 and 3 are all the same with exception of a different house, scream is a bunch of bad acting teenagers running away from a man in a black bed sheet not to mention the upcoming far fetched film Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, the man abolished slavery not hunt vampires. The Cabin in The Woods however, takes the typical scary horror of high school kids being attacked in the woods and adds to it a technological aspect. This is in fact Drew Goddard's (Writter of Lost and Cloverfield)first ever directed film and I for one really enjoyed it.The outcome and reasoning of what happens in the end doesn't make much sense and could have been far better written. It feels like its quickly been finished. A clever horror will leave the viewer thinking it may happen to them but cabin in the woods is too out there to believe.Overall a great film, something you can watch and really not know what will happen next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally innovative horror - Best of 2012 so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America churn out movies like McDonalds churn out burgers and both are as bland and unoriginal - you know what you're going to get right from the start. With 5 of your typical teenagers heading for "a cabin in the woods", this has all the hallmarks of yet a nother, the likes of which we have all seen and forgotten many times. However, this movie really bucks the trend in all regards. The acting is good, the effects are excellent and the plot will really surprise. Its the most innovative 'horror' movie I have seen in years.There is a reasonable splattering of humour throughout and the pace of the movie is maintained from the start. I would recommend not reading too many reviews, you really don't want to have the plot spoiled. This is a must see movie - thoroughly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What our dreams are from</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Well I was not ready for the horror genre to be turned on its ear, but that's exactly what co-writers Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard (also director) have done here. Rest assured that your favorite aspects of horror films will be lampooned, or at least parodied. There are times you will jump and laugh simultaneously, but mostly I found myself checking off the influences/targets of the filmmakers.There is no way to comment on this film without offering up spoilers, and I will not do that. What I can tell you is that you'll be reminded of films such as Scream, Friday the 13th, Bubba Ho-Tep, Night of the Living Dead, The Evil Dead, Saw, and dare I say, elements of The Twilight Zone ... you know the parts where you know there is more going on than you are seeing, but you can't quite put it all together.The movie starts out with a tongue-in-cheek assembly of generic characters from most horror films: the fun-loving jock (Chris Hemsworth, pre-Thor), the "bad" girl (Anna Hutchison), the "good" girl (Kristen Connolly), the brainiac (Jesse Williams), and of course the comic relief stoner waxing philosophical (a very effective Fran Kranz). This group piles into a borrowed RV and heads to the cabin. And yes, we get the obligatory stop at the run down gas station manned by the straight-from-Deliverance attendant played by Tim De Zarn.We learn quickly that something odd is going on and our heroes are really playthings in some kind of cosmic game being conducted at an underground lab run by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. That much is shown in the trailer and that's the end of what I can say. After that, the choice is yours ... just like in the basement.I have no idea who to recommend this to because the last 15 minutes are pure mayhem, and you will either be fully onboard with this Disneyland ride gone bad, or you will have wanted to leave for the past hour. The movie was selected for opening night at SXSW and it truly is a twisted, even demented jab at all things horror. Only you can decide what comes next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cabin in the woods is smart, knowing and occasionally funny and can be interpreted in a mind bending number of ways.If you are prepared to dwell on the films themes of horror clichés, teenager stereotypes and even the relationships between the old and young then this film will keep you entertained long after it has ended. Though not a perfect film, it is slow in its build up and the zombies are uninspiring and a little boring as the teen stalkers. I was hoping all sorts of beasts were going to be unleashed upon them on purpose or by accident by the two old incompetent underground control technicians but we had to settle for the tried and tested redneck zombies.Evil Dead 2 it is not.The 'meta' steps up its game in the films last 40-30 mins and we are treated to a fun slice of crazy as the underground techies get over cocky and underestimate the teens who somewhat outsmart them and make their way down into the inner workings of the machine only to be confronted (and us teased) by what COULD have terrorised the cabin in the woods. There is no real logic to this film and that is what ultimately lets it down. We are made to believe that these unsuspecting kids are more 'real to life' than the usual bunch of college clichés that are over- abundantly slashed and diced in modern horrors. The players in this game are smarter and don't just go off on their own or willingly take off their clothes in the dark scary woods. Instead they have to be manipulated into doing so by the techies' cunning tricks (both times spraying chemical gasses at them). So how does the girl stay alive and even cracking jokes right up to the climax of the film after being horribly bashed around by a zombie for 5 minutes and mauled by a werewolf for 2? And that also goes for the pot-head, wasn't he stabbed through the chest and dragged through the woods by his feet coughing up blood? These 'real' kids must have super powers or something because they not only survive but they do allot of running about.Some might say that those minor qualms can be explained by it being a parody but I can't forgive it so easily.As you would expect from the guys involved in writing or making TV's Lost and the film Cloverfield it has a twist. The twist is fun and bathes the film in a light-hearted afterglow allowing you to forgive it it's foibles slightly.I have been musing over this film for quite some time now and have realised it touches on much more than you initially realise while you watch it and perhaps it has more ideas shoehorned in than the visuals or logic can keep up with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Cabin in the Woods" Rejuvenates a Tired Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Cabin in the Woods" is a slasher film for folks who don't like slasher films. That's because this film doesn't like the slasher genre either. It satirizes the hell out of it and then adds a heavy dose of repentance and Biblical-like retribution. There's some nice performances especially Kristen Connolly as Dana the intelligent and resourceful girl in the group of twenty-something explorers who venture into the wilderness and end up getting more adventure than they bargained for. Fran Kranz is very good as Marty the joker who has devised an ingenious delivery system for getting stoned. Chris Hemsworth and Anna Hutchison are the jock and his girlfriend. Completing the group is Jesse Williams as Holden the serious-minded college student who declines an opportunity to see Dana au natural. There's also a family straight out of "Night of the Living Dead" and a mysterious group of techie types who observe and manipulate Dana and friends according to some preconceived plan. If Wes Craven began the process of poking fun at slasher films, Goddard and Whedon have added self-criticism and social commentary while keeping you entertained throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cabin in the Woods (2012) - Horror Movies at Their Finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Drew Goddard, joined by producer/co-writer Joss Whedon, "The Cabin in the Woods" is the newest addition in the horror genre of motion pictures. This movie was quickly adored by fans of the horror film genre. Now, you will walk into this movie suspecting to see one of the most stupidest and un-scary movies that Hollywood keeps releasing to theaters nowadays. But, that's when you realize as the movie puts you on the edge of your seat, you are brought on the roller-coaster. Now, I'm not technically a horror film fan, but I am one of the many fans of classic thriller films such as "The Shining". But, I must say, I was very impressed by the results of this movie. Well, the storyline of this 95-minute motion picture is better to be left unspoiled. But, what I can say is that the recycled plot of a group of college idiots, who visit a cabin in the woods, and might get slaughtered, is used rather expertly and perfectly in this movie. But, that's not the real premise of this movie! Like I said, the premise of this movie should be left unspoiled! This movie helps prove that the horror genre still lives up to all movie fans. But before, the horror films that were released were basically filled with cheap scares, and laughably bad sequences of acting and thrill. Now, after watching this masterpiece of horror, I gained a deeper appreciation for the horror genre. Written with such clever and hilarious dialouge provided by Joss Whedon, the first half of this movie feels like an R-rated comedy with characters that are beautifully realistic, and accurate to the many stereotypes of the college years, from the hot chick, the athlete, the brain, the fool, and the virgin. Provided with such memorable performances from Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Jesse Williams, and Fran Kranz, in a scene-stealing performance as the hilarious stoner who seems to believe that something is not right in this little cabin, this movie knows how to capture the essence of real-life college students, and their idiotic behavior. Then the moment when you see the basement door pop open randomly, this movie quickly changes into a survival horror film, where the college freaks might possibly get killed along the way. The horror moments are perfectly executed, and they leave you on the edge of your seat, and they leave you wondering throughout, "what the hell is going on?". I probably haven't been this scared in such a long time, and now this movie changes the way I see horror films. This movie is a perfectly executed mixture of comedy and horror, that audiences might not have seen very often. Not only is this movie a tribute to those who love horror movies (since this movie contains references from the classic horror films of the past), but it's also a tribute to those who love film, as well. Audiences will praise the perfectly timed scares, the accurate acting, the pulse-pounding suspense, the smart writing, and the perfectly timed comedy. You will walk out of this movie, the same way I had. After spending a fantastic 95 minutes in the theater, filled with one scare after the other, you won't stop thinking about the characters and the "thrills &amp; chills" for days. So, basically, there is nothing where the movie fails. Not only does this movie poke fun at the horror film genre, but it also pays tribute as well. It takes all of the usual horror clichés, and making them new and different, and while creating a new story that nobody has seen in a movie like "Cabin in the Woods". Everything, from the acting to the writing to the scares! This is a dark, graphic, and faithful tribute to the genre of horror films. This is also one of the best movies of the year by far! "The Cabin in the Woods", in my review, "a thrilling and entertaining heart-stopper, terrifying and deserving".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We chose," says Dana (Kristen Connolly), the Final Girl in The Cabin in the Woods. As the Final Girl in a slasher film, Dana has arrived at her proper place, the place you anticipate from this movie's start. She's been witness to her friends' terrible fates and is now decoder of the horrific puzzle. In this case, she means that she and her friends?who all decide to spend a night in the titular cabin and who all go in the titular woods.In other words, Dana's realization that she and her friends "chose" is both her fate and your payoff. In other other words, slasher aficionados know their own places, a point made extra-clear by Scream, though you surely knew it before then: watching a movie when you know the rules means you anticipate what's going to happen, and anticipation?of the victims' terror, their abuse, and their terrible fates?is key to your pleasure. You expect types of victims and monsters, as well as blood and screaming and diabolical violence. You expect kills.The Cabin in the Woods delivers all this and something else too, a framing device that's established in the very first scene, when Hadley (Bradley Whitford) and Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) head off to work, chatting about the office pool and what they anticipate. Thus the movie, like many movies before it, incorporates a veteran audience to mirror its own veteran audience. They frame a story that is familiar by definition: Dana and her friends are packing for their trip, each arranged according to a limited range of types: Dana's the Final Girl (so designated by her lack of a boyfriend), Jules (Anna Hutchison) is the sexy girl, affiliated with a handsome, jockish, and also book-smart boyfriend named Curt (Chris Hemsworth). He brings along a date for Dana, his new wide receiver Holden (Jesse Williams), and they bring along the requisite stoner, Marty (Fran Kranz), whose fuzzy truth-speaking will not be recognized by the others until it is Too Late.Their adventure in the woods goes as you expect: they meet the creepy guy in overalls (Tim De Zarn), here named Mordecai and presiding over a last chance gas station, with rusting pumps and a sign that says "Closed." He spits and squints and essentially embodies a warning to go no further, a warning the kids ignore and you appreciate for its combinator's earnestness and mordancy. The kids don't get much that follows, which is, of course, their job. They head to the cabin (Clover's "Terrible Place"), where they settle in for an evening of seemingly transgressive and completely predictable behavior: they smoke dope, play Truth or Dare (which leads to Sexy Girl's display of her gumption when it comes to sex), and wander into the cellar when the door slams open on cue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Postmodern horror melting-pot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The pre-title sequence alone suggests that this film isn't going to stick to the well-beaten genre path. Also, any film using Bradley Whitford and the music of OK Go is not simply going to run out the usual tropes and twists; invention is the vernacular.In fact, the biggest twist of this film happens very early on and so makes discussing the narrative without giving anything away rather tricky. However, the story of the film is actually not as important about the way it's filmed, about how the characters and their involvement is treated. The Cabin In The Woods succeeds - it's an exciting, funny, easy-going horror - because it plays with the idea of postmodernism. Simple irony is old hat so Drew Goddard and (unsurprisingly, the writer of self-aware sci-fi Serenity) Joss Whedon tell a story that gives the audience the slack of self-awareness whilst repeatedly reeling them in with the taught line of the plot.Shock and gore a-plenty, there's also plenty to laugh at and a class A cameo to look forward to. Go with friends. 7/10</fullReview>

I was one of the people who loved it. I want to start off saying that the writing could not of been more genius! The characters, the plots, and the situations- I had no idea who to root for! Every character was completely memorable and every line of dialog or shot had me on the edge of my seat. Terrified or laughing hysterically. I can tell there will be a lot of people who wont like this movie(just like any other movie) simply because it gives this generation in such a negative outlook on society. I say, So what? Yah! there are a lot of idiots in this gen. just like every other one before us! These idiotic-badass characters will be iconic representations of my generation for a long time, and i for one don't mind it all! If you love genius comedy with a crazy-doesn't-make-sense plot to go along with it that'll have you on the edge of your seat, see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind-blowing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to say that first of all I'd advise you not read any reviews or watch any trailers for this film. I wouldn't even read this one if you haven't seen it yet because although I will really try not to give anything away, I can't be sure because I haven't yet looked into the future. The fact is "The Cabin In The Woods" is like "The Ordeal" in the sense that with "The Ordeal" or you need to know before watching it is that a singer's car breaks down in the woods. Similary with this film all you need to know is that 5 young adults stay at a cabin in the woods. Luckily when I went in I didn't know too much and so I didn't know what to expect at all, but I certainly didn't expect to see what I did see. Just leave all your logic at the cinema's car park (or DVD case if you're reading this in the future) and prepare to have your mind blown.I don't mean to hype this up or anything but it is as good as everyone does say and it took me some time after the film had finished to adjust to that. I wasn't expecting "The Cabin In The Woods" to be so insane or 'out there' that I was shocked, and I didn't know if it was pleasantly. When the film did finish I couldn't make my mind up if what I just saw was completely brilliant or just cr*p, or if I loved it or hated it (to be fair I was leaning over to the 'love' side just because I had a ball watching it). But, once I had time to gather my thoughts, because "The Cabin In The Woods" does surprisingly give you a lot to take in, I realised that I had just seen a masterpiece. It's revolutionary and is probably the king of all slashers because it manages to explain them so well, with it being also marvellously entertaining. It manages to dissect the slasher sub genre and almost the whole horror genre itself in a even braver way than "Scream" did! "The Cabin In The Wood" has been described as this generations "Scream" and I think I have to agree, I just hope we don't get any "Cabin" copy-cats which "Scream" created! The film opens up in a unusual way and manages to set the vibe you're about to sit yourself in for. We get some stereotypical horror-movie titles with blood dripping down and pictures of old sacrifices and then it's immediately juxtaposed with two technicians having an every-day chat in an office-type building, which almost acts as a oxymoron for what you were expecting. Then the titles flash up on the screen, which I loved because it was unexpected and also not really fitting, which is really what describes the film. And then the first 20 minutes or so show us the stereotypical slasher film, it's amazingly clichéd, but it's clichéd for a reason. We've got our stereotypical five friends, one couple and one 'potential' couple and then we've got the drug-taking nut-case who is actually quite likable, unlike most druggies in horror films who are so annoying that you can't wait to see them die! And then they go off to the cabin, your stereotypical replica of "The Evil Dead" after stopping at a "Wrong Turn" slash "The Hills Have Eyes" styled petrol station that's run by a crazy hill-billy. It's all marvellously done and is basically everyone's schema of a slasher film.But once the basement opens it becomes far from your stereotypical slasher film. It becomes a non-stop exciting fight for survival and that's all I'll say about it. The bottom line is that it's really fun and sometimes quite scary. The final 25 minutes or so actually end up as being one of the craziest sequences since the big mum ending in Peter Jackson's "Braindead". It's bloody, chaotic and also serves a purpose. "The Cabin In The Woods" is an extremely intelligent horror film as well as being "Breathlessly entertaining" as a quote on the poster promises. It's wonderfully wittedly written by Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard who's work I've been impressed with on "Cloverfield" and "Let Me In". "The Cabin In The Woods" really does show their true potential though, by presenting something so simple and stupid and then turning it into something incredibly complex, intelligent and high-concept. It's sort of like a fun/funny version of "Martyrs" in that when you think it's going one way it goes in a completely different direction and throws you off. It's fabulous. Also, all the characters are actually likable, which I always say is the body of a good slasher film.I really admire films that are brave and "The Cabin In The Woods" could've turned into a confused mess. But luckily by not taking itself seriously (at all!) and structuring itself carefully, it turns itself into an incredibly memorable horror comedy. It presents a disturbing view of reality and the slasher genre, but what's even more disturbing is that something this spectacular was sitting on a shelf for three years gathering up dust! And the reason behind that is even more disturbing! They were thinking about converting it into 3D. That would be a tragedy and would perhaps suck out its substance, by putting its style first.It absolutely deserves a perfect 10 but, people who have never seen a slasher film before are likely to disagree. I saw this film almost one week ago and it still hasn't been out of my head (which isn't the best thing when your A-level exams are 3 weeks away) which you can't say for many films. Also it really is so unique that you couldn't give it any less. Oh, and I'll give you one million pounds if you saw the ending coming a mile off. I can't wait to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't go down those stairs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You don't see many movies that combine horror and comedy, at least not successfully. The last one to really pull that off was probably Scream. There have been some films in the genre like Shaun of the Dead and Slither, but those focused more on the comedy and were not really scary. The Cabin in the Woods is a new film which has some legitimate scares and also keeps the audience laughing at the same time.The film has a familiar setup of 5 young, good-looking people staying overnight at a remote cabin in the woods. They're even the stereotypical characters you'd expect to see in a horror film - a jock, a shy guy, a stoner for comic relief, etc. But what's different is that the group is actually being watched the whole time. They're not being watched by some serial killer in the woods or anything like that, but rather via surveillance cameras by an entire company. We learn this early in the film so I'm not giving anything away here. The question that lingers through the film is why are they being watched... is this some sort of test? Are they part of some crazy reality show? Things begin to happen to the group that are straight out of typical horror films. So you also wonder why the people watching them are so okay with what's happening to them. In fact, they have certain control over the situation and are even able to make their own adjustments.That's basically what keeps you so interested in the ongoings of the film. Instead of just watching these kids try to avoid being killed like any other slasher film, you're watching these other people watching the same thing as you are and wondering what they might do next as well. Just like Scream, The Cabin in the Woods takes the horror genre and tries to re-invent it by doing something completely different. Both films show us what we've seen so many times before with a new perspective. In a way, it's like they're addressing the tired clichés of these films and showing that you can put a fresh spin on them.The one thing I don't get is why the early buzz on this movie keeps implying there are some big twists in it. Like I said, we know the whole time that they're being watched and that those watching them have some control over the situation. There's no big revelation at the end that would have fooled you or contradicted what you thought was taking place; that's what's necessary to be considered a "twist". But I will say that the movie is well worth seeing, especially for the final 20 minutes alone which will blow some people's minds. It's pretty much a horror fan's dream come true as far as the amount of action and monstrous visuals we're bombarded with. In fact, the end made me wish the film had used something better than what they did use to scare the kids with through most of it. You realize the filmmakers could have taken a much more creative route than what they had the kids running from. That being said, check this out if you're looking for a good horror film that breaks from the norm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can i say...this film is truly awful. Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen....totally lost for words. It started off like a horror version of the Truman Show, but just got worse and worse. You never know whether its an experiment gone wrong or whether the things are actually happening. The film contains its own spoilers right from the start. Written differently it could have been quite a good movie, but it just seems a parody of every horror film ever made. Wooden acting and no real story line to it at all. I just hope they don't waste any money on making a sequel. I'll be giving that one a miss for sure. Total waste of 90 minutes of my time. I even asked the cinema for my money back + the car parking fee. Awful truly awful. -10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Um, no, "Cabin in the Woods" is NOT a "horror" film....but it IS a great comedic satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, for those who have seen the film, or just the previews, and wonder why the uber-hunky Chris Hemsworth's hair is short when he needs it long for his current stint as Thor, "Cabin in the Woods" was actually filmed in 2008 and then sat on the shelf for three years due to MGM going bankrupt. And being a so-called "horror" film, it was never a priority. Alas, it finally saw the light of day, which leads me to my next point...Which is, well, secondly, "Cabin in the Woods" is not really a "horror" film. Many are giving it high praise for being a completely original entry into the genre, some calling it one of the best horror films ever made. And, well, sorry, but they are all wrong, as this film is not actually a horror film. It is a comedy and a satire OF horror films, but due to the concept, there is absolutely nothing horrifying about it. At all. Nope, not even remotely scary.Why is that? Because I've seen literally hundreds upon hundreds of horror films? Well, as that could be true, it is actually because the horror and fear factor is stripped completely because everything you see on screen is controlled.The story is simple. Five stereotypical horror clichés get together and head to a...you guess it...cabin in the woods which resembles the one used in the greatest horror film ever made, "Evil Dead," almost exactly. However, it is no coincidence each character is a stereotype nor that they got pulled to this cabin in particular. Without giving the plot away completely, I'll say as much as you learn within the first ten minutes of the film: everything that will happen at the cabin is being controlled underground by a bunch of weird dudes, led by an awesome Richard Jenkins.So, knowing anything that happens to these five kids is being totally controlled, any hint of fear or "horror" is completely stripped from this film. Why is it being controlled? Well, to learn THAT, you need to see the film.That being said, the film is well worth the watch. Even though it turned out to not be quite what I expected, "Cabin in the Woods" is definitely an original concept based on horror film clichés deriving from everything from "Evil Dead" to "Halloween" to "Night of the Living Dead" to the early writings of H.P. Lovecraft. It has a good cast of stereotypes, led by the aforementioned (and "smaller," but still gorgeous) Chris Hemsworth and Jessie Williams of "Grey's Anatomy" fame....along with a COMPLETELY out-of-left-field cameo by a huge-named actress whose appearance I won't spoil.Hilarious in its self-referential and "Scream"-like laughing at the predictable aspects of so many horror movies, this non-scary horror film satire does start off a little slow, but keeps the laughs and grins coming until it kicks into high gear as you learn the secrets behind the cabin and the film truly takes off into an extremely enjoyable second act with a sequence of such amusing slaughter, it teeters on being one of the greatest in history.So, definitely not the best "horror" film ever made, but definitely the best satirical look at the genre since the first "Scream."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just back from the cinema. I quite enjoyed this. I am a Joss Whedon fan and knew that this would probably be worth seeing and wasn't going to be your generic teen slasher. What struck me was just how out-there the actual story line is! There are many different film references and this film is hard to pigeonhole in any recognisable genre. The obvious main reference being the evil dead films. Then the Truman show. There are even shades of his old TV show Angel. This film is very knowing. It is smart and aware but doesn't try and bore you with it. It's also quite funny in a lot of places. Most of the laughs coming from the stoner character. Played very very well by Franz Kranz. The special effects and inventiveness with the monster characters are particularly brilliant. Go see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods has been pigeon holed as a deconstruction of the horror movie, a retro-styling of the genre... it's neither of those. Cabin in the Woods is, basically, a joyous celebration of the every horror movie ever made. And nothing more need be said. ... as we have to get to one hundred words however... is it funny? Yes, oh yes. If you've ever watched anything remotely horror related you'll laugh until your socks fall off. If you're a fan of mametesque dialogue you'll laugh til your socks fall off and if you were ever hoping Bradley Witford would again reach the dizzying comic heights of season 2 of the West Wing... you get the point. Forget spoilers - the first scene tells you everything you need to know about the movie - forget the trailers giving anything away - who cares - this is enjoyment de jeux. Fun for the sake of it. Every ten or so years someone pokes fun at the cinema in a way that no one else has done. The Great Dictator, Zelig, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid, Scream... and now Cabin in the Woods. Trust me, you'll never take the line: 'Am I on speaker phone?' the same way again.</fullReview>

At first, I was frustrated at the clichés and thought, "oh god it's one of THOSE movies...".Well, for quite a while it was. But it got better towards the end, even if it was going a bit over the top. But, don't abandon hope:Cabin In The Woods has some of the annoying "horror"-buncha-teens-getting- slashed clichés, but at least they made something different of it. The clichés somewhat bring it down, but definitely is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cabin in the Woods is a very entertaining movie but it's not a great movie. Based on the reviews and the rating you might be led to believe that you will experience brilliant acting, engaging dialogue and plot full of twists and turns. You will not get any of that out of this movie. No matter how you look at it, it's a teenager horror movie with a familiar premise: a group of teenagers go to an isolated location where they are haunted by some evil. What sets the movie apart is that it's aware that the audience have seen all the horror movie clichés a thousand times. So what it does is it puts a slightly different twist on everything. The dark humour, the gory deaths and random sexual scenes feel very fresh and entertaining. Also, the special effects are pretty awesome. There is really not much else to say about it.So relax and enjoy the movie for what it is. Don't expect any thought provoking dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Be The Horror Movie of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin In The Woods I love movies like this because they are made for the fans. More than that they are made for the people who love horror movies. I don't mean love them the way a fan gets all excited about them. I mean the people who love them the way you're supposed to love your children. How, even in the face of some pretty great mistakes, instead of getting all angry and beating them up you instead hang your head in disappointment but hug them and let them know it's OK and they can try again the next time. These movies, like The Cabin In The Woods... these are the ones that last a lifetime.I went into this movie sort of forcing myself because I didn't pay much attention to it. The trailers didn't really excite me, though it looked fun. I think that's mostly because it wasn't familiar to me or maybe it was too familiar where it looked like another Hollywood train-wreck. With all the good word of mouth and a free weekend when it opened, as a representative of the horror genre, I felt it was my responsibility to go see this thing.I have to tell you that I'm pretty good about judging if a movie is going to be a lot of fun or not for myself and I was genuinely surprised. I went in not sure what to expect, but ready for being less than happy with it the way I honestly felt about Scream 4. I mean I am a HUGE Scream fan, but something just never sat right with me and the last movie. I always hated that. I dig the flick, as a fan of the franchise it was still fun to see all that they showed us, but it just felt foreign to me. Well, with Cabin I kind of started out feeling that way before I even thought about going to see the movie.I left the theater feeling excited and really happy about where this movie took me. The journey was familiar, yet new and unexpected. When they say you don't know what this movie is about even if you think you do... they are not kidding.From front to back this thing is one big ride on the most perfect horror attraction that could ever be built at this time. The fun of it is in the story but also in being able to pick out all the special nods to just about every popular horror name in movies that you can think of. Once the DVD comes out I know I'll be watching over and over just to try to get them all. But it doesn't take away from the movie being its own thing and they covered it in this truly unique and imaginative way. I was really satisfied when it was done.The only thing I can say that really isn't a negative but might be taken that way if I don't express this right... The ending isn't necessary. In almost any movie you wait and wait throughout the journey of the story for the payoff at the end. So many films have ended without the payoff and you get annoyed and feel like something was left out and you feel like the ending was crap and ruined the whole movie sometimes. Well, sometimes it's better to not have that payoff. The films that give in and give you what you're waiting for all that time can be fantastic, but after seeing the end to this I can pick out at least three places it would have been just as proper to roll credits as where they cut it. I think the film would have been better without that final cap at the end.Don't get me wrong. This film was indeed outstanding and I believe that it will be something people will talk about for a long time and friends will have parties over it and make up games to it. I believe it will become as iconic as Scream did. If you are not sure if you want to see this or not, you should totally just give in and see it. There's no excuse not to see it and as a horror fan or even just someone who loves a good movie, you have a responsibility to go see this film to show studios what you want in a movie.If you're thinking you'll wait for the DVD or wait until it's on TV or something, you'll be a little more disappointed because the big screen really works with this flick. You'll be glad you checked it out this way so you can appreciate the enormity of some of the things in the film. It will be just as great watching on your television or laptop, but you'd be doing yourself a favor by giving yourself this memory. Don't miss out on what everyone else will be talking about. And if you do, you have no one to blame for spoilers but yourself because people won't be able to stop talking about it no matter how much you throw a fit.Take some time and enjoy the horror that is The Cabin In The Woods.- Mr. Frights</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Game Changer It Claims to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(LOTS of SPOILERS!) This is yet another movie I can't review without giving out important plot details! So, I'm going to review the movie as if you've seen it and are wondering what other people think.This film has been billed as a "game changer" that changes horror movies forever, or upends all of horror movie conventions. Well, it doesn't. It has fun with them, yes, but that's about the extent of it. Plus, it sounded like there was one surprise after another in the plot. But, before long, you know what's going on. You figure out that these office dudes are conducting ritual sacrifices for some monster, or even the devil himself. And, that carries through to the end of the film. So, maybe one kind-of surprise, but that's it.Where the movie works is in its dark humor, at times pitch black humor! The jokes the two guys make as they're setting up the young ones for imminent slaughter are very funny, and very dark! Plus, this humor continues through the film, but only sporadically after about the half-way point. The film goes from dark-humored horror to straight horror with some dark humor added in. I think the writers didn't want to carry through on the first half and turned to blood and gore for the second.There are parts in the second half that are laugh-out-loud funny, like when the monsters arrive on the elevators. You know they're going to spring forth and kill everyone. But, when the elevators go "ding!" in that typically cheerful way, the monsters coming out is given a lot of extra punch, and adding laughs too. The hilariously goof-ball appearance of the "Purge Monsters" button is like every movie where a ship just happens to have a self destruct system. A super-easy way to kill off the baddies! I had been wondering up to about the two-thirds or so mark why the film was rated R. Then, the monsters come out and slaughter everyone in giant geysers of blood and body parts, culminating with a silent room of slaughter, with one limb going "splat!" to the ground. Then, I understood the R rating! Overall, a good, interesting movie. But, it was half hearted, going for pretty much straight horror at the half-way point, and not following through with the dark humor of the first. The ending did help, since it was super dark! Two people deciding "aw, screw it" and not sacrificing themselves but allowing the world to end instead is about as dark as it gets! 6 out of 10 Stars (******)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gleeful re-imagining of a used up horror scenario</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joss Wedon, the man behind cult T.V. shows 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' and 'Firefly' directs and co-writes this imaginative spin on a classic horror film scenario. From the generic title to worn out plot premise (four young people go to a creepy cabin deep in the woods only to be attacked by monsters), clichés are gleefully used; often with great comic effect, such as a sinister redneck gas station owner. The twist is that all that happens to the youngsters, their behaviour and even their personalities are being manipulated from a hi-tech control room by a large team of scientist and technicians. I won't spoil it by saying to what purpose. Bradley Whitford (Hadley) and Richard Jenkins (Sitterson) steal the show as the lead scientists, all other actors give satisfying performances that gel well with the plot. Characters and dialogue are very 'Whedonesque' which will appeal to fans of his work. Made to appeal to geeks and horror buffs such as myself, not everyone will appreciate or 'get' this movie. Some will even be annoyed by the plot holes. But if you know your ghouls from your zombies, you'll be highly entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much a horror movie, or even a horror parody, but a film that can cleverly laugh at itself and still be somewhat serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film's most common approach to being a parody of a movie genre is to make fun of itself and come off as ridiculous as possible, going for over-the-top begs for laugh and exaggerating as much as it can handle. When a horror movie tries to be original, it typically tries its best to break as far away from established formula as possible, or attempt to refresh the formula with new ideas. The Cabin in the Woods is successfully different because it isn't afraid of established formula. It makes a statement of originality by embracing horror formula and everything to do with running clichés in horror films instead of trying to escape the always lingering inevitability of them, and in the process of this embrace, it manages to be a parody that doesn't make its subject of exploit ridiculous by making fun of it. Instead, it utilizes the method of subtlety with clever dialogue and gags that are smart, hilarious, and raise thought-provoking points about horror films, while still respecting horror in cinema realistically and seriously. By doing this, it accomplishes deftly blending humor you can laugh at, and horror you can scream at, without either part being dominant, and never feeling like separate styles throughout the movie. There are enough references here that any fan of any horror sub-genre will appreciate, and by having so many it will provoke casual horror viewers to get more into horror culture from sheer intrigue. This also makes it something along the lines of a parody within a tribute, and one with intelligent observations of conventions through wise humor as opposed to stupid humor trying its best to make the film, and its mocking focus of horror movies look stupid, literally finding originality within the overused, and casually displaying smarts without the intention of being over- pretentious. A hybrid in that takes itself seriously and not too seriously. A horror movie that makes fun of its own self-awareness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shot in the arm to the horror genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the theater with very little expectation, besides a dormant penchant of some cheap thrills and chills. But the one thing that kept coming to my mind, while going through the pre-show commercials, was what Total Film called it in one of their past month editions : "reinventing the horror genre". While that may not mean much or anything at all, my subconscious self was yearning for something interesting, minus the torture gores of Eli Roth and his counterparts, that I detest.The Cabin In The Woods, through its trailers, shouts out aloud that here is a movie that you've seen it all before, and just like what you've come to expect by now, we too have twists, and turns and surprises along the way. In the movie though, what does stand apart by almost a telling yard is that, these twists and turns come to life in the narration, a lot earlier than you'd have anticipated and follows a coherent motive of surprising the viewer, the moment conventional wisdom looked to be the order of the day. Drew Goddard and Josh Whedon wrote a good story but the former, directed it even better. The acting was a well oiled support group that left no stone unturned in exploiting every given opportunity at pulling off histrionics, that such scripts provide. Special mention to the Fran Kranz, who I am told has been a regular in Wheddon's past works. As a nerdy, dope head, his weed act is the catalyst of this experiment and serves the flavour sumptuously with a long ending after taste. There is also no doubt that post Thor and the soon to be released pre-summer blockbuster "The Avengers", Chris Hemsworth's stock price is on the rise. &amp; that will do a world of good, in pulling the Youtube demography into buying cinema tickets for this cabin.Jenkins &amp; Whitford were pitch perfect Overall, if entertainment was the yardstick to a film's success, The Cabin In The Woods, is an assured and comprehensive winner. Its a shot in the arm to the horror genre. It'd be a crying shame if the most cynical follower of such movies would have anything to complain about this one. In my attempt at not giving too much away, I'd just say that the elaborate climax and all the mayhem that the proceedings give into, all mixed at a tastefully timed pace, should keep you glued to the edge of your seats for minutes that seem to be never ending. The humour quotient is immaculately placed in the entire narration and is never used as a tension diffuser. Such was the balance between perception and truth of the premise, that I had people in my cinema guffaw and shriek in the same scene in a matter of seconds. And I consider them both, bloody genuine reactions. As a film enthusiast I can only imagine the kind of fun the makers and everybody involved in the project may have had. Speaking of which. A homage, although sometimes projected as unintentional, has rarely missed my sights. The opening credits have a subtle touch of Tarantino's flair about them. &amp; the look of the cabin itself and a few other sequences will remind you of Sam Raimi's original Evil Dead. Now you know what we're talking As you can imagine, being compared to past classics that have done their bits in reviving a genre that sometimes produces overdose of solemn and mournful, can be a great thing. There are times when we tend to take going ons far too seriously and forget that its actually just a movie. If you're one of them, the likelihood of you coming out of the theater feeling shortchanged is very high.So my word of advice, in the words of Mr. S from "School of Rock" is that loosen those hinges on your shoulder, go loosey ? goosey, grab your popcorn &amp; soda and find the time to go watch this hilariously frightening piece of work, that has cult written all over it. Look, if not now; than at least in another 10 years perhaps ?Recommended for the Horror &amp; Thriller lovers. 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie blew my mind. It put a new twist on horror movies, and my opinion might change how horror movies is made. It started off corny as hell but it eventually made sense why it started the way it did. the movie was good in almost all the parts of a good movie. It had comedy to offset the tension build of the movie to make you relax and made you think that everything was okay but then bow they get you. it was in my opinion the best horror movie i seen since 1408 or don't be afraid of the dark witch was a recent film but there hasn't been to many good horror movies lately and The Cabin in the Woods broke the no hitter. I recommend watching it, it was a good movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage till it hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-written by BUFFY's Joss Whedon this is a high-tech new take on the Friday THE 13TH scenario. The new - or not so new - element here is that the horrors visited upon the five hapless occupants of a spooky lakeside cabin are being manipulated by a team of technicians in a vast laboratory beneath them, not unlike the people controlling the island in LOST.The 'controllers' include a couple of faces familiar from THE WEST WING and (appropriately) SIX FEET UNDER. There's even a cameo from Sigourney Weaver playing a variant on her AVATAR character.Joss Whedon has a lot of fun mounting an elaborate deconstruction (I blame Wes Craven for this!) of the last 10-30 years of horror movies. THE EVIL DEAD, THE THING, THE SHINING - almost every schlock-horror you can think of is referenced. The (ludicrous) exposition at the end is - almost - a throwback to the Denis Wheatley era (does anyone, apart from me, remember him?).The zombie assaults on our hapless cabin crew are as visceral as anything in the SAW series or its many imitators; the frontier into 'Torture Porn' is approached if not quite crossed. Great pace, super effects, lots of make-you-jump moments (not too many make-you-scream moments: that's harder to bring off today), but THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is like an extended Tribute Show. It doesn't have that vital spark of originality that gave, say, DRAG ME TO HELL its extra "zing".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun ride but there was no real payoff..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have given this movie a 7 or 8 if not for the last shot. It could have been creepy as all hell if they had just left us to wonder by fading out before sunrise. Enter the cigar smoking Hollywood executive who can't leave well enough alone and we have a cheese on toast fade-out. Yes, it feels that tacked on! Also, not sure if it was intentional but the "ritual" was all sorts of predictable. I could see things happening from a mile away!! It was a fun ride but there was no real pay-off. I realize that to have expanded on the back-story would have meant at least another thirty minutes but don't just give us a glimpse. It didn't leave me wanting more - it just left me ticked off. I missed the first few minutes so I could be missing something here but let's have more on these ancient ones. Prequel needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No it isn't original or scary but it's not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, regardless of the rumors there is nothing original about this movie at all. It is a mash-up of clichés. It is not funny and does not try to be funny. It is not anything at all like Evil Dead or its sequels. It is certainly not scary either. That said, it's still entertaining right up to the really lousy ending. It starts off with some rather badly acted businessmen preparing for a big project at the work place. Then it cuts to the gathering of 5 stereotypical teens ready to head out to summer house for a little vacation. Others have already mentioned that the characters are very flat and the movie tells that they were chosen for that very reason. It also implies that there personalities have been altered with chemicals to make them fit more into their roles. There is the slut, the jock, the scholar, the fool -in this case a stoner-, and of course the virgin. The businessmen in their control room plan every stage of the trip, watching the teens leave, having one of their own planted at the only gas station on the road, making sure the road cannot be tracked on GPS, and surrounding the area of the cabin with a forcefield so that there is only one way in which can be blocked so the kids can't get back out. They have the entire place rigged with cameras and electronics so that when the kids get to the cabin they can watch everything that happens. The businessmen have arranged all kinds of stereotypical western monsters from horror movies ranging from good ole zombies to special redneck pain worshiping zombies. Some when you get the chance to see them are truly creepy like their nod at the Cenobites from "Hellraiser" and an evil clown a la "It". Some are just sadly lame like a Merman and a giant hissing Cobra. The teens have to choose to go to the cabin then choose their method of death. The means of choosing is a cellar full of props. There is a dollhouse, diary, creepy old dolls, conch shell, and tons more stuff. The virgin makes the choice for the group unknowingly by reading from a diary. Yep, you guessed it... the redneck pain worshiping zombies it is. Apparently there are ancient evil gods sleeping underground. For them to remain asleep, a ritual sacrifice has to be made periodically. The businessmen orchestrating the scenario with the kids in the woods are the ones entrusted to carry off this sacrifice. If they fail, the gods will awaken and destroy all humanity. Fortunately, there are rituals being carried out in other countries besides the US. Unfortunately all those have failed this time and it comes down to our kids in the woods. They must die and in the proper order or all humanity is toast.Things seem to be going mostly according to plan. The zombie family finishes off the slut. The stoner gets pulled through a window by a zombie. The jock crashes his bike into the forcefield trying to go get help. The scholar is drowned when he and the virgin crash the motor home into the water. The businessmen go ahead and start to celebrate because the virgin's death is always optional as long as it is last.The red phone rings. It would seem the celebration was premature. The stoner is still alive. Apparently the weed he is smoking has made him somewhat immune to the various chemicals they have been using to guide the teens in the choices they want them to make. He comes to the virgin's rescue and they run away into a mausoleum that leads to an elevator shaft. At this point the movie goes downhill hard and fast. The ending feels like something just cobbled together to make a conclusion. The scenes are hectic and filled with torrents of gore. The story line is tossed aside for cheap action shots. The ending of this movie is probably the most unsatisfying ending in movie history. The virgin and the stoner realize the elevator accesses glass cubes holding monsters and ghosts and that someone let the zombies they have been running from loose on them. The virgin realized she chose which monsters were unleashed on them because she read the diary out loud. Now they have to battle security forces armed with automatic weapons with orders to kill them. They hide behind a big console that controls the monster so she turns them loose. The monsters attack the guards then make their way through to whole complex slaughtering everyone. Eventually after many corridors and rooms of gore, the two survivors reach the sacrifice room. The director of the complex who is played by Sigourney Weaver, explains that Marty, the stoner must die to save all humanity. She urges the virgin to kill him. After a struggle in which the director is killed, the two teens light up a joint and discuss how humanity is not worth saving as the ancient gods burst up from the ground under the cabin. This moving is entertaining enough to watch once. I would wait to rent it or stream it rather than pay high theatre prices though. If you want something scary or funny, this is not the one for you. The first two thirds of the movie will appeal to those who like traditional teen slasher movies. Pretty much everyone will hate the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the coolest movie I've ever seen!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would think walking into a film that's been shelved for 3 years that the result wouldn't be very positive. But you'd be wrong because the reasoning behind this films delay is due to the bankruptcy of MGM the releasing company. What stands is one of the cleverest, freshest genre films ever made. If you've seen any of the trailers of TV spots you can pretty much tell that the film takes the clichéd set up of teens visiting a cabin in the woods and flips it on its head. To say anything else would spoil too much for you but Cabin in the Woods is so smart in the way it tacles it's material not pandering down to the clichés up engaging and expoliting the material and twisting it unforeseen and energetic ways. The film clocks in at about 98 mins and there's not a drawn out spot in the films entire running time. it's filled with inspired direction from Drew Goddard of "Let me In" fame showing off his talents in a more efficient way here strong self aware performances from a good cast most notably Franz Kranz as the films fool and sexy Chris Hemsworth in the "alpha male" role as well as an extremely seductive Jesse williams as "the scholar" my new obsession lol. The film also employs some very missed old school horror movie feats like classic monsters and gory makeup effects. The result is simplistic in it's entertainment value but as complex a film a stheyc ome. It's entertaining, funny, a little scary and wonderfully inventive. Without a doubt one of the if not the coolest film I've ever seen and definitely one of the best movie s ever!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The God of all horrors !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow this movie was amazing and I don't mean that just because I love horror movies, its because this movie is the smartest movie I've seem in years. I don't no how Joss and Drew wrote this but they managed to make a horror classic. First let's start with the characters they are typical horror roles,the Jock (Curt), the Whore (Jules), the Scholar (Holden), the Druggie (Marty) and the sweet Virgin (Dana). Each one of them was fantastic at acting and keeping straight faces my personal favorite was Marty mainly because he is hilarious and high half the time. The creatures and CGI were fantastic the creators did a nice job at making them. The story is about 5 friends taking a break at a cabin, when they unknowingly awake the Zombie Redneck Tortured Family from there sleep in the ground (or is it). while this is happening you see two colleges on the way to the secret operation what is apparently in competition with Japan later you find out what there real intentions are, which all leads up to the thrilling 20 minute finale which is an absolute bloodbath. oh and the twist is totally unexpected. (Well it was for me).So I would strongly recommend this to horror fans and also people who aren't .10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great twist on a overdone genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his feature film directorial debut, Drew Goddard (a writer for "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Angel" and "Lost" TV series, the film "Cloverfield") has taken a tired film formula, the teen slasher flick, and turned it on its head. It's "The Truman Show" meets "Friday the 13th" meets "The Evil Dead," which just a little "Ghostbusters" added to the concoction.The result is a welcome, refreshing change of pace which is at once exhilarating, frightening, thought-provoking and drop-dead hilarious. And it's certainly a huge step up from 2007's "Cloverfield," which was shot in Confuse-O-Vision and populated by pretty but incompetent actors.Here, there are a few recognizable faces (Richard Jenkins, "Step Brothers," "The Rum Diary" and Bradley Whitford, "Billy Madison, "The West Wing" TV series) among the young ? and mostly unknown ? thespians, which goes a long way in establishing a sense of credibility the above-mentioned film could never muster.In "Cabin," a group of stereotypical movie youngsters are planning a trip to an isolated vacation home in the forest. The group includes the jock Curt (Chris Hemsworth, "Thor," although this movie was made before that one), his partygirl, Jules (Anna Hutchison, "Go Girls" TV series), brainiac Holden (Jesse Williams, "Grey's Anatomy" TV series), good girl Dana (Kristen Connolly, "The Good Wife" TV series) and the stoner fifth-wheel, Marty (Fran Kranz, "Donnie Darko," "Training Day," "Diary Of a Wimpy Kid: Roddrick Rules").It's more than obvious that the couples will hook up while the philosophizing sad-sack Marty will be alone with his thoughts, but he nevertheless tags along with the gang in a huge RV, even when things begin to get decidedly creepy.For instance, at what appears to be an abandoned gas station, a leathery attendant, Mordaci (Tim De Zarn, "Live Free Or Die Hard," "The Artist"), starts to angrily spout ominous warnings about their destination, even calling Jules a "whore." The kids, however, ignore the weirdo and proceed to the desolate domicile, which looks like the Munsters' summer home on the outside, but seems to be cozy and well-kept inside. A few introductory scenes of each character, some alcohol and drug use, as well as a game of truth or dare takes place before the fun really kicks off, with terrifying creatures soon surrounding the cabin.All the while, for some reason, the entire event is being observed by scientists, including Sitterson (Jenkins), Hadley (Whitford) and military bodyguard, Truman (Brian White, "The Game Plan," "12 Rounds"). Is it some kind of mind or behavior control experiment? Is it an elaborate government spy operation? Is it a candid reality television show? Of course, I will not reveal the secret, suffice to write, though, it comes out of left field and will no doubt leave many viewers shocked and pleasantly surprised at the outcome. And even though the picture has been in the can for more than three years, it was a matter of getting money for distribution, NOT because it was a poison project.The inclusion of Jenkins and Whitford, as previously mentioned, is a nice touch and their work together adds a great comedic element to the proceedings (an even more recognizable celebrity appears in a late cameo). And, the young actors, for the most part do very well, including Franz, who steals every scene he is in as the bumbling pothead who begins to suspect the worst.Even the pre-"Thor" Hemsdale and Williams, and the slutty Hutchison, do fine in what little is given them. The only negative I can write about the production is the performance of the lead actress Connelly, who, sadly, cannot convince anyone that she is in real danger or convey a sense of terror that would have certainly overcome anyone else.That being written, though, "Cabin In the Woods" is quite entertaining and with several curves before the conclusion, a great way to spend a few hours at the cinema ? something you cannot say a lot about most of the movies showing these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You think you know, but you really don't know. And you never will.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cultists and horror fans rejoice. The genre is long from dead. Especially since we have people like Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon hellbent on filing the rough edges and cementing the cracks. For years we have been met with shameless remakes, lame sequels, found footage disasters, and only once in a while does a solid, tolerable horror flick break through the bleak and droning clutter. Here, we have an original, crafty, and exciting flick in the genre that resorts to not only mocking the clichés commonly used in horror films but also possibly inventing some new ones of its own.This is the last thing I was expecting to say about a film titled The Cabin in the Woods, but after months of anticipation and article after article it has finally been released. I remember the original plot that was leaked on IMDb in January; "Five friends go to a remote cabin in the woods. Bad things happen." I thought to myself "you already have a film with a trite, uninspired title and now you release a plot that doesn't even try?" Little did I know I was being played. I saw the first trailer and was mesmerized. What would appear to be a stock, wooden (pun intended) exercise mixed with a heap of tired, worn clichés was what looked to be a promising and intelligent horror film. Those thoughts stay with me after viewing as well.Usually in my reviews I try and give a sufficient description of the plot. For Cabin in the Woods, I refuse. You're left with your wits, your assumptions, and that simple premise I quoted. I went in with that knowledge and the camaraderie I witnessed in the trailers. There's absolutely no reason anything else has to be said or given away. The five characters are standard horror archetypes that we've seen a countless number of times, and the film isn't shy about reminding us. The last twenty-five minutes of the film are relentless and, by then, the movie's title seemed to be practically void and nonexistent to me.There's just one issue I have; the film seems to have swapped a lot of the horror elements for cheap, slightly-amusing comedy bits that sometimes obscure direction. I've never been too big on horror comedies, but it seems Cabin in the Woods would have benefited from more thriller elements than corny comedy skits.But that doesn't overshadow the fact that this is a bold and unrestricted film, so far off the map of typical horror-fare that some newer films aren't even in sight. Some readers might remember my abashed review of The Devil Inside, but my faith in horror has become somewhat restored after watching Cabin. I recently watched a documentary called Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope, which Cabin's screenwriter Whedon was a part of. Seeing as he was a long time writer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer and directed and wrote the upcoming superhero film The Avengers, it seems he speaks to the group of superfans and nerds. Those who camp out at night to be the first one to see a film, buy a game/console, or those who seek to form and join a number of cults. We need more people in the business like Whedon. I'm always weary when old directors try out new tricks. What does it tell us when Goddard and Whedon's Cabin in the Woods was more subtle, fulfilling, and fun than Wes Craven's My Soul to Take? It's also a blessing to see Cabin get a substantial release in 2D. Originally, when the rights were under MGM's name, an up-conversion to 3D was proposed and thankfully abandoned. I found parts of Cabin to be a tad dark and hazy. Glasses that add an extra dimension that noticeably dim the light of a picture would've tarnished the experience. Maybe if I had some of the stuff Marty (Kranz) had everything would become clear to me. Everything except the turns.Starring: Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Hutchison, Fran Kranz, Jesse Williams, Richard Jenkins, and Bradley Whitford. Directed by: Drew Goddard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Horror Movie to End All Horror Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't say this is my favorite horror movie. Not at all. But why? Because, in a way, it transcends other horror movies. The film gracefully walks the line between tongue- in-cheek and legitimate horror so incredibly well; I was still thinking about it after I'd gotten home from the theater; how the filmmakers managed to pull it all off in such a short amount of time and yet so smoothly is something of a mystery to me.The film literally showcases every type of horror film (and masterfully pays homage to quite a few specific horror films). The genre builds from a Deliverance / Wrong Turn theme and quickly shifts to something reminiscent of the Evil Dead series, complete with a self-opening hatch leading to the inevitable basement. It hovers over this sub genre for a while, and then evolves into homages to films like the Cube, The Mist, Hellraiser, various ghost, monster, and zombie movies, and eventually caps it all off with Lovecraftian Cthulhu mythos.The film rips apart every horror movie you've ever loved, stitches them all back together lovingly (albeit sarcastically at times), and what you get is one heck of an entertaining movie. If you were to have a horror movie night, or even a full-blown festival, this is the movie you'd want to play last. I'm not saying that it's any kind of "pinnacle" of horror movies. I'm saying that it is the definitive statement and a concluding, passionate love letter to the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunningly original and fiendishly clever, "Cabin" is a movie for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you will enjoy far more, the less you know about it. So, with that said, you'll get no spoilers here. I would also strongly encourage you not to read any.Often times, I find that a movie that tries too hard to be all things, to all people, ends up being nothing to anyone. Yet, this is a piece of film that succeeds immensely as a horror film, suspense story, and dark comedy, more so than any other movie that I can ever recall seeing. I don't understand how a movie can be so serious, so enthralling... and yet not take itself too seriously and be campy fun all at the same time. But these filmmakers did it.I loved this movie so much, that I am going back a second time today to see it, after convincing my friend to join me. I do not exaggerate when I say that this film will revolutionize the horror genre and go down in history as the most impactful film of its kind, since the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre decades ago. Go out of your way to see this brilliant work. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truman in the woods...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fresh, fun and bloody far-fetched, Buffy God Joss Wheldon and director Drew Goddard's ferocious black-comedy may be riddled with plot holes to the point of absurdity, but it is different. Good different? Yes and no; The Cabin in the Woods is a wry and rash blend of every sub-genre known to horror that plays like a dystopian spin on The Truman Show. Imagine bits-and-pieces from every horror flick you've ever seen swirling in a cruel yet comical crimson cocktail. Slasher, zombie, paranormal, abnormal- you name it, it's in there. We even have the classic horror cast set-up; the jock, the whore, the stoner, black dude and virgin. They're all in there too- but for good reason.Bolting itself to a My Little Eye-like concept of a reality TV show gone wrong, this horror hybrid is set somewhere in the future and tells of 5 teen' stereotypes who opt to spend spring-break in a tucked-away cabin in the woods. Big Brother is watching, though. A detached control-room full of quirky hands and 2 cynical stage managers (including a priceless Richard Jenkins) have something in store for the oblivious 5. The would- be woods is like a giant stage. It's been rigged with all sorts of booby-traps and pitfalls with a tone of cameras to catch the whole damn thing. But why? Wheldon's screenplay doesn't beat about the bush; a rushed and frantic start ensures we know the who, the what, the where and the how after just 5 minutes. But not the why. This, along with the perpetual blood- letting, iconic horror film nods and laughs, is the question that drives the Cabin in the Woods to a barnstorming final third that borders on the brilliant and the daft, the ludicrous and the predictable. Jumpy in places, edgy in others, Goddard takes the style, form and ideas put forth by the likes of The Evil Dead, Scream and The Truman Show and runs with them. In spite of its energy, though, The Cabin in the Woods doesn't pull up many trees. Goddard's given up a good and gory, almost spoof-like addition to the horror genre that brings to mind the likes of Raimi, Craven and Jackson but it isn't the "mind-blowing game-changer" some are making it out to be. The brunt of its class lies, if anywhere, in its tongue-in-cheek humour- away from the woods and in HQ; the oddball antics of Jenkins' and co. are pure gold and the part of the knowing stoner Marty (Franz Kanz) is a fresh and droll addition.Goddard's piece of horror movie-making twists and turns a tad and is built on an array of interesting concepts but ultimately fails to leave the size a dent it perhaps could've left on the genre. His Cabin in the Woods is worth a watch for its zest and zane alone, though. Making it an absolute must for any horror film nut. Optional for everyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun but don't give away the secret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is really hard to review this movie adequately without giving away its party piece but I will try and do it justice without spoiling anything.Basic premise is 5 students (usual horror movie clichés) go on a break to a cabin in the woods and get more than the bargained for. So far so done before but this is totally different. The opening sequence and even the trailers point to the fact that all is not how it seems and we begin to find out pretty quickly what is happening.It is a superb idea and the first 2 acts are among the best horror/ sci-fi / black comedy film of the last decade or 2. The final act was a bit too over the top for my liking but was still great fun. The acting was solid, the script funny and well paced. The effects were a little comic book but again due to the nature of what is going on I suppose that should be expected.This really is a genre of its own, the hype surrounding it is unjustified because whilst it is unique it's a bit too ridiculous at times but then again I suppose that's the point. It's best described as Evil Dead meets the Truman show but you really will have to see it. It's marmite and you will either love it or hate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailers and marketing for this movie were VERY misleading. I thought I was going to see a serious, complex, dark and creepy movie, but instead I got an attempt at a violent comedy? The posters, commercials, and previews made it look pretty promising, and there was so much talk about the great unexpected plot twists. Yes they were unexpected, as I never thought someone would waste so much potential to take the audience in the direction they did. I was left shaking my head by the end. I was very disappointed and felt it was a waste of a decent plot idea. Not sure who is into this kind of thing, but this movie would have been better off as a cartoon.

		<shortDescription>You Think You Know the Story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No spoilers here, people. I saw CABIN back in March, and, now with some free time, I've decided to write a review for it. To keep this review as spoiler-free as possible, here's the most basic and vague summary I can offer you about the story: A bunch of teens go out to a cabin in the woods and bad stuff happens. Also, you think you know the story, but you really don't, unless you already read the script or have someone spoil it for you, both of which I'd highly advise against. CABIN is one of those films where the less you know about it, the more satisfying the end result is. Trust me when I say to stay away from trailers, reviews, etc. until you have finished seeing the film. However, in this day and age, that's easier said than done, so let me ease your mind when I say that although the trailer does seem to reveal a lot, it's fortunately misleading.A critic who reviewed CABIN discussed it in terms of the three act structure, which I will be doing because it makes it easier to understand without giving much away: In the first act, you'll be thinking, "I've seen this all before." As the film progresses to its second act, you'll be thinking, "Wait. What is going on?" By the third act, you'll think "What--I can't even...THIS IS CRAZY." By the time the credits roll, you'll think "Did I just really see what I thought I saw?!" That was basically my thoughts throughout the film. CABIN is like SCREAM. And again, it isn't. While SCREAM deconstructs the horror genre through the dialogue from its characters, CABIN takes a more subtle approach, as if the filmmakers were winking to the audience. CABIN deconstructs the horror genre and then builds it back up, forming a completely different creature. It assumes the audience is intelligent and has some fun in the process. While SCREAM ridicules the sad state of the horror genre, CABIN celebrates it. It gives reasons why the horror genre exists in the first place and why it should stay. In a way, CABIN even gives reasons why recent horror films are the way they have been for many years.CABIN is both a horror and a comedy, although I would say more comedy than horror. The funny parts are hilarious, and the scary parts are scary. The film effectively mixes the two without feeling awkward, and there's also a great sense of inventiveness going on here. Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon managed to make an ingenious film that is highly entertaining yet intelligent at the same time. However, the film isn't perfect. For one, the group of teens aren't really interesting to care for. They all do their jobs fitting their stereotypical roles and then subverting them, but most are still underdeveloped. However, this issue is minor once the film reveals its more mind-twisting layers. Fran Kranz is the best of the bunch, providing some of the film's biggest laughs. There's also a great pair of veteran actors, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford, who steal every scene they're in. Their chemistry is just undeniable, effectively playing off with each other. Some of the effects work is also rather cheesy. I felt that the film could have used a bigger budget to successfully display the big ideas both Goddard and Whedon had in their crazy heads.Still, the flaws are rather small when compared to the film's monumental successes. CABIN is not only a great film, it is an important one. Regardless if you're a horror fan or not, CABIN reminds us why we go to the movie theaters in the first place. It reminds us why the horror genre is here to stay. Let me end with a quote from critic Emanuel Levy's review of the film: CABIN is "an important reminder that inventiveness can still go a long way in Hollywood?when it is given a chance to shine."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Virtual waste of 1:45. Pretty much a stoner comedy with some pretty cool horror film homages &amp; about 3-4 minutes of chaotic awesomeness. And the "twist"? So ridiculous that no one will ever figure it out in several lifetimes. And after it's revealed you'll wish they hadn't bothered. Decent SFX. Over the top acting (likely on purpose to satirize the genre.). No redeeming value that made it worth sitting through the whole movie. It's no longer a mystery to me that it took 3 years to get this movie released. They were probably debating on whether or not to make it a straight-to-video. Let me tell you, even THAT would've been a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin In The Woods directed by Drew Goddard is one of the best horror movies I have ever witnessed in the recent years.The movie has a very good story and even has fine performances delivered by its cast.Story;- Five teenagers (Kristen Connolly,Chris Hemsworth,Anna Hutchison,Fran Kranz and Jesse Williams) head off for a weekend at a secluded cabin in the woods. They arrive to find they are quite isolated with no means of communicating with the outside world. When the cellar door flings itself open, they of course go down to investigate. They find an odd assortment of relics and curios but when one of the women, Dana, reads from a book she awakens a family of deadly zombie killers. There's far more going on however than meets the eye as the five campers are all under observation The movie has brilliant screenplay.And one more reason why I liked the move is for its ending usually in most of English horror movies the endings are sense-less and abrupt but Cabin In the Woods had a good ending.The movie's director Drew Goddard does an excellent job of combining horror and humor together.Kudos to him! The background score is perfect.Performances:- Kristen Connolly,Chris Hemsworth,Anna Hutchison,Fran Kranz and Jesse Williams,all act superbly.Bradley Whitford and Richard Jenkins though have minimal scope but manage to register an impact.All in all,Cabin In the Woods is an excellent horror movie,which should be a must watch for every horror freak!I am giving it an eight on ten.Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Advertisement campaigns be damned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film I've waited for...well, for ages. The Cabin in the Woods was filmed in 2009 and it's only now that it's received the release that it deserves. That it's been co-written by Joss (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Whedon only fueled the hype (and interestingly enough, I am unfamiliar with the majority of Whedon's work and had only my high hopes to go by, so that allowed me to go into the film expecting less than other people did). Thankfully, good word of mouth is allowing it to achieve a certain cult status as one of the ever popular subgenre of meta-horror films (for the best examples, look no further than Scream and its subsequent sequels).One of the biggest complaints I've seen about this film is directed towards it's advertisement campaign. I can't blame the people who've found fault with it: The Cabin in the Woods was marketed as a dead serious addition to the horror genre but it is actually more of a satire, an all out deconstruction of said genre as well as a love letter to the fans who've allowed it to still be a viable moneymaker. The film may be self aware, but it is even more self aware about being self aware and that is what makes it the jolly good time that it is. It succeeds not only in the Here's a few chills and thrills! department, but also manages to be a lot of fun to boot. The result is a very satisfying theatrical experience, but if you're looking to be all out disturbed or creeped out by the proceedings on screen, then you're watching the wrong film. The scares serve to, quite literally, enhance the plot.What I meant by that last statement there is that our main characters, which include a handsome football player (Chris Hemsworth), his horny girlfriend (Anna Hutchison), the sweet as can be nerd (Jesse Williams), the stoner with a little bit more going on upstairs than you think (Franz Kranz) and the quintessential virgin (Kristen Connolly), appear to be pawns in a game of death orchestrated by corporate bigwigs with the power to manipulate the proceedings. The dramatic irony here is that only the audience (those actually in the film and the ones who are actually watching) knows about it. The characters are left to fend for themselves and are, in essence, reduced to the very same character archetypes the film made a point to disregard from the start. There is no choice here; they are, much like characters that are designed to conform to slasher film stereotypes, doomed to be slaughtered.I can't say any more than that. What I can say though is that director Drew Goddard certainly knows his material. He knows exactly where his story is going from frame one and takes his sweet time luring the audience in. We don't know if this is Under the Dome or Slashers, but that's the beauty of it: We won't be absolutely sure of anything until the credits roll and even if you do know what's about to go down, you're going to be on a ride with more twists and turns than the marketing campaign would have you believe.http://2or3thingsiknowaboutfilm.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A somewhat horror but overall semi-satirical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Cabin in the Woods is a difficult film to review with regards to spoilers but I'll give it a shot trying to encapsulate what I think the film-makers are trying to put across. The Cabin in the Woods is clearly a satire from the outset, in 2012, bar remakes, reboots and the like horror tends to always attempt a new turn and while watching this film I found it most welcoming. The semi-satirical aspect comes as I saw it as a film that seemed to celebrate (or make fun of) the stock characters that make up the horror films that you would consider this a part of and for the most part it is decent at doing so. The characters in this film don't seem nearly as annoying as they tend to be in these films. Maybe that is just my perception but it seemed to be a deliberate act on the part of the film-makers. The film does manage to produce some genuine scares though mostly in earlier parts of the film. A positive is that the film does get more interesting as it progresses. None of the actors tended to stand out and just seemed to do just enough to make for a decent cast. Without trying to go into too much detail, it does provide plenty of aspects that would please horror fans and does seem to be a celebration of the genre without being too meta. I will say it is not for the faint hearted and if you don't like films which try to be many things in a short amount of time this may not be the film for you. Again without moving into spoiler territory that is where I believe the film has its flaws where it does try to do too much. Overall it is a decent film and if you like horror with some satire thrown in then you should give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It doesn't worked for me although the visuals are great, the blood bath and monsters are scary to watch but...there is no story to understand. 1st half is pretty nice...all the friends going to an abandoned cabin in the jungle but then the initial grip is being lost by the second half as soon as the monsters being started raining down from no where, although you will keep on getting thrilled with good visual effects but still at the back of the mind the only thought comes is "what the heck is going on" Its become quite hard to understand why to make a monster factory, and why does every body is getting killed? Its kind of senseless and disappointing at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: "Talent may frolic and juggle; genius realizes and adds." And while this dark comedy/partial satire on horror flicks isn't completely on the genius level, director Drew Goddard and producer Joss Whedon definitely add to the young-people-in-the-woods slasher/horror genre.The group consists of your standard ingredients: the virgin girl; the slutty girl; the jock dude; the nice dude; and the comic relief stoner. They venture to a woodsy cabin, watched by something other than crazy hillbillies. A clique of "businessman" view the entire trip on high-tech monitors as the youngsters inadvertently follow the slasher elements: happening upon a device that awakens the particular "beasts" that try killing them off. Meanwhile the office people, more down to earth than creepy or sinister, are having a betting pool party of it.Bradley Whitford, who's made a career playing conceited weenies since REVENGE OF THE NERDS II, and Oscar nominated actor Richard Jenkins are funny as the adults we cut back and forth to. And in fear of giving too much away, the movie has worthwhile humor, effective chills, and interesting characters to invest in: especially the sole survivor (or survivors) of the first two acts.During the fast-paced final thirty minutes, as multiple nightmares are unleashed on climactic levels, you'll either get with the program or wonder if the writers took themselves, and their beloved body count genre, far too seriously. Either way ? this is an experience. It's up to you to decide exactly what kind.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent, but it was not a horror movie. This was more black comedy horror and it owes it's success to the wit of the writers and also their familiarity with oh so many horror movies that have come before. The writers are certainly horror movie fans but this was more of a homage to those that have come before.It starts out with a bunch of beautiful young people that you assume will simply be killed one by one if you haven't read the reviews but the movie evolves into a much better film than that with a lot more creativity even though they nod to a huge number of old and newer classic straight horror films.The acting is excellent and the stoner guy basically steals the show. I want to comment on so much more but can't without giving the story away... Argh! I loved that they knew their classic films and that plus their cleverness makes this film one I want to own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror fans are in for a treat!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe the hype. I watched this film because of the incredible buzz it was generating among moviegoers, and of course Joss Whedon's involvement meant I had to check it out. If it wasn't for that then the film wouldn't have been on my radar whatsoever. It's safe to say that I don't regret spending my hard earned money to see this one.This film is straight up a love letter to Horror. 'Cabin' makes a statement about everything that is wrong with slasher flicks these days, and it makes an attempt to revive the genre with a fresh take on it. For the most part, it succeeds.If you are familiar with Whedon projects, you will instantly recognise his stamp on the film. The dialogue is consistently sharp and witty, and the humour, thrills and scares are balanced masterfully. Make no mistake, this film is hilarious. It manages to keep you on edge whilst delivering occasionally gut busting laughs. The actors do their respective jobs well playing our not-so-favourite horror movie stereotypes. The CGI is serviceable if not outstanding, some things look genuinely terrifying but on occasion a few things stood out as looking cartoonish. Drew Goddard did a bang up job in his first directorial effort, and did a good job of balancing the humour and scares.I won't spoil anything, but there is a rather brilliant and fantastic twist to the film, we are gradually clued in as to what is really going on with the cabin, and by the time it was outright said what was going on most of us in the theatre had worked it out. The final act of the film really is something special, and is some of the most delightfully chaotic stuff you will have the opportunity to indulge in this year. Everyone will love this part of the film, but fans of the horror genre will especially adore it. All of this and we are then treated to a cameo by a legend of the sci-fi/horror genre, everyone will be familiar with this person, but only fans will truly appreciate their being featured in the film. This is definitely a fanboy's film, but it is also tailored for the more casual of audiences (again, something Whedon is well known for) and should still appeal to them.The only reason that this film doesn't get a perfect 10 from me, is because aside from the third act of the film, it felt like at some parts it became what it was spoofing/paying homage to, depending on how you look at it. This is not a major criticism by any means, as it's triumphs more than make up for any small flaws. By all means it wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything "fresh" as was promised, in my opinion all the attention was focused on the surprise element of the story and as a result some scenes in 'Cabin' lacked flair and creativity. Minus the twist in the plot and third act, The Cabin in the Woods is, well, a competent if not special film about a cabin, in the woods. I had a great time watching Cabin in the Woods. Everyone should enjoy this film, but for horror/slasher fans, this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most original film or the genre in a very long time! 8 out of 10!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like I always say 80 - 85% of horror movies are not very good, but if you get scared, freaked out at least a little then it's worth it.The commercial might seem a little typical. But this film is not.I'm sure if any shots in the film remind you of The Evil Dead, or location of it being a Cabin in the woods. Was a well played homage to those films before it. And in no way a rip off.CABIN IN THE WOODS - 8 out of 10. The most original film of the genre I've seen. Why it was filmed in 2009 and only released now, appears to be arguments between the studio and the creators of the film over 3D. Eventually released with the creators 2D intentions. Well worth the money. It's true. It's not what you think. Very entertaining. The less you know, or tell anyone...the better! Good night at the movies!There will be gore. There will be laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiendishly clever and wickedly inventive, this meta-horror that puts a fresh spin on everything you love about the genre is also one of its most original films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when you thought you've seen all that the horror genre can offer, along comes a movie like 'The Cabin in the Woods' which is, to say the least, like nothing you have ever seen before. Of course, that's only what the fan-boys have been anticipating, given the promise from cult producer and co-writer Joss Whedon that this film would turn the genre on its head- Whedon, for the uninitiated, is the much-loved creator of TV's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' as well as the man behind this summer's blockbuster event 'The Avengers'.Indeed, this collaboration with fellow 'Buffy' writer Drew Goddard (who makes his feature film directing debut here) gives the familiar horror tropes a whole new spin, culminating in one of the most original revelations in the history of the genre that will take your breath away. After all, which horror movie would you find the likes of crazed serial killers, creepy young girls, winged mutants and over-sized Anacondas all together in the same place? But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's just say it starts in more conventional territory to give you some time to warm up to its nuttiness.So following in the footsteps of classic horror films 'Friday the 13th', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Evil Dead', the basic premise revolves around five college students, all more or less stock types, taking the weekend to get away to some secluded vacation spot. There's the jock- a football player named Curt (Chris Hemsworth); the intellectual- a bookish type named Holden (Jesse Williams); the dumb blonde Jules (Anna Hutchison) who is really neither if not for the fact that she had just dyed her hair blonde; the stoner Marty (Fran Kranz) with the retractable bong; and last but not least the virgin Dana (Kristen Connolly), or as one of the surprise characters in the movie comments, at least looks the part.There is of course much more to it, and right from the outset, the movie keeps you guessing if the quintet are no more than unwitting victims of a scientific experiment, intercutting constantly between the five teens and two techies- Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Hadley (Bradley Whitford)- who seem to be running some kind of a rogue surveillance operation. To say anything more would be to give away too much, as part of the fun is really not being able to anticipate what Wheedon and Goddard have up their sleeves. This however we will say to tantalise you- the redneck zombies which terrorise our five protagonists were deliberately released from their apparent resting place in the ground by our two rocket scientist types.To say the film is brilliant on so many levels is not an overstatement. On the surface, it appears to send up the typical teen horror genre conventions with witty teen-speak (think this generation's 'Scream') and keen self-awareness while keeping the thrills (e.g. watching the dumb blonde and the jock get it on before meeting a bloody fate) intact. And then on a different level, it seems to critique the modern-day audience's insatiable appetite for carnage and ritualised violence- while taking jabs at their concomitant thirst for reality-TV.Yet there is really much more than meets the eye, and the last 20 mins of the film is pure fanboy orgasmic delight, paying homage to every subgenre of the horror family (including those from Hollywood's foreign cousins Japan and Sweden) while inserting a surprise cameo that is utterly befitting of the nature of the twist. Admittedly it does require some knowledge of the genre as well as an appreciation of what Wheedon and Goddard are trying to accomplish to appreciate its genius, but once you do, you can't help but admire the thought and detail that went into the climax- and yes that's a killer unicorn you'll see somewhere in there too.It's easy for such an ambitious high-concept film to fall apart, but like the image on its poster, the many disparate layers hold together surprisingly well under Goddard's confident direction. It is as assured a debut as any, complemented by a smart teenage cast acutely aware of just what Goddard is trying to accomplish with each frame. The scene- stealer here is Fran Kranz, whose pothead paranoiac act is blessed with some of the best one-liners in the film, not least for the fact that some of the nonsense conspiracy theories he utters turns out surprisingly prescient.Perhaps the even more astonishing fact is that Wheedon and Goddard apparently completed the script of the film in just three days, taking a fiendishly clever meta-level approach to the horror genre and creating a game-changing exercise that puts everything you know and have come to expect from the genre in a whole new light. Scary, grotesque, bloody, gory, funny and entertaining at the same time, it is one of the most original horror films you've seen in a long while and the perfect jolt in the arm for a genre that's ironically gone the way of the dead in recent times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many emotions and feelings came when watching this film, the first was "what have I just witnessed", the second "that was f*ing brilliant", the third "that was kinda stupid", the fourth "that was very clever", the fifth "I've never seen anything like that before" and the sixth "I wanna see it again".I don't really know what I was expecting here to be honest, I thought it might be a fairly generic horror film with Joss Whedon's fantastically witty dialogue. And in some ways I was right but mostly I was completely wrong. This is a very hard review to write without giving away any plot points, but you may see some of it coming, but you'll never see it being done in this way before.To be honest the only thing I can say is just go and watch it and make of it what you will. I thought it was great, and came out of the cinema with a grin on my face. This is a hard film to gauge how different people will react, I expect most will find it enjoyable and funny, but others will loathe it, its definitely a "Marmite" film. To be honest this goes for a lot of Wheadon's writing and props go to Drew Goddard for an ace first time directing gig.So despite this rather lame review where I have struggled to comprehensively give an opinion, I really loved the film a lot and would recommend giving it a watch. But this isn't for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thor and his friends go for a little getaway to the titular place for a weekend of typical cheesy eighties horror shenanigans.Then good old Joss Whedon nips past and tries to do a Kevin Williamson, rewriting the whole horror genre.The twist in this is in fact that the cabin is there for more sinister reasons, Men in shirts in an underground office are watching their every move and waiting with baited breath what they pick in the cellar.It decides not just their fate, but a lot of people.I've been waiting for three years to see this movie, even Hemsworth god fed up and became a god of thunder, but was it really really worth the wait.In short no.The film is good, and has some really innovative parts (the last twenty minutes could be the craziest thing i've seen on the screen in a long time, but when every scene featuring the titular place becomes boring compared to what is happening with two old men in an office, things are not right.First you must realise is that this film is Svi-Fi. It gas horror elements to it, but it's not your average horror flick. The scenes with the cabin and the teens are just too predictable, and whether this was the intention of the writers, i'm sure they didn't intend to bore the audience.The cast are fine, but what makes tis film so watchable is the casting of Jenkins and the other guy whose name escapes me as the ones who are making it happen. These are genuinely endearing scenes and the script sparkles with wit and intelligence, then we get back to the dull teens.So all in all it's a great shame that the titular place is boring, but calling this film 'Two men in an office' doesn't have the same ring to it.An whoever thought it would be a good idea to have a bird fly into the shield near the beginning, ruined what could have been one of the best 'deaths' in the whole film.Great last twenty minutes, great in the underground office, dull, dull, dull with the kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film initially draws you in with its formulaic narrative and reference to other contemporary horrors such as Cabin Fever (2002), The Grudge (2004) and The Haunting in Connecticut (2009). A group of stereotypical teenagers (jock, slut, nerd, stoner and virgin), going on a stereotypical holiday in the woods, and meeting a stereotypical man the middle of nowhere who scares them; these genre clichés hint at another run of the mill horror, but in fact the film is quite the opposite.An underlying theme of consumerism runs throughout the film. We are introduced to the characters Hadley (Bradley Whitford) and Sitterson (Richard Jenkins), vending machine coffee fuelled, tequila shout drinking gamblers are not presented as bad people ? they make us laugh, despite their job being, for lack of a better word, sick.The true presentation of consumerism this film calls into question is the consumption of horror films and our expectation of the genre tropes. There is a strong feeling throughout that the film is playing a game with its audience as well as its clueless, fun-seeking cast members, none more so than stoner Marty (Franz Marty) who we are interpolated to love from the moment he is introduced ? hot-boxing his car with a stylishly inventive bong that folds down to look exactly like a flask; genius.For spectators who like to try and guess the story before it fully unfolds, you will have a field day with this. This is why this film is so successful, because they are saying: "don't go into the cinema with expectations, you are our puppets and we are going to turn, twist and rip your expectations apart as much as we can to give you a unmatchable cinematic experience."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I like a film I always spend some time on IMDb reading the "hated it" reviews and I'm constantly surprised by what I read. Obviously, a lot of people really hated this one and, whilst I might not take a lot of these seriously as they are little more than rants and SHOUTING, others have a more considered take on the film's shortcomings.I'm a fan of Joss Whedon's work so I'm predisposed to like what he does (yes I know he was only co-writer and not the director). The dialogue and sensibilities though are clearly Whedonesque in character and some of the actors previously cast in Angel and Dollhouse are prominent in the cast. There's no doubt this is a meta-film and whilst I started off thinking this was an elitist approach that is bound to alienate many, it is actually true about any great movie or work of art that it is about the state of the media in which its realised.Many of the references made in this film assume a familiarity with the horror genre, not just of horror films themselves but of literary references that have influenced horror. I would be surprised if most fans of the genre did not enjoy this on some level but the reviews here sometimes say otherwise. I will observe the convention that most other reviews have observed in not commenting on the developments that feature in the second part of the movie although I will say that I do not think the parallels with the Truman Show that some have drawn are really relevant. (Because nowhere is it implied or stated that there is an audience beyond the technicians).In the past I have often commented on poor CGI in films and this one has some quite dodgy CGI sequences but in this case I didn't mind. They are over so quickly and in some cases are so cheesy that I just treated them as part of the fun.I really, really liked Cabin in the Woods but you probably won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good fun comedy horror film with a strong inventive twist. This film is very meta in a good way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard some good rumors about this film but went in to the cinema pretty unaware of the films plot. I had watched the trailer before viewing the film and like most people felt it gave away too much up front. Fear not the trailer gives away only one real twist of the film. On to the movie itself. People in the woods and sh*t starts to go wrong. Thats about all you need to know about the film, and that it is more of a comedy than a straight up horror film. If you go in wanting to be scared then you could come away disappointed. However If you are a fan of the horror/comedy genre then this film is for you. The acting is average, but a good kind of average. The film relies more on humor, premise and visuals over straight up acting. The actors do a good job of making their characters likable to the audience which keeps you invested long into the second act where the big twist really comes to the fore. Fran Kranz deserves mention as the funniest and best realized of the characters though this is probably due more to how he was written than anything else. Also quick nod to Anna Hutchison for a fun make out scene.The films visuals are pretty good for a 30 million dollar budget but there are a few effects that could have been beefed up a bit. The soundtrack didn't leave much of an impression but it served it purpose. The films pacing is good through out even if it does lose itself a little at the end of the film. Which if I did have any complaints that would be it, the ending isn't bad it is just not as good as the lead up to it.To conclude "The cabin in the woods" is a fun film. Not the best horror or comedy film you will see this year but certainly inventive and well executed. In the congested horror genre that too often relies of reusing old material well past the sale by date "The Cabin in the woods" feels new and fresh, a real treat for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy/Horror... just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was just OK. not spectacular and not the kind I tell my friends about. It was entertaining, and if you like horror/comedy films you will probably like it. Overall the concept was a twist on some movies that have already been done (Cube, Saw, both of which were better). Has a sci-fi vibe but never really scares because it flips to funny too much. I actually laughed several times. I cant give away too much but the ending had a twist which was pretty overdone/weird. It worked with the whole thing though. Not believable at all but if you can get past that its OK. Still I thought it was definitely funnier that it was scary, so don't go looking to be scared! 4/10</fullReview>

It was constantly brought forth, yet it didn't amuse me even once.The usual teenage US take. I'm actually glad I grew up before this vile sh*t. The original Evil Dead was thousand times more fun than this garbage.In the old horror movies you actually cared about the people involved, whereas in this I just hoped that someone would please kill them off as soon as possible.

		<fullReview>This episode of seemingly a live Scooby-Doo ripoff adventure is a little better than it first may appear. Probably because the story isn't burdened with the whole soap-opera sub-plot. Also, it sticks to the approach of the original cartoon series as well: Team finds monsters, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, team seeks clues, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, Velma discovers the solution, trap set up for monsters, monsters chase Scooby and Shaggy, get caught in trap, true identity of monsters unmasked.The story rolls right along, with a pretty decent conclusion (if this were a kid's movie.) Relentlessly bargain bin worthy movie, but okay for an amateur effort.</fullReview>

The control room stuff was gold. The writing very good. The acting good. The direction was good except for the last 20 minutes. Although the content was beautiful, the shot compositions needed help. Take the time. In any case I detest hand-held: it looks bad in all cases and is just plain lazy.But all in all was a wonderful treat. I could have sat through more. Much more.

		<shortDescription>Cabin in The Woods - A Hit to the Horror Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now there's been very little talk about this film. Well, there has been lots of talk about it but it all goes something like this "um, um, well" and then they eventually say that its a horror movie and someone shouts at them saying that that's incorrect. It's written by the guy who made Cloverfield, which some people liked and said was revolutionary but I'm not a fan of. Also, this film was actually finished in 2009 and was not released up until now due to MGM going bankrupt, which make's it interesting as its actually a quite young (pre Thor) Chris Hemsworth playing a role in it. It's a difficult review to do because I don't want to reveal too much about the film which could end up spoiling it for people.Here's the IMDb description: "Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods." OK, so simplistic horror movie with 5 characters who are obviously the stereotypical teen quintuplet going to a place where some bad stuff is obviously going to go down. That description is really useless. This film is? interesting. All I can say is that it's not what its set up to look like in the posters or the trailer. On the subject of the trailer, some say it ruins the film and while I do think a few scenes maybe shouldn't be in the trailer, it does add intrigue. It is however one of the most well thought out, entertaining and different films I've seen in a while. It is honestly beyond a genre. It is nothing like any kind of film out right now and while it bears some resemblance to maybe one or two horror films in the past, these two films (i'm not naming them) were also unique to their time.The performances in the film are unimportant, though I guess they all seemed to do OK. Chris Hemsworth did his bit but I did really think that Fran Kranz (ridiculous name) who played Marty was really excellent in the way he portrayed his character which wasn't just because that character was written so well. Some of the shots in the film are worth noting and about 3/4 the way through there's some great scenes which unfortunately I can't go into too much detail about, but lets just say it makes you keep your eyes wide open.I don't think there is much more I can add to this review and it's annoying because there is so much to talk about. It is a blow to the horror genre's gut and I'm interested to see if Drew Goddard continues to try different things and experiment with "Horror" as a genre8/10. A fresh, entertaining thrill ride of a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching "The Cabin in the Woods"! Turn your brain off when watching "The Cabin in the Woods" the movie is stupid but in a brilliant way! The movies concepts are so bizarre the viewer has an original script with new plot twists and devices which keeps the viewer enthralled. I never seen a horror movie begin like "The Cabin in the Woods" has. I never seen a movie end like this one did! The script has a few social messages hidden into the film. One, society/media tries to control people, and fit them into typecast people. Two, there is a few people who are conscious of this, 3 d thinkers, and figure things out. 3 the movie has a low opinion of human nature and believes that we get what we deserve. Entertaining to watch! I give "The Cabin in the Woods" an eight out of ten!</fullReview>

I can't tell you how glad I am. This movie kept my mouth open the entire time with so many twists and turns it's almost impossible to predict the ending(as I am often prone to doing). Joss Whedon once again delivers an amazing story that surprises viewers to the very end. Speaking of the ending. Oh my god and wow are the only words I have to describe it. A movie that finally ends the way it should. This is a fantastic movie filled with horror, humor, and just pure fun. If you're not a Joss Whedon fan already, this movie will make you one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great satire of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well after weeks of hearing how great the Cabin in the Woods is, I finally saw it. Now I avoided pretty much anything having to do with this film. I didn't read or watch any reviews, didn't look up any details about it, and when any trailer for the movie came on TV, I turned away or changed the channel. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do not look up anything on it, this is a movie that is better when you don't know what you're getting into.Now this was directed and co-written by Drew Goddard, who also wrote one of my favorite movies, "Cloverfield." And while I can't say I like this as much as Cloverfield, this film was a very interesting film to see. It basically starts off as a typical horror movie, with a bunch of cliché characters. But it soon turns into something that I never would have suspected. And the characters are also really fun. Drew Goddard knows how to take cliché characters, and make them interesting. My favorite being Marty.The only problems I really had with it were that at times it was a little too dark, I couldn't tell what the hell was going on. THIS MIGHT BE A SMALL SPOILER: And the ending, it wasn't bad, but it was kind of depressing.I really don't want to get into much else, so I will just end with one small spoiler. It doesn't really ruin the plot, but I was happy when it happened.SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS: Remember Paul, that alien comedy from last year with Seth Rogan and the guys from Shaun of the Dead. I didn't like that movie, but that also had a cameo from Sigorney Weaver, unfortunately it was ruined because they let us hear her voice. This movie didn't show Weaver until the end, and it was awesome.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Cabin In The Woods" - See it in Theaters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the Theater - "The Cabin In The Woods" - Writer/Director Drew Goddard and co-writer Joss Whedon (The Avengers, Buffy The Vampire Slayer) have pretty much turned the Horror genre on it's ear with this ambitious, inspired bit of blood-soaked fun. It's a cool blend of Horror/Sci-Fi/Comedy/Satire that should please fans of pretty much any of the aforementioned genres. This isn't a straight-forward tale of college kids being slaughtered in the boonies- it's much, much more than that .The film stars Chris Hemsworth (Thor) as the jock, Kristen Connelly as the good girl, Fran Kranz (Dollhouse) as the wisecracking pothead, Jesse Williams (Grey's Anatomy) as the intellectual and Anna Hutchison as the sex bomb. Hemsworth fans might be disappointed with the nature of his role here- this film was finished in 2009 so the filmmakers couldn't possibly have foreseen the Superstar status he would cement with 2011's "Thor". Richard Jenkins (Let Me In) and Bradley Whitford (The West Wing) are the scene-stealers here, in roles I wouldn't wish to disclose the natures of. Amy Acker (Angel) and Brian White (Brick) round out the actors you may recognize.The dialogue is often of the very witty variety- pay attention because many of the questions you may have about the "rules" or problems you may have with apparent plot holes will pretty much be covered in quick snippets of banter. It's decidedly well-written, which is a rarity with current Horror releases. Those expecting generous amounts of blood &amp; gore, monsters galore and gratuitous boob shots (a little wanting in this department, for my tastes...) should all be pleasantly surprised. It covers most of the bases, so to speak.Complaints: a few quick scenes are way too dark for my tastes and a bit of a polish on the five stereotypical participants would have been nice. The stoner acting as comedic relief has a nasal delivery to his dialogue which seems forced and unnecessary.The film is complete with a very cool, resonating cameo near it's conclusion. Highly Recommended and it deserves to be seen in theaters.8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most fun I have ever had watching a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is not a lot more that I can say about Cabin in the Woods that hasn't been said already. The movie has been praised by critics as being one of the best horror movies ever made and one of the best movies of the year. I love a good horror movie but the problem is the horror genre has fell flat in the last...20 years! I was incredibly excited for Cabin in the Woods to say the least. Cabin in the Woods is inventive, funny, scary, exciting, and a movie that seems tp draw from the horror genre while redefining it simultaneously. The trailer gives absolutely nothing away which seems to be its curse and its edge. Many people think this looks like just another mindless horror movie with teenagers getting slashed but wait! There's a twist...a force field is keeping them in. Stupid. I admit I felt the same way until the buzz around this movie was incredibly positive. The trailer doesn't let us see just how unreal this movie is because it is so different if it showed anything more we wouldn't be surprised and it wouldn't be as fun. That is so refreshing and I hope this movie finds large success from word of mouth because its so damn entertaining. Cabin in the Woods has the basic premise of a group of college students going on a vacation to, where else, the Cabin in the Woods of course. Without ruining anything like the trailer didn't, Ill just say they run into trouble unlike anything you have ever seen in a movie before. Cabin in the woods is fast paced with no drawn out sections like many scary movies. The movie has just as many scares as it has laughs from beginning to end. It feels like a sattire because the movie is funny and you can see many different movies in Cabin in the Woods but it is not. It just feels like a sattire because it is so different in such a great way. This movie isn't the scariest movie by any means but this is a game changer type of movie (I hope). Filmmakers of the past horror movies should feel ashamed and future ones should take note. There is no need to rely on blood and gore for scares, but suspense and a care for the character in the scene. Many horror movies must take themselves less seriously and learn to let the audience laugh a little bit and have fun. Unless of course another Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist comes along again, and the horror movies Hollywood has been putting out lately gives no indication of that. I have been praising this entire time with no real description of the movie because I want you all to just go and see it. Trust me. I watched the first showing played in the city and I am going again tomorrow morning. Do not read anything about the movie and if a commercial coms on about it change the channel. This is a public service announcement. This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen and I cant remember a time I had more fun in a theatre.</fullReview>

I'm in...Of course it's scope winds up being SO much more then just a standard slasher flick..The makers obviously have a huge love for ALL things horror...

At one point, I became bored as I tried to figure out if the plot were similar to that of the Hunger Games in the sense of people being placed in controlled atmospheres. In fact, I really enjoyed the whole idea of sacrificial "lambs" as a means of keeping the evil Gods at bay. Although I give this movie an 8 rating, it's merely on the fact that the director chose not to make this a typical cabin horror flick. I think much of the audience was surprised to know that there was a reason for the killings, a reason that kept us on the edge of our seats. And it kept me guessing. How did they contain all of the alien/ancient specimen but had no real means of fighting them off? That alone keeps this movie from getting a 9 rating. lol</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horror film that doesn't shy away, but rather plays up its conventions for maximum entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past ten or so years, horror cinema has taken a very interesting turn. While there was a long period of time where horror film was composed of the classic monsters and slashers like Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers, or any number of monsters such as zombies, vampires, werewolves (the list goes on and on), horror cinema has had a series of films that work quite differently. Two major changes that can be seen now: the use of technology in horror films and the acknowledgment of the horror conventions in these films."The Cabin in the Woods" does both.Much like Sam Rami's 2009 "Drag Me to Hell," and even more obviously in films such as "Scream" or "Shaun of the Dead," "The Cabin in the Woods" is a horror film that does not shy away from reminding its audience of it. Just like "Drag Me to Hell," "Cabin" constantly overplays and exaggerates the conventions of horror cinema, from the obvious setting (uh?a vacant cabin in the middle of the woods) to the cast of characters we follow (the pretty girl, the jockey boys, the druggy/party guy, and the not very promiscuous girl).Now, before I continue on, I will warn you that there are some details I am about to talk about that may leak a little of the underlying story of the film. I'm not going to reveal major twists or even exactly everything about the underlying story (you probably won't even be surprised if you watched the trailer for the film and you will find out about this part of the film in the first minute), but I want to make sure I give this warning to people who don't want to be spoiled at all.So, the second change in horror film, technology, is an extremely large portion of this film. The film begins with Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford playing two execs in a strange company in a deep underground base. We slowly learn that these two guys, along with everyone else in the company, have video surveillance and control of every one of the characters at this cabin. Starting with this video surveillance, the film delves even deeper into technology as the film progresses, but we'll leave that alone for each viewers surprise.To read the rest of the review (does not fit in the short IMDb form) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/the-cabin-in-the-woods/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, Someone Finally Figured Out How to Make a Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me that I like horror films and how pathetically bad they've been over the past 10-15 years that I began to hate the genre. This is the best horror film I've seen since the first 'Scream.' It was fun, scary, I screamed a bunch of times, I was on the edge of my seat, it was original, wasn't predictable at all, and I had an all around good time. I really hope this is a turning point in horror films and people at least try to be original with them, for a change, instead of the Rob Zombie and Eli Roth crapfests we've had to endure for the past 10 years. Two of the worst film makers of our generation, who completely killed a genre. I'm glad Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard finally revived it. It was about time some writers and directors with talent came along. And I was happy to see some of the cast from 'Dollhouse' and other Whedon projects in the film.Films like this make it actually worth it to go the movies. Our show was almost sold out, on a Sunday afternoon, and I can see why. It's gotten great word-of-mouth and great reviews, and was the most original movie I've seen in awhile, and also, one of the better films I've seen...well, other than 'The Artist,' and 'The Descendents,' but everything else I've seen lately has been unmemorable and terrible.Definitely worth the price of admission and I'll probably see it again, 'cause I missed the beginning, and it was still that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Took me by Surprise. Horror and Non-horror Fans should definitely See This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five teenagers: Dana (Kristen Connolly), Curt (Chris Hemsworth), Jules (Anna Hutchison), Marty (Fran Kranz), and Holden (Jesse Williams) are vacationing for the summer. According to Curt, his cousin owns a cabin that is in the middle of the wood (the title says it all). Night falls, strange things are occurring in the woods. Looks like these kids are going to have one hell of a day. Meanwhile two technicians Richard Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Steve Hadley (Bradley Whitford) are preparing to set up an operation.Oh boy, to be honest people, I don't know how to start this review not because of how I hate this movie but because of how much I loved it. In fact this is one of the greatest horror films that I have seen in a long time.The Cabin in the Woods is your typical horror films or to say the least. By analyzing the title, you get the idea how the film comes down. The story about a group of teenagers on a camping trip is done plenty of times. But the second half of the movie gets really interesting because of the whole concept. Unfortunately I don't want to say it because it contains too much spoilers. However I do want to say that it's the best part of the film which is why I love it so muchSurprising, The Cabin in the Woods is a comedy as well. Half of the time we laugh because of the humor. The other is for the stupidity that was put in the film, like cheesy dialog and over-the-top acting, but here's the twist. Writers Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon did that on purposely did that so the audience can laugh and it works.Although the acting isn't amazing, at least it isn't bad compare to other films, especially the fact that it's a horror genre, which usually has bad acting. Without spoiling about their specific roles, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford are the perfect duos. On the teenager side, Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz also deliver good performances. Their roles are cliché, but it was meant to be like that. Again I have to credit to Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon for doing that. Strangely their characters are likable.Horror fans are going to enjoy the references of other horror genres like Halloween, Friday the 13th, Cabin Fever, Evil Dead, Hellraiser, etc.Overall The Cabin in the Woods is enjoyable. Sure the movie is not meant to be serious, but it is extremely entertaining. I haven't been this entertained in a horror film for a long time. Horror fans will definitely love it. Non-horror fans should check this one out. This film took me by surprise. You have to see this film to believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't know what to expect from this film and as a general rule when it comes to horror I'm a bit of a baby! I especially hate the gory movies. The movie was scary, but also tense and really funny in parts. This film had a surprising and fresh story line, and I totally loved it. It was entertaining and the usual horror movie formula was applied, but that was there to help the movie along and let you feel comfortable and lull you into a false sense of security and make you think you knew what was coming next. Trust me you don't know what's coming next, you go through most of the film wondering what the hell is going on, but in a really good way! It's grips you! The characters were watchable and Chris Hemsworth was his usual gorgeous self. It was thrilling in parts and scary! This is a seriously fun movie and definitely worth a watch.

No one has done anything like it, Joss Whedon did a great job in writing the screenplay. Of course at the beginning the audience is confused by what they think is going on. Once the action starts happening and things are explained it made me think?who thinks of this? It has your typical group of college friends on a vacation but it goes on to so much more than that.

		<fullReview>Are we in the right theater? That was the first fleeting thought that went through my head during the opening few seconds of Drew Goddard's Cabin in the Woods, as Steve and Richard (Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford) ? two middle-aged, middle-management types ? engage in banal conversation over a water cooler, in what appears to be a quasi-military scientific facility. Didn't we show up to see attractive young people getting killed creatively in a rustic, natural setting?But soon enough, we're presented with the good-looking collegians we expected: They're all meeting up at the house of Dana (Kristen Connolly) for a weekend off the grid, packing into an RV to head to a remote mountain retreat. Even before they make their debut, though, it's clear this is the right movie: There's no mistaking the familiar tone of producer and co-writer Joss Whedon's trademark witty banter in that opening scene.From there, things proceed, on one level, exactly as expected: some quick expository banter in the RV to establish the characters, a stop at a rundown gas station that seems drawn equally from Deliverance and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and eventual arrival at the cabin, shot to evoke the Evil Dead series.In the basement of the house, during a game of truth or dare (of course), the gang find a collection of creepy trinkets, baubles and assorted ephemera that looks like a horror-movie attic sale: sepia-toned photos of a long-dead family; a diary describing their violent past; blank-eyed porcelain dolls and puzzle boxes. Each one is a portent of bad things about to happen, which only the group's resident stoner conspiracy theorist, Marty (Whedon regular Fran Kranz) seems to realize.The catch is that as this crew of slightly too-stereotypical archetypes goes through the horror movie motions, their every move is being monitored by Steve and Richard back at that facility, along with an army of supporting staffers and technicians, both observing and working to influence the proceedings. Nothing in this film is quite what it seems.A horror-movie attic sale is, in essence, exactly what Cabin in the Woods is, an attempt to exorcise the genre of its formulaic possession by stuffing the movie full of its most overused and predictable elements ? and then dumping them through clever skewering.It would be unfair to speak in any kind of detail about the precise nature of the interaction between the cabin and the observers, or about some of the crazy images that Goddard manages to put on screen during the chaos of the film's completely insane climax. I will say that I was watching through tears of laughter flowing so freely that I probably didn't even catch the entire parade of the bizarre in that sequence.But part of the pleasure of this movie ? one of a great many pleasures, as it's the most entertaining and satisfying horror movie I've seen in a long while ? is to see how that relationship unfolds, and to be completely surprised by those images. Goddard and Whedon have created a wonderful puzzle of a film that is loving in its appreciation of good horror, even as it takes the genre (and its blood-lusty audience) to task for the unimaginative banality that has been too typical of recent scary movies.There's a serious and smart critique here, and life-or-death stakes that only come from characters one genuinely cares about ? a neat trick, given that they're set up to be so generic. But Whedon, the creator of a vampire slayer named Buffy, has always excelled at clever one-liners set against backdrops of unspeakable and ancient evil. Goddard, in his first turn as director, matches the verbal wit with memorable visual set- pieces that are as hilarious as they are horrific.It's true that the symbolic connections drawn here aren't exactly subtle, but subtlety in subtext has rarely been the prerogative of even the best horror. Neither is the movie particularly scary, but that's not the aim here, either. Whedon and Goddard create a self-contained universe that plays by its own rules to serve its own critical agenda, and does so with smarts and skill.For all of its intellectual pleasures, though, Cabin in the Woods is a visceral roller coaster of a movie at heart. And like the best thrill rides, when it's over, you just want to get back on and go again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joss Whedon created my favorite television show of all time: BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Tired of seeing the helpless blonde "cheerleader" character be killed off first in so many horror films, he turned the genre on its head. Now it was the blonde cheerleader who was doing the stalking, killing and hunting, but for the good guys. With the new film THE CABIN IN THE WOODS with BUFFY alumnus Drew Goddard, Whedon once again takes an old and tired genre and injects some life into it. The best way to describe THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is to say that it is a horror movie about horror movies. This is Whedon's love/hate letter to the horror genre.Without giving away the spoilerish parts of the plot, I'll simply say that it involves five friends who fit the horror movie stereotype (Jock, Slut, Stoner, Nerd, Virgin) who go to a ? you got it ? cabin in the woods. They want to party of course, get away from it all, "off the grid" as one character points out. The trouble is, it's never really a good idea to go to a cabin in the woods. If the horror genre has taught us anything, it's to stay away from these places. To be honest, the less you know about this film, the better. The trailer is all about the fact that you "think you know the story" and that's exactly what this film is about, our preconceived notions, which is where Whedon and Goddard have their fun with us.Fans of BUFFY and ANGEL will get a real kick out of this flick. Not only do characters from the Whedonverse show up (YAY for Fred and Andrew) but the overall tone of the film feels like it could be lifted right from the show. Of course, in saying that, I feel like I'm saying too much, so let's move on shall we?THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is one hell of a fun movie. The last time I had this much fun was with GRINDHOUSE, which was just as off the wall and entertaining as this one. That film was a hard one to sell, and I have the sad feeling that CABIN will be too. I can only hope that it does well, because the film deserves an audience and horror fans will certainly get a kick out of it. It's the best damn horror film to come out since Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT.To say it's all horror would be an understatement because the film is hilarious. Whedon and Goddard perfectly blend horror and comedy, which is usually a tricky balance, but these two guys worked on Buffy, which was a balancing act of genres itself. Taking the clichéd aspects of every horror film and throwing it up on the screen for us in a brilliant and deconstructing manner, we have a film that isn't afraid to laugh at itself. Every stupid character mistake in horror films is used to great effect here. Whedon and Goddard give purpose to why these things happen in the genre we all love to hate sometimes.Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford have great chemistry together and steal every scene they're in. Watching these two gave a different aspect to what we would expect from a cabin in the woods flick. The young actors on the screen all fit their roles well; we even get a chance to see a Thor-less Chris Hemsworth. In most films of this type, I'm rooting for the Freddy Kruegers or the Michael Myers of the slasher world, but here I was actually rooting for the victims. None of them are annoying, which is refreshing.There are more hilarious moments than scary ones, if I had to pick a side of the fence to fall on. I'm dying to talk about them, but doing so would ruin the experience for those reading. Seriously, go in knowing as little as possible. The film isn't afraid to show where it grabs its inspiration. THE EVIL DEAD is heavily referenced here, as are some other notable horror flicks. That's not to say that Cabin is in the shadows of other films, it stands on its own and without a doubt makes its mark on the horror genre. It will be hard for people to watch future teen horror flicks and not have CABIN pop up in the back of their heads.THE CABIN IN THE WOODS is one of a kind. People have been comparing it to SCREAM, in the sense that it's very self-aware and pumps life into a tiresome genre. I will agree with those statements, but don't expect people to go where this film went. It's too unique and bizarre for people to even try. From the moment the title card appears on the screen, you should know what type of movie you're about to see. I had a big grin on my face throughout the entire thing and it's safe to say that this is definitely in my top ten of the year. As a fan of the horror genre, I'm happy to say that THE CABIN IN THE WOODS has restored my faith. We have a film here that is not afraid to tell you what it thinks of horror movies, what's right with them, what's wrong with them and more importantly, why we love them.?

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer I thought "Oh... one of these... for the millionth time." Group-o-"teens" headed to a creepy cabin where they will be slaughtered one by one like we've all seen - thanks 90s teenie bopper slasher flicks. But alas, I was wrong.I distinctly remember a point in the theater where my mouth was hanging open just from the sheer madness on the screen unfolding in front of me.This movie was very entertaining. The story was completely wacky and original and that's what I needed. We are constantly slammed with sub par remakes every year, I was doubting there were any creative juices still flowing in the horror movie industry, but this film stands out.They raised the bar are crazy and I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film today and oh my god I just loved it. This film kept me on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. This is one of the creepiest films I have seen since silent hill. This is also one of the most original horror films I have seen in a long time. The storyline was excellent, the script was well thought out and there was enough blood and gore to make me cringe. If you are looking for a great horror comedy film then go see Cabin in the woods. This film is an absolute adrenaline rush. This movie is capable of being funny scary and gory all at the same time. Go and see this film and I promise you will not be disappointed. highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Cabin in the Woods' Meets Your Expectations, Then Destroys Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre clings onto and feeds off of audience expectations. From a fan perspective, horror-lovers tend to flock to films that appear as if they will evoke the feelings of previous successes, even to the point of supporting blatant mimicry. From a filmmaking perspective, a horror director's go-to card is expectation?the audience recognizing those classic audio and visual clues that create the anticipation of a scare.The entire horror genre is built on the foundation of what we think will happen, so when "The Cabin in the Woods" comes along and utilizes these expectations while also blowing the roof completely off them, it makes for a wildly entertaining success.Sure, some folks will want a run-of-the-mill "cabin in the woods" story, the one we've seen a thousand times thanks to paragons "Friday the 13th" and "The Evil Dead" among others. "The Cabin in the Woods" might let down those purists who rank the scare factor as top priority, but for fans of parody and satire, this is a must-see.The minds behind the film suggest a certain intelligence you won't find in horror offerings from amateurs. Drew Goddard, writer of "Cloverfield" and on TV's "Lost," and Joss Whedon, one of the most revered names in geek culture, team up on a script that delivers a great deal of wit and at the same time a strong mystery, a combination that makes for an irrepressibly exciting movie."The Cabin in the Woods" requires a certain amount of aversion to spoilers in order to be fully enjoyed, though so many unsuspected twists crop up that a few details won't actually ruin anything. Essentially, five college kids head to a remote cabin for the weekend and predictably ignore some tell-tale signs that something's amiss. The catch is that despite seeing this setup before, we as an audience don't even quite know what's going on this time around. The fact that the film doesn't open on a cabin, woods, or college kids is your first hint.Perhaps the biggest surprise has nothing do with the plot: the young protagonists are somewhat likable and the actors portraying them have a good deal of talent. Nearly everyone will recognize Chris Hemsworth (Thor himself) as Curt, but the highlights are unknowns Kristen Connolly and Fran Kranz as Dana and Marty, one an attractive bookworm and the other a clever stoner. The characters fit your horror stereotypes, but each with a bit of a twist that makes them more respectable. Even the "dumb blonde" (Anna Hutchison) isn't that dumb as she cares about her friends. Heck, the fact that these five would all be friends is kind of a jab at stereotypes.Strong writing reinforces the fact that these are more developed characters and shows Goddard and Whedon recognize that even though the goal is to turn the genre upside down, their film still needs to do the things good horror films do right in order to succeed.Without giving anything away, the central idea behind the movie is basically to give a mythology to a typical horror story motif such as the cabin in the woods, to weave it together with a science-fiction yarn that allows us to look at the genre both with humor and a greater reverence."The Cabin in the Woods" provides pure entertainment of a brilliant sort, an absolute rarity in any genre, let alone horror. With some pitch-perfect casting in roles best kept a secret, Goddard and Whedon sell their twist with great effectiveness. In hindsight, the whole operation could have backfired had there been just the slightest reason not to stay interested or care about the characters.Anyone with a keen eye for or love of satire and a familiarity with the horror offerings being played off of will find themselves on the exact same page as Goddard throughout the film. Consequently, these folks will simply love "The Cabin in the Woods." It's one thing to poke fun at a genre?anyone can do that, especially in horror. This movie does it without flopping into silly mindless spoof territory, instead entertaining us exactly as a traditional horror riff would.Although you won't see critical accolades because genre films get no love, "The Cabin in the Woods" will get its due when it appears on countless Best of 2012 lists?unless more and more 2012 movies that aren't supposed to be this good soar beyond expectations.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Cabin in the Woods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best ways to thoroughly enjoy The Cabin in the Woods, is to steer clear of its trailer and go in blind. Don't read any reviews because there are plenty out there who are just plain lazy and in their plot summary hint at what's to come, or tend to reveal too much - heck, if you're that cautious, skip my review altogether, though I promise to tread really carefully. A film that's usually bad gets shelved for months before a release date, and this was delayed for 3 years, though due to its battle to resist being converted to 3D. Thankfully it stayed the way it is rather than to go into yet another senseless depth of field conversion that brings little value to the table, and along the way nothing else got created that resembled its brilliance, keeping it extremely fresh when seen for the first time.Written by Joss Whedon (whose next film The Avengers just can't wait to burst onto the big screens) and Drew Goddard who wrote Cloverfield, and episodes for television series such as Lost, Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the concept for The Cabin in the Woods is so fluid and probably easy to come up with if you're smoking something, working on many levels, and gives us all a reason why horror films play out the way they do. The writing duo takes the quintessential horror film ensemble of characters, and slaps on some fictional yet logical rationale, though keeping it thoroughly entertaining, and with the usual bag of tricks up the sleeves that every horror filmmaker out there would have dipped into from time to time, packing it with plenty of strong irony that drips in every scene.Goddard also takes on directing responsibilities, and his feature film debut demonstrates a keen eye for various genres, all incorporated seamlessly into this film. Laughter and satire are always close by, and I can't fathom another film that's remotely close to its offering of thrills, spills and laughter, not by a mile. There are plenty of moments where you're kept on the edge of your seat, with surprising twists and turns popping up every now and then, even when the film established its own ground rules early on that will probably give you a whiff of what's to come later in the narrative. You may think you have all the answers, but the final act provides clear cut answers, and throws just about everything from the horror genre onto the screen in one giant melting pot.What I really enjoyed about the film is its tongue-in-cheek treatment about competition from around the world, reflecting real life and how we view horror films in general, with each subsequent viewing of a particular film, or a sub-genre, sensitizing us to anything a filmmaker could possibly throw at us, leaving us jaded, and almost always a step ahead of the filmmakers. Here, there's a deliberate flag flying attempt that pokes fun at the return of US horror filmmaking brilliance in a less than subtle sequence, and in what I thought was an overt warning was not to celebrate before the chickens hatch, a reminder to focus on the task at hand until it gets completed rather than to rest on premature laurels.So step into The Cabin in the Woods, and throw all preconceived notions you think may happen along the course of the movie. You'll get some right, but trust me there are a lot more going on here with references so fast and furious that this is firmly set as one of the rare few horror films that begs repeated viewing. Highly recommended, and a shoo-in into the shortlist as one of this year's best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And a new classic horror series is born!! This is what Scream did in the '90</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are the days we remember why we love Lionsgate. After collecting years of dust (due to MGM's financial collapse), the mini-major is taking a pretty hefty risk with The Cabin in the Woods, Cloverfield writer Drew Goddard's directorial debut. It only adds to the flavor that Joss Whedon (of "Buffy" fame) co-wrote the screenplay for the high-concept slasher that stars the newly minted Chris Hemsworth (Thor). The most difficult aspect of Cabin is how to sell the movie without giving anything away, I'm about to experience the same dilemma in writing this review? While there is a pretty heavy turn of events, one of the film's twists (if you can even call it that) is revealed in the opening scene. Cabin begins in an office atmosphere with co-workers Steve Hadley (Richard Jenkins) and Richard Sitterson (Bradley Whitford) comically riffing on a project they're working on. It's the mysterious setup that'll engage the viewer until the big reveal. Simultaneously, the audience is introduced to the stereotypical "teens" that are about to embark on a journey to check out a cabin in the woods, recently acquired by one of their uncles. The two stories eventually collide into a bloodbath of epic proportions.The strength of Cabin comes in the playful nature of the screenplay. Goddard and Whedon play everything tongue and cheek in a completely meta atmosphere. The two take loving jabs at the genre, making fun of the array of clichés horror fans are used to seeing, all without it coming off like a Scary Movie sequel. But the true magic happens in the full delivery of the promised "slasher movie to end all slasher movies." It's hard to elaborate without giving anything away, but it should be known that Cabin in the Woods will become an instant classic among genre fans. It's immediate. To say it's the Scream of the new decade is sort of a misnomer - seeing that people outside of horror may not "get the joke" - but for those on the inside, expect a heartfelt and blood-soaked homage to all of the films we've grown up watching.Ultimately, Cabin is an extremely fun movie that's beyond satisfying, especially for those expecting some sort of bloodbath. And even though there's a pretty heavy amount of CGI, there's an equal amount of unbelievable practical effects. Tonally, it all makes sense when you see it.While Cabin in the Woods is a tough sell to the general public, we as horror fans can only pray it finds its footing. It's one of those "gateway" movies that'll open the world of horror to an entire new generation of film buffs. There's something special about this slasher that hasn't been felt since Warner Bros. released Trick 'r Treat all those years back (and unlike Michael Dougherty's anthology, Cabin is blessed to have found a loving home.) While I wouldn't go as far as to call it a masterpiece, it's definitely the kind of project that will leave its mark, especially on younger viewers. And with Jason Voorhees nowhere to be seen (again), it's the perfect movie to check out on Friday the 13th?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out by saying that I was scared before the movie than after it. I fell asleep half way thru the movie, and my friend started playing around with his phone... This is how boring it is. It isn't really a movie, its more of an Evil Dead "homage", an Evil Dead "homage" that doesn't make sense. The Cabin in the Woods shouldn't be shown in theaters but more like on The History Channel or something. I don't know why its rated R, My 4 year old cousin could probably watch this "homage" without being scared, he'll probably not find it entertaining. The ending is just retarded. If I had $10 to waste, I wouldn't watch this movie again! I would throw the money away and not watch this piece of crap. The only scary part about the movie is when the dog jumps on the fence and starts barking.. I'm pretty sure this wasn't planned out as a scary part. That Sugarplum Fairy was straight up hideous. Her roll didn't even fit her! The beginning part leaves you with a "wtf" face. I gotta give this movie credit thought because it Mind-F***ed me.. It made me think that some parts are gonna be scary but actually aren't. I was closing my eyes expecting some scary stuff to come up but unfortunately, nothing. The animations weren't that great either. I bet my friends and I could make a more scarier movie than this.</fullReview>

Highly recommend to the horror fan but not to the other fan, they will think it's dumb. Go see it if you like zombie monster flicks, don't go if you don't like those movies. They show way too much in the trailer, ruins the surprises and twists. I think the writers should have had more faith in the audience, especially today's movie fans. They will spread the movie's need to see like crazy if it's that good and this was that good. I would have had more fun if I didn't see the trailer, that's all. So go see this movie if you like Friday the 13th, Aliens, Cabin Fever, etc. etc.</fullReview>

I can honestly say walking out all i wanted to do was run into another showing and watch it again. The acting was great- loved the stoner guy. Solid story with intriguing undertones. The humor, although sometimes concealed, is there and i did get some good laughs out of this film. The only issue i have with this movie is the reason given for the events of the film spoken at the end. No spoilers, but i just thought it was slightly silly. Other than that, i loved the movie and i would definitely recommend it to anyone. Suspense is great for first hour and a half or so, but the final 20 minute s**t fest at the end was absolutely great.

		<fullReview>Just got back from seeing the movie.The less said about the plot, the better.I really think this could become a classic over time.It really had everything going for it.It was very clever without being condescending to the audience. The stoner dude was effectively used as a mirror for the audience. Which I found very effective. Every time a horror cliché was executed, he would say something like "I do not think that is wise!"There were enough twist and turns that even this jaded viewer never saw coming.And oh, that climax!! Not only did it go totally insane in the last 20 minutes, the finale was about as non-Hollywood as you could get. I can't remember seeing an ending like that in a very, very long time.It has humor, a great plot (which alone is a novelty), gore, suspense, great special effects.I have read that some people thought this movie "ripped off" a lot of other horror movies. I didn't see it that way. To me, this was a lovely homage to the genre and I think it did it with class.As you may have guessed, I have been very vague about the movie. Again, the less you know the more you will probably enjoy it.If you love horror, humor and smarts in a film, then you should enjoy Cabin in the Woods.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically the thing that makes this movie a great watch is that it's being very self aware. It understands the genre that it's being part of and uses all of its clichés and yet manage to turn it into something fun, without ever becoming a true spoof of the genre.It really uses all of the familiar genre ingredients, of a couple of friends going to a cabin in the woods (hence the movie its title!), in the middle of nowhere. You of course already know what will be happening all to them...or do you? The story manages to give some spins to its movie, that are unusual, surprising and original but above all things are also things to add to the movie its fun.It obviously got put together by a bunch of people who had a true love for the genre and also really understood it. They understood what it is that makes a great genre movie and also what annoys the lovers of the genre, which is something this movie makes perfectly and subtly fun of at times. Because yes, make no mistake about it, this movie is a horror but at the same time also really a comedy! It makes this movie perfect to watch for all sorts of people. It's a great and fun movie for the horror lover and the more casual movie goer will also surely enjoy the ride because of its comedy elements.Because the movie, despite all of its clichés, manages to become such an original one, it is already being considered to be one of the best genre movies of recent years. Perhaps I wouldn't go that far but it definitely is one of the more original and fun genre movies of recent years.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

It has restored my faith in cinema, that a creative and technical team can pull this off because there are so many pitfalls and mines where a film can go wrong. Joss Whedon is a genius, if this film is as good as it is the mind boggles with The Avengers. Films like this don't come round very often. I'm not sure what else I can possible say. I highly endorse this movie. Ten stars are not enough. It's hard to write ten lines of text and say absolutely nothing about this film, because anything I talk about would potentially spoil the experience. That is all :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am pleased to say i was one of very few people to see The Cabin in the Woods at its first showing at 00:05 Friday the 13th, this movie has quickly worked its way in to my favorite movies. Unfortunately its a film that you can literally say nothing about without ruining the brilliance, so if you're a movie spoiler (even if it's not on purpose), make sure you're one of the last to see it. All i have to say is its most likely the best movie i've seen in years, it's totally unexpected and unlike most other horrors, have a robust and well explained story, so no thinking, what? what happened there? This is maybe the movie of the year, if not it's definitely a must see. so get yourself down to the cinema and witness this unique movie, then go home and hope for the day you can talk about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Buying Whedon's Wild Theory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Cabin in the Woods" had received so much critical praise as an excellent horror film, so this horror movie fan could not resist a bait like that. I did not read anything about the plot nor have I seen the trailer before going into the theater this morning. What can I say, this must be one of the most convoluted horror stories ever put in screen!It starts with a couple of old guys in an unspecified company talking about their mundane lives. Then, the focus cuts to some college kids who were about to go on a road trip. It is only later when you see the connection between these two disparate sets of characters. We would then see a situation seen in countless horror flicks where the characters are trapped in a lonely cabin in the God-forsaken woods where they are killed off one by one by zombie rednecks. But is that all there really is to it?The five college kids are stereotypical of what we see in practically every horror movie we had ever seen before: the whore, the athlete, the scholar, the fool and the virgin. Cliché you say, but this literally multi-layered script by wunderkind writer Josh Whedon (who just gave us the masterpiece called "The Avengers") would actually attempt to explain why these five characters should be present in all horror movies all over the world. I know that sentence probably made no sense, but that is the main premise of this over-reaching screenplay. You would never imagine what the bigger story would be, and who actually gets to deliver the explanatory lines towards the end. Acting is not a focus here, and it may actually be intentionally bad as a send-up to most horror flicks. Chris Hemsworth does not really act or look like Thor here, and could actually be played by any jock actor and would not make a difference. The computer-generated effects were excellent especially in the grand mayhem scenes where practically all the horror creatures of movie lore make a gory appearance. This ambitious conceit would be the main bone of contention of those who like and dislike this complicated film: do you buy Whedon's wild theory or not? I certainly liked it and I'm buying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subverting clichés for something original and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Behind this cliché title and cliché premise hides something quite different and original. I repeat what everyone else has been writing about it, the less you know about, the better. I'll just expand a little on what made this so good in my own opinion. The main characters were not selfish jerks, they were actually likable, and you'll even root for some of them. Even though they fit in the standard horror character stereotypes, initially they were not and basically how they "turned" into those stereotypes was cleverly explained. The all-around good acting: serious but not too serious, light but not parodic, certainly helped matters and kept the movie tone just right. Cabin in the Woods didn't take its viewers for imbeciles: it was smart, had a few humdinger plot twists and once again played with those famous horror clichés subverting them in the process. This movie actually explained most of them, but I can't tell you how.The directing was professional and easy to follow, even spectacular sometimes. There was a reveal about 3/4 of the way through(involving cubes), that had been hinted at previously that made this film mind-blowingly cool and paved the way for a seriously action-packed and unpredictable last act, something I've never seen in any horror movie and I've seen a lot. Horror fans will in fact probably enjoy it more because they'll get most of the references. Josh Whedon fans (Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse), will get a blast of seeing a few old familiar acting faces. It doesn't mean that non-horror aficionados won't enjoy it, too, because the Cabin is quite unconventional and it's not too gory compared to many other genre entries. To be fair, I found the movie way more entertaining than scary, probably because I'm too desensitized to the horrific aspects by now. I thought the jump scares and surprises were effectively done, although it's not a particularly atmospheric film. Weirdly, I think that Cabin in the Woods will become a genre-defining film. By that, I mean that I suspect it will become often referred to, whether or not the movie was liked, although I'm not sure how the concept could be done again in such a clever, fresh way.Rating: 8 out of 10 (very good)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best compliments a horror picture can get is that the suspense worked, and it was really spooky. It has been ages since this has happened in a film like this, "Cabin in The Woods" goes a step further than some of the classics, whether it follows a straightforward narrative or it approaches its main themes in an innovative way. This film will probably end up pleasing most of those who see it because it has a lot to offer to just about any member of the audience.It all starts in the expected way, with five college students spending some vacation time in an isolated location, doing every little thing that can get them in trouble, and most of the plot for the first half of the film follows the expected pattern, with an interesting subplot slowly developing in the background. Soon, "Cabin" begins to show how impressive it is.What makes the film so good is that it keeps surprising you, even when you think you have figured its angles. Stereotypes soon turn into something else, minor characters begin to resonate in unexpected ways, and the jolts are genuine, as we see them in a refreshing perspective. It'd be cruel to reveal some of the developments in the last third of the film, but here is where most of the fun is.The audience is in for a treat as myths are revisited, some story lines are spun in, well, cool ways, and there is even a special appearance by a beloved figure near the end of the film. In the end, be prepared to relish a visual feast, with many a chance to enjoy a good scare, a good laugh, and to appreciate that as long as people have imagination, we will be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE CABIN IN THE WOODS': Five Stars (Out of Five) The best reviewed movie of the year, so far, is this B slasher film from 'Nerd God' Joss Whedon! Whedon co-wrote and produced the film and his buddy, a usual partner in crime of his, Drew Goddard directed the film. The cast features new Whedon 'Go-To Man' Chris Hemsworth (who also plays 'Thor' in Whedon's upcoming 'AVENGERS' film). The film is a meta slasher flick spoof and the best of it's type since 'SCREAM' or possibly even 'EVIL DEAD II'! The story revolves around five friends going on vacation at a remote cabin in the middle of the woods owned by Curt's (Hemsworth) cousin. Despite being warned of danger by a creepy gas station attendant (Tim De Zarn) they continue to the cabin and also investigate it's mysterious basement, which is full of strange artifacts. Meanwhile they're being watched by technicians at a government facility and we learn they're guinea pigs in some kind of experiment. The film constantly winks it's eye at the viewer as it runs through every horror cliché imaginable.The movie is brilliantly tongue in cheek and the perfect homage to B horror films. The script is clever and the directing is perfectly fitting. The cast is all perfect in their roles (especially memorable turns from Fran Kranz, Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford). It's hilarious as well as perfectly gruesome (a horror fan's wet dream) and the climax is more than any monster movie fan could ask for.

		<fullReview>I am not often wowed by movies but this was one of those times!! I had great expectations knowing it was written by Josh Whedon and was very curious why he would do a movie genre of this type but was not at all what I thought it would be. The movie to me was perfect in every way and kept you entertained from nanosecond one to the last. I do not want to give anything away but even if I did you never know if you are coming or going in this multi genre film of Gothic Horror and Twisted Comedy. I smiled, I screamed (well my wife did) but most of all I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Writing, directing and cinematography were off the charts. I will be returning for a second showing this weekend and hope you will too. This is a classic that will go down as one of the top 10 horror films of all time.</fullReview>

And, you get a return to the brilliance that was Joss Whedon...prior to "Once More With Feeling."The Lovecraftian demon ballerina was an especially new (yet suitably gross) innovation. But, the creature playing with the puzzle ball? It looked like the Frankenstein Monster had a love-child by a female Cenobyte!

		<shortDescription>A Fresh Take On Modern Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the dusty shelves at MGM's studios lay "The Cabin In The Woods", the new film by "Cloverfield" director Drew Goddard and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" writer Joss Whedon. Although completed three years ago the project was backlogged due to financial difficulties at MGM until Lionsgate finally picked it up and have finally distributed it ready for eager audiences to see. At no better time either with Whedon's upcoming highly anticipated "The Avengers" making the risk of this under the radar release minimal and lowering the effect of potential damage.Explaining any of the plot would be doing the film a disservice, as it's jigsaw-esque structure is one of its strongest points. The basic premise however is five high school kids take a break to a remote cabin in the woods where their stay escalates into disastrously horrific results due to an unseen force, which may or may not be controlling everything that is happening. It's billed and sounds as though it's journeying down the same road that most teenage horror-slasher films seems to take but that would be far from the truth as the story takes all the conventions of which we've grown accustomed to; the slow build-up, the unnecessary sex scene, the stupid decisions the protagonists make which cause you to shout at the scream due to their choices and throws it all on it's head creating a tongue in cheek comical look at how horror movies have become.All the characters tick all the boxes for the traditional teen horror movie conventions. Dana (Kristen Connolly) is the sensible, timid student; Curt (Chris Hemsworth) goes along the typical jock lines; Jules (Anna Hutchison) comes across as the girl who craves attention, dressing in scantily clothes; Marty (Fran Kranz) is the stoner who brings the comic relief and there's Holden (Jesse Williams) as the sensitive male. Unlike other horror movies with these presets we care for these characters as they essentially start as five normal teenagers, the story forces them to fall into their caricatures, which gives them more of human, approach rather than the stale interpretations that other horror films do. Alongside the cast are two other actors worthy of a mention Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford as a duo, comical double act, their role however is not worth mentioning as it's better to be experienced not knowing.What really makes Cabin stand out amongst the long stream of consistent horror movies is how it manipulates and twists the traditional conventions of a teen slasher horror movie and turns it into a useful and developed plot choice. No one exclaims how the situation their in is remnant of the films they've grown up with, breaking that wall between the film and the audience, the conventions are used to push the story forward and give reasoning forward. For example, why do the majority of modern horror films include and scene depicting sex? Why do characters decide to split up, allowing themselves to be picked off one by one? All these are answered and none of the reveals for forced or unnecessary, but well crafted plot points bringing a tongue in cheek style to the story without over playing it unlike films such as "Tucker &amp; Dale Vs Evil", a small independent horror-comedy which goes for the same vibe and oversteps it mark. Cabin causes for a sly satire.Any reservations about this film are minuet but are still worth noting. Though billed as a horror/comedy, the film rarely reaches any level of terror unlike the brilliance of "Shaun of the Dead" but never reaches the over comedic levels of say the increasingly tedious "Scary Movie" saga. It doesn't particularly reach a happy medium, however it does stay highly entertaining from the moment the titles appear to the end credits. During this 90-minute ride however are small plot holes, which may bring a viewer out of the experience, but for a film of this stature a certain level of disbelief has to be brought in on the audiences part. The whole premise could seem ridiculous as it plays out, especially during the final act where the tension and entertainment explode to a high-pitched level, though the film earns that right and brings a unique ending to the film that will stay engraved into your memory for weeks on end.With all the low standard horror films that are streamed into multiplexes it's refreshing to see a project not backed with an adapted script or a revitalization of a previous film, which provides a tongue in cheek approach to the horror genre. It's not a particularly deep character piece; neither will it sweep up a large amount of awards at the Oscars. It is however a highly entertaining, tense, comical approach to modern day horror movies, turning the genre on its head doing something bold and fresh. This is a film made by the fans, for the fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short, this one of the most disappointing movies that I have ever seen on the big screen. Despite the beautiful graphics and big stars like Joss Whedon, the film, in the end, felt like the quality of a made for TV movie. The story began with a grand idea of delivering a alternative vision to a classic fair tail, but ended filled with holes in the story line and flow. None of the characters had any depths or emotional attachment. The entire movie felt like a train wreck of random scenes and jokes. Kristen Connolly did a fantastic as Thelma, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast, whom the director probably found in the back alley of the studio. In conclusion, do not go see this movie and save your money and more importantly save your time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tip for watching the film, to prevent disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly - this was one film I was really looking forward to having been hyped up on the Harry Knowles site. It tried to be Sam Raimi, it tried to be Hostel, but it failed on all counts because it couldn't settle on any particular tone. At the beginning, a juxtaposition between a corporate office environment and a retro horror film vibe with the cabin feels a bit like the seventies movie WestWorld. But whilst WestWorld took itself seriously and had an eerie, gritty vibe (thanks to Michael Crichton), Cabin in the Woods tries too eagerly to please with lame humour, whilst still trying to take itself seriously. This is where it tries to emulate Sam Raimi, and fails miserably, because its neither funny nor scary. The Cabin segments evolve from goofy/silly into (trying to be) scary. The corporate segments evolve from serious, into goofy and silly. Because of this, you have no idea what to think or feel whilst watching these tones shift. It just feels messy, there is no solid frame of reference. I appreciate this may have been on purpose, to keep the audience on its toes, but it doesn't work at all. You end up just not caring about either segment, because you don't know what to trust. You're just waiting for the "big reveal". The reason for the juxtaposition for these two opposite environments gives the film its intrigue, you spend all your time trying to figure out the motive. I kept waiting for another meta-level of irony and satire to emerge. Perhaps the control room is funded by Hollywood, and this is how all the lame horror movies really get made? No such luck. One tip for watching the film - keep yourself firmly in a Sam Raimi frame of mind, a la "Drag Me To Hell" so you know not to get too "off track" with your predictions. The film descends into complete silliness by the end, and if you were falsely lulled into a "Hostel" or "WestWorld" vibe then you'll be sorely disappointed. Another thing worth mentioning - the score of this film was by David Julyan, who scored The Descent and Eden Lake. All three movies capture similar vibes with the very similar scores by Julyan (and wide angle shots of cars driving into woods). His score here was far too similar to those films - but what a difficult film to score, having to jump from eerie to silly/goofy at the drop of a hat. Julyan was definitely a wrong choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this movie I didn't quite know what to expect, especially after the opening credits. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the great pace and casting choices. Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford were great to watch together. Kristen Connolly was very eye pleasing and the cameo by Sigourney Weaver was cause for applause.The most enjoyable part of this movie is the story. It does not take itself too seriously, allowing for many laughs which are not too distracting and do not subtract from the overall tone of the film.As far as horror films go, this is a very fun movie and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the unexpected. Not that this movie wasn't predictable. Watch it with your friends!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They may never be able to make another "X 20somethings trapped in the woods" movie again.This film is essentially a sardonic slap in the face of the entire horror genre. It holds up trope after trope and says "Remember this one?" serving as both a scathing admonishment of the industry, and a walk down memory lane.The film is so incredibly genre-savvy, that by the time we get to the actual horror portion of the agenda, it comes across as genuinely unsettling due to the fact that our usual defenses have been disarmed. And throughout the movie attempts to explain, or at least justify, some of the stupidest moments in horror cinematic history.This might as well be the capstone on the entire horror genre, as there will never be another movie horror scene where the leads do something stupid without you remembering The Cabin in the Woods, and thinking "So THAT'S why these normally sane and rational teens decided to have sex in the open air Jacuzzi while the serial killer's running around.A MUST see, because no explanation could do it justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I doubt that there will be a sequel to this.The beginning of the film tells you this is not the usual horror film, and you may quickly come to a conclusion as to what is really going on--the "victims" in the film are similarly trying to find out what is really going on. You try to think of the right category: haunted house? slasher? mad doctor? evil spirits? Or possibly this is more a science fiction film than a horror movie? Or maybe . . . it's something else entirely.I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I was not bored at all, and I certainly cannot think of another horror film this is "just like." The acting is fine. The characters are intended to be stereotypes, and the actors make them interesting.The last part of the film has some very subtle wicked humor. The film also features some plot-connected marijuana use, which under the existing criteria probably did more to earn this film an R rating than did the gore or the nudity.</fullReview>

But I wanted to watch it because in the trailer it looked very unique. Lets just say, the film was a fun time. I went with friends and we had a great time watching the movie. It's a movie you don't take seriously and you just enjoy the heck out of it. I am going to go watch it again, I rarely watch movies twice in the movie theater, but this is a must for me to watch it again. If you love horror, and great humor, you should love this movie. But the movie of course is not for everyone, you will hear people say it was horrible and the worst movie ever, thats mostly because they either did not get it or don't like horror and humor.All in all, I gave the movie a 9/10. Its not perfect, but it's very close. A great time at the movies.</fullReview>

The epitome of a roller coaster ride, with the last half hour of the film taking you in a direction that you never imagined possible. Slightly humorous in the sense that it pulls us in and repels us at the same time. I want to look away, but it is just too much fun. For not knowing anything about the film going in, I feel that this was the type of movie where it doesn't matter what you know going in. Leave your expectations at home. It's not about a Cabin in the Woods. For those of you who feel that you can predict the ending, I can assure you that it is the last possible thing you could ever suspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no real way of how to describe the film in words.. There just isn't a place to start. Instead just take a look at this meme review of the film .. Says it all ! SPOILER FREE http://9gag.com/gag/3893443 OK to post a review here I need at least 10 lines so some thought. This film is a great film and comes very close to the one of a Funny Games style , not in the sense of plot or anything, but just in the way its filmed and the way in which the film communicates with the auditory and the viewer . It interacts and point to the viewer all the time . And in the essence is a film about films (horror/thriller ones) a really bold film , and a bold move from the studios to let the director and scriptwriter go with it. should definitely be a historical film , just for making these bold choices ! So obviously I recommend to everyone! Especially for the horror fans , because the film is a big intertextual cuddle!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect deconstruction of Horror... hilarious, tense, unpredictable, and entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been anticipating The Cabin in the Woods for more than a month. Why? Well, I only heard about it last month, and thank god I wasn't waiting for it for months or even a year like many others. I read the script as well, so I did know what I was going into. But I had to know the joy of watching this on the big screen. Boy, did it live up to my extremely high expectations.The film's opening immediately reminds me of a recent, but equally magnificent horror/comedy, and that is Drag Me To Hell. But whereas that film derived it's comedy from more gags and cartoonish moments, this one starts off with brilliantly written dialogue. From the start we see two guys dealing with some sort of task, and they must accomplish this task or else... well, I'll stop there. I do want to say that although this film is very funny, it also is pretty tense. The cinematography and the music especially drive the scarier scenes well, and they both do a great job of maintaining it's witty but also seriously-driven tone. People have said that this film makes fun of these types of films. In a way yes, but it's important to note that both Goddard and Whedon were able to come up with this because they love horror so much. Their love for the genre is apparent in all of the turns the story takes, but it's not a spoof. This film is meant to be taken seriously as a horror film. It isn't just here to "make fun" of the genre as much as it is here to reinvent the genre and to make it that much more exciting. It's a blast to see this much love for the genre oozing through the screen. Since everyone has already talked endlessly about the satire and about the expectations the film toys with, I want to talk about the characters. When looking at what happens, it's surprising to see just how much we do care for them. Not just the main 5, but also the ones behind the "experiment". Bradley Whitford in particular stands out, with many different traits that make him the most likable of the bunch. His comedic timing, as well as his sense of regret and sadness at times, is brilliant. When it comes to the doomed 5, they all stand out in their own ways. Kristen Connoly is beautiful, with the sort of angelic face that stems from a more pure form of Uma Thurman. All of the deaths here are well done and quite brutal. The character that surprisingly has stayed with me the most was the first that got the axe, and I think that the first attack/death is quite effective in it's execution. You aren't just watching how "cool" the deaths look, but in this case especially, it makes you desperately sad for that character. The acting from this actor in his/her first death is quite effective and haunting, and quite sad. The ending is spectacular, and as a whole was able to have a balance between witty and funny but also serious. The cameo is brilliant, and the final scene with the discussion is fantastic. People shouldn't be ready for a twist, because what the film does very well is hint at several clues throughout the film. There's never any real "revelation" or twist, but instead the viewer is strapped to more and more information about what is really going on. The final minutes are again, rather sad. I was surprised by how much emotion the film allows the viewer to have, and in these final moments of the film is when that is more evident. Again, the film works perfectly for what it's trying to be, but despite that it still works on "feelings" and to me that's what was most surprising coming out of it. I had read the script, but what I hadn't counted on was the amount of care and thought put into these characters and situations, despite how ludicrous and how extreme they were. All in all, definitely what I was hoping for really. I have not stopped thinking about the film, and to me it's pretty much the perfect horror film. I'm sure it'll remain among my favorites of the year, just like that little Sam Raimi flick in 2009 did. I never had any anticipation for The Avengers, but hey, bring it on!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Instant Horror Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know the classic tropes of Horror films ever since Scream brought forth its classic rules to survive in this genre. Nowadays, those rules have been reflecting in just about every Horror film being released where there are gratuitous amounts of gore, sex, and drug use. There almost seems to be no hope left in Hollywood either due to their wastes of money with releasing constant remakes and sequels that are just used as money grabbers but have no substance at all. Then, faster than a speeding bullet comes Joss Whedon to rescue the genre for all Horror fans. Whedon has developed a titanic fan base because of his television work with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly, Dollhouse, and Dr. Horrible's Sing-A-Long. He is well known for his combination of horrific violence with slapstick to create perfect self referential stories with much depth and symbolism that calls back to American society. The Cabin in the Woods is the wake up call our generation, and Hollywood, needs. With a perfect cast, sharp and witty writing, clever scares, and a thousand twists, The Cabin in the Woods goes beyond the level of a Horror masterpiece, and is sure to become an instant classic.Now, before going any further, I will express some incredibly important pieces of information to all. First, I have a set list of Horror films that I consider the "best of the best," and the top 10 is reserved for strictly the classics, like Psycho, The Exorcist, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. After seeing this movie only once, I can say without a doubt that this film has become my second favorite Horror film of all time! Second, this film is a spectacular Horror film; however, I cannot tell anything about it. This is a special type of film, where you have to see it for yourself. It's the type of movie you need to go to the theaters to see with a group of friends and then discuss with only those friends afterwards. I'm sure though with the horrible spoilers on the internet that some may learn some things. However, I cannot express enough how important it is that you do not listen to anyone who has seen the movie. You must see it for yourself!Now that that is out of the way, I will review the film with no spoilers at all. First, the acting was terrific. Joss Whedon has assembled some of the finest actors for this movie, like Chris Hemsworth, and some are even new actors. They all perform very convincingly, and you feel for each of the characters in the film. Next, there is the cinematography which is fantastic. Joss Whedon is not only a master with a pen, but when partnered with Cloverfield's Drew Goddard, he is a master of the camera. The camera work was perfect and crisp for each scene. Furthermore, with a great score this film really knows how to revitalize the classic atmospheres of Horror. Whedon knows exactly what to do to bring the classic Horror film back to life. Meanwhile, there is the writing which is sharp, witty, hilarious, and incredibly sinister. There is a huge mouthful of cynicism in every line given in this film that adds to the overall effect. Also, if you think that you know the story from the trailers, then I have two words for you. THINK AGAIN!!! This film knows what you expect, and then kicks you right in between the legs and sucker punches you over and over and over again. You never know where this film is going to go, as each moment twists and turns until you are basically turned into a giant Rubik's cube (like the house in the poster). Moreover, the film has an extremely high octane entertainment factor because it is the most original Horror film to be released in nearly a decade. To give you a hint, once the end credits started, the theater I was in erupted in cheers and applause. I have never experienced this before.Thus, I come to the end of my review for what has to be the best film of 2012 so far. Joss Whedon deserves a round of applause for this work of Horror GENIUS, and Hollywood now needs to learn what it owes Horror fans. The film is a passionate love letter to Horror fans that I will gladly accept, and if you enjoy originality, cleverness, and pure adrenaline-rushing entertainment in your Horror, then look no further. The Cabin in the Woods is everything Horror fans have been waiting for, and people will be talking about this film for many many years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off I will say that you don't want to go into this film with any knowledge of it's premise. All you need to know is there is a group of college kids who go to a cabin in the woods were strange things begin to happen. From there this movie begins to twist and turn into something you were not expecting. Also you should know that this film is not simply a horror film but also a comedy/spoof if you will. This film does almost everything right with it's brilliant combination of scares and laughs. Quite simply i cannot say anything about this film, don't even look at the IMDb boards or faqs because they ruin it. All I will say is this is a very original movie that takes a lot of huge chances that we have never seen before but have only dreamed of. My hat goes off to these filmmakers. Just getting this script turned into a film would be a huge challenge i imagine trying to explain this plot. Simple answer is if you like horror movies you will love cabin in the woods. however the rest of people will either love it or hate it or simple may not get it, but wow what a trip it's nice to see some originality and chances took in the film industry from time to time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge Joss Whedon fan I knew whatever he came up with would at least be good. This however is genius, it is insightful and intelligent. In parts it has a very Buffy esque feel too it; with similar monster creations. The mix of comedy and 'horror' is superb, I can honestly say this is one of the best films of 2012 and possibly one of the best films I've ever seen. Unless you have seen the movie, you really could not possibly predict the outcome, it had me squirming, nail-biting and laughing. The ending of the film is by far the best part and I often find endings of horror films in particular to be annoying or cliché, yes a bunch of teenagers in a cabin in the woods is all very cheesy but it'll surprise you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Freshest Horror Film in a LOOOONG Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wasn't sure what to expect going into "The Cabin in the Woods".I mean, it had one of the most cliché titles I've ever heard (how many horror flicks take place in a cabin in the woods? half a trillion?) yet it was receiving outstanding reviews. Lucky for me, those reviewers were right. This film is phenomenal. Not since EVIL DEAD II have I seen such a deliciously self-referential mix of chills, thrills, and wit. This is clearly a film made for scary movie fanatics who have grown sick and tired of by-the-numbers torture porn and are yearning for something to breathe life into the genre like SCREAM did all those years ago. Conventions are knowingly broken or lovingly mocked throughout, and I had a heck of a lot of fun picking out the references to horror classics. I would reveal more about the characters, plot, etc. but in a flick with this many twists and turns, I wouldn't want to spoil a thing for you.10/10A must see!</fullReview>

Club brains for mince meat and pop eye sockets out with spanners if you get my drift.Well, it was all of that and more! If you love Wrong Turn part 1 and you are quite religious in terms of believing in the rapture, the end of the world and the inevitable apocalypse then this film's a 10/10 to get you preaching the word!Personally, it was all gore and blood at it's best for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fantastic. at first it took awhile for me to get over the whole "what the hell am I watching", feeling but by the end I loved it. This movie, I would describe as the twisted cousin of the evil dead series. I say this because I've never laughed or yelled at the screen as much as I did while watching this. Whoever wrote this had to have though hey lets watch a lot of horror movies while doing acid. This movie in my opinion was not advertised properly, from the trailer you would imagine that this was just a run of the mill slasher flick. this movie is an ode to ever horror movie that came before, with the same atmosphere that those 70s midnight showing movies use to have.straight off the bat the movie tries to mixed it up with the characters making the sporty guy smart making the slutty one a caring nurse in training, and they actually pulled it off. I can say I was really rooting for these kids to live unlike all the other slashers where I can't wait to see how they die. by the time these kids make it to the basement, that is filled with junk that came straight from over a dozen famous horror movies that I notices, I was screaming at the screen have you never seen, Hellraiser, Evil Dead, or a Jason movie in your life. a real surprise was the stoner character in this movie who has been smoking pot from the beginning and has basically figured out everything thats going on thanks to a small dose of paranoia. If you liked Zombieland, Evil Dead , Drag me to Hell this is your movie, not to say that it's not a damn good horror movie with buckets of gore at every turn, but its was just so much fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two girls and three guys go off in a van to spend a weekend in a remote cabin in the woods. After an encounter with a sinister man at a filling station, they eventually arrive at the run down cabin, and start behaving in the ways in which young people in remote cabins are accustomed to behave. But what are those men in white coats up to? Drew Goddard's first movie as director (co-written with Joss Whedon) tells us, before we sit down to watch it, that it is playing with a sub-genre of the horror movie, and that it wants us to know this right from the start. And what follows is as playful as the title. We get our fair share of cabin in the woods shenanigans, but we get a heck of a lot else, too. And I'm not going to say anything about them, because this movie has surprises up its sleeve.It also has a very good script, with some laugh out loud moments. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>College students on a weekend getaway must fend off a zombie family sent to kill them by workers in an omnipresent control room.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is coverage of the script I did for my class at Depaul University in Chicago. SYNOPSIS:DANA POLK, 20, and four of her college friends load up a Winnebago and set off to an isolated cabin for a weekend getaway. During this time members of an unnamed company prepare a control room full of monitors and buttons linked to the cabin. It is revealed that the cabin is the company's last chance to accomplish a currently unknown and specific task that has resulted in careful interest in the college students. En route to the cabin the group stops at a rundown gas station and is rudely confronted by the estranged owner whom we later learn works for the company. There is much flirtation amongst the kids that influences their room assignments in the cabin and raises anticipation for brutal killings during steamy make out sessions. Early in the evening everyone is enjoying boozing and sexual promiscuousness but then Dana and the group venture to the cellar and unknowingly awaken a ZOMBIE family that proceeds to brutally murder the group one by one starting with JULES. Amidst panic and attempts to barricade the cabin's doors and windows, MARTY uncovers wires leading to video cameras immediately before his perceived death. Dana, CURT, and HOLDEN try driving out of the woods but workers in the control room demolish the only route back. Curt attempts to jump a ravine on a motorbike and it is then that Dana learns that someone else is controlling everything. She fights off a zombie as the Winnebago sinks into the lake and is met on the dock by MARTY.Marty leads Dana down the same entrance the Zombies rose from. They travel down and side ways in an elevator passing a collection of various monsters. Dana infers that the monsters are summoned by whatever her and her touch in the cellar. The workers in the control room get wind that the two are still alive and send a swat team to finish them off. Dana and Marty unleash all the monsters via a master control button and amidst a slew of vicious killings the two escape to a ritualistic chamber. In the chamber the DIRECTOR of the company emerges and reveals that Dana, Marty, and their friends were objects in a human sacrifice to please Gods that rest beneath the earth's surface. The story ends with the God rising from the earth and the assumed end to humanity. COMMENT:This script sets itself apart from the typical teen slasher by using a unique concept not yet seen in the genre. Taking many elements from THE TRUMAN SHOW as well as many horror films this script for the most part successfully creates a viable blend of suspense, intrigue, and horror. With this being said this script is not without a big flaw. The motives of the antagonists are borderline absurd. Also the antagonist characters are poorly constructed. These blemishes can be fixed but this script requires a fair amount of work.One of the most appealing aspects of this script is the development of the characters. Dana and Marty are both likable characters with a good amount of depth rarely seen in the genre. Marty's dialogue from the get go is rich and humorous. Dana is the stereotypical virgin survivor from nearly any horror but is a likable protagonist that, if worked on, could be a character audiences will love. The supporting cast is at times lackluster but does not need to be anything more than generic. For the most part this script is solid. The most work that needs to be done lies in the development and motives of the protagonists. Audiences will be disappointed with the script's current ending. The company workers and directors must undergo changes to satisfy audiences beyond opening weekend. Basing the workers motives on underground Gods is far-fetched and not supported well in the script. Revealing this tidbit at the end of the film is an unnecessary curveball. Much work must be done to the antagonist's motives to alter the ending. An ending where both characters or the director survive will leave open the possibility for a sequel. Overall this is a script riddled with potential to stand out amongst a cluttered genre. The current draft has a unique basis and provides two likable characters for audiences to root for. This script satisfies fans of slashers and those looking for a protagonist to live through. This being said the writers fumbled a few story elements and created lackluster antagonists but this can all be fixed by more experienced writers. What matters most is that this film could be the first of many if done correctly.SCRIPT EVALUATION: CONSIDER WRITER EVALUATION: CONSIDER</fullReview>

The stoner, the jock, the virgin, are all here.

		<fullReview>"Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods." Taken from the film's IMDb page, that synopsis is all that you should know before watching Cabin in the Woods. Without being facetious, I almost want to say "just go see the movie. Trust me on this," as it would be a crime to spoil any one of this film's surprises. That being said, it's time to rise up to the challenge and review this thing. Somehow.One of the most endearing aspects of this film is its self-awareness, which primarily shines through the dialogue between these five friends. Each of the actors fit neatly into their respective archetypes, with Fran Kranz stealing the show as the gang's stoner. More than just another token, however, the character actually ends up being considerably deeper than I initially expected. The same holds true for both Richard Jenkins' and Bradley Whitford's characters, though I won't elaborate on those two any further for the sake of spoilers.The bulk of Cabin serves as both a parody and an homage to classic horror movie tropes, with the sharp, witty writing of Joss Whedon and director Drew Goddard carrying the day. It's the climax, though, wherein the horror film genre is turned completely upside down, that the movie elevates to a whole new level. Simply put, crap hits the fan.While single-handedly destroying the genre, Cabin in the Woods provides for one chaotic ride. Not since last year's Hobo With a Shotgun have I had this much fun at the movies. I just about permeated this review with insufferable hyperbole, so I might as well end it with some more: nothing can prepare you for this movie.Seriously, though, don't let anyone spoil it for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was going to be another one of those typical a bunch of people go to a cabin (literally) and go down one at a time until the nice girl (because there is always THAT stereotype) goes the distance. This was the case, but it was intentional on EVERY level. There are many levels to this movie, many levels. There are no mistakes worth mentioning. A continuity here or there, but really no mistakes that punish an audience member. This movie is clever, consistent, scary, funny, and keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats all the way to the end. What I like most was that they didn't insult and spoon feed the audience right from the get go. Most of the movie makers out there feel the need to spell it all out for us in the first 20 minutes so we know everything and there are no surprises. This movie keeps you enticed until the very end. I feel that everything was explained in the end. There was no loose ends so to speak. All the little details were well delivered and placed properly. The acting, story, and dialogue all were great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will always be nay-Sayers. It is unfortunately something that comes with movies like this these days. So let me say this: If you are a cynical, jaded, pretentious movie watcher then the horror movie genre is NOT FOR YOU! Horror movies, no matter how good they are will always have somebody disparaging it saying things like "what's the point?" and it was "utter drivel." There will always be people who will review a movie badly just because it becomes popular and they feel that to dissent somehow validates their opinion and makes them smarter than all of the "simpletons" who "actually enjoyed this." Now, I'm not saying that everyone who has a negative opinion of this movie or any horror movie is necessarily like this or has an invalid opinion, but I am pointing out that people like this are out there IN ABUNDANCE and that you should beware of them. That being said...If you're reading this review then chances are you already have some idea of what this movie is about so I wont bog it down with a big synopsis. In short...I loved this movie! It creates originality out of that which is no longer original. Is it the perfect film? Um, no. Is it really scary? No. But is it devoid of scariness? Of course not! But there are other places one can go for a really scary movie experience. So some of the special effects were sub-par and the CGI wasn't that spectacular, Big Deal! Here's the true appeal. I had more fun with this movie than I've had with a new movie in quite some time. You hear that? FUN. Something some people forget to have when they go see a movie. It does a good job of presenting interesting ideas about the traditional aspects of horror/slasher films. Joss Whedon creates a fantastic story that gives us a look behind the curtain of the horror genre to show us something that we haven't quite seen before or at least not in this way. So go check it out and don't forget to enjoy yourself! It's scary! It's funny! And it executes its purpose of satire and parody so wonderfully that it had me leaving the theater with the feeling that I experienced something clever and new!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Cabin in the Woods" is the definitive horror/comedy of the past decade, and one of the finest since "Evil Dead II"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon deliver unto us "The Cabin in the Woods", a thrilling and hilarious love-and-hate letter to the horror genre, and one of the finest horror-comedies I've seen in many, many years. The film is expertly crafted to both utilize and satirize conventions of horror and its various sub-genres, all while delivering a tale that works on its own level as a fairly serious horror film. It's expertly crafted and fine- tuned to deliver a story that will make you laugh uproariously, then scream in fear, then laugh again. God, I love this movie!Starring Kristen Connolly, Chris Hemsworth and Fran Kranz, the film follows a group of five friends who are headed to a cabin deep within the wooded mountains for a few nights of fun and poor moral-decisions. Little do they know that the cabin is one of several worldwide centers watched over by bizarre scientific compound underground, that make sure the ritualistic sacrifice of a group of youths is made annually to appease the "Ancients", which are essentially demi-gods who must be appeased by blood sacrifices. These sacrifices are to be carried out by any one of a number of evil beings (from vengeful ghosts, zombies and Jason-Voorhees esque serial killers, to supernatural threats, to mythical creatures like werewolves and Cenobite-like creatures straight out of Clive Barker's "Hellraiser"). The killers of choice are determined by which one of many artifacts, talismans or magical incantations the youths choose first by accident. In this case, accidentally reading a Latin inscription in a diary raises from the dead a maniacal clan of pain-worshiping zombies to kill the kids, and we get to witness as they try and survive at any cost, all while solving the mystery of just what's going on.At the same time, we follow a more comedic storyline revolving around a few of the workers in the compound, as they watch over the events and try to influence the outcome by various means, including erecting an invisible forcefield to help prevent the escape of the victims, releasing pheromones into the air to increase their libido and decrease their decision-making powers, destroying any paths for escape, etc. All the while, the workers place bets on which of the killers will be chosen, drool over the gorgeous college girls, etc. It's quite funny to see the behind-the-scenes of a pseudo-scientific cult.The acting is all extremely strong. Connolly is fantastic and believable as Dana, the likable lead character in the story. Hemsworth is a lot of fun as the jockish Curt, and proves post-"Thor" that he is a very capable actor and not at all a one-trick pony. Franz is hilarious as paranoid stoner Marty. And all other roles are played fabulously.The visual direction by Goddard is unusually strong, and the film has a fantastic energy to it. Goddard is able to sell not only the scares, but the abundant laughs. And his script (co-written with "Buffy" creator Joss Whedon) is a great piece of work, both satirizing and glorifying the horror genre at the same time. It's very tight, composed and thought-out, and is an absolute blast.Everything about the production is strong and competently made. The score is incredible. Production and costume design is top notch. The few CG effects are generally well-realized. The gore effects are awesome, and for the most part old school, which I loved. (I generally don't like CGI gore, as it just doesn't look right) I really can't think of a single negative thing to say about this film.Another thing I feel I should address is the dichotomy of the film, in that it is both a loving homage, and a declaration of hate of the horror genre as it stands. It obviously has a lot of affection for horror, in how it playfully references many of the clichés and conventions of it. Yet at the same time, it's also clearly damning the lows that studio horror have sunk to. (Such as brutally making fun of stupid characters, the over-abundance of torture, etc) It's a very interesting film in that it makes light of horror in a way that both glorifies and damns it at the same time, and I hope the message comes across and people start to re-evaluate horror and its potential as genre, rather than continuing the dumbing-down that studios have encouraged.All-in-all, "The Cabin in the Woods" in an incredible entry into the horror-comedy subgenre. I'd argue it's possibly the best entry since Sam Raimi's "Evil Dead II" (although for me "Shaun of the Dead" is also a high contender), and is an absolute joy to watch. I give it a 9 out of 10! If you are a horror fan, you owe it to yourself to see this, especially if you too are becoming weary of the genre and how its been ravaged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Cabin Fever Worth Catching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are in the unfortunate position of having seen the trailer for this little 'horror' flick, then you may already know too much. Erase it from your memory; stop reading this review and book a ticket, safe in the knowledge that this cabin is full of surprises that defy the clichés. But before you go, be aware that I will reveal nothing of what is in store if you choose to see this film.It all starts with the typical set up familiar from a thousand other horror films. Five college kids head off the grid to find a secluded cabin belonging to a cousin. It's the perfect place for a bit of sex, drugs, swimming in a lake and getting picked off one by one in grisly ways. So far, so Evil Dead, Wrong Turn and Cabin Fever.But right from the opening scene, there's something different about this Cabin in the Woods. Who are the corporate types in the opening scene and where do they come into the plot? Why is there a man on a roof spying on the college kids as they set off on their adventure? And how come these kids aren't quite the usual stereotypes we expect in this kind of film? To say anymore could ruin the experience for readers of this review. But what can be said is that this film is an occasionally hilarious white-knuckle ride. Horror fans will rejoice at the old school set up and the vicious violent deaths while all viewers will enjoy the comedy, the surprises round every corner and the clever subverting of genre conventions.The cast do a good job but it's the mostly smart ideas and the clever writing that really make this stick out. Hemsworth can deliver handsome jock while sleepwalking, while Kristen Connelly and Fran Kranz ably tackle virginal sweet girl and stoner shtick respectively. There might only be the odd surprise in terms of who buys it next and who will make it to the final frames but what will surprise are the regular deviations from the main plot to the sinister activities of the corporate types from the opening scene.And if you don't enjoy the brilliant and hilarious bloodbath finale, you'll need to look long and hard to find something else that can satisfy your horror needs. The final reveal may lack the surprise hoped for from the rest of the smart set up but it's a minor complaint when the ride is this much fun.Verdict: It's fast-paced, fresh, frightening and ridiculously funny! But be warned: be careful what you read/see before you go in. Blessed is s/he that knows next to nothing about what is in store. www.ilovethatfilm.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cabin In The Woods is one of the best horror films i have seen in a long time. It starts very strange until the typical horror starts teenagers going to the woods on there own you just know whats coming but not here in this movie. There are soo many twists and turns i'm sure you will not see any of them coming. Joss Whedon has created a unique new horror movie that will spawn squeal after squeal all the actors are really good at there roles which is another bonus for this film. There are many jumps to be had as well its a great movie to be seen in cinemas and im sure it will be a perfect Friday the 13th movie for anyone in the UK. The Cabin In The Woods is ever changing the final scenes are unimaginable, scary and extra ordinary. There's little wrong with this horror comedy sci-fi mash up. The Cabin In The Woods is a ride and a great one so strap yourselves in prepare to be blown away. I don't see why this movie was not released sooner and why it was sat on the shelf for soo long it truly is a remembered experience that you wont forget for a long time and has potentional to become a classic in this horror genre and it is going to change the Horror genre so get ready for more take off sequels and prequels. The Cabin In The Woods perfect for horror fans (even fans of The Evil Dead Series) see it now and do not wait i say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was shockingly good!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect going into this movie because from the trailer you really don't know what it's about. My friend and I were almost going to leave because the line was so long and we weren't sure if this movie was even going to be worth seeing. Well I am happy to say that I am glad that we stayed! The movie is very good. It was funny, it was scary, it was gory, it was everything it needed to be! I loved the entire cast, they were amazing! With horror movies, you never know what your going to get with the acting, most of the time it's not very good but these actors played their characters well. And there were definitely some eye candy as well which is always nice (Chris and Jesse!) The ending completely caught me off guard. During the whole movie I was like what is going on and then once it explained everything, I was like oh okay this is really cool! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that loves laughing and horror and gore and hot guys! I am hoping this movie does really well but I am not sure because of the trailer. The two reasons people will go see this movie is word of mouth and the actors because a few of them are pretty well known!! Also there is a nice cameo at the end but I am not going to spoil it, you will just have to see for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie Made in my Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brief overview- I am 15 years old, and I love horror movies. But the ones made today follow the same tired formula. So for a pleasurable viewing experience, I usually have to look for movies made before I was born. I saw the commercial for this movie several weeks ago, and I made a point to go see it. I went last night, and I can hardly contain how impressed I was by this movie. First and foremost, this was one of the least predictable movies I have ever seen. From the first frame, you are completely unaware of what is going on. The story straps you in for a ride that you manage to get a perfect grasp of in the last 20 or so minutes. It features a cast of characters that are somewhat stereotypical (Jock, Nerd, Slut, Virgin, Stoner), but I believe this was an effort to further poke fun at the clichés seen in other movies of this nature. The kids arrive at the cabin, and odd things are found inside. They are led into the cellar, where they pick their fate- and after reading a passage from an old book (one of countless references to The Evil Dead) a "redneck torture family" rises from the dead and comes to kill the kids. And that is the last piece of horror movie normalcy you will find in this film. But as much as it is scary, it is hilarious. I found myself giggling with giddy delight at many times during the movie.Like when the stock of mad beasts is released into the lab, I was cackling in the front row, drawing a weird look from the girl I took with me. Is it for the faint of heart? Probably not. But I would recommend this movie to anybody who doesn't mind a little blood. Well, lots of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Cabin In The Woods' in a way fulfils the promise that producer Joss Whedon implicitly made in the 1990s - that he would one day put on screen a film that rivalled 'Buffy' or 'Firefly' in originality and play.The Cabin In The Woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of our mainly capitalist Western lifestyle could observe self-defeating hallmarks of our society. Corporate moneymaking, fast food, franchise cinema and war. These things entice as well as repel us and are ripe for satire. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usually South Park can be relied upon to give implicit commentary in hilariously surreal and or scatological, movie-toned episodes and it is this idiom&nbsp;that Joss Whedon and Writer/Director Drew Goddard work to in The Cabin In the Woods. &nbsp;From the SAWesque posters advertising the feature to the first few minutes of the film, it seems we are in torture porn/ teen slasher territory.&nbsp; Fatherly figures banter by the water cooler in an office then we cut to a veritable Scooby Doo gang of college students assembling for a trip to the eponymous cabin. What becomes clear is that the patriarchal administrators are following the every move of the gang. From a creepy redneck gas station owner to ultimate terror at the hands of undead hillbillies, the entire night in the woods is conducted to collect sacrifices for some unnamed benefactor or entity. From the second the audience think it has watched a staged snuff movie created by a slick corporation for the entertainment of a blue chip client, we are again wrong footed. &nbsp;An apocalyptic modern myth unfolds, the implication being that every Jason, Black Lagoon creature, werewolf and Hills Have Eyes family are genetic mutations created to despatch youthful sacrifices. Their blood is then drained to some subterranean chamber.&nbsp; &nbsp;Survivors of the latest onslaught have almost been beaten by the corporation of power dressing acolytes. Like any &nbsp;office of weapons brokers or television execs in a reality show they are in permanent denial of their dirty deeds. There's even an office sweep stake among the remote torturers. &nbsp;Two of their latest victims escaping, there is, revealed in the industrial complex beneath the ramshackle cabin, a&nbsp;veritable giant vending machine of slashers, fiends and monsters criticise generally trending geekdom or the impotence of an original artistic idea once it becomes a franchise or action figure. Immolated child molester and murderer Freddy Krueger became a toy and children's' costume, lest we forget. &nbsp;With all its commentary and change of pace and audience roller-coaster reminiscent of 'From Dusk Til Dawn', 'The Cabin In The Woods' follows Kevin Smith's 'Red State' as being a genre film that refuses to play by genre rules and is ultimately more scary and unsettling in places than a by the numbers franchise movie. It is a classic worth seeing for its playing in the glossy arena of blockbuster horror - and is also possibly the finest Scooby Doo film never made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror films from the last 20 years have been nothing but absloute garbage. It's sad, a lot of these so called horror films are nothing but trying to show as much blood and guts with basically the same old story lines. Hollywood needs to wake up and make an actual horror film like they did in the 70's and 80's. The thing that gets me every time is that people actually pay over $10 to see this crap. The only thing worse is what passes for horror on television these days.Enter Josh Wheaton &amp; Drew Goddard's, wholly original, "The Cabin in the Woods".Why watch TV horror at home when you can pay to see at your local cinema? It's simple really. You probably have to be a fan of this kind of thing to enjoy it. So the people giving it four or five stars are fans of American "television fantasy" film-making. Filled with absurdity. I personally can't get into most of it, so regardless of the fact that it has serial killer in it - I'm a serial killer fanatic - I didn't enjoy this truly absurd piece of movie-making. Just like I don't enjoy any of the television horror (except "Buffy") - all smoke and no bang. If you're a fan of television fantasy and horror, then give this a try. If not, then don't waste your time.</fullReview>
