		<shortDescription>Orson's Corrections</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are excerpts from a nine-page "Memo to Mr. Cohn from Mr. Welles", written after Orson had seen studio mogul Harry Cohn's edited version of the picture (he took an hour out): "...The preview title music was written by a first rate composer, George Antheil. Although not written for our picture at all, this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable...The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer (Heinz Roemheld) is the rather weary one of using a popular song--the "theme"--in as many arrangements as possible. Throughout we have musical references to "Please Don't Kiss Me" for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material. The tune is pleasing, it may do very well on the Hit Parade--but Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy...Mr. Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old-fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as "Disney". In other words, if somebody falls down, he makes a "falling down" sound in the orchestra, etc., etc...If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative, I couldn't be unhappier about the results...Just before I left to go abroad, I asked Vi (Viola Lawrence, the editor) to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi-cab and also quite a bit of dialogue. I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut...saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence (this was not done, accounting for the main weaknesses of the film's opening reel)...There is nothing in the fact of Rita's diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo...What does matter is Rita's beauty...the evil overtones suggested by Grigsby's character, and Michael's bewilderment. Any or all of these items might have inspired the music. Instead, the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony: a pratfall by Pluto the Pup, or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck...There is no sound atmosphere on the boat. A little wind and water is sorely missed. There's no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen...At the start of the picnic sequence...in the temporary score, we used a very curious, sexy Latin-American strain...This has been replaced with a corny "dramatic" sequel--bad stock stuff...This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit...There is a big musical outburst after Grigsby's line, "I want you to kill him." This is absurd...The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio...was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point. As it stands now, it's on about the same level as the rest of the scoring. Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we're kidding...The aquarium scene needs more echo. "Please Don't Kiss Me" is in again!...A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michael's run down the pier. From the gunshot through to the phone call, a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort. For some reason, this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo. As a result, the whole sequence seems dull...The audience should feel at this point, along with Michael, that maybe they are going crazy. The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they're going to sleep...The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music...The closing music again makes reference to "Please Don't Kiss Me"...This finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity, and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture."All of these edits from Orson were ignored</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all, you do not go to an Orson Welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy-ever-after star?You go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings, lighted and scored imaginatively, photographed bravely, and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place? As usual, as well as directing, Welles wrote the script and he also played the hero ? a young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil, but still retained his clear-eyed trust in the goodness of others? Unfortunately for him, he reposed this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future? She was married without love, to an impotent, crippled advocate, acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane? There is a youthful romanticism underlying it all, and this quality came into exuberant play in "The Lady from Shanghai." Before the inevitable happened, Welles escaped ? to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of the post-war cinema ? Welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere? His camera seemed almost to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is One Wild-And-Crazy Film Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s, this has to rank as one of the strangest, and most fun to watch. I say that because of the four main actors: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby," is one of the strangest people I've ever seen on film. His voice, and some of the things he said, have to be heard to be believed. Slaone isn't far behind in the "strange" category. Hayworth is not as glamorous with short, blonde hair but still is Hayworth, which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy. Welles' is as fascinating as always. One tip: if you have the DVD, turn on the English subtitles. His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says. Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups. You also have a unique ending, visually, with a shootout in a house of mirrors. Great stuff! As bizarre as this film is, I still thought the buffoon-like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Other than that, no complaints. This is great entertainment, which is the name of the game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, Great ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, the chemistry between Welles and Hayworth was not great, and, to put an end to the "even though they were married" lines, they divorced two weeks after the release of the film. However, as a film-noir and a piece of Orson Welles' body of work, this film is top notch.Its biggest flaw, besides Welles accent, is that the beginning of the movie is very slow. However, it is necessary for the ending to payoff. It's unfortunate that the current world is moving at light speed, and that movies are chastised for taking ample time to develop their world. A modern example of length being put to good use is The Count of Monte Cristo. Still, that film doesn't compare to "Shanghai".Once the trial, which is often hilarious, begins, the movie reaches the heights of greatness. It all climaxes with a visually stunning ending in the mirror room of a fun house and a fantastic performance by Hayworth.The film sticks with you. Also recommended: The Third Man</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly underrated exercise in style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles' "The Lady From Shanghai" does not have the brilliant screenplay of "Citizen Kane," e.g., but Charles Lawton, Jr.'s cinematography, the unforgettable set pieces (such as the scene in the aquarium, the seagoing scene featuring a stunning, blonde-tressed Rita Hayworth singing "Please Don't Love Me," and the truly amazing Hall of Mirrors climax), and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in his greatest performance, Welles in a beautifully under-played role, the afore-mentioned Miss Hayworth--Welles' wife at the time--at her most gorgeous) make for a very memorable filmgoing experience. The bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling, not inscrutable at all. The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns, and Welles' closing line is an unheralded classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial arbiter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks Like It Could have Been a True Classic, But....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After CITIZEN KANE in 1941, Hollywood executives turned their cob-webbed backs on the great Orson Welles. With the exception of KANE, Welles lost all creative control on MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, JOURNEY INTO FEAR, and many other films to come. Welles was an innovative and creative genius, the most unconventional of filmmakers when Hollywood was in need of a few more. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is yet another example of the misunderstood view of Welles' films at the time, a movie that seems a bit choppy and non-fluent. It has a conventional 1940's premise told in a most unconventional way, and I am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. It is now legend that Columbia mogul Harry Cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about. In hindsight, many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story-telling of Orson Welles and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is only nearly great because of their intrusion.Beside being arguably the greatest director of all-time, Welles was also quite a performer as an actor. At 25, we all know what he did as "Charles Foster Kane", perhaps the most famous character in film history. Here, he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence, something unfamiliar to those familiar with Welles other great work. Instead of a slick, wise tongue, he speaks with a rough, Irish twang. Rita Hayworth (his unhappily married wife at the time) plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts Welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment. He is a large lug who may have even murdered a man, but the real mystery lies in the relationship between Hayworth (with stunning blonde hair) and crippled hubby Everett Sloane (Mr. Bernstein from CITIZEN KANE). A creepy partner of Sloane's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has Welles' "Michael O'Hara" head spinning. Welles narrates the picture as O'Hara, but things are still unclear throughout. See for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what's up.An uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around "O'Hara", with Sloane defending him. It is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods, including Sloane cross-examining himself. I didn't really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway. Up to this point, the cinematography is great, some scenes are shot with craft and skill (aquarium love scene), but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us, the audience, in. Reportedly, the court scene was re-shot against Welles' requests (10 closeups of Hayworth were ordered) and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at Cohn's insistence. A gaudy score infuriated Welles, who once again, was left out of the editing process. Thank Welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour-de-force ending that will always be treasured. The so-called "Hall of Mirrors" scene brings buffs back time and time again, rightfully so.It must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented. The crash of the mirrors represents "O'Hara's" disillusionment and the "crazy house" itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration. It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed "crazy", twisted and turned like a Dali painting. This is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the AFI's Top 100. Then again, 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles films may have made all collective "best of" lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic.NOTE: Look for the Mercury Players that are so prominent in Welles pictures. They pop up all over. RATING: 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One can only imagine the film Mr. Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio! This film is a flawed Welles, but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America's best motion picture director of all times!We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie. The story has a lot of holes in it, perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn't trust the director. It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers, Roman Polanski, even Woody Allen, when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself. No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr. Welles. Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended, or his films either on tape or DVD form.Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here. If she was a beauty with her red hair, as a blonde, she is just too stunning for words. Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie.The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work, was his own appearance in it. Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O'Hara, a different film might have been achieved altogether. Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street. The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work, the vision and the talent he gave us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles takes on a pulp-noir novel and, at the least, makes it his own</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched one of Orson Welles' last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker, I knew I was watching a great movie unfold, though at times I did not know why. The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of a film-noir: average-Joe lead, femme fatale, conspicuous supporting characters, and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure. It is an entertaining ride, and it's filled to the brim with Welles' unique gifts as a director, but there are scenes that tend to just not work, or don't feel complete in what was Welles' full vision (the latter is unfortunately too true- executive producer Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for that).Welles co-stars with his then wife, the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth, as Mike O'Hara, an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people. Hayworth is Mrs. Bannister, married to Mr. Bannister (Everett Sloane, who played Mr. Bernstein in Citizen Kane), who is accompanied by a friend Mr. Grisby (Glenn Anders, who has great control in his eyes). They want to go sailing on their yacht and take O'Hara along for the ride, and at first he's reluctant, but agrees since he's falling for the married Mrs. As their journey unfolds, O'Hara finds that Bannister and Grisby are not pleasant to be around, and more so with Grisby, who at first seems out of his gourd. Yet as the plot unfolds, O'Hara is drawn into a scam that Grisby is planning for insurance money, with results that I dare not reveal (although they have been discussed over and over by others).Whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story (and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated), the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty-five years. Though he doesn't have the terrific Greg Tolland (Kane's DP) at his side, dependable Charles Lawton Jr. assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark, covered in shadows, deep focus, low angles, the works. A particular accomplishment is the fun-house mirror scene, which is merely a highlight among others. Welles himself is always dependable as an actor- even if his accent isn't anything special- and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush, despite her path in the story. The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out, especially for Welles, Hayworth, or film-noir buffs (fans of the Coen brothers might find this fascinating as well). It may just take a little while, repeat viewings (as was for Touch of Evil), for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's A Bright, Guilty World"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael O'Hara is a charming Irish sailor, a drifter who encounters a beautiful woman in Central Park, saves her from attackers, and finds himself drawn inexorably into her eerie world. Orson Welles wrote this screenplay, and adaptation of of a Sherwood King novel. He had great difficulty getting it past Joseph Breen, the overseer of the Motion Picture Production Code, and in the end had to drop the ending in which O'Hara persuades Elsa to kill herself. Welles also directed the film and played the key role of O'Hara, a character with strong Wellesian resonances. As Higham, Welles' biographer, puts it, "Like Welles, O'Hara rejoices in being eccentric and poor ... and sees through and condemns all corruption."  The great Rita Hayworth was estranged from her husband Welles in mid-1946, and agreed to take the role of Elsa Bannister as part of a final bid to save the marriage. Elsa is the Lady From Shanghai, the temptress whose sexual allure ensnares O'Hara. Arthur Bannister, the complaisant cuckold, is played by Everett Sloane, stalwart of the Mercury Theatre and long-time Welles collaborator. The disturbing role of the deranged George Grisby is taken by Glenn Anders, his face distorted by wide-angle lenses to suggest the psychotic menace of the law partner with the bizarre death-wish. It has been claimed that Welles based Grisby's character on the real-life Nelson Rockefeller. As one would expect from Welles, there are some stunning visuals in this film, and some hauntingly memorable screen moments. Hayworth sings the love song beautifully, and the Acapulco interlude is visually delightful. The cast works brilliantly as an ensemble, delivering the Wellesian dialogue with purring efficiency. The Central Park sequence involves the longest continuous dolly-shot ever filmed. Later, we see the arches of the Calle del Mercadero slip by moodily as the camera tracks down the street, and then the angle is reversed and we see the colonnade from inside. Only Welles could come up with the aquarium idea, with shots of a different, better, aquarium matted in to give the exact effect that he wanted - a silent commentary on predators. The rounded tops of the fish tanks link the aquarium thematically with the Calle del Mercadero. The famous final sequence in the fun fair was butchered by the studio, reduced to a mere sherd of Welles' original scheme, but still terrific. Our spatial perceptions are toyed with, much as O'Hara's moral bearings have been skewed by Elsa. One part of the film which fails badly is the trial scene. Absurdities proliferate. A defence attorney finds himself called to the stand as a prosecution witness, and if that is not silly enough, he then proceeds to cross-examine himself. The surprise subpoena is nonsense. Verdict - A relatively lightweight offering from Welles contains good things, but is marred by the risible courtroom scene. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Noir Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1946 and released in 1948, The Lady and Shanghai was one of the big films made by Welles after returning from relative exile for making Citizen Kane. Dark, brooding and expressing some early Cold War paranoia, this film stands tall as a Film-Noir crime film. The cinematography of this film is filled with Welles' characteristic quirks of odd angles, quick cuts, long pans and sinister lighting. The use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in Touch of Evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and the sequences in Chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration, in many ways, to Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it is Welles' obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques.However, despite this criticism, the story combined with wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) make this film a joy to watch. Orson Welles pulls off not only the Irish brogue, but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions. Finally, Glenn Anders strange and bizarre portrayal or Elsa's husbands' law partner is nothing short of classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chinese Puzzle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first mystery is to guess what Welles' original film was like. That makes this a real adventure -- to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics, imagine the beautiful woman it once supported.If you do, you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever. As mysteries go, the narrative is rather ordinary: a simple diversion, one jealous husband as red herring.What's rather miraculous is Welles' placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark, dark multifaceted world. The first real noir, but even darker. It's not an obviously twisted world, unless you think about the camera. What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common.For all the celebration, Kane was a success because of the great drama and story. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self-reference of Shakespeare with this eye. Othello and MacBeth are both begun in this period, and I consider them part of a single vision with this. The noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives, even a little -- they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So in telling this story, Welles has to make the environment into a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery.Thus we have the famous lighting, blocking and angles we know (and have since seen countless times). And we have the deliberately closed sets: the park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and funhouse. I am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of 'external' narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments.My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it, among the other character-environments introduced as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of Black Irish (who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist) was neither: a force of human conspiracy (the park or the civilized version, the courtroom) nor of nature (the picnic or the civilized version, the aquarium).Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement. This is of course a self-reference to what Welles is doing: putting these people (including himself) through hell for our own caprice, a matter underscored by the Peking Opera set with Welles doped up. And of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception.More about the self-reference: surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife. But I believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Surely Welles was as much screwed with, and in much the same way, as his character. And that screwing took the form of the murder of this film, leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment.That poor Rita comes from China ties up the whole thing, the Chinese theater, the expected rape from above, the loss of the woman. The investment in environment beyond all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael O'Hara's Femme Fatale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the point in time that The Lady from Shanghai was being made, the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating. The film was as much an effort by Welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir. Not received well at the time, The Lady from Shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass. Gotten better with age so to speak.Welles is Irish seaman Michael O'Hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three muggers in Central Park. Sparks do fly, but then comes the rub, turns out the lady is married to crippled, but brilliant criminal attorney Everett Sloane. Nevertheless Sloane takes an apparent liking to Welles and hires him to skipper his yacht.So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member, he would have skedaddled back to the seaman's hiring hall in Lower Manhattan. Instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and Sloane as his eminent counsel.Welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film. Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair. This may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw Welles's vision of independent film making a threat to their power.Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner Grisby who is one slimy dude, he winds up a corpse. The other corpse to be here is Ted DeCorsia, a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself.It's a good noir thriller, showing Rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here. The final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged, but I wouldn't recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning, but badly written and acted film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently Welles made this film to help finance a Mercury Theatre production. It shows. It's sloppy. The film noir plot is complex. Too complex for Welles, it's riddled with holes. The whole thing hinges on O'Hara behaving in ways that only a fool would even consider. Hayworth is stunning but equally idiotic as the femme fatale. However, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders are good fun as the Hayworth's crippled, hot-shot criminal defence lawyer, husband and his giggling, slimy business partner, although their performances hinge on caricature rather than character. The trial scene is hilarious, but in ways that were probably not entirely intended by Welles. Sloane is defending Welles on a murder charge, but then both Sloane and Hayworth, Sloane's wife, get called as witnesses for the prosecution without notice. The whole thing is farcical, so farcical indeed that Welles's character decides to scarper. Visually the section that follows is one of the most stunning I have seen. Finally, Welles's Irish accent was awful. There did not appear to be any reason for it. His character could just as easily have been an American for all the difference it made to the plot.In all, the whole is one of the most laughable film noirs I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing visual intensity and piercing acting make up for any flaws by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady from Shanghai (1947)There is no getting around talking about the director of a movie like this. Orson Welles made this on a lark, to fulfill an obligation, and you can tell it is loose to the point of careless in some ways. And the plot isn't totally clear as you go, nor are the motivations of the characters.But this slightly off, slightly illogical, slightly (or very) bizarre construction is exactly what makes the movie work. So, first off, I think this is a masterpiece. The way it veers from telling a story to suggesting one, the way it shows reactions by heightening them to the point of surreal drama, the way scenes that are improbable and invented and made fabulous, as in some kind of dream, all of this is great movie-making, and makes for an interesting movie, too (the one not always leading to the other).If you asked Godard, he would say this is Welles's best film, and I'm inclined to at least see why. It has the total excess and expressionist eye candy of the best of both "Kane" and "Touch of Evil" but it also has something they don't have, and that's this feeling of being on a journey, floating through the world in a beautiful way, regardless of what happens. And this is what the main character experiences, the man called Michael played by Orson himself (with a terrible and irritating accent that is an attempt at a brogue).There are fascinating tidbits behind the movie, but maybe the one that you need to know for it's layering of meaning is that the leading woman, Rita Hayworth, had just ended a relationship with Welles. They were still married but were separated, and you can kind of feel their lingering feelings mixed with doubts, on screen. Or so I thought.The filming--the photography and lighting--is amazing, truly phenomenal stuff. It ranges from moody water scenes (the twilight party is terrific, visually) to close-ups of sweaty faces to the legendary (rightfully) final scene with the mirrors, shattering, multiplying, dissecting. So just for what it looks like this is a terrific ride. But in fact the acting is intense and edgy, and the plot, once it starts to gel halfway through, is clever and fun. The whole Asian slant to the title, and the opening conversation, comes around full tilt with a great ending in San Francisco's Chinatown.If you like Orson Welles, you've probably seen this by now, but if not, do so. But don't expect the kind of tightly constructed movie you get with his other films. It's almost an art film, with a bigger budget, and is rightfully in its own category. Great stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lady from Shanghai did not impress me, although it was visually appealing and interesting to watch the scenes with the long-takes. I especially liked the scene in the fun house-that was suspenseful and really gave you the confused drug induced feeling. The plot was confusing and I expect that is the way the Orson Welles intended it, but it lost me. I felt no sympathy or concern for Welles' character. I think that Rita Hayworth was beautiful and mysterious. I noticed how they lit her face to make her more beautiful. I also loved the courthouse scene, it kind of reminded me of the similar scene in Alice in Wonderland-sort of comical but surreal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welles' jazz eye of seduction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm in awe of Welles and all he achieved. Look, Welles at the time was already on his way out of Hollywood, and this was far from his ideal film, not a pet project. And yet you wouldn't know it from the end result which just oozes creativity. Here is genius, being able to throw yourself in the circumstances, and creative joy, working for the work itself.But for all intents and purposes, this is simply not the film Welles conceived of and shot?that has to be one of the great lost films. Once more, the studio botched the thing, the third time for Welles at this point. It's not just that an hour is missing, but that extensive reshooting and editing has fundamentally altered the original piece. Miraculously it still works, because every studio imposed decision goes to cement the thriller, and so long as you have the girl and gun a thriller generally works.But in feel and tone, this is a much more ordinary noir than Welles intended. And yet it's still a masterpiece.The film is in the manner of a jazz improvisation between narrators for room in the music, and each change of narrator subtly transforms the music, and the new music mysteriously repositions the walls and and even who the viewers are. This is likely what many viewers identify as surrealism, though I find it deeper than anything conceived by that group.First is Welles' himself - narrating when we first see him, the story as already in the past and being recalled. At some point, there's even talk of a book he's planning to write. In his story he is fascinating and desired?a fanciful storyteller trying to pass himself as a schmuck, in both senses. Of course he meets a dreamy blonde out of thin air. Of course he valiantly rescues her from crooks. The husband is anxious to hire him and not any other in a roomful of stooges. Inbetween, we get interjections: her song and dreamy swimming, tropical animals slithering all around, all intrusions in his story of seducing the woman. All the while, you'll quite literally see the chorus change, from the roomful of sailors and later the Acapulco band in Welles' story-space, to the gossipy crowds at the docks, aquarium and court-room, to the mysterious faces in the Chinese opera.During the Acapulco picnic, Welles silences the villains with the shark story and coolly walks away, still in control. Even the killing of the Franco spy as backstory smacks of a narrator's conceit, allowing him to portray himself as both noble and dangerous. Can you imagine the character as played by Welles having killed anyone? I could buy Bogie, Mitchum, even Gable. Not Welles, any more than Astaire. The spaces in his sailor-world? Open, seductive seas, evocative tropics.Banning, the lawyer husband, takes over, initially through his stooge Grisby. His main centerpiece is the trial, his natural space. Here the dynamics shift to a cheaper mockery and satire?the meaningless legalistic objections, the gossipy spectators, the self- interrogation, the judge's whimsically oversized chess game, the slapstick hullabaloo of O'Hara's escape by mingling in a jury. The spaces are confined and stagy. The air stringent.And then we wander off to her world, one of veiled Chinese intrigue and lying mirrors, both calling attention to staged image. Previously, the aquarium: dark, submerged, hushed. Once in the Chinese opera, our narrator is fully under her spell: the sleeping pills. And of course the mirrors, where discovering her deception is rendered as his stumbling through staging gear, odd architecture. Imagine! This scene was to run for 20 minutes in the original.So wonderful overall. Welles takes the erotic thriller and turns it into layered drift through inner worlds. As characters enter his story, originally a story where he'd seduce a beautiful woman, they acquire life, dictate new spaces, change the watching chorus, creating their own currents in the story that fool with the seduction. Just beautiful.And yet I find myself coming back to that alluring and lost original.Welles' main intention was simple, challenge both the cinematic language and our eyes? in two ways, first a capricious self- awareness of the dark elements of noir in the sailor losing control of his story. This is preserved throughout the movie, easy to spot, its function being that Welles is fooling with what we're accustomed to take serious. The Maltese Falcon was based on this stance.But the real loss for me is the second challenge Welles imposed, the authentic world and camera. Supposedly, the original was done in long, distanced sweeps of camera, which is completely unlike the film we have. Studio reshoots and patchy editing ruined the effect, completely altering the fabric, leaving us with some of the location work but a different feel. Oddly enough, the patchy and hyper-edited tone is not unlike Welles, though it does not show his mastery. But I was happy that I could spot one occasion that was left intact, a simple shot from which we can somewhat reconstruct the intention: it's when Grisby approaches the yacht for the first time, Welles is at the bulwark looking out, he is standing in soft focus and very close to the camera and moves out to meet Grisby. It's all in that movement from soft focus, the creation of lived space. Epstein had been doing it before, others. But, a studio film with the visibility of Welles and Hayworth behind it would have changed cinema as much as Kane did. It'd be a different world.Alas, we can only imagine. Amusingly, Welles' violent fistfight in the judge's rooms, another remaining instance of Welles' original plan of real impact in the eye, was kept in the film, because it's a fistfight and there the immediacy was apparently desired by the studio, still is if you look at Hollywood blockbusters..Noir Meter: 4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant jumble of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could be well have been THE definitive film noir of all time, had not the Columbia Studios cut so much of Orson Welles's original. What we are left with is a flawed, yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor/director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent.'The Lady From Shanghai' is film noir at it's most sizzling and confusing. Welles, with an uneven accent, portrays Michael O'Hara, a journeyman Irishman, who, after a fateful encounter with the seductive, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth, in a GREAT performance)finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband's (Everett Sloane) yacht. Elsa, or 'Rosalie' as Michael likes to call her, plays the innocent, helpless doll very well, ensnaring O'Hara in her web. As the lovers conduct a not-so-secret affair at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner in his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders)comes aboard. He is a weird, untrustworthy figure who offers Michael a unique proposal: He will get $5000 to assist Grisby in the faking of Grisby's death, so it looks murder. The plan is for Michael to get off a technicality, and run off into the sun with Elsa. But things do not go to plan.Hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal. At times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child-like, at others brutal, world-weary and hard. Always she is brilliantly beautiful, whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black, brandishing a gun. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is a far-cry from her famous 'Gilda' role. Her then-husband Orson Welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop (angering Columbia boss Harry Cohn). It was a terrific marketing ploy, and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully. She is not the sympathetic femme fatale that 'Gilda' is, here- instead she is a predatory, black-hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option.The Welles and Hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage. They would divorce after the film was made, so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic, lovers in this, so it's hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen. Certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality, with Welles as the 'fall guy' (he even admits it himself in the film!) and Rita as the double-crossing babe.Welles character is the typical noir 'drifter' with not much sense. As Welles voice-over proves to use, O'Hara indeed does not use his brain very much 'expect to be thinking of her (Elsa)'. Welles usually played intelligent, charismatic fellows, so his turn here as the dim-witted Michael is unusual and very interesting. Indeed, Welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well.Everett Sloane is suitably slimy as Hayworth's crippled husband. One wonders why he hires Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically, so why does he invite a 'threat' on board? One interpretation could be that Michael provides the 'service' to his wife that Bannister cannot in his crippled state. There is definitely something to that theory, with a lot of implications toward Elsa's behaviour before she met her husband (was she some sort of prostitute?)and Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes.This is a jumbled, convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed. We are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot, as with most noirs. Welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches, including the justifiably famous 'hall of mirrors' climax. It's a terrific scene, one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness. This fun house scene is visually stunning, with a Dali-like feel to the painted sets (apparently Orson painted them himself). Subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by Welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought-provoking experience.The dialogue is scorching and confusing, delivered superbly by Rita's alternately breathy low voice and helpless, high-pitched little-girl voice. Hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one, and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir'. It's a pity (only a slight one , as Rita was a brilliant dancer) that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 40's instead of darkly-themed noir like this. She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Shanghai" secrets: Mysteries wrapped in enigma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In NYC, seaman Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) rescues Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) from a mugging &amp; rape as she takes a horse &amp; carriage through Central Park -and lives to regret it. Titian-haired Hayworth's a platinum blonde in this one; as dazzling as fresh-fallen snow -but nowhere near as pure...To reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal "noir" would be criminal. It's as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes -but the film holds far darker secrets: From the NY Times: "Childhood Shadows: The Hidden Story Of The Black Dahlia Murder" by Mary Pacios "Mary Pacios, who was 5 years old when she was befriended by 15 year old Bette Short, retraces Short's steps, interviewing friends and associates. She also offered a detailed, if speculative, analysis of Orson Welles -particularly in regard to his movie "The Lady From Shanghai". According to Ms. Pacios, the movie, along with related archival materials, has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with Short's murder. She raises the question: Could Welles have been the killer?" Interesting theories -and with the spate of books now out on "The Black Dahlia", much more may come to light. Fritz Lang's brutal "film noir", "The Big Heat" (1953), was a roman-a-clef telling of the "Dahlia" killing in "The City Of Nets" that was L.A. -but it's the Orson opus that the "Dahlia" had a "hands-on" connection to. In reality, it was Bugsy Siegel (and the Hollywood mob wars of the 1940's) that did the "Dahlia" in ...but that doesn't negate much of what Pacios wrote. Almost all of Hollywood intersected with Elizabeth ("The Black Dahlia") Short and her tale/aura/legacy/curse is encoded in a number of Golden Age films.The "Black Dahlia" was always on the peripheral edges of "Shanghai"-even before it started filming. Barbara Payton on Franchot Tone: "It was when he was thinking about making "The Lady From Shanghai", before he lost the option to Orson Welles. Franchot said he'd been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the Dahlia in the Formosa Cafe* across from the Goldwyn studios..." *The floor above the Formosa Cafe was Bugsy Siegel's office and "The Dahlia" one of his on again/off again working "girls".It gets deeper and darker- After the 1951 brawl over Barbara Payton between Tom Neal and Franchot Tone that sent Franchot to the hospital with a concussion and "never talking the same way again," Barbara said, she married Tone "just to spite Neal." Tom ("Detour") Neal also knew "The Dahlia" (who didn't?) and became obsessed- From "L.A. Despair" by John Gilmore: "The January 1947 slaying of the young, beautiful would-be actress Elizabeth Short, known as "The Black Dahlia", was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime. A project, called "Who Killed The Black Dahlia?" was being kicked off by actor Tom Neal, a hell-raiser from WW II movies. Potential producer Gene Harris: "Someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by Tom Neal and his cohorts..." Not long after: "It would be very clear one beautiful day to come, when Tom would sneak up on his pretty, new Palm Springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a .45 bullet through her head." Barbara Payton and Norma Jean Dougherty (later Marilyn Monroe) knew the "Dahlia" and their stories are well known. It seems all who crossed the path of the "Dahlia" (like the proverbial black cat) entered a "Twilight Zone" darkness and/or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward. Tone/Neal/Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called "The Lady From Shanghai"..."Lady From Shanghai" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because Columbia president Harry Cohn couldn't understand the story. It's dark "noir" to be sure -one of the darkest, in fact. It's also a wicked satire on life in the new Atomic Age.Nicolas Christopher:"Shanghai" pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the American city. The film's principal murder victim (and there are many), a psychotic and double-dealing lawyer, manically foresees Armageddon at every turn, claiming he can "feel it." He announces that he plans to escape to a remote Pacific island -a particularly acid joke on Welles' part since this was the very year the U.S. began testing atomic bombs at just such a place, the Bikini Atoll, relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem. By the time of Bikini, the erotic identification of Hayworth with the Bomb appears to have been institutionalized, with the blessing of the military brass; the first bomb dropped in the Pacific testing ground in named "Gilda" and has Hayworth's image, in provocative dress, painted directly on its casing..." Its ironic that Orson Welles' broad interpretation of an Irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many. Welles is giving a clue to viewers that "Michael O'Hara" is only the storyteller - not part of the story even though it revolves around him. "O'Hara" contradicts the shark motif throughout the film. Sharks on a feeding frenzy won't stop until there's nothing left. "Michael O'Hara" lives to tell the tale. "Elsa Bannister" causes a feeding frenzy during "O'Hara's" trial and her netted chapeau suggests she's caged in -so as not to devour the human spectators to a Roman Coleseum. The spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own, gossiping and carrying on about "Elsa" -a human aquarium correlating to the San Francisco marine museum sequence. That's the human condition ...except for "Michael O'Hara". And yet he'll be spending his life trying to forget his past ("Elsa") -or die trying. "Elsa" is part of "Michael" and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from the beautiful camera-work and scenery (including a few familiar places in Mexico), "Lady From Shanghai" doesn't have much to offer besides a mushy pile of screwed morals and a head scratching twist.At the conclusion of the film, i was not really sure what i was watching. The plot was easy enough to follow, but the meaning of the film is still a bit fuzzy. It is enough to keep you thinking well after the movie is over. The mental imagery in the film compliments what is seen on screen and the plot very well. When O'Hara tells the story of the sharks eating each other, it serves two purposes- to foreshadow the fate of the elite seen in the film and when they finally kill each other, it is used as a simile.The plan worked out by the scheming seductress Elsa is curiously portrayed. It is frustrating to watch unfold because the whole time O'Hara knew better than to get mixed up with her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This suspenseful as well as courageous movie contains intrigue , thrills , plot twists and layered dialog prevail . Fascinated by gorgeous Mrs. Bannister (Rita Hayworth), a somewhat naive seaman Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) joins a sea cruise along with a seductive and amoral wife , her lawyer husband (Everett Sloane) , his colleague (Glenn Anders) and ends up mired in a complex murder plot . At the final takes place a riveting and known climax in the hall of mirrors at San Francisco's old Oceanfront Playland .Noir film with a twisted and offbeat intrigue in which an Irish man becomes involved a pawn in a game of killing . This excellent and utterly compelling thriller is packed with thrills , emotion , betrayals , turns and a hard plot , including a climatic ending scene . Well based on novel by Sherwood King , being scripted , produced and directed by the same Orson Welles who includes a tongue-in-cheek approach to retelling . Lady from Shanghai is an interesting and fascinating flick , other titles considered for the film were "Black Irish" and "If I Die Before I Wake," the title of the novel upon which the film was based . The yacht on which much of the action takes place was the "Zaca", which was rented from its owner, Errol Flynn . Flynn skippered the Zaca between takes, and he can be spotted in the background in a scene outside a Cantina . Awesome acting by main cast , Orson Welles is top-notch as an ingenuous adventurer , made cat's paw in a criminal scheme, who joins seductive Rita and accompanies her husband aboard a bizarre sea cruise . Orson Welles' decision to have Rita Hayworth cut her hair and bleach it caused a storm of controversy, and many in Hollywood believed it contributed to the film's poor box-office returns . Columbia Pictures chief Harry Cohn thought the movie would ruin his star, Rita Hayworth, and held the release of the picture back for one year . Cohn ordered director Orson Welles to insert "glamour" close-ups of Hayworth . Very good performance by support cast such as Everett Sloane as a repulsive advocate in law , and Glenn Anders as his scheming partner . Evocative and atmospheric cinematography in black and White by Charles Lawton Jr , including usual lights and shades from Noir Cinema .Lady from Shanghai was well directed by Orson Welles , a genius who had a large and problematic career ; though Orson Welles' original rough cut of this picture ran 155 minutes, numerous cuts made by Columbia Pictures executives included a shortening of the famous "funhouse" final ; in fact these scenes were supposed to be unscored, to create the sense of terror. In 1938 he produced "The Mercury Theatre on the Air", famous for its broadcast version of "The War of the Worlds" . His first film to be seen by the public was Ciudadano Kane (1941), a commercial failure , but regarded by many as the best film ever made , along with his following movie , The magnificent Ambersons . He subsequently directed Shakespeare adaptation such as Macbeth , Othelo and Chimes at Midnight or Falstaff . Many of his next films were commercial flops and he exiled himself to Europe in 1948. In 1956 he directed Touch of evil (1958); it failed in the U.S. but won a prize at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair. In 1975, in spite of all his box-office flops , he received the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 1984 the Directors Guild of America awarded him its highest honor, the D.W. Griffith Award. His reputation as a film maker has climbed steadily ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I start out to make a fool of myself, there's very little can stop me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box set I had recently purchased. A box set I chiefly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and to also re-evaluate Waterloo. So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and I'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure.On the surface the story seemed a simple one, man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs, they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband, and then...Well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself doesn't really know what is going on, he is as confused as the viewer is, and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film. Obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has its moments, but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped.So many wonderful things in the film, it has Welles visual style all over it, see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house are majestic on the eye. The narration from O'Hara is joyously self mocking, while we get good light relief by way of a court case where Everett Sloane considerably lights up proceedings.Yet the film is still something of an oddity, and in fact it's a choppy viewing experience because (as I was to find out after) studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour, and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer, but very unfair on Welles' vision. I'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale. As it is, though, we have an excellent and intriguing film, one that hints at greatness to rival the more praised of Orson's productions, but thankfully what remains is a fiendishly engrossing film that keeps on giving rewards with each subsequent viewing. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies. Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy, which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment "big dummy that I am." Plot is so complex that I still don't know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed. That scene alone is worth the price of admission. This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character. No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond. No one should miss this picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael O'Hara May Live Long Enough To Forget Her.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not as great a film as many people believe (including my late aunt, who said it was her favorite movie). But due to the better sections of this film noir, particularly that justifiably famous "fun house" finale, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of importance beyond it's actual worth as a key to the saga of Orson Welles' failure to conquer Hollywood.By 1946 Welles' position as a Hollywood figure was mixed. CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by Hollywood insiders themselves. Welles' attempt at total control (direction and production and acting) of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system. His best job in this period was as Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE, supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but actually shot in large measure (with Stevenson's blessing) by Welles. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRANGER, a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record.Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS. But despite the assistance Mike Todd, and Cole Porter composing the score, the musical was a failure. His failure occurred just at the same time that his wife, Rita Hayworth, was on the rise with her portrayal of GILDA. So the marriage was going on the rocks as well.Welles had to make money - his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in the possible movie rights to AROUND THE WORLD to Todd (which he would eventually rue), and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin, who was supposed to be directed in it (and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX).The story goes that Welles, with a $10,000.00 tax bill to worry about, called Cohn and offered to do a film with Rita for a down payment. Cohn was willing to do so, but naturally asked what the film was. It was a wise question. Welles was on a pay phone in New York in a pharmacy that had a book department. He grabbed a book with the title THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and raved that it was a great thriller. Somehow Welles convinced the normally astute Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he'd look into getting the rights, and sent Welles his down-payment of $10,000.00. After Cohn hung up Welles bought the book and read it - and found it was really pretty bad. He spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up Rita's character of Elsa Bannister.Certainly it has a curious plot development. Michael O'Hara is a seaman/longshoreman. He rescues Elsa Bannister, when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation. She convinces him to hire Michael as the skipper of their yacht. The cruise also contains Bannister's sinister partner George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and one Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia) who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa. When they can Michael and Elsa try to find time together, but Broome or Grisby keeps showing up.Grisby makes Michael an offer - he wants (for reasons connected to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society) to drop out of it, pretending to be dead. According to Grisby (the plot becomes murky here) he can still collect his life insurance (although dead?) and use it to run off to the South Seas. He will pay Michael $10,000.00 if he will pretend to shoot Grisby. This includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder (Michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead).Of course Grisby is killed, and Michael is arrested for that, and for the murder of Broome (shot with Michael's gun). Michael is tried with Bannister defending him, and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual murderer, and manages to escape just before the jury verdict. He is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival, and this leads to the famous "fun house" sequence and the conclusion of the film.It's a terribly confusing movie (as I have had commented on). That does not mean it's not worth seeing - visually it is striking. Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the trial judge's quarters, where he knocks the bailiff into the judge's bookcase, shattering glass. Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth diving from a rock, reflected on the lecherous Grisby's binoculars.The acting is pretty good, in particular Sloane (possibly that fine actor's best film role). Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer. He rarely made movies before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable. Also Ted De Corsia does very nicely with Broome - a detective who is really looking for his own interests, to his own cost.As for Hayworth, she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and THE STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions), and is a memorable siren. Welles' O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TOUCH OF EVIL, or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it is a good film for all that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Filled With Distinctive Welles Touches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if Orson Welles had not starred in "The Lady From Shanghai", it wouldn't be difficult to guess that he had directed the picture. It is filled with the kinds of creative touches that Welles loved and couldn't help indulging in. From the offbeat decision to change Rita Hayworth's hair, to the weird behavior of some of the main characters, to the bizarre courtroom scenes, all set off with Welles's trademark assorted camera angles and other techniques, it is fascinating to watch even if it does not come up to the standard of Welles's best films.The story is often overshadowed by the atmosphere, but it's interesting in its own right, with Welles playing a young man whose ego and whose infatuation for Hayworth's character allows himself to become entrapped in a web of deceit and crime before he realizes everything that's involved. Not all of it is plausible, but it certainly holds your attention, and it is deservedly known for the spectacular climax. The finale with its special effects is an impressive bit of film-making, and it also is very appropriate in setting off some of the main themes of the story.Though it is fair to criticize this movie for its faults, it's still a distinctive classic that deserves to be seen and remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lure of the Licentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles, in this film noir classic, is a street smart sailor who has never dropped anchor in a placid world. From combat in Spain to ocean roving, he has travelled the globe but not learned much about those whose wealth allow them to control the lives of many.Rescuing a beautiful woman (Susan Hayworth) from Central Park muggers (tame by the standards of more recent criminal infestation in my favorite park), he is instantly drawn to her as she, apparently, is to him. A visit by her husband to the seamans' hiring hall results in his signing up as a crewman for a superficially leisurely but actually tense cruise.The husband is a famous trial lawyer, crippled in body and in mind, possessive and taunting. Aware of his wife's inclination to unfaithfulness with the Irish sailor, he alternately appears accommodating and threatening. His partner, a truly loathsome character verging, as shown in close-ups, on madness, plays an increaingly sinister role.All the players are believable in the spirit of post-war noir films. Welles sports a brogue and his real life wife, Hayworth, is a combination of languid dabbler in adultery and artful plotter. The final scene in the long vanished San Francisco fun house is a high spot of both the film and Welles' creativity.A Welles classic worth repeated viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wandering seaman joins an odd couple - aged millionaire husband and glamorous wife - for a bizarre cruising journey that ends up in a murder plot.Ineffably silly story tarted up with brilliant cameraworks, good performances and undeniable flair; this now strongly reputed, heavily expressionist film noir thriller betrays uncertain handling and hasty production, so that it finally gives the impression of being found out while making. On the whole, a stylish exercise for conoisseurs - particularly the final shoot-out sequence among the mirrors - but the plot is still a downer, and at the time was an audience-baffling commercial flop that also destroyed Rita Hayworh's image and career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lady from Shanghai" simply does not make sense. The plot is so complex that I don't even think Welles knew what was going on. However, it is probably not his fault since the studio cut almost a full hour out, leaving huge chunks missing.Visually, it is very well done. Classic to the film noir style of the period, there are ominous shadows throughout. Two scenes in particular really stand out. The scene with the aquarium is visually stimulating with its use of flickering light. The finale at the Funhouse and House of Mirrors showcases Welles brilliant direction.All in all, the mood and atmosphere of this film noir and the periodically brilliance of Welles fail to make up for the choppy viewing experience of this erratically, over-edited movie. In the end, it was too confusing?which is its biggest downfall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does he do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his I see. Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial, and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can tend to be confusing sometimes, and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast (about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly). It doesn't matter, however. You can't watch Welles' films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot. His direction defines what great direction is. Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed. Check out the courtroom scene. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can't stand them. Case in point, try to sit through Welles' own speech near the end of Compulsion. In Lady from Shanghai, just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene. Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings. Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it is just a simple Venetian blind, and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era, but Welles gives it a beauty all its own. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else seemed to have, to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry. Whether he was speaking Shakespeare or spitting out hard-boiled lines, it had the power to stir the soul. 10/10.</fullReview>

The cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half-baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue.

		<shortDescription>Not so lovely Rita</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the chequered history of the making of this movie, one will always wonder how close the finished result matched Welles' original vision. Was it just a knock-off version of a cheap pulp-fiction novel Welles just happened upon or was there a deeper artistic intent at work? I personally think that while it maybe started off as a quickie stop-gap thriller for Welles, he unquestionably picked it up and ran with it as only he could and even if Harry Cohn and his cohorts did hijack the finished article in the interests of commerciality, Welles' talent and verve transcend even the skewered and compromised cut we see here.Sure there are lots of strange, even occasionally surreal aspects to the film, Welles' "Oirish" accent, that he's almost always in three-quarter profile facing the left, the massive close-ups and occasional crazy-cutting, the talking in Chinese to name but a few, but it also contains memorable, bravura scenes which only Orson could devise, like his deconstruction of the clichd courtroom scene, his and Rita Hayworth's rendezvous at the aquarium with massive shape-shifting marine life glowing and glowering behind them, the upshot in the Chinese Theatre and of course the terrific climax in the hall of mirrors.The motives of the characters and consistencies of the plot are at times seemingly thrown to the wind but somehow you're swept along, rather like Welles Black Irish Michael O'Hara, like a cork on the sea and left at the end deposited on the shore, breathless, confused but exhilarated. I know there are those who think it's a terrible movie and who blame the money-men saboteurs, but I loved it, warts and all. Although you never get used to that brogue, Welles is great in the lead role, Hayworth too in a misunderstood role. Then characters like the greasy, grisly Grisby and the lame, sardonic husband (the way he drawls the word "lover") really get under your skin as they're meant to. And there's more, those close-ups showing the sweat, dread bewilderment and blankness of his characters' faces, the great dialogue, especially the analogy of humans with sharks, the little dots of humour with the various reactions of the public in the gallery of the court scene ("You're kidding, right?") and the chase scenes so reminiscent of "The Third Man", to name but a few.Someday I'd love to see the film Welles had in his head, but then you could say that about almost all his projects going right back to "Citizen Kane". I'm a fan and in the end have to be grateful for the small mercies of just whatever he was able to get released through the studio system, flaws, tampering and all. And I love film noir, so this was great for me to watch and I think it is a great watch too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just about every film buff knows Orson Welles's masterpieces "Citizen Kane" and "Touch of Evil". But lesser known is "The Lady from Shanghai". It is probably safe to call this movie one of the greatest examples of film noir. I interpreted the mirror scene as a metaphor for everything that happens in the movie (showing two of each person implies duplicity). And it goes without saying that Rita Hayworth oozes sensuality as naturally as she breathes.If the movie has any problem, it's Welles's voice. The Irish accent is just not one that most actors know how to impersonate (can't they just cast Irish people in those roles?). But that doesn't weaken the movie at all. The acting, camera work and editing coalesce into one of the greatest pieces of work ever put on screen. It reaffirms Orson Welles as one of the greatest directors ever (maybe THE greatest). I also recommend "The Third Man" (a film noir in which Welles starred but didn't direct).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly this movie confused the heck out of me! I thought Elsa and Micheal loved each other. However they went back and forth a few times from him hitting her to her trying to kill him and then him walking away from her when she gets shot. So i guess they really didn't love each other after all. I will say this though Elsa is a very beautiful woman. Grisby as well as a few of the other people that worked for Mr. Bannister were all weird and they freaked me out. I still don't understand a lot of the movie, perhaps if I were to watch it again it would all make more sense to me. And I'm curious if Mr. Bannister died in the end in the "Crazy House" at the amusement park. Which brings me to my next thought, I thought it was very creative how everyone thought Micheal was crazy so the Chinese people put him in the "Crasy House" however I'm still not sure why Elsa asked for the Chinese man's help in the first place. Im still very confused!</fullReview>

But if you try to pay attention to the incessantly twisting plot and boring characters, then you have a very less than interesting film. Welles and Hayworth are both very good actors and did well in their parts, but that alone did not make this movie any more comfortable to watch. I felt myself waiting for it to be over almost as soon as it started. If the plot and the script hadn't been such a mess, the movie would have excellent. The fun house mirror shoot out scene was easily the best part of the film, and for a minute it made me forget everything else that was bad throughout the rest of this movie. Welles is a fairly good director, but if you were to watch any of his films, I would definitely not recommend this one.</fullReview>

Listen to his snakeyness when he calls Hayworth "Lover." What power!He was only in his 40s in this movie, which means he was in his early 40s in Citizen Kane, yet the energy and talent evident whenever you see him imply that he's older.

She is a scheming, double-dealing, sweet-tongued femme-fatale who, as Welles' Michael O'Hara character puts it 'plays games'. There marriage was breaking down at the time this movie was made, &amp; in this black valentine he seems (I say seems, because I really don't know how their relationship ended) to have got his own back.Another thing I noticed about this movie was its similarity to Polanski's 'Bitter Moon'. Both are set in the sea, both have crippled husbands of beautiful young ladies playing mind games with innocent men, &amp; in both the director's wives play important roles.Anyway, like almost everyone else who commented here, I too found this movie long on style but short on story (tho' I don't know if Harry Cohn is to blame for that!). If you follow Orson Welles &amp; think him to be God's gift to cinema (tho'not necessarily to Hollywood) this the best way to spend 87 valuable minutes in your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lady from Shanghai" is a 1947 film noir by director Orson Welles. The film was famously "butchered" by Colombia Pictures president Harry Cohn, who removed about half of Welles' footage and replaced it with extensive and expensive re-shoots."Shanghai" is narrated by Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles), an Irish sailor who gets swept up in a plot involving crooked lawyers, rich businessmen and sultry femme-fatales (Rita Hayworth). Like most of Welles' film, its aesthetic is busy and bombastic to a fault. Welles assaults us with all manners of trickery, including off-beat camera angles, strange accents, unusual compositions, copious long shots, extreme close ups, grandiose location photography, audacious crane shots, leering shots of Hayworth's bikini-clad body and manic fun house sequences which include a visit to a Hall of Mirrors. Welles so commits to his "throw everything including the kitchen sink" approach, that he even hits us with giant fish, giant octopuses and a courtroom filled with shenanigans too bizarre to describe. There's even an apocalyptic subplot in which characters pontificate the End of the World! As "The Lady from Shanghai" doesn't represent Welles final vision, Welles intentions for the film remain unknown. Some view it as a film about the dissolution of Welles' marriage to Rita Hayworth, whilst others see it as a tale unreliably narrated by a madman. Others view it through a political lens, O'Hara a disillusioned dissident (he fought against General Franco in the Spanish Civil War, whilst the film's chief villain admits to being pro-Franco) and leftist trapped in a landscape of visual distortions and so forever unable to "fit" into the world. This world, he explains, is one of conniving sharks, humans destined to "eat themselves up" via deranged blood-frenzies. However one reads "Shanghai", it offers one of the most baroque and bizarre handlings of familiar noir tropes.7.9/10 ? See "Out of the Past" (1947) and "Double Indemnity".</fullReview>

That being why did I just waste 87 minutes of my life watching this. I really hated the character Grisby, and was thrilled when he was carried out on a stretcher. I just thought that the storyline of the film was very unrealistic due to the number of twists and turns in the last 10 minutes. Even though i thought all this, i have to admit that the lighting was good, and that along with the sound, this film kept my attention. Due to this, i give the, "Lady from Shanghai" 2 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Lady From Shanghai" is famous for having been made under unusual circumstances. Orson Welles and leading lady Rita Hayworth were married but their relationship had broken down and also Welles' work was carried out for nothing as a means of repaying Harry Cohn (president of Columbia Pictures) for a loan he'd provided to enable Welles to complete an earlier project. The finished product was over 150 minutes long but was then edited down to 87 minutes by the studio. Remarkably, the inauspicious nature of what happened before its release didn't prevent the movie from being a hugely enjoyable and visually rich thriller with an elaborate murder plot, a group of treacherous, unpredictable and sometimes inscrutable characters and some sensational set pieces.The screenplay was adapted from Sherwood King's novel "If I Die Before I Wake" and recounts, in flashback, the story of the extremely naive Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) who becomes infatuated by a glamorous blonde called Elsa (Rita Haywoth) and is persuaded to take a job on her wealthy husband's luxury yacht. This leads to O'Hara becoming involved with a bunch of characters who are incredibly devious and also to him being drawn into a scam which sets him up as the fall guy for a murder.Elsa's husband, Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) is a famous and very successful but crippled defence attorney who is also an inveterate schemer. His law partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) is a crafty but crazy looking guy who sweats profusely and whose outpourings sometimes sound completely moronic (for example, when he leaves the yacht on his boat and shouts back at Michael and Elsa "so long kiddies, bye, bye"). Grisby's eccentric appearance also, at times, becomes distorted and exaggerated by the use of extreme close-ups which make him look even more grotesque. Elsa by contrast, is rather enigmatic, a woman with a colourful past who is only with her husband because he's got something on her, but also someone who occasionally seems to be quite vulnerable.Michael is different to the rest of these people and they discuss his lack of interest in money and the fact that he'd killed a man in Spain during the civil war. He finds their habit of sniping at each other strange and unpleasant and remarks about how they amuse themselves in the evenings by sitting around and "calling each other names". This behaviour prompts him to tell them a prescient story about an experience he'd had in Brazil where he'd been fishing and an injury to a shark had led to a whole group of them eating each other in a mad murderous frenzy which left them all dead.Michael is eventually arrested for murder and Bannister represents him. The strength of the evidence against him leads to a plea of excusable homicide and a farce of a trial follows. The spectacle involves an ineffective, ridiculous judge, an absurd sequence in which Bannister interviews himself as a witness and numerous ill mannered and eccentric actions by the jury and members of the public. Before the verdict is announced, Bannister admits that this is one case that he wouldn't mind losing because he's become aware of Michael and Elsa's attraction to each other and this prompts Michael to successfully make his escape from the event.There's a great deal to enjoy visually in "The Lady From Shanghai" with many high angle, low angle and extreme close-up shots being used very effectively to record the action. The composition of what's in shot is expertly arranged, especially in the scenes where the group of characters are in conversation on the yacht and at a picnic. An extremely high overhead shot of the courtroom, Michael and Elsa shown in silhouette in the aquarium and clever use of light and shadow in the scene where Elsa visits Michael behind bars are just some of many further examples.Some of the exotic locations seen on their journey to San Francisco provide additional interest as do the scenes shot in the aquarium and the Chinese theatre. The events which occur at the Hall of Mirrors are immensely enjoyable and spectacular and provide the movie with its fantastic and totally fitting climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Mystery Movie Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This breathtaking cult movie is my all-time favorite in the mystery genre. True, the mystery itself is somewhat flawed. Welles very cleverly explains the plot off-camera during a dazzling montage in an amusement park's fun house. The visuals are so arresting, it's impossible to follow what Welles is saying. The actual identity of the killer comes as a complete surprise. But this knowledge will not detract from subsequent viewings because of the marvelously inventive way the story is told, the electrifying incidental details, and the spirited gallery of memorably grotesque characters. Chief among these is Glenn Anders, whose sweaty, insinuating, abrasively evil and totally corrupt Grisby is easily the most chilling persona in the whole gallery of film noir eccentrics. Mind you, Everett Sloane's nervy, calculating, crookedly vicious attorney almost matches Anders in bizarre appeal. Ted De Corsia also shines with such a passionate intensity of hate and self-interest, at times he overwhelms both siren Hayworth and confused hero Welles, whose pulsating direction, allied with Lawton's low key, deep focus, noirishly expressive cinematography, creates a magnetically enthralling atmosphere from first to last.</fullReview>

It was tough to watch and I expected more from Welles.This movie had an interesting plot, but I really felt like there were holes. I shouldn't have to watch the movie again to catch something I missed important to my immersion into the story. The mirror scene is also a little bit dated like some of Hitchcock's scenes in the 50's. However, Welles' camera play and way of making film makes all of his films interesting and worth watching.

		<fullReview>After directing his self-proclaimed "worst" film with THE STRANGER, a solid crime drama with a conventional, straight-forward narrative, Orson Welles returned to high-profile, bold, visually stunning, complex and difficult film-making with his superbly crafted, thoughtful adaptation of the novel by Raymond S. King about tough Irish sailor Welles falling for sexy Rita Hayworth while working on the ship of her husband, rich lawyer Everett Sloane, and being forced by Sloane's partner Glenn Anders to take part in a small crime, which turns ugly. The stellar cast with Sloane a special standout as embittered man, whose wealthy surface is poisoned by his love for blonde femme fatale Hayworth, who without her red hair looks emotionally cool and appears clinically gorgeous, while Welles is rather ordinary in the lead. While the screenplay looses impact towards end and there's nothing special about the crime plot, the atmosphere Welles creates with unusual camera angles, excellent editing and exotic places is terrific. Not one of Welles' best, but certainly one of his most interesting films with the legendary climax in the hall of mirrors making a brilliant end to a rather muddled film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I concur. He was and remains a unique force in film. More than a triple threat who could act, write and direct, he had a genius uniquely suited to film. One can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter. This film certainly reinforces that impression. A musician, a theatre actor, an heir to Shakespeare? hard to tell but I am very grateful that his time came with film and he have him captured on film. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all of his movies and wish there were more. I particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film. Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there. Even towards the end when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intent, he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in. Rita was a gorgeous blonde -- a Lana Turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to Welles and one wishes for another minute, another film, another hour in his company. That is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know, we all know, that there is not part of him not worthy of our time.

Orson Welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed. All his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end Welles became a fat drunk, like his character in A Touch Of Evil! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women, I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant,John Wayne, I could go on and on but I digress... and because I am a woman,I can see the attraction to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film-makers of today: Tarantino, Scorscese, Spike Lee, most of the film makers just don't measure up to the film makers of the Forties! I know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time I can't name them all. No Offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium! August 21,2006. Please remind me of some current up and coming film makers, I don't want to be stuck in the past! I love some of the films out now, but rarely are there any that I would put on a "100 best" list..

Can anyone give me a best list for the 90's and on up to 2006? I would like to know who to watch! Thank you! Also Props to this website!

		<shortDescription>Fun-filled parody of film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An often bewildering parody of film noir in particular and Hollywood conventions in general, Columbia relegated "The Lady from Shanghai" to B-movie status due to objections over Orson Welles' manipulation of soon-to-be-ex-wife Rita Hayworth into a ruthless femme fatale. However, Hayworth's metamorphosis is the most superficial of the caricatures that populate the film, among them Everett Sloane (Bernstein from "Citizen Kane") as a leering, corrupt, crippled lawyer, and show-stealing Glenn Anders as the giddily inscrutable Grisby, whose machinations drive what passes for a plot. Amidst this gallery, Welles' own sublimely ridiculous presence, as a hopelessly idealistic sailor with a phony "Black Irish" accent, becomes the most obvious tip-off that the proceedings are anything but serious fare. Once the comic tone is established, the film lurches forward with manic energy, throwing plausibility to the wind as it careens toward the climax in the expressionistic Crazy House and its Hall of Mirrors. The flattering close-ups of Hayworth (inserted by the studio to "save" the picture) clash marvelously with Welles' vertiginous camera angles, adding to the film's discontinuity and enhancing its satirical nature. My favorite line: "I came to in the crazy house, but for a moment there, I thought it was me who was going crazy!" My advice: forget the plot and enjoy "The Lady from Shanghai" for its many guilty pleasures.</fullReview>

Michael O'Hara, Orson Wells,gets caught up with events in "The Lady from Shanghai" that slowly spin out of control and ends up facing the San Quinten gas chamber for a murder that he didn't commit. One evening in New York's Central Park seaman Michael O'Hara runs into, and later rescues from a gang of muggers,mysterious and alluring Rosalie Bannister, Rita Hayworth. During a chit-chat with Rosalie before she drives off he innocently tells her that he served time in a Spanish prison for killing a man which, with the fact that he knows how to sail a yacht, greatly interests her. Later at the ship-yard Rosalie's husband the famous defense attorney Authur Bannister, Everet Stone, unexpectedly shows up looking for Michael. Bannister offers Michael a job to sail him and his wife Rosalie on their Yacht down to the Caribbean and finally back to their west coast home in San Francisco. Some time later sailing off shore of a small Caribbiean island George Grisby, Glenn Anders, unexpectedly rows aboard and Michael somehow realizes that the trip that he's on isn't exactly the pleasure cruise that he thought it would be. Grimsby turns out to be Authur Bannister's law partner as well as a private detective who's checking on Rosalie to see if she's cheating on her husband. Before sailing back to San Francisco Michael feeling very uneasy about the whole arraignment on the boat thinks of quiting but he's fallen so much in love with Rosalie that his emotions overrule his intuitions. That miscalculation on his part soon leads Michael right into the trap that was set for him by one or all of the three on board. When back in SF the Bannister butler Sidney Broome,Ted De Corsia,is murdered and then his killer non-other Grisby is also found dead with him having a signed confession by Michael to his murder! The frame up is now complete and with the false and concocted evidence on him being air tight and unshakable Michaels worst fears became a reality. Authur Bannister volunteering to defend Michael seems to also be in on the frame that's pointing him straight into the California gas chamber. During his trial Michael starts to feel, by the way Bannisers is conducting his defense, that's exactly what he's doing. Breaking away from the court police before the verdict is even reached Michael is now an innocent man on the run and no one to turn to. Ending up in an empty and deserted carnival fun-house, on the San Francisco waterfront, Michael tries to find the one person who could exonerate him of Grisby's, and possibly Broome's, murder:the murderer himself. Wells has trouble trying to stick to an Irish brogue that he uses on and off in the film and the bleach blond Rita Hayworth is at the top of her game. Everet Stone as the secretive and sinister Authur Bannister gives one of the best performances of his long stage and screen career who you don't realize until the last, and shattering, scene in the film just what or what not he has to do with Micael's frame-up. The now classic ending in the fun-house's Hall of Mirrors has been copied countless times over the years but never equaled even with the advancement of computer-enhanced special effects. It's not the effects in that scene it's the acting by Wells Hayworth and Stone and direction, also by by Wells, that makes it so memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still in disbelief from this movie. It was sooooo good!!~ Not that I would expect anything different of an Orson Welles movie, but I think this is almost as good as "Citizen Kane"! It's great to see husband and wife Welles and Rita Hayworth working together. I've also always heard how great the "Hall of Mirrors" scene is, but I never thought it would be that good! With the way it's set up, with everyone blending together I have only one word: WOW!!!!!I think "The Lady from Shanghai" is one of Orson Welles greatest movies. I also enjoyed seeing Everett Sloane (Arthur Bannister) in a bigger part than in "Kane". I think he was a talented actor, and is great as Bannister! This is one movie you won't want to miss!Rating: 10 out of 10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surreal film noir released soon after the "real," genre-defining classics "The Maltese Falcon," "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice." Welles films shouldn't be evaluated against others. He was playing by different rules. In fact, he was playing. This starts where other femme fatale films leave off, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is embellished with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical rapid-fire style), dialog (lots of "hard-boiled" philosophy), and unusual acting (good Hayworth presumably intentionally one-dimensional). To Welles "genre" may have meant "formula" but he seemed to like using "mysteries" as backgrounds for his "entertainments."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir that went too far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles is all over this film which accounts for its greatness. The photography is marvelous and certain scenes take your breath away.But the overall effort doesn't quite work. Ironically, it may have something to do with the fact that there's no real chemistry between the love interests. Since Welles and Rita Hayworth were married at the time, that seems odd. Since their marriage was falling apart at the time, maybe it's not.The film suffers from the beating it apparently took at the hands of the studio who failed to provide Orson with the license he needed to break new ground. It was hacked up and it shows.In any event, Welles took the wrong role here. He doesn't come off as the swaggering irish sailor (and I found his accent irritating). Instead, he should have played the crippled husband and let Glenn Ford reprise his "Gilda role"--it would have been a different film.Nevertheless, I wish they could have retained the original film that Welles made--an hour longer than the finished product here--it would have stood as an even taller monument to the brilliance that both Welles and Hayworth brought to the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a re-release of Orson Welles' "classic" this afternoon. It's not a particularly well-made film, but what with its eye-candy set-pieces and bizarre characters, one can almost overlook that the film seems to have been written by about a dozen different writers who never spoke to each other: the plot moves in fits and starts, with scenes abruptly ending and beginning, it's wildly over-narrated, and the plot doesn't make a bit of sense. Still: the hall of mirrors. It's a frustrating film, but impossible to completely dislike. However, it makes me think about the re-release craze that seems to be going on these days. It's easy money for the studios, but is every movie made before the Kennedy administration a "classic"? It's getting out of hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder, if necessary with a clear story to make a complex movie. Welles is probably knew what he was doing. I think that some segments are superfluous. While looking at the totality of the movie I really like. I must admit that at times I had the impression that director is bored. Scenery is at the level. Expressionist style is commendable. The atmosphere answer noir, particularly in instances where the narrator sounds dazed. The story of an ordinary guy (sailor), the mysterious femme fatale, murder, love, hate, greed, jealousy, and of course money. Nothing special.The tension in the shadow of confusion of the main character. He initially acts like he does not feel selfishness, crime or pathetic. The vicious young man, charming blond beauty, a criminal lawyer and frantic enthusiast correspond with noir themes.Rita Hayworth as Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister is a balm for the human eye. Redhead, blonde ... who cares. A victim of its own deception in hazardous locations. Performance is solid. Its role is perhaps a little vague.Two lunatics. Sloane as a successful, self-centered lawyer and sick husband. Anders as annoying, vague and delighted enthusiast. Both actors are the right choice.Orson Welles as Michael O'Hara is playful in its own particular incident. I've used a couple of times a sweet laugh, when the main protagonist tries to be serious. Romance is not passed the exam. The culprit is solely Welles. The best is in the narrative. It was discovered absolutely everything about this movie.THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is very exciting movie, in which a little more experimentation. Anthology scene a final settlement in the house of mirrors will certainly be remembered. I will remember the final monologue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid film noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic film opens with sailor Michael O'Hara rescuing beautiful blonde Elsa 'Rosalie' Bannister from a group of muggers in Central Park. Afterwards as he takes her home he tells her that he is a sailor and she offers him a job crewing her husband's yacht which the couple plan to sail from New York to San Francisco by way of the Caribbean and the Panama Canal. Initially he isn't keen to take the job but eventually he takes in and joins the Bannisters and their friend George Grisby on their voyage. As time passes it is clear that Michael is developing feelings for Elsa; something George has clearly noticed. Then George approaches him with a very strange proposition; he wants to pay Michael $5,000 to murder him! Actually he wants Michael to tell the police that he killed him so he can start a new life on the insurance money, he assures Michael that without a body he can't be prosecuted. Of course it doesn't go as Michael hoped and he finds himself on trial for his life with Rosalie's husband, a renowned defence attorney, representing him.Fans of film noir are sure to like this as is has all the hallmarks of the genre; murder, a twisting plot and most importantly a beautiful femme fatale. Orson Welles does a solid job as Michael, the ordinary man caught up in a deadly scheme, even if his Irish accent seems a bit off. Rita Hayworth is impressive as Rosalie, a woman more dangerous than she appears, Everett Sloane is good as her husband Arthur as is Glenn Anders as George. The story starts relatively slowly, giving us time to get to know the characters then quickly picks up the pace as the plot emerges and the danger becomes apparent. This all leads up to an inventive finale in the hall of mirrors in an out of season funfair. There are moments of comedy; most notably the court room scene where Arthur is called as a witness and ends up cross examining himself! Overall I'd say that this is an impressive film that fans of the genre should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie in Yugoslav Film Archive. It's really great to watch classics on big screen. I recommend that to all Welles' fans. There is not much to be said about ''The Lady from Shangai''. During the '40s and '50s a lot of film-noir (mystery, detectives...) movies were made. Although film-noir crime movies rarely have 'deeper' philosophical meaning/intellectual importance, some of them are very good. ''The Lady from Shangai'' is certainly one of those. An interesting, original, maybe even unique plot; beautiful Rita Hayworth (I heard that this is her only movie where she was blonde) and magnificent Orson Welles (it is unbelievable how easily this man can change his voice); great visual beauty of the movie; some good dialogues - those are the good sides of ''The Lady from Shangai''. On the other side, as I already mentioned, movie is not an intellectual master-piece. I must also admit that some things are maybe missing (e.g. the movie is named ''The Lady from Shangai'' and I believe that not enough is said about lady's experiences in this Chinese city). However, my vote is still 10/10 for two reasons:1) Good sides made me really enjoy this movie2) I like WellesMy top 30 for now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classic film noir has it all ? a tight script, great scenes on location, and the seductive and beautiful Rita Hayworth. Orson Welles is in the role of the guy realizes he's swimming with sharks, but can't stop himself from doing so. Isn't that a common theme in these movies? At Hayworth's urging, he takes a job on her husband's yacht; her husband (Everett Sloane) is a rich, invalid lawyer who is having his wife followed. Things are uneasy from the outset, and then take a turn for the worse when Sloane's partner Grigsby (Glenn Anders) offers him money out of the blue to commit a murder ? on himself, Grigsby. Glenn Anders looks like a maniacal Mike Ditka while making this proposition ? oh wait, Mike Ditka already looks maniacal, but you get the idea.Rita Hayworth went blonde for this film, which apparently led to the ire of her fans, but she's a knockout and on top of it, she delivers a strong performance. I'm not sure about Orson Welles' Irish accent, but he did give us a great film, and it really was his baby, having written the screenplay, produced, directed, and starred in it opposite Hayworth, his wife of four years who he would divorce shortly after the film's release. The film has great scenes in San Francisco and Acapulco, the 'open air' feel of which provide an interesting counterpoint to the 'noir' plot. There is also, of course, the iconic final sequence in the hall of mirrors. The film is successful but it's too bad Welles wasn't given full creative control, as a great deal of that last sequence was edited out and destroyed, which is a real shame. One reason I like it is because despite some intricacies in the plot which will keep you guessing, it's all explained logically in the end. Another is Welles' direction, which is intelligent and provides interesting camera angles. I'm not sure why this movie was released to mixed reviews in 1947, but it's worth seeing if you like films in this genre.</fullReview>

It may be disjointed, but it's never dull. For me, it's a visual feast. The camera-work alone, much like "Citizen Kane," is vastly innovative. How fascinating to watch the aquarium scene with its magnified fish overpowering the conversation. Rita Hayworth looks beautiful - lovingly photographed, often in closeup, with her then-controversial short blonde haircut. I chuckle when she's chasing after Orson Welles in Chinatown and suddenly starts speaking Chinese with the locals! Or entering a room in silhouette, like a spider woman, after Broome is shot. The justly-famous ending in the Hall of Mirrors remains one of the most vivid sequences in film history. Credit goes to Welles for once again pushing the envelope and coming up with something unique and daring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stylish Classic From Orson Welles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady from Shanghai" is a hybrid--a combination of the artistic vision of director Orson Welles and the more pragmatic vision of the studio, which altered almost every portion of the film. It is also an unlikely success, but sometimes films come together despite their mishaps and disparate elements--"The Wizard of Oz" comes to mind.Reading the trivia notes in IMDb about the film, one would have to say that the odds were against TLFS being a consistent and successful entity, but somehow it became a wonderful piece of art noir.Starring Rita Hayworth as Elsa Bannister, the beautiful wife of a very successful but bitter attorney played by Everett Sloane, the story is told by central character Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles), a tough but vulnerable seaman with a fatalistic point of view. He immediately falls for Mrs. Bannister and is drawn into the web of their dysfunctional relationship. Glenn Anders plays George Grisby, Bannister's partner, with a brilliantly off-kilter and manic intensity.The cinematography is beautiful, giving the brightest objects the darkest shadows. The scenery is spectacular--from the shots over the city of San Francisco to the glittering scenes of Acapulco.Though the storyline is convoluted, it holds up. The film is really a mystery about the true nature of Elsa, but it hinges on a point of law (like "Double Indemnity") that is questionable, but irrelevant in the biggest scheme of things.Welles' decision to cut and color the luscious locks of his estranged wife Hayworth was severely criticized at the time, but for my money it gives her a look that is more severe, more dangerous, more inscrutable--but just as beautiful--adding to her mystery. The courtroom scene (with its comic elements) is also often criticized, but the viewer is not supposed to laugh. It adds to the farcical nature of the film. O'Hara always feels like the gods are laughing at him, so it is appropriate that the procedure that will determine his fate feels less than serious. The film ends with the famous hall of mirrors scene, where all is explained. And the viewer is left with the impression that he navigated a crazy house of illusions and--like O'Hara--became victim to his own nature. It is a stylistic classic that retains at its core the markings of a genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It could have matched the greatness of CITIZEN KANE if it had embraced all the richness Welles envisioned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Revered as an exemplary film-noir by today's cinephiles and critics, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI was a calamitous project of prodigy Welles battling with Hollywood studio system, so much so that its behind-the-scene anecdotes (including the fickle relationship with his then wife Hayworth, they divorced in 1948) have somewhat eclipsed the film itself.The plot is rather convoluted considering that there are only four main characters involved, Welles plays Michael O'Hara, an Irish sailor in New York, gets involuntarily smitten with the titular blonde Elsa (Hayworth). who is another man's wife. Michael then is recruited by the wealthy but disabled criminal defence attorney Arthur Bannister (Sloane), who happens to be Elsa's husband, to his yacht as a seaman. Sailing via Panama Canal, from New York to San Francisco, with Arthur's business partner George Grisby (Anders) also on board, the yacht collects stunning scenery en route whilst a murder plan is hatching up. But it will undergo an unexpected turn in terra firma, yet, at any rate, Michael ends up as the fall guy.Narrated by Michael's sedate voice-over, and it is his angle we closely follows, the film imposes a distinctly visual allure of its chiaroscuro atmosphere, sharp facial close-ups with grotesque mannerism, or striking silhouettes between t?te-a-t?te, up until the climatic shoot-out in an abandoned Fun House, highlighted by the hall of mirrors where the all the masks and lies are bared, and leaving audience for a second, wonder who will be the sole survivor, out of its dashing and juxtaposed editing proficiency, it is an indelible flourish in Welles' machination, in fact, this 92- minute original theatrical edition has been vastly re-edited by the decisions of Columbia Pictures executives, whereas Welles' original cut runs around 155 minutes, that's why Welles is uncredited as the director, so one might conjecture what could have been, if everything had went through according to Welles' idea thoroughly.A shortened masterpiece, one might call it, in its succinct characterisation, the film depicts the underbelly of a world full of sharks, lines like - "Everybody is somebody's fool", "The world's greatest criminal lawyer could also be the world's greatest criminal", or "I don't know how to fire a gun", says a coy Elsa. "It's easy, you just pull the trigger", Michael responds inscrutably. - have already explained the myth and anticipated the denouement.Hayworth was in the peak of her career, so the movie and Welles obligatorily splurges on her with great amount of close-ups, duly adds a paragraph where she lip-syncs PLEASE DON'T KISS ME as an irresistible siren. In her iconic femme-fatale form, Ms. Hayworth is the hallmark of Hollywood Golden Age's glamour, there is some acting required, but realism is barely there.A literally eye-popping Everett Sloane, a slippery Glenn Anders and a doe-eyed Welles are other three parties of the entangled murder game, where there is no innocence remains in the end. In all fairness, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is not instantly inviting, but cogently bestows its brilliance on its deducted value. It could have matched the greatness of CITIZEN KANE (1941) if it had embraced all the richness Welles envisioned.</fullReview>

The theme park ride used was a great symbol of O'Hara trying to piece the puzzle together. His solution to the problem is reached at the end of the ride. Unlike most film noir this movie's main character made it out alive in the end with minimal loss. A very well done film noir. I would recommend to others.</fullReview>

Besides, it is a way to reduce the gap between two shots that are discontinuity editing. Moreover, this movie is plenty of the background music (nondiegetic element) and the music in the plot (diegetic element). They are combined to present this movie perfectly. In the scene that the main actress go swimming we can see "The Iris Shot" from the binocular because the directer wants to create the audience's attention by focusing on the point of view. In the next of couple scene, there is the example of "The 180-Degree System" which is the conversation between the main actor and actress, and it eventually ends by kissing. Finally, the setting is very beautiful because many scenes are photographed in the real place, so the view of the background is very nice.</fullReview>

The most noticeable use of lighting is in the scene shot at the aquarium where they go from one face that is light to both faces black and back in fourth depending on how dark the conversation is getting. There are lots of great shots on the water, the one I enjoyed the most was the one when they pull into the island My favorite scene in the movie though has to be the scene at the end where there in the room with all the mirrors. It impossible to tell whats a reflection and what is and actual person. Not only does it add to the mysterious of the plot it just sums up the whole point of the movie; that you never know what is really going on. The Narrating done by Welles I also really enjoyed. He voice made the movie seem more realistic like it had already happened and he was just retelling the story to us. One thing I noticed is that Welles sometimes talked with a strong accent and less of one in other scenes. I felt that was a little took away from his role, I'm not sure if that one done on purpose or by accident but I didn't enjoy it.</fullReview>

What brings this movie for the viewer is of course many things from the time, when expectancies from the victory of democracy were supposed changing the current life of everyday, but it was in part only much more a kind of mirage, even in court affairs like this one of the movie with a crippled lawyer and a mariner in location with the crew of unadaptive and surviving men of occasionally chance for the job. One of the scenes that took for instance the feelings of modernity at the time, it was while in a given instant on a cruiser boat, while it's listen on the radio - from inside the cabin, also seen in the deck by the couple of characters - a brief commercial without report with the reality of the fiction. However, but giving us a notion of the fake rule inside a banal story of adultery and wrong way for the adventurer, searching justice in Central America after fighting against Franco during the Spanish civil war. All the plot is very confused as the searching of freedom in itself here is convoluted by so many tricks as in court scene that hope for better life is choking with the individualism of the main character. Or as in another scene further, not at all by the fault of the mariner lover, when the crippled husband and his beautiful young wife, each other rivaling by shooting against mirrors in illusory reflections of brightness by a shadowy night and broken it little by little, more by self-destructiveness than self-defense, after cutting down either their links, disgusting like before the story beginning. The scene that justifies the intriguing title of the movie extracted from a novel that it was not read till the end it seems by the gossips at the time nevertheless it was located in the Chinese theater where the feminine character attends a session and the contrast between her beauty figure and the old mandarins smoking a kind of cannabis, it is in the darkness and with a strange oriental sound mingled in such an exotic atmosphere, one of the most beautiful visual compositions concerned by a pause in the mystery of lives inside an extravagant plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder, he says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It used to be one of my favourite films but I saw it way too often on VHS back in the 1980's and the sheen wore off a bit. Now not having seen it for nearly twenty years I can view it maybe a little more objectively ? nope, it's still a pretty weird film. Made by Orson Welles simply to help finance his Mercury projects and suffering the usual studio interference (but at least surviving it) it was an odd story photographed deliberately oddly with odd characters hamming it up to the max.A badly-dubbed Irish sailor with a past gets embroiled with a hard-boiled female siren who's married to a cynical sicko of a lawyer who has a cuckoo business partner - he takes a job on the lawyers' posh yacht to ferry them all about the West Coast. The undercurrent of menace is hardly lessened when it turns out one of them wants to be murdered. There's plenty of snappy dialogue and editing, witticisms and interrupted aphorisms in the best Wellsian manner, all leading to a unique experience: a crackpot film noir. Favourite bits: Welles' choice shark allegory to the lovely chummy bunch which somewhat deflated them; the entire nonsensical courtroom scene ? handled very well but it could have been borrowed from Monogram; of course the Hall Of Mirrors scene which was the most impressively ridiculous scene ever put on film; followed by Rita Hayworth's memorable last line and Welles' harrowed face as he yawningly wraps it all up. Although Welles' character of Michael was at convoluted pains to point out what a silly fool he was, the whole plot hinged on just how foolish he was ? but he was so foolish you have to stop and laugh either at his credulousness or Welles' for misjudging the audience's credulousness. Maybe the uncut 155 minute original with perhaps sympathetic background music would have made it all easier to swallow?maybe.Overall though, what we're left with is an unforgettable journey impeccably steered to its literally shattering conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no prior knowledge of this film before I watched it. I knew it was directed by Orson Welles. Come to find out, it starred himself, as well as his ex-wife, Rita Hayworth.One thing in particular with the movie is that I noticed the plot was not exactly concrete with strange settings and characters. Come to find out, this is what I should expect from a Welles film. The characters did stick out to me though. George Grisby was an outrageous character in the movie and the words he was speaking were sometime just out of control, for lack of a better term.The best part of the movie was the final scene with the mirrors. The camera angles and shots made the scene just incredible and I wish I could have seen the whole scene as it should have been shown. This scene was cut by more than half by the studios. In fact, half the movie was cut and edited by the movie studio?.what a shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching Lady from Shanghai I was drawn to the plot line instantly. Mystery and deception are two very intriguing parts of the movie. I personally enjoyed the scene that Michael O'Hara wakes up in the hall of mirrors and thinks that he is going crazy. All to find out that after it was not he going crazy at all but the fun house playing tricks on him. In this scene I really feel as though Rita Hayworth did a tremendous job on that scene she had a lot of passion showing through. When Welles departs from the hall her shrilling voice really stood out to me. She had a lot of emotion throughout the entire movie. I felt that she played her role very well. Orson Welles was not the stand out character in this film I felt that he was not fully committed throughout the film. I do not personally feel that the film can be easily related to people, maybe the feeling of being trapped. But as for the plot I am not sure many can relate to murder as a part of their everyday life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film didn't particularly capture my interest, it did feature some very interesting moments and themes. The most notable of which was the scene shot in a hall of mirrors. I felt this scene captured the nature of this pseudo-noir, in which no one is who they seem, and everyone is after everyone else. The allegory of the sharks that Michael presents during the picnic plays a central role in the theme of the story, and brilliant foreshadowing is achieved when Elsa, the worst shark of them all, chooses an aquarium as the meeting place for her and Michael. Aside from Wells' expert use of photography and space, the movie did little for my interest. Something about the story's haste and jumpiness left me spinning for the first half of the film, and not until the scene in the courtroom was my interest in the film revived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie kept you on the edge of your seat throughout, the plot was not predictable at all. It was a more complex film, having two stories playing at the same time in the film. It's complexity challenged the audience to put the "pieces of the puzzle," together for themselves to figure out or predict what might happen in the end. The acting was very good, and I would say that this movie had very high verisimilitude. There is not doubt in my mind that this could have actually happened. I wouldn't doubt that this gave the audience a glimpse of how an individual can manipulate things in the government system and what holes he/she will be able to jump through to attain either money or murder. Because of it's verisimilitude I would say it is a bit scary and disturbing in the selfish nature of people.</fullReview>

I think that this is a direct result of a lousy script. I like that Orson Welles acts in his films. I thought that he was very convincing in his role. I really liked Rita Hayworth. I thought that her character had great depth. I never knew what she was thinking. The diversity in setting was wonderful. One minute they were on a boat, then on an island, then in a fun house. The mirror scene was very creative. I also liked the ending because they were cruel people and they got what they deserved. I would have to say that my favorite scene was when Rita Hayworth was lying on her back and singing. It was so beautiful, and it really made me feel the slightest bit sorry for her predicament.</fullReview>

The dialogs itself was kinda bland. none of the actors/actresses popped in this film except maybe rita hayworth. The movie overall wasn't all to bad. the scene in where they went into the fun house with the mirrors was good. the camera work involved in that was done quite well. I don't know what Welles was thinking when he made this or even how to do his "Irish" accent.

		<shortDescription>Fascinating but flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The character of Grisby seemed to be the most curious of a totally odd assortment of characters. Even more so, than the crippled Bannister, his stunningly beautiful wife, or the "Black Irishman" played by Welles himself. The theme, expressed by Welles himself, that the trio of idle rich on board the yacht, were like sharks that the Black Irishman had seen devouring each other misses the point if one knows anything about sharks, or the law for that matter. Sharks have been compared more correctly compared with lawyers. Sharks as predators, are not cunning creatures like the three on the boat. They plan and scheme without the bold attack of a shark.Welles should have compared them to predatory cats, who plan their attacks with stealth and cunning, and sometimes end up killing each other over the spoils.The court scene seems written by someone who has never been inside a court. However in strictly film terms, it does seem to capture the diabolical interplay between the three principal characters.I thought the scene at the empty amusement park was novel, but I may have to watch the film again, to figure out how Bannister knew Welles and Hayworth were there. I may also have to watch again to understand how the DA came up with a witness that saw Welles and Hayworth kissing in the Aquarium, or the appearance of the subpoena for Hayworth, without the knowledge of the Defense. Very bad law. As for politics, Welles, always the anti-Nazi, may have forgotten that the Irish were legally neutral during WWII, and the Irish government never lifted a finger to help the English, or the US who were in the war before Pearl Harbor. Did Welles forget Ireland had just fought and won their independence in the Southern Counties, with help from anyone who was willing to help. That included Nazi's, Communists, and many American Irishman, who cared little for what was happening in Spain, but a lot of what was happening in Irland during the 1930's.The fact that Grisby was pro-Franco and O'Hara killed a Franco supporter seemed to be a political statement that defined the goodness and badness of the characters in a rather clumsy way. (Franco at the time was the fascist Dictator of Spain at the time, but Stalin was the most famous and dominant dictator of the world at the time this film was made. For all of the Kudos written about Welles, couldn't we expect him to write something other than current Hollywood correctness?Welles seemed to ignore that Central Europe was being gobbled up by Stalin, while Franco had simply run Spain without any interest in dominating the world. Odd, that Welles chose Spain as his final resting spot, and clearly had an attachment to the country while Franco was still in power. One wonders if he ever visited the Soviet Union, or ever attempted to understand the evil present, rather than evil past when this film was made. In the Third Man, he plays an American with no morality, only a sublime self centered attitude toward life. This character seemed to fit what I know of the real Welles. A man whose genius put him above the rest of us, and whose lack of morality, or what ever one calls the relationship between fellow humans.Many men of genius, and surely Welles was, the genius always seems to come at the expense of characteristics that most "normal" people have in common, and that is common sense. For those of us not in the film business, but make a living, we all understand that one must make a profit in order to go on making a living. Welles films, like Shangai Lady may please the film critics, but it didn't please the accountants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady from Shanghai, My Own Two Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Orson Welles as well as film-noir, I really like this film. It has all the great visual style you'd expect from such a combo. Great B&amp;W photography to go along with Welles' exceptional visual sense of style. Welles was one of those directors who would take a nothing scene of a few people sitting around a table talking and infuse it with at least some interesting look. The shots, the staging, and the lighting are always far above what most any other director would bring to such "throw away" segments. My one big complaint about Welles' visual sense in this one is actually foreshadowed by his character's very first lines of narration that begin the picture. I can't reproduce them verbatim, but they go something like "I wasn't in my right mind...and when I first saw her, I knew I wasn't in my right mind." How accurate! I know it's a B&amp;W film, but Welles took Rita Hayworth, one of the all-time knockout red heads and ordered her bleached blonde especially for the picture! IMHO, "not in his right mind" is an understatement. Oh yeah, she's still gorgeous, but every time I see the film it takes me a while to put aside my disappointment of seeing Rita with that awful white crop of hair. It's doesn't even have any "golden tones" to it. Welles is quoted as having said that B&amp;W is "the actor's best friend", feeling that it focused more on the actor's expressions and feelings than on hair, eye or wardrobe color. He fixed THAT little problem with spinning Rita's hair contrast 180 degrees! I DO believe the idea that this was an "act of vengeance" upon his soon to be ex-wife. Usually after viewing "Lady from Shanghai", I throw my copy of "Gilda" into the VCR to get a good look of Rita in a classic noir as she shoulda/coulda looked here. They say her look reduced the take at the box office. I wouldn't go as far as to believe that, but the gents who did attend were no doubt disappointed to say the least. One final thing. I didn't read through all of the other comments on the picture, so my apologies to anyone who had something similar to say. I tried to be "original" by writing my own review first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Screenplay written by, directed by and starring the incomparable Orson Welles. Welles plays a rough and tumble Irish seaman who gets caught up in a murder for hire scheme and at the same time not so secretly smooching with the wife(Rita Hayworth)of his eventual lawyer(Everett Sloane). Film-Noir at its best. Script and story line meanders in that Welles way. Terrific camera angles and positioning. My favorite scenes are the get-a-way from the courtroom and later the very unusual scene in the mirror maze.Note:This movie has nothing to do with Shanghai, but San Francisco. Hayworth(the soon to be ex-Mrs. Welles in real life)cuts her trademark red hair and dyes it blonde. Welles floats back and forth speaking in an Irish accent as he also narrates this misunderstood movie. And the yachting scenes are filmed on the personal yacht owned by Errol Flynn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Engrossing film noir scripted &amp; directed by Orson Welles about an Irish drifter (Welles) beguiled by the beautiful wife (Rita Hayworth) of a successful attorney (Everett Sloane). Before long he finds himself mixed up in a plot to fake a man's death and winds up on trial when the man is actually murdered.A stylish piece of work that's gained more appreciation in the years since its release but still appears to be divisive among film fans today. A lot has been written about the troubles between Welles and studio head Harry Cohn over this picture. Among other things, Cohn was furious over Welles' cutting and dyeing Hayworth's hair. Something like that seems silly today but this was the studio era and stars had a specific image the studios crafted and wanted to maintain. Welles knew what he was doing, of course, and Rita's new look is stunning and a large part of why this film is so memorable. She was rarely more beautiful than she is in this movie. Every shot of her is perfection and her sex appeal is timeless. When she breathlessly delivers lines like "I'll make it worth your while" she reaches across the decades and smacks down all the would-be screen sirens of today. Everett Sloane does a great job, as he always seemed to. Such a solid actor. Glenn Anders isn't as well-known today as Hayworth and Welles (or even Sloane for that matter) but he gives a delightfully eccentric performance here.For his part, Welles' script and direction are superb but it's his acting that is often singled out as one of the main criticisms of the film. Many don't like his Irish accent. I've heard better but I've also heard far worse, even with many current actors who are critical darlings. Other than that his acting is good, great at times, and his chemistry with then-wife Hayworth is excellent. Charles Lawton, Jr.'s handsome cinematography is probably the real unsung hero of this. It's really a wonderful movie, particularly if you're a fan of Welles or Hayworth. It has quotable lines, interesting characters, and some impressive visuals. The hall of mirrors climax is justifiably a classic. As with every great film, this has its detractors and its admirers. I'm one of the latter, obviously.</fullReview>

Her presence so dominates the screen that the rest of the cast, including Orson Welles, are practically obscured. The entire story revolves around her, and with good reason: Hayworth's incredible screen presence. The close ups, the wide-angle shots and all other shots in-between show Rita Hayworth at her most glorious best. But there is more to this movie then just Rita Hayworth. The movie tells an intriguing story that is full of suspense and has a surprising ending. The location shots in Acapulco and San Francisco are fantastic. The movie also captures the essence of the American courtroom, and how passion can cause people to make irrational decisions with tragic consequences.</fullReview>

Every time I see another one of his films, I can't help noticing the brilliant originality of each one. Though it is not Citizen Kane, and it is not meant to be, it still has that amazing cinematography and insane characters all throughout the film. The characters are wacky, from Welles' bad Irish accent, which didn't bother me after a while, to Glenn Anders bizarre portrayal of George Grisby, which I thought stole the show.The fact that they shot on location was wonderful. I feel the use of the outdoor light, especially on the boat, made the film so much more believable. The strange placement of what we would call green/blue screen today gave the film a surreal atmosphere, the scene in the aquarium was great with the over sized sea creatures. The court scene was fun and so was the ending in the mirror room....Welles sure was ahead of his time...wouldn't you say lover??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles superb and stylish direction elevate a troubled production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady from Shanghai" is well known as one of Hollywood's most troubled productions. Welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons. This made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of. They post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the Irish accent, and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done. Most disastrous of all, Welles and his on screen and real life leading lady Rita Hayworth were falling apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screen.Fortunately, this is all overcome by just how fantastic Orson Welles' direction is. He makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen. Also, the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal. This sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films, such as the courtroom sequences in the middle. I typically find courtroom dramas a bore, but Welles' direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else. The ending at the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost.The acting here is also very good. Despite their failing relationship, Welles and Hayworth both give decent performances - their interactions however are just a bit lacking. Everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady from Shanghai" obviously has its problems, but its worth watching just to see one of cinema's masters at his finest. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning Welles film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch film with Orson Welles, whether he directed or acted in it, I always enjoy it, no matter what kind film it is.The Lady from Shanghai is amazing film from Welles and I saw some of his major films like Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, and The Magnificent Ambersons. Let me explain a little background on The Lady from Shanghai. Welles chose the book at random when talking to head of studio and told him that he would turn that book into film. He got his wife, whose is Rita Hayworth (my first film with her), starring in it but he got bash for dying Hayworth's hair to blonde. It is well established that studio had cut Welles' original version of 155 minutes into 87 minutes and from what I heard, the additional footages are lost. It's shame that the hour is lost because some areas in this film sometimes don't make sense at all.Now, to my personal feelings about The Lady from Shanghai. This is one of the easiest films to watch by Welles and I was rather impressed by that because his other film, Touch of Evil, is very confusing as hell. I really enjoy The Lady from Shanghai a lot and the cinematography is very top notch, which makes film so great to watch. Everett Sloane did superb job as Bannister, Hayworth's husband in film, but sometimes I feel his acting is bit over the top and should have restrained a little bit but he provided comedy relief, which is good.I'm not familiar with Rita Hayworth but I just adore those close ups of her because she's truly beautiful and I want to watch more films with her in it. Fantastic actress, who always keep me on my toes but trick me very well, It would be so nice to see additional hour to this film because some of the plots doesn't make sense at all but hey, it's film noir, what do you expect? It's about mood, atmosphere, and sense of dangerous, which is really fun. My favorite part is the fun house sequence and mirror sequence. Oh my God, have you seen so amazing scene ever? It just blew my mind away but I was very sad when I found out that the studio had shortened the fun house sequence. I think the fun house sequence is just full of fun and awesome to watch because it's very mind boggling. When the mirror sequence came on, I nearly died. It's so well shot with precisely timed cinematography. I don't think they should have use music in fun house sequence because it takes away a lot from that part. I heard that Welles want that part to be unscored, which add more tense and suspense is something that I definitely agree.Easily one of the most mind blown films I've ever seen. Today, Hollywood films are all about payoffs but no build up. But The Lady from Shanghai builds up to super-sweet payoff, which will have you rolling in your hallway big time. Amazing film.</fullReview>

I know people complain that it was cut down, but the only part I think that I miss is the extended crazy house scene.Rita Hayworth looks totally amazing, and Everett Sloan gives an Oscar-worthy supporting performance. And I really like the courtroom scene. This is just like all of Welles' other films in that it is sooo ahead of its time.My favorite line in the film is, "Just say you're doing a little..target practice." Yes, the plot is very confusing, but I don't take off much for that. It makes you watch again, to try to understand what exactly happened. It was much better the second time. This is a must see.

Welles was a genius in Hollywood at a time where he was too far ahead of them for them to realize the full extent of the talent in their hands. But The Lady From Shanghai shows just how diverse Welles was with material and with how he chose to convey his ideas to film.See it. You won't be disappointed!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Irish sailor named O'Hara is hired by an defense lawyer's wife to help her sail the oriental seas. En route he becomes involved with the wife and the attorney's partner in an insurance scam. The scam backfires and O'Hara is on trial for murder with Bannister, the lawyer, defending him with his own purposes in mind. Hayworth acts like she wants to break out of her role at a point, but doesn't know where. Welles seems as if he were downplaying his role in the film. Parts of the plot make little sense and I thought that they're were a bit too many closeups. However, the climatic scene in the Hall of Mirrors and Sloane's performance as Bannister make up for trivialities. Obviously, Columbia head Cohn wanted the film done his way, rather give Welles his freedom. I still don't think a "director's cut" would have helped matters any. Probably just watching for the last 10 minutes. Rating, 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed Above-Average Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Lady From Shanghai" is known better as a film studio mishap than the good movie that it is. Orson Welles, one of the most celebrated film makers in history, directed, acted, as well as wrote this movie like he did so many others. Unfortunately like many of the others, in regards to the film studio's rights and ownership advantages, it was butchered. Sure, the film is in circulation on home video and such means but you're not getting the original Orson Welles film. What you get is a studio version of the Orson Welles film. The film is a good mystery nonetheless but one who knows these facts about the film can not help but feel a bit unsatisfied. One can certainly appreciate that whenever a person's work is disassembled and taken away, one has to feel a certain loss and dismay. Orson Welles is one of the very best in his craft as his "untouched" films show. Though even in flawed studio treatments of his films like "Lady From Shanghai" it is still apparent that it came from the gifted hands of a talent. This film may be a bit difficult to follow but a mystery should be. The manipulation of the viewer is the key to the greatness and therefore essential to any mystery film. If a mystery film doesn't make sense then it takes some entertainment out of a mystery and this movie does make sense after some observations on a second viewing. With extra viewings, hopefully you should see and appreciate bits of talent that only proves that Orson Welles deserves the accolades that he received in the latter half of his life. A film with a story not to be told but seen."The Lady From Shanghai" - Flawed yet still entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Makes It Great??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this film and its maker great? well only if you make the allowances for ego, uncontrolled creative talent, and perhaps being unsure if you really want to work hard at all. The great 'Kane' from 1941 was certainly Welles' claim to fame, undoubtedly. Yes, it did suffer undeservedly at the hands of political giants and perhaps weak film distribution heads. But I've also heard it said that Welles made the claim: "that he started at the top, and worked his way to the bottom". If this is so, then maybe it tells us much about the man.He knew from the outset, to surround himself with colleagues who were not simply talented, but also very hungry for success. So what happened...perhaps his ego was too big for even himself to control, or was he simply not able to recognize the good ideas from the bad? As for "Lady" I've tried twice to find the greatness that 'modern' critics are so passionate about. David Kehr calls it a masterpiece, but a masterpiece compared to what!? Here is a film made in 1947 that looks more like it was made during the downward spiral days of the mid 50s. When the el-cheapo directors were cashing in on quickie -'exploitation' films, and many mainstream movies had begun to look more like television productions.Where is that magic look of 'Kane'?. "Lady from Shanghai" was a film with not one great Director of Photography but three! While it's solely credited to Charles Lawton Jr. who gave '3.10 to Yuma' '57, ~ 'The Tall T' (also '57) even 'The Big Store' '41 a quality cinematic look, how much of that shines here?. The two other (un-credited) photographic masters, namely: Rudolph Mate of: 'Dodsworth' 36 ~ 'Foreign Correspondent' 40 and 'Cover Girl' 44, along with Joseph Walker: 'Mr Smith Goes to Washington' 39 ~ It's a Wonderful Life' 46 ~ 'The Jolson Story' 46 (all 'A' grade looking films) could do little to give 'Lady' that 'special' look and sustain it."What about the ending"? I hear people say...a special effects mans dream. Lots of smashing glass, carnival sets, and an ending almost as foolishly indulged as the somewhat over the top courtroom scenes just before it. We're told that Welles had the side show fun-house scene running for an entire spool (that's 22 Min's!) before Harry Cohn had it cut to a more realistic length. I doubt many could have lasted the 2 1/2 Hrs Orson had originally intended this silly story to run. As for the opening scenes...just when it appears as if the main character is 'day dreaming', we find we are supposed to accept the action as 'real'. Unfortunately I can't help feeling that those who repeatedly sing the praises of this film, and Welles, are those that may belong in the same club. Some, like Welles, made one film that was praised, then also sank rather rapidly to the bottom - could this praise be perhaps for the sake of 'their' own reputations? If so, then more's the pity. Orson Welles had greatness, and will be remembered for it, but didn't necessarily demonstrate that lasting mileage to sustain it. There are just too many other 'great' film makers from the past, whose achievements may be head and shoulders above Orson...but many of these tend to be somewhat sacrificed by certain 'modern' industry people and critics alike. Still, DVD is bringing other great classics from the past (and present) for us to study and fully appreciate. Footnote: Another reviewer posted a suggestion to check out "The Third Man" as proof of Welles' greatness. Yes, he gives a sterling 'performance', but in 'The Third Man' Welles is being Directed by Carol Reed, from a story by Graham Green. Reed is just one of those great film-makers of sustained effort --over many years' work-- that are rarely acknowledged in the way we continually hear about Mr. Welles....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth, her tresses cut short and dyed blonde, plays a cool, dangerous beauty of Russian descent who is saved from rapists in Central Park by a ne'er-do-well Irishman; she gets him a job on her husband's yacht, but he becomes embroiled in a murder and may face the electric chair if he doesn't work fast. Slow-starting film of Sherwood King's novel "If I Die Before I Wake", directed by and co-starring a handsome (if somewhat out-of-place) Orson Welles. Welles, who also took sole credit for the screenplay adaptation (though many others reportedly worked on it), doesn't pick up the pace until well into the second-act. The dreamy quality throughout the picture is both curious and desultory, with lines overlapping and characters behaving in an oddly surreal manner. The big dramatic moments are played in a low, muffled key--all for a narcotizing effect--while Hayworth and Welles exchange heavy-lidded movie-star stares. Their final scene in a funhouse is deliberately cold and indifferent, leaving a fine chill in the air. William Castle served as associate producer, and was also one of the uncredited writers. A mixed bag: **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Put Welles into a flick like 'Body Heat' and you expect good things to happen. Put him into it with Harry Cohn overseeing production-and you get something like This instead. I have a mixed reaction to this at best.I went into it expecting alot better-the 'Fatal Attraction' formula was clearly at work, I liked the cast, and of course the genre. Welles though...his track record tends to be over-rated at the least, here for example he tries an Irish brogue, which lapses in and outta the dialogue depending on the take-ala Tommy Lee Jones in 'Blown Away'. Rita Hayworth I just could Not ID, kept on thinking 'Claire Trevor' or 'Lana Turner'. As a plat. blonde-here icily restrained at best-she doesn't quite cut it. Bring me back Gilda.Sloan and De Corsia of course are always good; the trial scene Was right outta the Dancing Judge Ito's, I wasn't sure if it was her husband or his law partner who wanted to fake a killing, then when I got That figgered out, you get the whackjob editing and mirror room foolishness. I still liked it but it was strange.Put this down to 'nice try'; perhaps it woulda worked better if they'd let Welles have at it w/out Cohn's interference OR gotten some one ala Hawks or Wyler to direct it, pushing aside Welles' excesses and replacing them with tauter direction and storyline.**1/2 outta ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film never engages the viewer. From the very beginning it seems highly improbable that the leads would meet the way they do and that he would work for her. No sparks fly at all between them (even tho they were married at the time). The plot is very contrived and not exciting. Welles Irish accent is too distracting. Rita is breathtakingly beautiful and is the films only saving grace besides the ending which is inventive but too short.Incidently the film took a long time to film which is evident in ms. Hayworths wardrobe. At the beginning of the film she wears the New Look, the longer dresses from 1947 that swept fashion after the war. Later in the film she wears the shorter skirts from 1946. Its all in reverse but may be the first Hollywood film to show the legendary New Look from Dior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little jambon with all this fromage?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admire Orson Welles. Not for everything he has done, but mainly for the way he has been apotheosized by the film community years after his films were made. Granted I, like just about any other film lover, am enamored with TOUCH OF EVIL (despite Charleston Heston's ridiculous attempt to portray a Mexican) and adore the grandiosity and genius of KANE. But I think that allowing those films to be color his other work does not allow for an honest appraisal of his output, whether it was hacked to bits by the studios or not.SPOILERS AHEAD.First of all, Welles' Irish brogue is horrid; he should have just portrayed an American or actually paid attention to how the Irish speak. It ranks (and I do mean "rank") with Tom Cruise in FAR AND AWAY, Sean Connery in THE UNTOUCHABLES (who really has no excuse since he is bloody Scottish) and Brad Pitt in THE DEVIL'S OWN as one of the worst attempts at an Irish accent in a film that takes itself seriously. Now, I am not one to claim that the ability to mimic an accent is essential to acting, but if you are going to attempt an accent, give it a good try, especially if the film you are in is a thriller. This may seem a minor point of contention, but Welles is talking a lot of the time and his dubbed, ridiculous brogue is truly distracting. This is a perfect example of Welles needing a director to shout, "Cut out that terrible accent!" The problem, of course, was that Welles was the director. The other characters were also pretty annoying; Everett Sloane and his "piercing gaze" and "maniacal laugh"; Glenn Anders and his truly over the top scenery munching; Rita Hayworth as an unconvincing, languid femme fatale. Say what you will about how the editing affected the picture, the acting was meant to be kept and should have been junked.The camerawork is something different altogether. Welles displays his gift for angles, contrasts, lighting and ambiance in several notable scenes, something that is truly remarkable. That said, I find the cartoonishness of the Hall of Mirrors scene, which seemed Welles intent, to be a bit of a yawner, not the spellbinder a lot of people like to call it. This, as well as the court room scene, is a perfect example of Welles not being subtle and coming off overly ham-handed. A little subtlety would have been nice, even if satire was his aim.All in all, the film is amazingly mediocre and uneven, something I doubt adding back the other hour would change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the 2nd time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be amazing, worthy films. But the remainder of Welles career is, unfortunately, squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering. And when he makes a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on, is just kind of sad. I couldn't tell you what he was exploring here. It's all as mannered as Welle's godawful Irish brogue; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the film. Several Welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque. Mr Arkadin (pick a version, any version) is a similarly belabored project. The material is inconsequential. It just can't bear the weight of all this noodling. For a director trafficking in reality-based drama (as here), he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality; or to a coherent story. The murder-for-hire scheme is ridiculous. Kudos to Welles though, for having Hayworth cut her hair, and getting that performance out of her. The camera loves her. She's the classiest, most upscale, sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film. But her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision, made so the movie will have some genre it fits into. The movie can't be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds.When all is said and done in L.F.S., the convolutions are all for what?; to convince you you've seen something thoughtful? to give Welles more to do? to make you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story, or to telling a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who isn't a crippled billionaire, arranging a quadruple-cross murder-for-hire scheme, or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or substance. Overwrought, preposterous, unengaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody is somebody's fool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dave Kehr calls this film a true 'film noir comedy'. It seems to me that this perspective manifests in the way that the universe of The Lady from Shanghai continually and incessantly laughs at Michael O'Hara's misfortune and helplessness. Certainly Welles has obliged stylistically - his strange, morphed compositions increasingly begin to collapse around O'Hara as he is drawn slowly into the mystery of the murder conspiracy. The blocked paths of the actors criss-crossed and circle each other venomously as the aquarium creatures loom large in the background. The narrator seemingly jumps readily inside his own story as the voice-over switches seamlessly into dialogue. And then there is that famous climax in the house of mirrors where all sense of direction and orientation is abandoned for our characters - each shot and each shattering of glass further distorts the space (although the lost footage is apparently much longer and grander). In some instances the cosmic farce is literal in its humour - as the hobbling Bannister ends up on the stand interrogating himself in the trial that is little more than a slapstick affair. But for all the effort in maintaining this pervasive aura of paranoia and disorientation by ramping up the convention stylistic tones of noir the film falls a little flat. The murder plot itself, which is meant to be increasing hard to follow until that final reveal, is secondary to Welles' atmosphere, so what we have is a distancing effect due to his own plodding, almost bored narration guiding us along. What is supposed to be irregular and affecting merely highlights its own flaws - the clumsy ADR dubbing which does the dialogue no favours, the oddly stilted romance that doesn't quite lure us into a false sense of security (perhaps a casualty of the director and starlet's impending divorce), awkward little zooms and smash cuts that merely draw attention to themselves rather than establish a tone. I would so very much like to see this lost artefact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with a typical film noir, "The Lady from Shanghai" (1947) is a mysterious and alluring film, complete with a cynical, crime-ridden lead character, a beautiful femme fatale, and a complex and dramatic plot. It's a bit less glamorous than other film noirs; the exception being the lovely Rita Hayworth, of course. It's a little dingier, a little more rough around the edges. But that isn't a drawback. And it certainly stays entertaining for an hour and a half.The lighting isn't all that remarkable, but the camera-work is interesting to examine. Orson Welles, the director and star, throws a bit of artistry in when it comes to angles and such throughout. And, of course, the iconic climax has its fair share of exciting cinematography. The main little itch I had through the entire film was Welles's fake Irish accent. He performed the facial expressions and the body language well enough, but that accent just didn't hit the mark. It left just a bit of a sour taste in my mouth, being that he is the main character, who also narrates throughout.Overall, worth watching, even if just to take a look at Welles's work and further expand your idea of a film noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The visuals are by Rembrandt, while the narrative is by Swiss with more holes than the cheese. I don't know how many of the narrative gaps are due to studio interference (Columbia) or to Welles' apparent indifference to coherence. But if you can untangle the final threads, you belong in rocket science. Good thing the visuals are so compelling, but then that's expected from arguably Hollywood's greatest visual artist. Those sea-scape compositions alone are worth price of admission. Nonetheless, the overall result suggests a Welles or a studio more interested in exotic effects than in digestible narrative, producing what amounts to an intriguing mess.Then too, what's with actor Anders as lawyer Grisby. His portrayal is plain bizarre and in defiance of the mystery's apparent solution. How, that is, could the calculating Elsa (Hayworth) be expected to fall for a repulsive dingbat like Grisby. And how about all those loving cameo close-ups of Hayworth, dragging out the set-up long after we've gotten the basic idea. I wonder if that was husband Welles's idea or the studio's investment in its top star. Whichever, the repetition doesn't help the pacing, even if she is a knockout. I know it's heresy to knock an icon of the movies at any level. But if you're a Welles, why keep making commercial movies you know the studio will mutilate, as Columbia likely did here. All in all, I wish one of noir's master storytellers, like Mann or Losey, had been in charge. Then maybe the studio would have laid off and the result would have been a compelling whole instead of an atmospheric tangle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The peculiar love/hate relationship between Hollywood and Orson Welles can perhaps best be seen in this sometimes sloppy marriage of pulp fiction with fine art: a far-fetched but enjoyable film noir from an acknowledged genius at odds with The System. Never mind the difficult plot, in which Welles himself plays an Irish sailor looking for trouble and finding more than he can handle during a pleasure cruise up the Mexican coast with a glamorous femme-fatale (platinum blonde Rita Hayworth) and her crippled lawyer husband (Welles regular Everett Sloane). The otherwise standard noir scenario was just a convenient frame for the director's now familiar battery of visual tricks, including an elaborately staged and justly famous confrontation set, appropriately, in a carnival funhouse, where human nature is revealed to be not unlike the feeding frenzy of sharks. As always the real romance in the film was between Welles and his camera; everything else was simply foreplay. Filmed at various locations in and around San Francisco, including the now defunct Playland at the Beach amusement park.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absurd and Erotic Film-noir about Loveless Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In The Lady from Shanghai Orson Welles decided to abandon the experimentalism which characterized Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons. For its aspect ratio and images the film was classical, but its content wasn't like that at all. I am referring to the things hidden below the surface, because the plot of the film is ridiculously easy, but one shouldn't take this as an insult, not at all. Andre Bazin commented on the subject matter quite aptly: "The Lady from Shanghai is, paradoxically yes, the most complex of all the films by Welles, compared to the nothingness of the script: when plot is no longer detrimental for the actual action, themes begin to bloom in almost natural state." The Lady from Shanghai is an individualistic journey into the core of film-noir. It's the perfect internalization of the genre. The typical ingredients of the genre burst out so naturally that one can't identify them as film-noir at first glance. Film-noir attained its final dynamic form in the years of WWII and the finest blossoms of it were made during the late 1940's. The price of war was one of the central themes of postwar noir and therefore exhales from The Lady from Shanghai as well. In postwar noir the actual war was over but it was still going on our minds, in the civil society. An Irish man, Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) gets a job at a yacht owned by an affluent man, Arthur Bannister who is married to a younger goddess, Elsa (Rita Hayworth). Soon O'Hara is in the middle of the world of crime, as he gets framed for killing a man. After the final showdown, in a hall of mirrors, Elsa gets shot by Arthur and O'Hara decides to leave her there, to die, like a dog. But the crime plot is just a frame-story.The film drills down deeper, beneath the shallow storyline, and its content is characterized by moral thematics and indeterminism. Welles' ethics seems to claim that man is free to decide between good and evil. But also a feeling that the free choice isn't dependent on the human desire, but dictated by fate which presents in the modern character. So basically the philosophy of the film is built on the essence of indeterminism: we're free to make certain choices, but those choices we make are inevitable and predetermined. Is the protagonist led by chance or fate? That's left open for interpretation.Critics loved the film, the audience hated it and Hollywood had had just enough of this experimental genius, who only cost millions of dollars. The original American viewer couldn't forgive Welles for killing Rita. "For years there has been talk about the 'hatred for women' of Hollywood, and due to the brilliance of Welles Rita Hayworth will remain as its most famous martyr." (Andre Bazin) We must not forget the fact that Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth were actually married, in real life. But about a year or two before The Lady from Shanghai their relationship had died. Even that on screen Rita's husband is Mr. Bannister, the love story is played by her and Welles -- even that below the surface lies betrayal and loveless love. It's all about the battle of marriage and, in the end, when Welles (O'Hara) leaves Rita (Elsa) to die; a cinematic divorce has been enforced.From this perspective The Lady from Shanghai might seem like an extremely personal film, which it is, but it's also a traditional erotic film-noir. We all have our own opinions about the perverse truths, told to us through symbolism and erotic imagery. For instance, Welles' character rolls a tobacco but doesn't light it. Later on Rita's character takes the same tobacco and lights it. Overall the film is a fest of images. The over-sized close-ups exude erotic innuendo. But they also tell about the loss of private property and the emotion of joy caused by it -- a chauvinistic perspective, but quite an apt one if we watch the film as part of Hollywood's 'hatred for women'.The film is extremely absurd which can be seen in many scenes but also in the rapidity of narrative. One form of absurdism is the abundance of the world. Orson and Rita live around limbos, invalids, psychopaths and other 'freaks'. This group of people fill the taverns of the haven, exotic milieus, nameless streets of big cities and finally the madhouse, the courtroom, in which hysteria and schizophrenia culminate. In the climax of absurdism a journalist Bannister, a betrayed husband, interrogates himself. Power, law, love and eroticism are all fiction, breakable and uncontrollable.Rita Hayworth had already made her most remembered, glamorous, performance before The Lady from Shanghai. The culmination of eroticism was done in Gilda, one year earlier, as Rita took her glove off. Her performance isn't as glamorous in The Lady from Shanghai but it does have its intelligent criticism. The scenes on the deck, and the day trip for instance, are brilliant depictions of loveless love. They're also images of voyeurism, as the men peep Rita through telescopes, since it's the only form of sexuality they are capable of.The milieus of The Lady from Shanghai are conventional but at least just as brilliant: the docks, the yachts, the aquarium, the courtroom, the streets of big cities, the hall of mirrors, and the exotic ones; the island and the oriental block with its tiny shops and theater plays. As an "philosophical" film, The Lady from Shanghai also talks about the absurdity of being, as all the characters are trying to reach death. In addition to the loveless love and price of war, the vacillation of identity is one of the leading themes and it culminates in the hall of mirrors where one can't know who's who. Original contents, insightful thematics and brilliant stylistics put this film-noir classic on a pedestal from which it is very hard to be dethroned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Orson Welles film was actually a box office flop when it was first released, but has stood the test of time to be regarded as one of the best of the film noir genre. It's beautifully photographed and has some striking scenes. Due to conflicts between Welles and the studio, he partially lost control of the filming and the result is an inconsistent film with sudden changes in tone. At times, the behavior of the characters doesn't make sense. But it's still worthwhile. The final escape from the courthouse and closing shootout are among the most excellent crime climaxes in film history and have been repeated many times over. I definitely recommend this film, which is a near-masterpiece.</fullReview>

I liked the aspect of the femme fatal played by Rita Hayworth, Elsa is the main reason for all the trouble that happens in the movie. Michael played by orson welles is very attracted her although she is married and seems to go where she wants and do what she wants so it makes for quite a movie. The Visual effects in the movie during the famous Hall of Mirrors scene was one of the best I have seen from that decade of movies. It was amazing the depth that went into that scene. Orson Welles does a great job of creating a masterpiece for the eyes by creating a room filled with mirrors and using the two shooting at each other to create a kaleidoscope of images created by the broken glass. I was very surprised by this movie and I'm very glad I watched it and I recommend it to anyone with a imagination.</fullReview>

Orson Welles direction is outstanding, he has created so many memorable scenes in this film. He gives a fine performance as well. Rita Hayworth has seldom been better, she is such an breathtaking beauty. In a supporting role, Everett Sloane steals every scene he is in.Superb cinematography and the score is exciting and very effective. It is suspenseful and stylish throughout. The art direction is exceptional. Welles paid a lot of attention to detail. The scene with the mirrors is one the most intense and memorable scenes ever filmed. An unforgettable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lady from shanghai is a 1947 that was directed by Orson Welles. A classical example of a film noir. It fits the time period. The femme female is present. It has the alienated male lead. The low key lighting gives the film a dark contrast. Michael, who is played by Orson Wells, saves a beautiful woman by the name of Elsa who is played by Rita Bannister and the plot begins to unfold. Michael is draw to the beauty and mysterious side of Elsa. The films contained an overall Dark tone. The light was very dark and low key and some scenes are place in a dark creepy amusing park. I felt the film was over the top. The film puts the viewer though a number of different twist and turns. I was not a fan of how the film was structured. I like when a films keeps you on the edge of your seat but I found this particular film was too much. It hard to follow and I felt that took away from the enjoyment of the film. Also, it's a little too dramatic with the non digestive music. One scene I would say I thought was cool was the way the shooting scene was set up, with all those mirrors. I thought that was creative, and a cool way to give the audience suspense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full disclosure: THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is this reviewer's all-time favorite Orson Welles picture - less didactic than KANE and far more entertaining than AMBERSONS...Originally produced in 1946, LADY was not released until 1948, thanks largely to studio interference during post-production. Columbia studio-head Harry Cohn hated the picture from day 1 due to his obsession with Rita Hayworth - Cohn detested Welles and loathed the director's shearing and bleaching of Hayworth's famous long hair for her role as a combination trophy-wife/underworld boss lady. Cohn also found the film incomprehensible - after Welles' screened his initial, 2.5 hour cut, Cohn actually offered $1000 cash to anyone who could explain the plot to him in a way that made sense (there were no takers!)...Despite the flaw of an often-confusing storyline - such essential points as just how Rita Hayworth becomes the leader of the Chinese underworld, exactly who is being targeted for assassination and why, and what Welles' hapless-sailor character Michael is doing in the middle of all of this are never really explained - LADY FROM SHANGHAI is a feast for the eyes and the imagination which rewards multiple viewings. Sadly, unlike the magnificent restoration of TOUCH OF EVIL a decade ago, there will never be a "director's cut" of LADY, as the excised footage (much of which was apparently concerned Elsa Bannister's life in Shanghai as mistress to the leader of the Chinese underworld) was deliberately destroyed on Cohn's orders. Those who complain about LADY'S being difficult to follow should keep in mind that we only have about 50% of the film which Welles actually made. On the other hand, it's hard to see how LADY FROM SHANGHAI could have made any "sense" in the first place, given that the film's plot and script are cloaked in deliberate obscurity. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is less a coherent narrative than it is an elaborate visual and aural extravaganza. This film contains some sequences which will literally take your breath away, with the legendary mirror-maze climactic shootout being the best known, but the love scene in the aquarium and the trial sequence - among others - are equally rich in style and impact. After several viewings, you will be able to just relax and enjoy the bizarre journey. No matter what you think about the movie's plot (or lack thereof), the final 20 minutes of this movie will blow your mind, especially when Rita Hayworth starts speaking fluent Chinese! DO NOT MISS THIS PICTURE if you want to see true storytelling genius at work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson Welles: Director, Writer and Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1947 Orson Welles directed, wrote and starred in a film noir, The Lady from Shanghai. Welles' use of lighting in this movies gave it the overall feeling of a typical film noir style. Even while shooting with the light of day it still seems dark and cold.In this film Welles often used a "dutch" shot where the camera is on a slant or tilt creating a diagonal shot. This is useful because it gives the impression that the something is out of the ordinary and that the world with in the frame of the camera is unbalanced. This shot was definitely appropriate because there's something thats not quite right about whats happening in the story.When Michael O'Hara realizes that he's been fooled from the very beginning I felt like I too had been betrayed and blindsided. This is the result of excellent writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic film noir, classic thriller, mystery, dark and suspenseful, romantic, Columbia classic- every thing one would expect from Orson Wells. Wonderful imaging, quick paced, beautiful high-key lighting. Great scenery. Plot was interesting and easy to pay attention to. Wells did a great job in acting as well as directing this film. I thought Rosily (Hayworth) had something to do with the set up against Michael (Wells) but I didn't think she was the main antagonist in the film. Typical film from this time era where at the end of every crime is a beautiful yet evil woman. The imaging at the end with the mirrors and the gun fight was beautifully directed and edited. Wells has much a baby face in this movie. It must have been hard to direct a movie where you are the main character and the film in centered around you. Wells character was not the most believable character for him, but he did it successfully. Wells framed each shot masterfully and took full advantage of the natural beauty of the location and accentuated each scene. As always he did a wonderful job!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shanghai showcases Welles' audacious style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drifter Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) rescues Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) from muggers in Central Park one night then accepts a job from her grateful husband to crew on their yacht. Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a very wealthy lawyer takes along his partner George Grisby on the voyage where an unsettling mood prevails. When they return Grisby offers O'Hara a large sum of money to take part in a deceptive scheme involving his feigned murder. O'Hara having fallen for Elsa fails to see the logic in the plan and he soon finds himself on trial for murder being defended by Arthur.After a rather improbable start, director Orson Welles' The Lady from Shanghai takes on a fascinating look unseen at a major studio in its day. Welles' mastery of the form is on display as he maintains suspense and keeps things deliberately murky with bravura camera angles while match cutting against the grain in a jarring and challenging style that reflects the New Wave a dozen years in advance. The problem is that purportedly the film had a two and a half hour running time and this engrossing avant garde imbalancing act around the editing may have as much to do with Columbia head Harry Cohn as it does Welles. There is no mistaking the expressionistic compositions, piercing close-ups and esoteric settings as anything other than Welles though and he saves the best for last with a climax in a fun house that is both inventively symbolic and wildly surreal.Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders as the scheming oily law partners are powerfully loathsome while a blonde Rita Hayworth as Bannister's wife is classic noir fatale. Welles adopting a charming Irish brogue narrates with philosophical wonderment as he tries to swim with these three sharks without being consumed.Cut by an hour The Lady from Shanghai suffers at times from continuity issues and poor plot structure but Welles technical skills and visual audacity more than make up for the gaps in this impressive suspenseful noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in my opinion, i think this is one of Orson Welles' best films, this highlight of 1940s film features a talented cast including Rita Hayworth at her most desirable. For what it was in its time, the most interesting part that was created was the mirrors scene at the carnival. Like most of Welles' Hollywood efforts, Shanghai also had some of the greatest set pieces, topped by the delirious shootout in the fun house hall of mirrors. all in all, The Lady from Shanghai (1948) is an imaginative, complicated, unsettling film, with fascinating visuals and tilting compositions, and of course luminous. anyone that is a fan of orson welles, i recommend that you see this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Lady From Shanghai" is not one of those movies that you can watch and then easily forget. It's beautiful camera work and imagery, that leads you through the stories endlessly twisting plot, seemed to stick my mind. The one scene that completely blew me away was brilliant fun house final finale, where the final shoot out happens, inside a maze of mirrors, creating an astonishingly avant-guarde and edgy work of art.There are certainly some things within the film that make it appear a bit less professional. Some of which are Welles' extremely thick Irish accent, which seems to come and go as it pleases, and its sometimes overly complicated sub-plots, All in all it is a wonderful and complex display of love, betrayal and murder and is yet another example of Orson Welles genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great narrative, but you won't see its value until watching it again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles knows how to take a person into a story and make it feel real as possible. The framing is done in a way to attract attention to the right things so that you can figure out bits of what is going on, but you can still get lost. Like Welles' other movie Citizen Kane, it uses lighting to create effects to draw the viewer in and keep them interested. The sound is good for the time. Orson Welles' narration of the story helps fill in gaps that would leave people even more clueless, but the narration seems to take away from the movie a bit which can be a bad thing, even in small doses.Orson Welles tries to do an Irish accent which is pretty decent. It's not great, but at least he doesn't overdo it like many actors. He slips back to his normal voice a few times, but he makes it mostly sound like the same voice.The movie's biggest flaw is that it has so many insane plot twists that are hard to prepare for that you have to watch it a second time to get the value you want from it. The first viewing is more like an investment for future entertainment. That isn't a good thing when it comes to movies, but the cinematography is good enough to keep the story interesting. That is probably what makes it worse because I couldn't stop watching it, but I was getting tired of it. It reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan's more insane movies which are full of too many plot twists. It reminds me more of the anime series Code Geass because both it and Lady From Shanghai can be hard to follow sometimes towards the end, but once every plot twist hurdle to crossed, there is only more room for enjoyment. They also both are interesting enough to enjoy, but not fully like one normal would with a story. This is the kind of movie that you love or hate.</fullReview>

The cinematography and the differentiating of the shots blended in well throughout the fast-paced film. The use of the natural lighting night and day shots and shadows were evenly contrasted well in the indoor and outdoor settings. The use of the montage scene juxtaposing Welles and his friends on a boat and the picnic scenes were shown well. The lighting isn't soft on the women and men in the film at all. The most interesting thing throughout the film were the various plot twists that kept the viewers guessing what was going to happen to the main actors at the end of the film.I would recommend this movie to anybody that's an Orson Welles fan or is interested in getting glued into suspenseful films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady From Shanghai (1947) is a great, somewhat unknown Orson Welles film. Although it is not regarded as one of his better films (it is often times regarded as his worst) there is a palpable story line and solid acting. The storyline of the film is at times quite confusing, but it is fairly understandable, tangible throughout. Having not seen many other Orson Welles films it is hard to compare, but The Lady of Shanghai seemed like a great film. The daring Welles took a confusing script and translated it very well to film. The acting is superb as are the many intricate shot sequences. One scene in particular stood out, the night scene with the Mexican picnic. I'm not sure whether or not it was filmed on location, but everything looked startlingly real. The night sky, the ocean, even the local Mexicans serving the food. Little things like this make a movie. Somehow Welles is able to create beautiful colors and moods on black and white film, something I've yet to see from anyone else (except maybe Murnau). It is remarkable how Welles can act so beautifully, and direct so fluidly at the same time. Overall The Lady from Shanghai is a great film, and a milestone for modern movie making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always try to watch a film with an eye toward its universal themes. If one looks too closely at this, it is just a bit hard to swallow, particularly the murder plot that is foisted on poor Mr. Welle's character. When the metaphor of the sharks is continuously put forth, we come to realize that these are not nice people. They are self centered, cruel, and lazy. They keep each other at arm's length. There is enough self pity to supply a tanker and they act out of it. With all that, it is a suspenseful film with interesting plot twists: the courtroom scene and the house of mirrors in particular. It is also filled with those expressionistic camera angles. Welles admits he is a fool right from the start, but, you might know it, there's a dame (Rita Hayworth) involved in his near destruction. Because he is such a rascal he goes along for the ride, though he hedges his bets several time before acting. Soon the merry go round of deceit starts to turn and all parties are caught in it. There are some great character actors in this film and some wonderful shots (It's too bad the Welles canon is so limited). See this because of its innovative strengths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Rita Hayworth's Best Roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its title, "The Lady from Shanghai" is not set in China. The title refers to the fact that the character played by Rita Hayworth is an exiled White Russian who grew up in China and spent time in the title city. (She was also to be cast as an Eastern European refugee in a later movie, "Fire Down Below"). Hayworth was normally a redhead with long flowing locks, but in this film her hair is cut short and dyed blonde.The story begins when Michael O'Hara, an Irish seaman, rescues the beautiful Elsa Bannister from three hooligans. (Confusingly, Michael also refers to Elsa as "Rosaleen"). Elsa introduces Michael to her husband Arthur, a famous criminal lawyer, who is planning to his yacht to San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Michael is persuaded to sign on as a member of the crew. On the voyage it becomes clear that the marriage of Elsa and Arthur is an unhappy one, and Elsa and Michael find themselves falling in love.The plot thickens when Bannister's law partner George Grisby joins them on the boat. Grisby makes Michael a bizarre proposal. Grisby wants to disappear and fake his own death in order to collect the insurance money. He offers Michael $5,000 to sign a false confession that he has killed Grisby. Grisby explains that the insurance company will accept this document as proof of his death, but as there would be no corpse, Michael cannot be convicted of murder. Michael agrees to this, intending to use the money to run away with Elsa. When, however, Grisby is murdered for real Michael finds himself on trial for his life.As with many films noirs, the plot is a complicated one. (Besides the ones mentioned above, there are several more twists in the plot). Indeed, at times the plot of "The Lady from Shanghai" is not just complicated but also confusing and illogical. (Michael's fake "confession" states that Grisby was killed when his gun went off accidentally, but it is still used as evidence at his trial for murder. Perhaps Welles felt that a manslaughter trial, with no possibility of a death sentence, would be insufficiently dramatic). Insufficient thought seems to have been given to the legal aspects in general, and the trial scene itself, with Counsel for the Defence being called to give evidence for the prosecution and then being allowed to cross-examine himself, would seem more at home in a farcical comedy than in a supposedly serious crime drama. Some of the weaknesses in the plot are due to the film's troubled production history; Welles' original cut of the movie was over 2? hours long, but the studio cut it savagely to little more than half that length.The film was directed by Orson Welles, who also stars as Michael. Rather surprisingly, Welles cast Hayworth as Elsa. The two were, of course, married, although by 1947 they had become estranged from one another and their marriage was to end in divorce the following year. It is, perhaps, therefore unsurprising that Welles does not bring a great deal of passion to his role, even though Michael is supposed to be obsessed with Elsa. (A similar situation had arisen with "Since You Went Away" three years earlier, when Robert Walker was cast as the love-interest of his estranged wife, Jennifer Jones).The film does, however, have its strengths as well as its weaknesses. Although in some of her earlier films such as "Cover Girl" Hayward had played sweet young girl-next-door types, by the late forties she had moved on to sultry femmes fatales. She had played her best-known role of this type in "Gilda" the previous year, and Elsa is another character in the same mould. This is one of her best roles, as well as one of her most sensuous, and she looks just as good as a blonde as she did as a redhead, although at the time her new look was not popular with her fans. Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders are also good as the sinister, leering Arthur Bannister and the equally sinister Grisby.The photography is attractive, in the stark black-and-white noir style, and there is one particularly famous scene, the almost surreal final shootout in the Hall of Mirrors. (Was this the inspiration for a similar scene at the end of the James Bond film "The Man with the Golden Gun?"). Throughout the film there is a strong sense of tension, of moral decay and of approaching menace. As with many films noirs, this is a film one watches less for the details of its plot than for its atmosphere. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welles' most underrated work? Welles' most unheard of work? Welles' worst work? Whatever you want to call it and apparently people did call it a failure when it first came out, The Lady From Shanghai is still a triumph in my opinion of a good story; suspense and just genuinely good fun. The film follows on from Orson's explosion into the world of film with 1941's Citizen Kane and then a few other films in-between that and this picture from 1947. The film adopts a film noir approach of down and out heroes, femme fatales, shadows, silhouettes and general criminal shenanigans. To say that it comes off in an impressive and entertaining fashion would be true.This was made at a time when noir was all the rage in Hollywood what with Double Indemnity, The Maltese Falcon and Sunset Blvd. all within several years of this film and although it hasn't quite gained the reputation nor the recognition since like those films have, it holds its own. Like most noirs, the film centres around a man who is just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Michael O'Hara (Welles) is a down and out (or perhaps he is just down) sailor who cannot get work but ends up embroiled in a murder plot when he does find work. As a character, he is big hearted but lacks the sense not to be manipulated and as a seaman, resembles an interesting substitute for a P.I. or an insurance salesman. The film carries a narrative that will see him in some tight situations as well as even appearing in court; a location I do not think is commonly associated with the genre of noir but it's here anyway.The film brilliantly sets up its situation and its priorities when the fatal woman of the genre in Elsa Bannister (Hayworth) seems unflinched and unbothered when O'Hara admits he has killed someone in the past. It is this statement that makes us realise he's done it before and it seems, he's unwitting enough to be tempted to be embroiled in it all over again. But as a reaction, Bannister is unmoved, perhaps even aroused when he first admits he has killed someone because there is a plan forming and it seems a perfect fall guy has just showed up. I do not put her reaction down to bad acting by Hayworth nor do I a poor script; if anything it is a fabulous hint at what is to come, narrative-wise.And so, O'Hara joins Bannister; her husband and a few others, one of whom is George Grisby (Anders) who comes up with a plan where his own death will be faked so he can leave this place and get away from it all. O'Hara seems like the perfect fall guy for this, too. As a space within a film, the boat acts as a perfect setting. The boat is small and very intimate; a perfect place for bonds to form between characters but between O'Hara and Bannister as well as between O'Hara and Grisby specifically. Perhaps the boat is acting as a metaphorical urban city; perhaps Welles has recognised genre convention and has manipulated them somewhat. The overall setting is actually one of a rural description. The backgrounds during the boat trip when the film is set in motion is jungle and beaches as they sail around Mexico and dock now and again ? this also acts as an impressive situ for the characters, a close and intimate place where people are never too far away from not wearing much and the scorching Mexican heat plays with the mind. O'Hara's bond with Mrs. Bannister intensifies somewhat.But along with the familiar tale of deception and crime within the narrative, we get some wonderful silhouettes and manipulation of light at an aquarium where O'Hara and Bannister meet up. Then there is the finale in the hall of mirrors in which the expressionistic reflections tower all over the place creating a dystopian setting in what is usually associated with fun and enjoyment: a hall or mirrors at a funfair. This juxtaposition is one of a few clever things Welles does in the film and despite being copied so many times in years to come, I wonder if the people mimicking it take into account things like the expressionism that the genre demands or the juxtaposing of the setting. Or do they just copy it because it looks good? Most of the time, I think the latter because it's been spoofed in productions that are not of the film-noir variety.So with the film embodying noir traits that fans of the genre love as well as it acting as a fascinating early piece from Welles, there isn't too much the film does wrong. The courtroom scenes feel a little out of place and are somewhat anti-climatic in their jovial nature but the fight scenes in the film are really well choreographed, especially at a time when Westerns sped their fight footage up or more drama. The Lady From Shanghai acts as an interesting and intriguing way to spend a film viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Everybody is somebody's fool"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In discussing the portfolio of Orson Welles, it's difficult not to detect a certain level of tragedy inherent throughout his career. Welles was very much a director who always did what he wanted, a behaviour that caused frequent clashes with anxious studio heads, and, owing to an approach to film-making that was ahead of its time, often translated to poor box-office receipts. Widely-celebrated masterpieces such as 'Citizen Kane (1941)', 'The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)' and 'Touch of Evil (1958)' took decades to achieve the reputation that they hold today, and each proved considerable disappointments for the studios responsible, leading to Welles' eventual departure from Hollywood, towards a European career that was fraught with constant financial difficulties. 'The Lady from Shanghai (1947),' likewise, wasn't a smashing success upon it's initial release, and, indeed, one might suggest that Welles did everything possible to ensure that it would fail at the box-office: he filled the screen with bizarre, unlikable characters, and effectively diluted the star-appeal of then-wife Rita Hayworth by shearing and dyeing her famous red hair.The first forty minutes of 'The Lady from Shanghai' left me relatively indifferent, in the sense that I had no idea where the story was heading, and couldn't understand the significance of the film's events to date. My reaction, apparently, differs little from that of Columbia Pictures President Harry Cohn, who couldn't decipher Welles' labyrinthian tale, and demanded that somebody explain it to him. The story itself was lifted from Sherwood King's novel, "If I Die Before I Wake," which was chosen practically at random. Welles had offered to adapt the book when Cohn gave him an urgently-needed $55,000 to finance costuming for his musical stage-show, "Around the World in Eighty Days." Filming for the film took place, in addition to the Columbia Pictures studios, in San Francisco and Acapulco, Mexico, aboard a yacht belonging to none other than Errol Flynn. Welles' original cut for the film ran 155 minutes, but, as occurred with tragic regularity through his career, the studio raised their scissors to his picture, slicing off at least an hour of footage.It is perhaps because of this studio interference that 'The Lady from Shanghai' cuts rather choppily from a thriller to a courtroom drama. The trial episode is played largely for satire, with Welles emphasising the blatant disorder of the courtroom, abound with constant interruptions from noisy audience members and sneezing jurors {one cut juxtaposes the judge playing chess with an aerial shot of the courtroom, suggesting that it's all just a perverted game}. Welles' inventive use of the camera is always a treat to observe; in one sequence, as Michael (Welles) speaks with George (Glenn Anders) atop an ocean lookout, the downwards-angled camera dangles the two characters over a fatal precipice. The film's climax is absolutely unforgettable, a gripping and innovative shoot-out in a carnival house of mirrors. As each character blasts away at illusory images of their enemies, the bullets shatter their own reflected profiles, fulfilling Michael's foreshadowing anecdote that compares Elsa (Hayworth) and Arthur (Everett Sloane) to sharks gnawing feverishly at their own flesh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1947 film stars and was directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair. So, I've hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well, she does a superb job playing the frightened/cagey Elsa, married to a crippled millionaire lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her, she doesn't know if she can live without the things money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and his partner bicker and bite, just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun, which borrowed heavily from this scene). I wasn't sure who the murderer was until the end.This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon. The dish centers on the sea, it is subtle, sour, and pungent, all to great effect. These might not be the best, fresh shrimp, but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco. The flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy, but filling alternative to more mundane, common fare. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my two or three all-time favorite movies. It just blew me away the first time I saw it. The more times I've seen it, the more it seems to me ahead of its time. It is very much like a Coen Brothers film: the weird supporting characters; the oddball, often non-sequitur dialogue, the brilliant visuals, and the abundant lawyer-bashing, which I'm not sure was in vogue in 1946. (Yeah, I know this was released in '48, but it was made in '46.) You may have to watch this a few times, just to understand what's really going on in the plot, but it is well worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This is going to be murder, and it's going to be legal."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your noir with a little Latin beat, this could be right up your alley. The title is a bit of a misnomer though, since 'The Lady', Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) wasn't from Shanghai, she just happened to be there once. If I hadn't heard all the caveats from the reviewer who introduced the picture on Turner Classics, I wouldn't have considered it to be a 'flawed' picture. Apparently producer Harry Cohn who financed the thing had a lot of problems with the finished film, and had Orson Welles re-shoot a lot of the scenes with Hayworth to feature her glamorous side, hence all the steamy close-ups. Welles was married to Hayworth at the time even though the marriage was kaput, so watching both of them get passionate on screen must have been a real exercise in acting effort.You might need to catch the story a couple of times to figure out the murder plot, but it's all spelled out by the principals - Grisby (Glenn Anders) killed Broome (Ted de Corsia) when Broome discovered the plan to kill Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) and frame Michael (Welles) for the murder. Elsa (Hayworth) killed Grisby once she knew Michael had written the confession, but that left her husband still alive to represent Michael as the world's greatest criminal attorney. The fun house mirror maze would have worked out fine for Elsa if she and Arthur hadn't shot each other, but I guess you can't have everything.The schlub in the story was Michael, but he knew that all along. He inadvertently managed to follow the premise he offered at the start of the picture - "One who follows his nature keeps his original nature in the end". Apparently so did all the rest, managing to fulfill their nature as sharks, mad with their own blood.</fullReview>

The Chronicles of Hollywood feature when Welles wanted money to start a play, decided to call Harry Cohn, owner of Columbia, offering a movie. When Cohn asked, Welles was given the title of a novel cheaper than he found at the kiosk, and vulgar materials that came one of the most fascinating films Noir Cinema, when he finished his stormy marriage to Rita Hayworth.With this masterpiece Welles started his pilgrimage through Europe in order to make the film he wanted, and not return to Hollywood until ten years later to shoot the spectacular film "Touch of Evil".The mythical "Gilda" performed here her first role in "Femme Fatale". Unlike remembered character, the evil of "Elsa Bannister" is not apparent, but the only way to survive in this ruthless world that show, Rita Hayworth make a high performance, full of nuance, but always covered by an evil that not abandon in the moments of love, but yet so fascinating that always leaves the viewer uneasy.The final image that closes the film happened to justice to the history of cinema to be a fascinating and complex sequence in game appearance and reality, but of wickedness increased to infinity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The problem is the script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film contains great acting, beautiful photography, and a finale that, as a set piece, may stand as one of the greatest in the history of film. Yet the film is marred by a silly and incoherent script that makes the plot alternately laughable and unintelligible. Consider the following plot flaws:1) Grisby approaches Michael O'Hara and offers him $5000 to sign a written confession to having killed Grisby, whereupon Grisby will disappear. Grisby explains that his motive is to collect on the partnership insurance that he and Bannister have on each other. Grisby explains to O'Hara that he needn't worry about being convicted of murder because no one can be convicted without a body being found.There are several flaws in this. First of all, if Grisby were to be considered dead, the beneficiary of the partnership insurance would be Bannister, not Grisby. How could Grisby collect on his own death? What insurance company would write a check to a dead man? Moreover, why would O'Hara sign a confession to a murder when Grisby is definitely wrong when he says that someone can't be convicted of murder without a body? In fact there have been many murder convictions where a body was never found. Moreover, a written confession is tantamount to a guilty plea and could easily result in a conviction.2) Eventually Grisby is actually murdered and O'Hara is charged with the crime. It becomes apparent that he is being framed. We are obviously meant to suspect Bannister of the murder, his motive being to collect on the partnership insurance. But it turns out that his wife, who had had an infatuation with O'Hara, was the actual killer. But why? Surely not to enable her husband to collect on the partner insurance. If she wanted to get rich from a murder, wouldn't it have been far more profitable for her to kill her husband so that she could inherit his entire estate?3) It is unclear whether Mr. and Mrs. Bannister had been plotting to kill Grisby and to frame O'Hara for the murder right from the beginning. Was this why they were so eager to bring O'Hara into their employ so early in the film? If so, this would imply that Bannister was actually complicit in Grisby's killing and that it wasn't just the act of his wife.This plot has more holes that a hunk of Swiss cheese. I could cite many more, but I'll stop here. There are many positive aspects to this film, but overall it's a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film noir at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Orson Welles. What a filmmaker. He has gone down in history as one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived, and his mastery of the film-noir genre proves it. The Lady from Shanghai is a smaller production without a lot of the revolutionary glam that his films like Citizen Kane or Touch of Evil had, but that doesn't mean it isn't a film well worth watching. In it, Welles plays Michael O'Hara, a seaman who is hired to work on Arthur Bannister's yacht after saving Mr. Bannister's wife from danger. O'Hara discovers that joining this yachting crew has given him a lot more than he bargained for when he gets involved in a complex and bizarre murder plot. O'Hara is displayed as the stoic modernist hero who is flawed, yet pure of heart and has the best intentions. The mystery that unfolds around him is fascinating and the film grows more and more intriguing as it grows into a great film-noir classic.A talent like Welles' is something that doesn't come around very often. The man could write, direct, and act incredibly well and all this shows in The Lady from Shanghai. Welles has created such an intriguing story in this film and while it might not be of the same epic scale as Citizen Kane, it still deserves a lot of recognition on its own merit. Welles fills his exciting story with some great characters who deliver articulate and punchy dialouge that chills, humors, and excites. This is simply just one of those films where after watching, you don't feel like it could have been made any better. It might not be picture perfect, but for what the film has to offer you couldn't ask for much more.Welles also proves his masterful eye for direction here. His direction never intrudes where characters and story development are more important, but it keeps a certain suspenseful life in the film. But where his creative eye really shines is in the final showdown of the film. I won't describe it in detail so as to not give away important plot points, but what I will say is that it involves three people in a hall of mirrors at an amusement park. A shootout takes place in this twisted hall of mirrors, and it makes for a surreal and nauseating mind trip. The scene is so mind bending and I don't know where you could see anything like it in the 1940's. It is probably the highlight of The Lady from Shanghai, and it is well worth the wait.There just aren't two ways about it. This is a great film. It's certainly not the film that a man like Orson Welles is remembered for or ever will be remembered for, but it is not worth missing. It is a great look into the masterful workings of Orson Welles and it gives us a taste of why Welles is considered such a legend today. There are so many film-noir films out there so it is easy to miss The Lady from Shanghai, but I advise against it. If you are a fan of film-noir or Orson Welles, this is a great watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The suspense of this film made it enjoyable. It was surreal to see who the actual murder was at the end. It was very unexpected that is would be Mrs. Bannister. All she ever really wanted was money.It is interesting to see how films from the late 40s and 50s seem to have many women in charge and showing independence. Mrs. Bannister for one really owned and manipulated everyone she came in contact with.I fully enjoyed the acting job by Orson Welles. It was clear to see how passionate he truly was about making this film. His Irish accent was very good. I loved the ending when he just walked away from the carnival, listening to Mrs. Bannister cry for life. Even though he narrates saying how he never knows if he will truly forget about her; leaving her laying there was enough to show that he had overcome her games. It was a very powerful and mysterious ending. I definitely think one would benefit from watching this film more than once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story revolves around Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) who finds a job working as crew on Arthur Bannister's yacht currently sailing towards San Francisco. On the way they pick up Arthur's business partner Grisby. Bannister's wife Rosalie (Rita Hayworth) takes a liking to Michael and decides in her mind that she loves him more than her own husband Bannister. The yacht reaches it's destination and soon enough a plan to fake Grisby's death comes about so he can take off. Turns out that Michael only wants the $5,000 so he can run off with Bannister's wife Rosalie who he has fallen in love with. Things take a terrible and odd turn and Grisby turns up actually dead and Michael takes the blame. The story from that point on is unclear as to who did it and whi it happened but it makes for an interesting ending to an interesting film.A really great film, Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth have great chemistry. The filming style was great, really great lighting of characters and overall a really clear setup. Great film, would definitely watch again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Orson Welles. I love everything he did. The Trial, Citizen Kane, F for Fake. This was a man far ahead of his time. I know that's the clich they use to describe Welles but that doesn't make it any less true. This film is a great thriller, it doesn't feel like a film noir. It doesn't feel like it belongs to one single genre. It is a suspense film but its shot like a glossy romance movie from the 30s but it has an odd undercurrent flowing through it. There's always something off, with characters and their actions, the music, the camera angles. I mean this in the best way possible. Everything just feels odd, there is a scene where Welles is called to meet with someone on a beach. Instead of him walking off camera or just cutting, he walks straight forward through the water to the people he has to meet with. It doesn't seem like much but it just felt strange. Again I mean strange in a good way. This was a film that was trying to be different but it doesn't feel forced at all. Some of the acting is over the top in this but you get used to it. That hall of mirrors sequence must have blown some minds back in the day</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rita Hayworth gets the same treatment given to Barbara Stanwyck in "Double Indemnity" (1944) in this audacious noir entry from Orson Welles. Fitted out with platinum blonde hair and a heart chiseled from a block of ice, Hayworth is the femme fatale and Welles the object of her malice. The plot is nearly impossible to follow, or at least it was for me on a first viewing. But this is Orson Welles, folks, so the focus should be on the dazzling style, which is highly steeped in German Expressionism. Canted angles, disorienting reflections, whirligig music -- it's all here, the aural and visual equivalent of the funhouse that serves as the setting for the film's unforgettable climax.For Woody Allen fans: this is the movie Allen pays homage to at the end of "Manhattan Murder Mystery."

		<shortDescription>Cold and Deliberately Distancing, but Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's begin by clearing away the underbrush. If you know the hardboiled/noir genre, nothing you see here will surprise you. The plot twists will be targeted a mile or so back, and you'll know the ultimate villain long before Welles coughs it up.The movie is also distancing -- deliberately so, I think. The plot twists are increasingly off-the-cuff and unbelievable (Rita Hayworth has Chinese henchmen at her disposal?), the heavy-handed absurdity gets increasingly heavy-handed (I do not much care for the famed "hall of mirrors" sequence, which strikes me as avante-gardey fooling around at it's lowest level), the parade of grotesques is unbelievable, outside of some location shooting the whole thing is very stagey. Etc.So I don't think it works as a crime movie at all. It is interesting as an examination of Welles's themes, most particularly slow corruption and what evil does to the soul. The voyage sequence, in particular, is mostly well done, with some interesting speeches on this subject worth hearing. Also, the movie is generally well-acted: Welles in particular is surprisingly good as the roughneck seaman.So, no TOUCH OF EVIL, but okay in it's own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dangerously close to a precipitous drop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite loving Rita Hayworth, finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler "symbolic" aspects of the cinematography, The Lady from Shanghai didn't quite work for me. I had a problem with most of the performances, the script and the overall structure. And in a film that's mostly people talking with each other in various situations, that's quite a problem. The Lady from Shanghai ended up at a very low "C", or a 7, for me.The Lady from Shanghai is really all about Orson Welles' character, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara sees Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park on a carriage ride and hits on her. Later, he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him. O'Hara is a seaman from Ireland and the globetrotting Elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband, Arthur (Everett Sloane), a very famous and powerful California defense attorney. They talk O'Hara into working for them, despite his initial reservations--it seems to him, and to the audience, that Elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with, and O'Hara doesn't want to get involved.Shortly after going to work on their yacht, a strange man, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), who says he's Arthur's partner, shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble. Eventually, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme. Foolishly, O'Hara agrees. Naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble, and eventually, a number of mysteries are revealed.Maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that, so far, I'm not exactly a huge fan of Orson Welles, and here, he produces, writes, directs and consumes most of the screen time. I haven't seen anywhere near the majority of Welles' work yet, but I've tended to like his later films better, when he became a bit more campy and performance-arty. I love F for Fake (Vrits et mensonges, 1974) for example, and I even kind of like his performance in Casino Royale (1967), when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table, but Citizen Kane (1941) never did much for me, despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years (including about one year ago; my rating was a low 7--the same as my current score for The Lady from Shanghai).Welles' performance and the dialogue he's written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me. He's a bit of a motormouth, a bit of a boor, and a bit monotone--he tends to sound like he's reading. His performance reminded me of what I've seen of Welles' version of Moby Dick (listed on IMDb as 1999, but "completed" in 1971, it can also be seen in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995)), where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he's inherently, sublimely dramatic. I'm also someone who almost never complains about accents, but somehow Welles manages to make his Irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me, too.As for the other performances, I can only say I thought Hayworth did an excellent job. Of course she's gorgeous, which doesn't hurt. Plenty of eye candy here. Like Welles, Sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me--I never quite bought his character, his handicap and so on, and Anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn't seem to fit. Welles often shoots him in close-up and Anders almost always has some over-exaggerated, manic expression on his sweaty face.Structurally, The Lady from Shanghai is very uneven. The first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap-operatic, although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique. Once Grisby introduces his scheme, things pick up a bit, and mostly improve as we near the end. But by the time The Lady from Shanghai becomes a crime/mystery film, it's too little too late, and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden, thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence.The ending is more action-oriented, less-dialogue heavy, more varied and exotic in settings, and at times, fairly abstract. Welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director. If The Lady from Shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime/mystery stuff and the arty ending, it could have easily been at least a 9. The final scenes are easily 10s, as Welles shifts from a Hitchcockian suspense scene in a San Francisco Chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a Chinese amusement park. The funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time. It's well integrated with the script, as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism.The cinematography throughout is interesting, even if it usually can't make up for the problems in the foreground. Welles blocks scenes with skill. There are lots of attractively filmed settings, from Central Park to Acapulco to various San Francisco locations. Welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action, from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of Acapulco to the maze-like Caribbean streets, the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the San Francisco Aquarium, and so on. The romance material, for which the Aquarium serves as one backdrop, is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film, but on the other hand, that makes the romance never quite work as romance.Surely serious Welles fans will appreciate The Lady from Shanghai much more than I did, and of course it's worth a watch if you love Rita Hayworth. The Lady from Shanghai isn't exactly a terrible film, in my view, but it's dangerously close to not "passing". Proceed with caution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>some vintage Welles that ultimately disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very hard to say just what was going on with "The Lady from Shanghai" and what the film could have been without studio interference. Orson Welles' prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater; indeed, funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs. He made "Lady from Shanghai" for his soon to be ex-wife, Rita Hayworth. Harry Cohn was fearful for Rita's image and held back the release of this movie for one year.The plot concerns an Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara, who falls in love with Else (Hayworth, stunning with short blond hair). Her husband is a well known criminal attorney Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) who is as crippled on the inside as he is out. He hires O'Hara to work on his yacht, and there O'Hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and deceit."The Lady from Shanghai" moves at a snail's pace, though I agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot. Still, this movie drags. The scene in the fun house is fantastic - Welles wanted it without music, though, and I believe the studio cut it down. It's a shame. The photography throughout is stunning, atmospheric, bold, and very stylish.Welles was an excellent actor, handsome in his youth, charismatic and possessing a magnificent voice and technique, but in many films, it's almost as if he doesn't trust himself or doesn't take the time to develop a character. Instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses. One of the only times he didn't do this was "Tomorrow is Forever," where the director gets an excellent, deeply felt performance out of him. Contrast that with "Compulsion" where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance. Here Welles is doing quadruple duty - as director, star, co-writer and narrator. Sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization. Nevertheless, he is always compelling.The supporting players are excellent, including Sloan and Glenn Anders. Hayworth, gorgeous and soft-voiced (her singing was again dubbed by Anita Ellis) is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences. What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty.Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing, and "The Lady from Shanghai" is no exception. But this one leaves the viewer frustrated, as does "The Magnificent Ambersons" - as does any work that Welles did within the studio system. He was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign; he wasn't. He was a strange dichotomy - he needed more freedom, but as is evidenced by some of his later work, he needed the structure of the studio. Alas, he couldn't have both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And yet, despite the flaws mentioned in my summary heading, it keeps you watching until the fateful climax in the Hall of Mirrors. But along the way there are some real problems.First of all, Orson Welles' Irish accent is not only distracting but often hard to understand. And whoever did the dubbing did a poor job of it. Likewise, Rita Hayworth delivers many of her lines barely above a whisper with background music making her dialog unclear. This is particularly true in the aquarium scene.Secondly, the editing is clumsy. Obviously the film was longer than its present length and the cutting shows. Who is to blame for this? Is this another case where Welles had no control over the release print?Thirdly, Welles himself is miscast as the Irish seafarer. He is never even the least bit convincing and there is no actual chemistry between him and Hayworth. Too bad Glenn Ford wasn't offered the part.The convoluted plot makes THE BIG SLEEP look like child's play.Rita Hayworth is excellent as the femme fatale wife of Everett Sloane, who gives a brilliant performance. Glenn Anders does a marvelous job as the creepy Grisby. The story is a tale of deceit and murder with Welles being used as a pawn--and the ending is a highly effective one in which Hayworth really shows herself a fine actress. And incidentally, Rita Hayworth is given some of the most ravishing close-ups of her career and looks great with cropped blonde hair.But it's too bad the murkiness of the plot and the choppy editing have made this somewhat implausible story seem to be much ado about nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting the 'Fun' in Fun-house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Thanks to user-reviewer Narrator_Jack_dot_com ("Orson's Corrections", Narrator_Jack_dot_com from United States, 21 February 2006) for providing an excerpt on the famous memo from Orson Welles to Harry Cohn.*** "Lady from Shanghai" (1948, Orson Welles&#xfeff;), a shark-infested Film noir&#xfeff;&#xfeff;, is a perennial art-house favorite. On the big screen it is a rare visual feast, with Welles' trademark off-kilter and gorgeously chaotic direction elevating it far beyond its weaknesses. The film's most famous sequence, the much-imitated, never-surpassed Fun-house Mirror Scene near the conclusion is one of the greatest scenes in cinema. Still, nagging questions remain, and not just with the sketchy plot. Chief among them is how good would "Shanghai" have been if Orson Welles had creative control? Welles disagreed with many modifications that were introduced by Harry Cohn&#xfeff; and Columbia Studio. His chief complaints were with the audio. Welles objected to the repetitious music which appears throughout, as well as the obvious (i.e., "Disney") musical effects. Welles wanted the Fun-house scene to be silent and the swimming scene to have more ambient sound. Cohn also insisted on adding a singing scene for Rita Hayworth&#xfeff;. Welles wrote a famous 15-page memo to Cohn arguing his points. Welles's suggestions were completely ignored. In Cohn's defense, the singing scene works. Also, the consistent music perhaps adds necessary balance to the unusual visuals.How Welles came to make the deal with Cohn is worth retelling. In 1946, Welles is simultaneously personally bankrupt as well as desperately trying to keep a Mercury Theater production of "Around the World in 80 Days" afloat. He is informed by a creditor that he has two hours to raise $55K or shut the production down. At a bookstore, Welles finds a copy of "If I Die Before I Wake" by Sherwood King, which he has not read, and calls Harry Cohn, pitching it to the studio boss enthusiastically. Cohn wires Welles the advance that saves the theatrical production. Welles subsequently reads the book and learns how implausible the story is.Despite the film's duality (with the audio reflecting the studio's wishes and the visuals from Welles), the finished product is one of the best film noirs in the genre. The cast is solid. Welles is the standout; however, his' portrayal of an Irish commoner (seaman Michael O'Hara) receives mixed reviews. (Perhaps this stems from our lofty expectations of his talent, or the dim-wittiness of O'Hara. Welles also isn't very convincing in his fight scenes.) Welles casts his estranged wife (Rita Hayworth) in the eponymous role in the hopes of preserving their marriage. (They divorced soon after the film's release.) Welles had her famously red hair dyed blond, to the displeasure of many of her fans. BTW, Hayworth is very good; she makes her unbelievable character seem possible.Glenn Anders is George Grisby, the nervy-eyed law partner of the sinister Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane). Grisby is very strange throughout and contributes strongly to the quirky feel of "Shanghai" as noted by other reviewers. As a nationally famous trial attorney, Arthur Bannister has to be charismatic, and Sloane is up to the task. The trial scene is at times painfully farcical. However, I really love Bannister's dialog with his client O'Hara; this moment is very memorable.While "Shanghai" has crazy plot turns it is splendorous to take in, especially in a theater. Local cinephiles should lead a horse-drawn carriage in the direction of the revival theater screening it to watch it all over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, highly problematic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times, The Lady from Shanghai reads like art, unexpected and challenging. At times it reads like literature, with fascinating characters and some lovely dialogue. And at times it's just a big 'ol mess.I learned a lot about why it became a mess through wikipedia, but first I'll talk about the finished product.The movie begins pretty well, introducing a charming sailor who meets a striking beauty. While some people feel voice-over narration is inherently a bad idea, I don't, and at first the movie handled that aspect well, as Welles waxed poetic on his fate.For perhaps the first third, the movie is pretty solid. It introduces two more fascinating characters, the brilliant lawyer Arthur Bannister, played with a civilized veneer over animal barbarity by Everett Sloane, and the fantastically creepy George Grisby, played effectively by the otherwise obscure Glenn Anders. The movie is well paced and engaging, with a poetry to its dialogue (such as the sailor's memorable description of shark fishing). Much of the cinematography is striking.Yet, the movie's problems were already becoming apparent. First off, that narration became increasingly oppressive. The sailor's constant foreshadowing seemed designed to suck out the suspense. Scenes and motivations were becoming unclear.Then there were some oddities in the filmmaking. A scene between Welles and Anders is a particularly good example; there conversation was frequently interrupted by a close-up of one of them that would feeling jarring and out of place, as though it was just cut in without a sense of rhythm. As the movie progressed, muddled plotting, unlikely events, confused scenes, and constant narration made a hash of the movie. And yet, there were still brilliant scenes. The courtroom sequence is brilliant; a chaotic mess of sneezing, cross talk and unruly observers. There is a fascinating scene in a Chinese theater, and the final fun-house sequence is justifiably famous.How could an film artist as brilliant as Welles fumble so badly through so much of the film? According to wikipedia; he didn't stumble, he was pushed. Columbia Picture's president Harry Cohn didn't like Welles' final edit, and decided to cut an hour out of it and have assistants do extensive re-shoots. Welles wanted a documentary feel, so he avoided close-ups, but Cohn didn't like that. All those jarring, out-of-rhythm shots were actually shot by assistant directors and edited in by hacks. The narration had to cover an hour of material missing from the film. Cohn apparently found the original movie confusing, and perhaps it was, but it's unlikely it was any more confusing than the final result, and I'm certain it would have been a much better movie if left alone.The greatest tragedy is that Welles' brilliant fun house ending was originally going to be 20 minutes long, and was cut down to three. That is heartbreaking.In spite of Cohn destroying what could well have been one of the greatest film noirs of its time, there is enough of Welles' brilliance shining through to make this worth seeing. But then, Welles' films are always worth seeing for the inevitable brilliant bits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One fun house climax does not a classic make, and as an insurance scam film noir, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI cannot hold a candle to DOUBLE INDEMNITY. As a dark thriller featuring a limping schemer, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI would be lucky to carry THE USUAL SUSPECT's water. As an "essential" movie directed by Orson Welles, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI not only falls woefully short of CITIZEN KANE's standard, but doesn't even measure up to the butchered existing version of THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. Welles' costar--the title character of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI--Rita Hayworth said, "it's too hard, living with a genius," and divorced her husband\writer\director Orson shortly after they had finished making this flick. Though the finale of THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is admittedly a Wowzer, you may gain a new respect for the endurance powers of Rita Hayworth if you're able to follow along for the full 87 minutes of this genius at work in THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Orson &amp; Harry: The Final Cut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I'll pay a thousand dollars to anyone who can explain the story to me."- Harry Cohn*, head of Columbia Pictures, on THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI. In Frank Brady's fine biography of the celebrated actor/director/writer/producer, *CITIZEN WELLES, we discover that Harry Cohn was in such awe of Orson Welles' talent and was so desperate to make a movie with him, that he nearly gave Welles full autonomy: the aforementioned writing, directing, producing, and starring acting role. But Cohn did withhold one very important element which many if not most filmmakers seek: the final decision on editing. More than a year after THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI was in the can waiting for release Cohn railed against the director for cost overruns, for what Cohn felt was an incoherent mess of a movie, and, most vehemently, for tampering with Rita Hayworth's image (Welles cut and dyed blond Rita's dark tresses). It was a tough shoot for Orson: constant delays, script changes, killer Mexican heat, plus one added burden: the breakup of his marriage to the film's female star. Ultimately,Cohn dumped the film as a second feature where it bombed financially. The film itself? With its theme of pervasive corruption threatening a stalwart if highly unaware protagonist, LADY is an uneven prototype for Welles' fully realized noir masterwork, TOUCH OF EVIL (1958). Both films share a nightmare quality; there is constant dislocation and disorientation in each work. Both films take on an atmosphere of cramped delirium, magnified by crude allusions and nefarious deeds which slip in and out of the deep physical and psychological shadows. And both films exhibit murder as an almost preordained fate. Again, LADY's major flaw is a rambling story structure, underscored by poor editing (Cohn and a studio editor pieced the film together!). But there are great performances, with Everett Sloan's Arthur Bannister throwing his nasty Kane-like weight around, albeit on crutches, and especially Glenn Anders' sweaty, quietly obscene malefactor, Grisby, a fascinatingly distasteful cretin who sets the skin to crawling. Orson labors hard in his role of Michael O'Hara. I found his cartoon brogue entertaining. But while the accent may be overdone, wouldn't it be in a nightmare?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles reportedly once told Peter Bogdanovich that he(Welles) will likely only be appreciated once he is dead. And so it seems was the case with "The Lady From Shanghai", considered a flop in Hollywood at the time of release. Today however, decades later it is considered by many to be a masterpiece and a highly influential work of film noir.To be completely fair when I first saw the movie during my more formative years I didn't much care for it. I liked the look of the movie, interesting shots with Welles' fingerprints all over them. But it was more recently with subsequent viewings that the movie truly began to shine for me.This is yet another example of how studio interference can ruin a good film. Orson Welles and studio boss Harry Cohn were at constant odds with one another about nearly everything. The story, the running time, the location shoots, the fact that Welles made Rita Hayworth cut her signature crimson locks and die her hair platinum blonde, production overruns, budget and the score.I would truly love to see the "director's cut" as I suspect that it would be fantastic, but sadly it is lost to us forever. Harry Cohn cut nearly an hour of footage from the version that Welles submitted, 155 minutes was reduced to just about 87 minutes - one can just imagine what could have been. The single largest point for Welles was the score. He just hated the music and wrote an extensive memo to Cohn about how it can be fixed and why, every single point on the memo was ignored. And viewing the movie with these points in mind you can clearly see that Orson was right too.Rita Hayworth simply steals the show, her performance as the consummate femme fatale with a shady past and sinister motives is enchanting, and I maintain that Welles did her a great service in the way he lit and shot her scenes(overall and not just the close-ups that were inserted on Harry Cohn's insistence). The movie also delivers some very memorable scenes. The Chinese theater sequence, the fun-house mirror finale and the shark speech at the picnic. The latter remains both chilling and relevant to this day.The movie also has one of my favourite closing lines of all time in Michael O'Hara's(Orson Welles)epilogue.Apart from the music that was misapplied the dialog and acting both tend to fade between brilliant and hammy at times. The movie was brilliantly shot though and is simply a pleasure to view, and so inconsistency is the real problem that seems to plague "The Lady Form Shanghai" and keeps it from being a true masterwork. Had the original cut survived and the sound issues been addressed, who knows? To bring this laboursome review to a point. The Lady from Shanghai is a great story told with style. It certainly does have issues and is not without fault but stands as a must see movie for anyone even remotely interested in the Film Noir genre.</fullReview>

It says she is from Shanghai...but she is clearly WHITE! And don't trust her either, period. She betrayed Orson like a scumbag. She was only faithful to the money and to the noir genre. She broke my heart. Orson Welles looks like this guy I used to know. So the movie delighted me with whole lot of nostalgia. There's some wisdom in this movie. The thing about the people having edges is some true philosophy. I learned a lot from this film and I others did too. Camera work is delightful and the ending scene with the mirrors is filmed fantastically. How did they do that? It's like Enter the Dragon but better. I bid you goodnight.</fullReview>

Although I enjoyed how in the end you find out how women have the power over the men, I did not think it showed verisimilitude. I don't believe that one women can make all those men so crazy and stupid. I wish that there were subtitles when there were people speaking Chinese. Some of those parts seemed important. For instance when Elsa was on the phone with a china man when she was hiding Michael in the theater. The narration of the story was good. I like how you were in Michael's head the entire time even though what he was thinking was not very smart. My favorite scene was then ending in the funny house. I can only imagine waking up there and thinking that it was real. The shootout in the mirror room was classic and the ending of the movie was good.

		<fullReview>Lady from Shanghai, The (1947) *** (out of 4) According to legend this film originally ran 155-minutes but was hacked down by Columbia to the present 87-minutes. If so, that might explain the narration as well as other items that just never add up. The film has a sailor (Orson Welles) meeting a beautiful blonde (Rita Hayworth) who he quickly falls for but she informs him that she's married to another man (Everett Sloane). This doesn't stop the sailor from taking a job on board the man's yacht where he continues to see his wife as well as get offered a second job by a man (Glenn Anders) who wants himself killed but only with a twist. Since Welles became a legend there have been so many myths out there so I'm not sure if I believe this film actually ran over an hour longer. I'm sure stuff was cut out and we know the music score was altered but even with these changes we're left with a pretty good movie. I'll be the first to admit that the story makes very little sense but that actually doesn't take away from the film too much as the cast is so great and the style is so amazing that you can overlook the issues with the story. Welles and Hayworth make for an excellent team as the two have a great chemistry and the sexual innuendo is right there in front of our eyes. Apparently there was a lot of controversy with Hayworth dying her hair but I found her to be very beautiful here and Welles camera certainly captures every inch of her body and makes her look incredible (just check out the sequence with her on the rock). Sloane is very good in his role as well as really comes off as nutty as the character calls for. Anders is certainly one of the strangest characters to step foot in a film-noir, which says quite a bit considering how many weird characters the genre has seen. The cinematography is wonderful as we get all sorts of great shots and some wonderful pans. The scene between Welles and Hayworth on the horse buggy is wonderfully done and the legendary scene with the mirrors still packs a great punch. The plot twist when Welles knows he's in trouble and how it's shown to us is another very memorable sequence. Flaws and all, this is still an impressive film that manages to have some nice tension as well as some great performances. The real star is without question the atmosphere created by Welles.</fullReview>

There is a lot going on in this film so I think in order to get the full message of it, it must be watched a few times. You miss a lot only watching it once and later on I will go back and watch it again. The acting in the film is very well done especially when Michael rescues Elsa in Central Park from the 3 people attacking their coach. This is the first movie I had seen with Rita Hayworth in it, it reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption because of the poster of her in it. After I watched the film I read that Hayworth and Welles were dating, this probably helped the chemistry they had while filming the movie. I recommend watching this movie before Citzen Kane because I was very disappointed when watching this and got sick of it fairly easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Orson Welles has done it again. For $50,000 and a promise to Columbia to direct a book with a different title, he was able to save the costumes for his "Around the World in 80 Days" theater performance as well as give us another butchered masterpiece. Being a relative "newbie" to Welles, one always argues that "Citizen Kane" remains his magnum opus, but after watching "The Magnificent Ambersons" (a stronger, more genuine film) and now, "The Lady from Shanghai", the argument seems a bit too one-sided. Welles is a powerful director, a decent actor, and a detailed storyteller; one doesn't need to argue that all day. Yet, it is impressive that he is known only as a one-film man, when everything else watched has continued to get stronger and stronger. "Magnificent Ambersons" proved that he could tackle the family drama as well as a social commentary on the wealthy, and with "Shanghai" he proves that he can transform a movie star from pin-up girl to sadistic lover. Part noir, part travelogue, part confusion, "Shanghai" was an experience all within itself. Harry Cohen, head of Columbia, has stated that if anyone could tell him what this film was about, he would pay $1000. That speaks volumes about the ability that Welles had to construct an intelligent, gripping noir. "Shanghai" is about love, it is about revenge, is about mirrors, and it is about the law ? all brought together in a way only Orson Welles could do it.Originally two and a half hours, the version viewed was under 90-minutes, meaning quite a bit of Welles vision was lost in the editing room. One even hears stories that his original score was cut and replaced with cartoon music and constant repetition of the theme song. It would be hard to imagine what Welles' original vision would have produced, but even with his missing elements ? "Shanghai" proves thought-provoking, entertaining, and downright diabolical. It begins with two actors, Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles, together in a park, learning that even the most beautiful women come with baggage and history. From the very bizarre car park sequence, we soon get the impression that this isn't going to be your normal film. Welles pulls you in with the unknown, and unique characters. His portrayal of Michael O'Hara is possibly the weakest element to this film, as his accent fades in and out of existence with each scene. Welles is good as an actor, but adding the Irish element to his voice diminished the ability to truly believe who he was meant to be. On the other hand, Rita Hayworth was phenomenal. Her transformation in this film could be likened to a modern day Theron's "Monster" or Swank's "Boys Don't Cry", shedding her long red hair for a short platinum look. She was not only impressive physically, but as mysterious as noir women come. From the opening scene, she is always someone she is not ? and when Glenn Anders looks at her from his binoculars several scenes later ? it is as if Welles is saying, we all need to be watching her. Up until the final moments, we don't know where her loyalties remain, and that speaks value of both the director and the actor.With Hayworth giving her best, Welles taking strides behind the camera (not quite in front of), the other one to watch is Everett Sloane, who plays the handicapped Arthur Bannister. Welles gives Sloane this meaty character who drinks, worries, plans, and is the best lawyer in town ? yet has this crippling physical attribute which creates this darker, more diabolical character. Sloane was my favorite character in this film, because, like Hayworth, we were never quite sure what his next play was, or who he was doing this all for. With "Shanghai" Welles has crafted this amazing noir that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, impressively shot, and delivers an ending that remains a cult favorite ? attempted to be recreated time and time again, but always lacks that panache only Welles could film.This is a character driven film, and despite my flimsy nature on Welles the actor, the other background characters have enough heart to carry what he lacks. The power of Hayworth, Sloane, and Anders alone is worth watching. Who are these guys? How did they choose O'Hara? Why be so elaborate? The twist and turns continue to come, and "Shanghai" has that repeatable feel that your DVD player will love. I cannot wait to rewatch this film and see what was missed. There had to be more clues, something in the background that the virgin eye would miss. This was noir at, well, maybe its best looking, but well represented.Thank you Mr. Welles for continuing to impress me with each passing film.Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man From Kenosha</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady From Shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director, Orson Welles, whose last Hollywood film this was for many a moon. It's a kind of post-modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular, and it concerns a happy go lucky Irish sailor (played by Welles) who falls in with a mysterious lady (Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time), and her crippled, and probably impotent husband, played with a brainy, malevolent gusto by Everett Sloan. A long sea voyage follows, with Welles in tow as bodyguard, and the plot thickens when Sloan's law partner (Glenn Anders) turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown. A murder plot ensues, and all sorts of calamities follow for Welles and his employers, and at this point the story, fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far, goes off the deep end, and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set-pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not, by itself, possess, and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess.It's hard to know what Welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in Hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife. But self-destruction intervenes, as it often does with Welles, and Miss Hayworth has never looked less fetching. That she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar, as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness, a quality she does not possess in this picture. The director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at O'Hara, the (presumably) easygoing sailor, since Welles, for all his many gifts, was not known as an easy man to work with. This is a role that twenty or thirty years later Sean Connery or Robert Shaw might have been able to breath life into. Welles does not. The most interesting performance in the movie is Glenn Anders' as Grisby, Sloan's loony, treacherous law partner. Anders works wonders with the part, and is photographed to look bizarre, while his scenes end on odd, sour notes, and are often choppily edited; but for all this he manages to make Grisby's derangement palpable and disturbing, and anticipates, in a genteel way, the more flamboyant Method actors of the fifties, such as Timothy Carey.There is a question that nags me about this film: what was Welles trying to say? He was a highly talented and intelligent man, and tended to make statements in his movies, which, whether one agrees with his world view or not, were brilliantly put forth. I think I have an answer, or a partial one: Welles was summing up his movie career. He had reached the end of his rope in the Hollywood studio system he despised, and he knew it. The Lady From Shanghai isn't exactly a nose-thumbing at the studio moguls of the day, but I suspect that it is, in its portrait of amoral, rival big shot lawyers (read: producers) expressing Welles' opinion of the power brokers of Hollywood. That he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling. Welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler, and he rarely lived in one place for long. He was hired by a studio to provide it with a big, prestigious film (Citizen Kane), which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered. This may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film, which is to say Welles' personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony, and his inability to deliver the goods, as promised. The mere fact of him turning up in Hollywood, like his mere presence in the film, could not forestall disasters well beyond his control. That he presented himself in the movie as an amiable, naive outsider shows a lack of self-knowledge on Welles' part. He was much more of an inside player than he let on, and I imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life, and himself for knowing so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In our post-classic age of cinema Orson Welles has been held up as an icon of the struggling director, the passionate artist battling away at the forces of commercialism, and the free-thinker who was misunderstood in his own time. He has topped several polls of best director of all time and was supposedly the inspiration, or perhaps more accurately the hero of a whole generation of young filmmakers in the 60s and 70s. But this always seems to stem from his tussles with the studios and supposed snubbing by AMPAS. It seems relatively rare that anyone really delves into what was right about his pictures, and rarer still that anyone dares point out that there were a great deal of things wrong with them.The first thing that makes its mark in The Lady from Shanghai is the faintly ridiculous sound of Welles's Irish accent. It's not a bad attempt at the brogue, slipping only occasionally on words like "cop", but it's a twee, corny take on Irishness, only a couple of nudges away from Tommy Steele's leprechaun in Finnian's Rainbow. And it's not just the voice; in no way does his performance here convince as the tough, seen-it-all seadog he supposedly portrays. Welles could act, but he could not do Humphrey Bogart. But then, when one sees the general standard of acting in this picture, it does make Welles seem a little more normal. Take Glenn Anders. He seems to be doing some kind of bizarre cheeky chappy comedy performance, but his character as written isn't funny. And no, this isn't a clever part of the surreal and disorientating style ? it just looks like a mistake. It looks like poor filmmaking.One thing that seems to attract the eager yet inexperienced wannabe director to Welles is his overt stylisation. And it is true that his graceful crane shots and baroque compositions are very impressive, even beautiful, but you cannot just treat the camera like a fun toy without there being some method to it all. Particularly distracting here are the endless close-ups, suddenly shoving a massive face onto the screen in the middle of a line, flipping back-and-forth between giant mouths in dialogue scenes, misleading us over which characters are important and how they relate to each other. If this is an attempt to deliberately confuse or disturb the viewer, it is at the expense of any narrative cohesion or character development. There are directors whose names are now forgotten under the trumpeting of "auteurs" who could use subtle visual tricks to unsettle the audience and still give you a story that engrossed you and characters to route for. Welles, it appears, could not. The hall-of-mirrors shoot-out is admittedly breathtaking, and is a climax any film noir could be proud of, but it would work better as a standout flourish of stylisation. Every moment in The Lady from Shanghai is stylised, which dulls the edge of that finale.Of course, Welles's defenders will claim the shortcomings of this picture were due to cuts and studio interference. Doubtless cuts and interference did happen ? this is in fact fairly normal in any studio production. But the problems with the direction can also be found in Welles's European productions where he supposedly had greater freedom. And neither are the flaws consistent with typical studio output, so this cannot realistically be described as a "Hollywoodized" corruption of Welles's vision. Orson Welles was certainly an intelligent man who did many great things in a long and varied career, but as a movie director he was never much more than a dabbling amateur (a sentiment he may well have agreed with himself). And I think this more than anything is why he was largely shunned by Hollywood, a professional institution if ever there was one.</fullReview>

However, things do not go as planned.....This film seems ridiculously complicated with an absolutely ludicrous storyline. The cast are all dislikeable with the exception of Rita Hayworth's character and Orson Welles affects an annoying Irish accent throughout the film. What the film tries to do with the idea of a man's mind being affected by chaos doesn't quite work. It just seems like a film with disjointed camera angles to make things look weird and a very under-played, calm Orson Welles.There are good scenes, eg, the finale in the Amusement Park; and bad scenes, eg, the court scene towards the end of the film which is played for humour and is unrealistic. I'm afraid that the good moments are not enough to save the film from it's completely unbelievable storyline. The film is watchable but don't be surprised if you can't follow any of it. You'll need to make an effort with this one...!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady of Shanghai is lost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've wanted to see this movie for some time now. What a gargantuan disappointment. While no doubt a very stimulating visual experience, "The Lady from Shanghai" is no less than a 'train wreck' of a movie. The film was doomed the moment Welles was chosen as the protagonist. His disheveled, middle aged appearance is at odds with physical descriptions of him as young and strong. His Irish brogue is laughable. His on screen Chemistry with Rita Hayworth is nonexistent. The acting is at times serious and intense, and at other times comically exaggerated. The storyline (which is highly implausible and even bizarre) meanders in a lost sort of way and never really 'holds water'. The only moment I brushed with plot satisfaction was the 'whodunit twist' at the end.Agreed, the visual richness of scenery and cinematography are truly wonderful. So good in fact, that I would love to put this movie to a good musical score and make a hit Music Video out of it. Even better yet, I'd like to make a wall mural out the motion picture and hang it in the great room.Regardless of who is to blame in the production drama, the film is frankly a 'stinker' (mirror scene or no mirror scene). There, I said it. But for its masterful visual effects, I'll rate the film a 'must watch' for connoisseurs. Just don't set your hopes too high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young Irish sailor, Michael O'Hara gets employed by a rich old man, Mr Bannister and his young wife to work on their yacht. However he begins to fall for Mrs Banister while getting involved as a pawn in a deadly game of murder and deceit.Not one of Welles' better or more recognised works this is still a good film even if it lacks direction and the plot is a little confusing. The first half seems to drag a bit but the latter stages are more rewarding in terms of plot twists and turns with plenty of nice touches. The courtroom scenes even manage to bring in some comedy in the shape of the jury and gallery of onlookers. The hall of mirrors conclusion is a classic scene and is well known even if you haven't seen the film.Welles is good as star but his Oirish accent is a little thick at times, at occasionally he has been re-dubbed really badly. Hayworth is good as the female lead and it's interesting to think how this work reflected the treacherous breakdown of their marriage at the time of production.Overall the first half is a bit of a meandering affair, however when the games begin it becomes much more involving and much more entertaining. Not a classic but yet another example of the boy genius at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film has obtained quite a cult following...but I'm NOT among them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI was originally a much, much longer movie but hacked apart by Columbia Pictures from 155 minutes to its present form at 87 minutes. This liberal hacking apart of the film is painfully obvious in places, as towards the end, there is a long, long narration that explains all the missing pieces in a very convoluted way. Up until then, I kept saying to myself that the plot didn't make a lot of sense and the film lacked continuity but tacking on this lengthy explanation was just the last straw--and made the film a maddening thing to watch. Perhaps the original film WAS a lot better, but in this form it really, really stank in places and seemed incomplete.Not all my complaints are about the continuity and complex plot, though. The character of George Grisby was bizarrely written and seemed pretty difficult to believe. The guy was totally obnoxious and laughed a lot and just seemed like he needed a good punch in the mouth--and it was obvious to everyone but Orson Welles' character that he was just bad and dishonest. So, naturally, Welles agrees to Grisby's crazy scheme and walks right into a setup! This is just too stupid to believe and did not seem like brilliant film-making.Now if you try to ignore the messed up plot and Gribsy, there are some terrific elements to the film. Rita Hayworth (sporting a Lana Turner hairstyle) was excellent and sultry and Orson Welles' Irish accent wasn't bad at all. The film had some excellent snappy Film Noir-ish dialog and the final scene in the fun house was pretty cool and must have inspired other films (such as ENTER THE DRAGON and CITY OF WOMEN). Overall, it's a fit with interesting parts but the whole just doesn't work. What a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Film-Noir from Orson Welles?Visually Vibrant and Captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bizarre, Unsettling, and Mesmerizing Film-Noir from Orson Welles that was Mangled, Reshot, and Rescored on orders from Columbia's Harry Cohn. This Surreal Display of a Guilty World, nevertheless, is still one of the most Talked About Movies of its Day to This Day.It Can't Help but Evoke Feelings of Dizziness and Awe. The Film is so Vibrant and Visually Stunning it Captures Audiences with its grisly Characters and stark Backdrops. On Top of all that is a Script that is filled with Cynical Zingers and Poetic Flourishes.Rita Hayworth is Stunning in short cropped Platinum Blonde Hair and Her Whispery Performance is Alluring and captures the Femme Fatale figure as well as any in Film-Noir. The other Characters are like an Aquarium filled with Predators nibbling at each other until All are Dead.Everett Sloan as a severely Crippled, Evil Lawyer. Glen Anders as His Slimy, Sweaty, Repulsive Partner, and Ted De Corsica as a Low Life Opportunist that Bullies His way Into the Plot are all Unforgettable. They are part of the Poisonous Ingredients in the Welles Stew that is served up in a most Unattractive Visualization of a Corrupt Milieu.The Ending is an Iconic Dali-Esque display of Funhouse Fun and extreme Cinema Extravagances pushed to the limit. The Film's Plot may have some Problems but the Movie is so much Perverted Pleasure that it is fitting that most of the Blame concerning its few Flaws are Attributed to Harry Cohn and most of the Praise is Awarded to Welles without much Argument anywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance but still a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a massive fan of Orson Welles, but visually he is something of a genius. The images he creates on screen are genuinely remarkable. There aren't many others like him. The Lady From Shanghai comes from a period when he was having mixed results with his projects and this is the most noteworthy film to come out of that part of his career. He writes, directs and stars in this noir about a seaman who joins a cruise only to get caught up in a bizarre and convoluted murder plot. Since it's a noir, things aren't simple and since it's a noir And it's by Orson Welles, things will be even more complicated than normal. TLFS isn't a great movie as the plot becomes smothered by too many unnecessary plot threads and while Citizen Kane is an interesting story this is primarily an exercise in style. Orson Welles, while a fine actor, gives one of the worst Irish accents in film history.Its style over substance. But what style! The images in the film are amazing and Welles does things with the camera most other filmmakers just wouldn't do. The acting is strong overall and the funhouse finale is a master class of imagery. The plot is pleasingly complex and although it can be distracting at least it keeps you guessing and isn't just totally conventional. The characters are all corrupt but they're also developed and overall it's an interesting enough movie overall and is certainly stunning to look at. You can never see what's coming next and it doesn't feel totally flat in terms of substance. Although Orson Welles' movies seem to show off a bit, here there is visual sparkle and depth to show off. This noir isn't up there with The Third Man or Laura, but it is a good, solid effort with some very strong elements and some weaker ones. A lesser known Welles film which is worth your time, although it's more a well done film than an entertaining one.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shattering conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just caught the restored print of this at my local cinema and can't say I didn't enjoy it but it didn't hit me like I thought it would. A long time since I saw it so I thought it might have more impact. The thing is, I suppose, the story is not that great and all the time spent on the boat, whilst not without incident and smart dialogue is something of a prolonged interlude. With the exception, of course, for Rita Hayworth, and this is really why we are here. Welles' shooting of her is masterful, be it full length in swimming costumes or facial close-up that fills the screen' She also performs really well in this and if Welles is unconvincing with his silly Irish accent, she really gives one of her very best, and certainly, most sultry performances. The film springs to life with talk of murder but the theatrical sense of unreality already established stand in the way of this having as much impact as it might. What possessed Welles to direct the courtroom scene as if it were high farce, I have no idea but again it doesn't help. What does help is one of cinema's greatest endings. Watching this again in this shining new print was worth the ticket price. From the very beginning of the sequence with the Caligari like black criss cross shadows to the literally shattering conclusion it is quite masterful. As it happens, it was only the other day, in The Guest that I had seen this very scene homaged but not for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Romance, With a Murder Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinated by gorgeous Mrs. Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth), seaman Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) joins a bizarre yachting cruise, and ends up mired in a complex murder plot.Orson Welles is pretty fantastic, both behind and in front of the camera. While I found his Irish accent a little bit hard to believe, his overall ability to carry the film is remarkable. Rita Hayworth was fine as a love interest, but gave no impression that she was able to carry a film... though I confess I have seen few things with her.The twists are mostly unpredictable, and the real talent seems to be in the cinematography. There is a scene towards the end that has become notorious for its camera trickery. While I do not think it makes or breaks the film, whoever was behind that scene's conception (and I suspect that was Welles) deserves full credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Features Welles the actor over his directing talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is classified as film noir, which usually means stereotypical characters in a plot that makes no sense, with the usual "I know what you don't know, but think I don't know what you don't know..." goofiness.Here, Welles obviously puts his effort into his acting, and just uses the script as a vehicle to showcase his talent. This film is different from most of his others, in that he shines more as an actor than a director. This is obviously on purpose. Not that it is badly directed, only that the direction is merely to showcase acting.For instance, a scene where someone could bleed to death if he doesn't act swiftly, his reluctance is clearly based on a character trait instead of sheer sadistic joy or self righteous judgment. He simply shows utter shock in such a way that modern audiences would be too naive to appreciate.The term "dated" is of course the dork's favorite word, to justify his or her naive thoughts of what people do when guns are blazing. When guns blaze, people go into shock, fear, panic; they run, they freeze, they don't behave as most modern films show, which anyone who has ever stepped outside a cubicle can attest to. No, not dated, simply a victim of jealousy.The plot is pretty inane, but the characters do come across genuinely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lady from Shanghai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the two reasons for seeing this were it being directed, produced, written by and starring Orson Welles, and it being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Irish Michael O'Hara (Welles) is hired as a crew member for the yacht of Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), sailing to San Francisco. While working there he meets Bannister's wife Elsa (Rita Hayworth), she seems to like Michael more than her husband. Docking at Sausalito, Michael goes along with a weird plan by Bannister's law partner George Grisby (Glenn Anders) to fake his own murder so he can disappear. Michael is to paid $5000 to do the job, and the only reason he agrees is to run off with Elsa, and it all goes wrong when Grisby is found genuinely dead, with Michael getting the blame. Somebody has set Michael up, and it is unclear who and how, so a court case is set in place, and it is only afterwards that Elsa is revealed as the murdered and film noir Femme Fatale. Also starring Ted De Corsia as Sidney Broome, Erskine Sanford as Judge, Gus Schilling as 'Goldie' Goldfish, Carl Frank as District Attorney Galloway, Louis Merrill as Jake and Evelyn Ellis as Bessie, the Bannisters' Maid. Filled with very good performances, particularly from Hayworth and Welles, a stand-out scene with the hall of mirrors and slide sequence, a film definitely worth seeing. Very good!</fullReview>

As for the filming technique, I have always been a fan of Welles' creative genius. Really the only part I liked was the mirror scene. The use of angles and the mirrors in general created a sense of insanity and really reflected how the whole movie came off, confusing.The random gunfire and the shattering of the mirror was pretty cool.

		<fullReview>I was expecting a much better film, considering that it was Orson Welles'. Instead, this movie was mediocre. The acting was way overdone. Welles' Irish accent sounded a bit like the SNL comedian imitating Vincent Price. The plot seemed pretty ridiculous. Why would he sign the agreement? It made no sense. It wasn't worth the cost. The movie was pretty boring. I never really got into, nor really believed the story was dramatic enough to be believed. So, I guess it was a big disappointment.

		<shortDescription>Ineffective Performances And An Overall Bland Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a while - a good, long while - for this movie to pick up steam. The first half or so I found infuriatingly dull and difficult to follow as well as lacking in any real atmosphere. Even the extended time the main characters spend on the yacht seemed bland. That setting wasn't used to very good effect. The performances really didn't help all that much either. I haven't seen a great deal of the acting of Orson Welles over the years. Based on this movie, I can't say that I feel I've missed all that much. He came across as dry and largely unemotional, making his character of Mike O'Hara not particularly interesting. I make the same personal note about Rita Hayworth - I haven't seen much of her work. Here, as Elsa Bannister, her beauty is used to very good effect, but the performance itself seemed, like Welles, strangely emotionless. The only performance that I thought was modestly effective was that of Everett Sloane as Elsa's husband Arthur.Even given the weakness of the performances, I'll say that the movie picks up steam eventually, particularly with the beginning of O'Hara's trial. It's at that point we begin to understand some of the confusion that dominated the first half. To make a long story short, O'Hara - with a checkered past, but still a character who isn't particularly well developed - just by chance found himself as a pawn in the middle of a game played by the Bannisters, who basically want to be rid of each other, and O'Hara becomes a convenient tool to accomplish that purpose. There's a bit of uncertainty as to how all this is going to turn out, but, frankly, the end struck me as anti-climactic at best, although I enjoyed O'Hara's shark story and how it tied into the film's plot. The somewhat interesting second half made up a little bit for a weak first half, but still, I don't think this is any better than a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Welles failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lady from Shanghai failed to work for me. Orson Welles is one of the most brilliant men to work in Hollywood. Some brief flashes of that brilliance do show through in Lady From Shanghai. It may have been a much better movie if Harry Cohn had allowed Welles' original vision to show through. He didn't and the result was and is a critical and commercial failure. Cohn chopped nearly an hour off the films running time. He added some ridiculous scenes like Hayworth's song and interfered in the pictures scoring.All the interferences notwithstanding, there was much mediocrity in Welles' original vision as well - the ridiculous court-room scene is a case in point. Welles spent a lifetime blaming the studios for destroying his career. Certainly, he had flashes of brilliance and Citizen Kane was a monumental achievement - the only one no one was permitted to change. But his genius could border on the insane and ridiculous as well. The halls of mirrors and fun-house scene are brilliant - even though audiences only see a truncated version of Welles' original vision. It has understandably lost some of its magic because modern audiences have seen rip-offs of that scene in countless other movies. I do wish Welles had been permitted to make one more film sans interference and had not been so erratic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . as he's the miscast "man in the background outside the Cantina" guy, when he SHOULD be playing the part of the foolish sailor, "Michael O'Hara." Unfortunately, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI suffers from the same flaw that would later hamper the picture ROCKY: Writer's Blockhead. Sylvester Stallone thought just because he wrote the ROCKY story, that somehow entitled him to portray the title boxer character himself. If he could have worked through this hubris, his idea could have become a more successful film starring an accomplished actor as ROCKY, such as Robert De Niro or Bruce Dern. Similarly, Aussie Flynn's Irish brogue surely would have been more convincingly foreign than that of Orson Welles. And since Mr. Welles just has Michael standing by idly during the Shoot-out at the O.K. Funhouse, Errol clearly would have ad-libbed some bit of Swashbucklery to enliven the proceedings. Furthermore, Errol was too much of a gentleman to allow Rita Hayworth's character to die alone (wife or no wife in Real Life). But what else could you expect, knowing how these two blokes met their historical ends? Errol became the actual ROBIN HOOD, leading Castro's boys to Victory in Cuba (and getting bumped off by the CIA Black Ops guys for his success). Welles occasionally waddled on set to make TV ads for some of the products he favored during his fatal case of gluttony. Elvis may have died in his john with a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich at hand, but at least The King wasn't whimpering about some old sled!</fullReview>

She is the damsel in distress right away, and Michael rescues her from a bunch of thieves in Central Park. He agrees to be hired on as a crew member of her criminal defense attorney husband Arthur (Everett Sloane)'s yacht. They pick up Bannister's law partner George Grisby (Glenn Anders) who proposes that Michael fake murder him in a plot to fake his own death. Of course, everything goes wrong and Michael is blamed for Grisby's all too real death.Orson Welles has great directing skills and he shows it all in this movie. The only exception is the aquarium where the fish look so cheesy. The style is there. However I don't think Orson Welles fit as the patsy. The plan is so convoluted that it's obvious something bad is going to happen to him. O'Hara needs to be a plain gullible everyman. Orson Welles never gives off that characteristic. He looks smarter and less trusting than that. Also the plot is a confused mess after an interesting open. There is a long narration to explain it all near the end. It's a bit of a mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique Drama of Murder and Treachery.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had been six years since Orson Welles had come out with the break-through "Citizen Kane," a troubled production if there ever was one. Things hadn't improved. Welles was still having trouble getting financing and his marriage to Rita Hayworth had been eroded by ship worms. It's a miracle that he got this out.It's a muddled and not very interesting story. Welles is an Irish sailor who is hired to serve as boatswain on the yacht of a very rich man, Sloane. Welles falls for Sloane's wife, Rita Hayworth as a blond with short hair. And he's pulled into a scheme to fake a murder of a passenger, the scar-faced Glenn Anders. Unexpectedly, real murders begin to pop up and it looks like Welles' work. He escapes from the courtroom and there is a confrontation between Welles, Sloane, and Hayworth in the now defunct amusement park called Playland in San Francisco.Welles is chunkier than he was in "Citizen Kane," an angular hulk. Rita Hayworth accepted the part because it gave her a chance to get out of the glamorous mode in which she'd been cast. She was too young for juicy character parts but had outgrown the role of Fred Astaire's dancing partner. Everett Sloane is adequate as the scheming tycoon. His bulging eyes and hoarse voice carried him through a long career. If his voice is gravelly, though, that of Ted DeCorsia as the yacht's steward sounds like coffee being ground.It's not nearly as gripping or as technically dazzling as "Citizen Kane." The muddled story doesn't really shake you by the lapels. Kane was a formidable figure, egomaniacal and pathetic. I cared what happened to him. Here, I found I didn't really much care who got who in the end.There are some striking visual techniques on display, though generally more subdued in their nature than in "Citizen Kane." Example: There is a scene towards the end in which Welles and Anders are chatting at a table in a bar in Sausalito. They're seated next to a window. Outside the window, Sloane appears, shouts to them, and there is a brief conversational exchange.Well, Anders and Welles were filmed live at their table, but Sloane, on the other side of the window, is being rear projected. On top of that, Sloane himself had been filmed in front of a rear projection of the docks at Sausalito. In other words, in just one scene we're looking at three layers of film. This was the third time the most distant film, the shot of the docks, had been shot. Welles had done the same thing with Susan Kane's suicide in "Citizen Kane." The final shoot out in the Crazy Mirror House at Playland is deliberately spectacular. Sloane enters on crutches, his narrow images lined up next to one another on the screen, and the visual suggests a kind of ominous caterpillar with innumerable awkward legs.There's a fine scene in a Chinese theater when the police enter during a performance and the actors keep on with the play but their eyes stare sideways as the authorities infiltrate the audience. Hayworth's character was raised in Shanghai and she speaks Chinese. There is an element of Siniticism running through the story but I don't think it "stands for" anything, not like the Chinatown in "Chinatown."</fullReview>

That he was a cinematic genius is as far beyond dispute as that Godard is a cinematic poseur but the sad fact is that Godard WAS allowed to perpetrate his travesties time and time again with no front-office control whilst Welles had to content himself with the occasional crumb from the mogul's table and even the crumbs came with strings attached. Okay, Lady From Shanghai is flawed. So what. It's yet another chance to share a cinematic vision with a genius, a guy who, it is crystal clear, would rather make films than make love and we can only applaud and honor a guy like that not bring him low and scramble Lilliputian-like over the prostrate mighty Gulliver, loosing barbs as if we could prick him to death with criticism. Every frame of film shot by Welles has more value than the entire ouevre of Godard and all his disciples and we would do well to remember that and salute him. Others in these pages have discussed the story, lack of same, the faux accent and every other fault. Again, so what. So it's flawed but so is the Koh-i-Noor. 9/10</fullReview>

The movie is a drab with chaotic, stretched out and repetitious dialog on the yatch and off the yatch. Rita Hayworth (real name Margarita Carmen Cansino, was married to Orson during this time) looked good but her acting was nothing to write home about. The court trial and subsequent events in the theater too contrived and preposterous. The dialog was like overhearing not two but three boring people talk. The music was non existent or had no effect on the ear. Why does this movie deserve an 8? I will never know and I don't care to now, except, I will have to check the "Hated-it" column on this website, before I waste my time watching a junk movie that was put on a pedestal just because it was made by Orson Wells and starred Ms. Hayworth. The best directors in North America were/are, Sturges (Magnificient Seven, Great Escape),Wyler (Ben Hur), Wise (Sound of Music), Scorsese (Good Fellas),Coppola (God Father series)and Barry Levinson (Bugsy.) Orson Wells will never be in that category.</fullReview>

If only that little darling of a director, Orson Welles, hadn't spent so much frickin' time meticulously photographing Rita Hayworth's face in close-up, making sure that it was always picture perfect in every shot, making sure that not a single shadow ever fell on it, rendering her face a literal mask rather than an actual human face, then, perhaps, The Lady From Shanghai might've survived its stupid screenplay (written by Welles, as well) to become a worthwhile piece of watchable movie-entertainment. Maybe.But, because of all the preposterous attention that the camera paid to the manicured "flawlessness" of Hayworth's face, this sadly rendered everything that happened around her in the story as utterly ridiculous. Yeah. Because of all this doting over close-ups of Rita's plasticized face (as though this was all that mattered) the entire premise of this film rang completely false (just like Hayworth's face, in fact) from beginning to end.Of course, it was quite understandable that Welles would pay such fanatical attention to Hayworth's face since these 2 pieces of Hollywood royalty were, in reality, married to each other at the time. But, with that aside, why Welles forced Rita to have her hair cut short and bleached blonde is beyond me. I mean, in combination with all of the truly idiotic dialog that she (and everyone else) spewed out, the platinum blonde coif only served to make her out to be the ultimate image of a Hollywood, gold-digging bimbo/boy-toy supreme.And, so, with Welles and Hayworth actually being married to one another you'd honestly think that as on-screen lovers (already being off-screen lovers) that they would literally burn up the screen when it came to their moments of passion together. Yeah. Their on-screen images should've been absolutely sizzling to behold - But, alas, instead there was ultimately no chemistry, whatsoever, happening between these 2 at all. None. They were as stiff and unfamiliar with each other as a couple of strangers, or cut-out paper-dolls.I guess it should be of no surprise to anyone that divorce was looming just around the corner for these 2 shortly after this film's release in 1948.All-in-all - The Lady From Shanghai was a major disappointment on all counts - From Welles repeatedly forgetting his character's Irish accent, to there being far too many scenes shot in front of unconvincing back-projection screens, instead of the real thing.Sheesh! Like, give me a break! I think it's really interesting to note that with Welles, himself, being less than attractive as a leading man, that he, in turn chose Everett Sloane as the actor to play his rival in the story. As one could plainly see, Sloane was quite obviously one of the most ugly-looking actors in Hollywood at the time. And, with that, Welles rendered Sloane even more ugly and repulsive by making him a pathetic cripple, as well.Personally, I think that this particular Hollywood darling named Orson Welles was nothing but a big, conceited snot, and that The Lady From Shanghai (which bombed on its initial theatrical release back in 1948) has, far too often, been grossly over-rated (as a major cinematic achievement) by way too many film critics ever since.</fullReview>
