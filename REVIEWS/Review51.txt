		<shortDescription>Screaming 10 year old girls will be in heaven. Anyone else....no....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. So I walk in the movie, and Every time the great Biebs comes on the screen, I hear the most annoying, loud, and irritating screaming little girls who somehow worship and adore this boy. 90% of the theater were young girls who thought this guy was the "hottest person alive." So annoying.And onto the movie, it is a waste of time, just watching his annoying confident face, and people like Usher talking about his talent. I hope so much you wont pay 10 bucks to see this crap. Really. The kid is just annoying. Please just stay away from this movie. Unless your a 10 year old girl, this is an utter waste of time.1/10. No, 0/10, because of the crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly the worst movie ever made. Theatre full of 10 year old girls screaming their heads off at the sight of him. Could not stand sitting there for the entire time. Left early.DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS. I don't even understand how people agreed to turn this into a movie.1/10, only because 0 isn't an option.If anyone wants to see this movie, don't pay money for it. It is one of the worst films I've ever come across.Im not sure why this became a movie, but im sure it was just so they could milk money from the current state of how popular the kid is and get even more money out of him. Never say never is bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A boring and pointless "movie."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie simply because I thought it would be interesting to learn about the Biebs and because I'd heard it was actually very good. I was not a fan of Justin nor did I dislike him, I was just neutral, so I figured it would be interesting to see if I would enjoy the movie or not.Sadly, I did not. Although it was interesting to see how Justin started out, (which was like a year ago???) the movie was SO incredibly boring. Half of the movie was Justin on stage singing his songs (which all sound the same) and the other half was him having a cold. So basically I learned that the hardest situation Justin has ever had to deal with was the cold he cold before performing.I ended up leaving the theater about five minutes early partially because I couldn't take listening to one of his songs and partially because I couldn't take the annoying fans in the theater screaming every time he was on the screen.So if you are already a fan of the Biebster, feel free to watch this movie. If you are not a fan, you aren't going to want to see it and will be mad for wasting ten bucks on a documentary that could have been aired on MTV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that if I pay for a movie then you should at least stay and watch it as you have payed the money for itI sat through Vampires Suck.I stood up from my chair and left this movie.This "movie" is some of the worst film making I've ever seen, that's if you could consider an hour and a half tribute to a prepubescent teenager while like camera shows his 12 year old female fans a movie.Unless you're a 12 year old who is currently under the impression that Justin Bieber is the world's most talented person on Earth the AVOID this movie.If you ARE a 12 year old who is currently under the impression that Justin Bieber is God, go listen to music from 80's / 90's.If there was a 0 stars option, I would have picked it. This movie made me sick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest - I'm not exactly all that up to date with what kids these days consider "hip". When I saw an ad for this film on the television, though, I was intrigued. I bought a ticket for myself and saw the midnight premiere.I really admire Mr. Bieber and the director of this fine film. What they created is a honest satire on the level of something like Borat. Never could I have fathomed that a mockumentary about the music industry could ever surpass something like This Is Spinal Tap. But Never Say Never has done just that.Much applause, Mr. Bieber. I await more great works of satire and comedy in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to go see this movie with some friends, just to have a laugh. We were hoping that it would be so bad that it would become funny. But it was just awful... I just cant take that kid seriously.Also, this movie just confirmed what we all knew, JB has an ego even bigger then Kayne West. The entire movie was like: "Look at me, i'm a talented singer and a good person! There is simply nothing that i can't do!"What the movie forgot to mention is that its his mommies fat cigar smoking managers that made JB. he's a puppet. This movie could make him look better, but it just buried him deeper. I'm starting to think that this was done on purpose because the fat cats want to get rid of him.Would not recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right so everyone here on IMDb is pretty much committed to giving this "movie"(if you can call it that) 1 out of 10 to get it to no.1 on the bottom 100 list. Trust me, they're right.I went to see it because I knew there was no way I could criticize this movie without seeing it.However, the film lacks any artistic merit whatsoever. It is full of the latest and greatest pop sensations of the Youtube generation, but all these names and flashy lights are just stuffing in the under cooked turkey that is this show.At the heart of this presentation is the message to never give up on your dreams, however the whole movie is just Bieber smiling, looking pretty and grooming his lesbian hair, and as mentioned in previous reviews, the theater was full of tween girls screaming their heads off every time he inhaled or exhaled. Someone really needs to teach the modern generation about cinema etiquette, or at least tell them to shut up for 10 seconds. I honestly don't know what this movie was trying to do besides earn money and add a few more accolades to the stars names. In short this movie is just pointless.The 3D also sucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not even a Justin Bieber hater (though that kind of surprises me because he is the exact type of thing I usually rail against on my blog) but I feel like I need to take a 12 hour shower after watching this useless, horrible disgusting piece of "entertainment" with my sister. Yeah I like to hang out with my sister and we BOTH wanted to go see this movie thinking we'd at least get a laugh. Boy was I wrong, this was just awful. His performance is terrible, it's as if this vain little pubeless kid thinks all he has to do is stand there and let 10 year old girls scream at his stupid haircut. The songs are terrible, there's a few attempts to create visual spectacle of some sort but all of it is just awful and pointless. LOL to the reviewer who referred to him as "Miss Bieber" that's awesome. Way more entertainment out of that one joke than I got out of this entire pointless vain movie that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and not an enjoyable experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is not coming from someone who is giving this film(if you call it a film as such) a 1 because I haven't seen it and I hate Justin Bieber. This review is coming from someone who did see the film, aiming to give an honest judgement and to keep open-minded. I love music and I love film, but Justin Bieber: Never Say Never came across to me as pointless and I just didn't enjoy the experience.I did not like how Never Say Never was shot. The photography was shoddy and sometimes went at odd angles, and the lighting got so much I finished the film with a very bad headache, which still hasn't gone away. I do agree about the 3D, I not only found it unnecessary I also found it distracting. It also doesn't help that the 3D wasn't- like the annoying narration- actually that good in the first place, in fact it was really quite bad.The music and Justin Bieber are also major problems. Not Justin Bieber as a person mind you, when I saw him performing on television at Christmas he seemed quite down-to-earth, hard-working, honest and not too full of himself. I just hate his music and I have never liked his singing either. His singing is for me rather forced and flat, and his music especially Baby has me switching off the radio quicker than you can say "Santa Claus is Comin' To Town". As for the music with exception of the lyrically powerful Born to be Somebody the songs suffer from dull melodic writing and uninspired lyrics that made me think hang on I've heard this before.I'm sorry to say, Bieber didn't impress me very much either. As I've said, I have never liked his singing or music. However, he does have a commanding presence on stage. But... I don't think here he is in particularly good voice, the singing is still flat and forced for my liking and his acting did nothing for me. I also hated the audience. During the concert scenes, the screaming often got so loud that it was almost impossible to hear the vocals or lyrics, and this audience if this was humanly possible is more annoying than any of the audiences for those trashy talk shows(ie.Jerry Springer, Maury). Granted, people love that and do it for the atmosphere, what I'm saying is that it isn't for me. Also as part of my autism, I do have problems with sudden loud noises so while I hated the audience when it came to seeing the film, being in the audience I think would have upset me more.The story's structure and message didn't do much either. I didn't mind that the story was part biopic, part concert feature, but the biopic stuff does come across as superficial and contrived and I think some of it slows the film down quite considerably. The message is a follow your dreams message, I have no problem with the message itself, it's just that it is not a very fresh one and feels very overly-didactic in the way it is put across in this film. The dialogue at best is really bad, some of it is cheesy and some of it is cloying, while the direction is wretched. The acting is subpar, Bieber's acting is worse than his singing and Jaden Smith while okay has a hardly credible persona. In fact, the sole bright spot in the cast is actually Miley Cyrus, which surprised me as I cannot stand her.In conclusion, this film comes across as pointless and I just didn't enjoy it. Bieber fans will like it, otherwise it isn't really worth it. 1/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel bad for Ludicrous and Usher for being strong-armed into participating in this atrocity.Anyone who liked Bieber will like this movie. Anyone who disliked Bieber will dislike this movie. It's always embarrassing to watch a "star" resort to poorly produced garbage like this "documentary" to scrape together a couple extra million for his bank account, but I guess Bieber is starting to realize that once he hits puberty his profits will disappear. Best to take advantage of the pedophile women who want him before it's too late.In any event, the popcorn was pretty good, and Usher and Ludicrous are talented performers. It's too bad the documentary wasn't about them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so unbearably awful. I guess it is supposed to be a documentary on this little kids undying unquenchable dream to be a world famous singer. He's like what? 10? He's never had to pay rent or have a job. He's gotta color pictures and finger paint. There are bars FILLED with musicians who know what it means to sell blood just to make rent and spend their entire lives writing music that no one else will ever hear or appreciate it. This kid like what? Hit forks on pots and pans then landed a a major label deal. Whats worse is every time he popped onto the screen and little girls screamed about how hot he was all I thought was "This boy looks exactly like a little girl........"The 3d was just the perfect metaphor for how much they shove this down your throat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daughter dragged me to this monstrosity for her 12th B-day. Needless to say I drank heavily before going into the "movie" which ended up not helping in the slightest. I honestly was hoping to maybe fall asleep, but with all the girls in the theater going ape shat, it was impossible. I really never cared one way or the other for this kid. To me he was just another product of some producer intent on destroying the world with bubble gum atomics. After watching this "film" my attitude is one of complete disgust. I have never hated anyone as much as I now hate Justin Bieber. This kid really doesn't need his ego stroked anymore than it already has been and I'm not sure that I have ever seen a douche being molded at such a young age. I felt myself hoping that a fire would break out, just so I could feel anything other than the simmering rage threatening to boil over at any moment. Can someone tell me when a bowl cut became hot? Or denim? Or leather pants? Or those stupid slotted sunglasses?On the plus side....my daughter loves me and in the end, isn't that what is most important? That and patiently waiting for Beiber to overdose on Oxycotin on his 20th birthday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'This movie contains no material likely to offend or harm' reads the trailer for this "film" which should be disregarded by anyone over the age of 12 or with an IQ greater than 6.What we have here is an exercise in self-indulgent nonsense. A long and painfully cringe-worthy experience which could easily have been slashed to 30 minutes and tossed aside to the biography channel. After all, think of the amazing musicians who have never warranted a 3D biopic lasting almost 2 hours... The use of 3D in this film seems to be more geared to keeping the attention of toddlers in the audience, as clearly there is nothing to be gained by showing any part of this story as if it was supposed to be a visual feast, which people talking and the occasional dance number certainly is not.The point of this film is undoubtedly to give young Mr. Bieber (or those who conduct his financial affairs) another way to print money, and keep the saccharin music movement in top gear. It is in fact an insult to the movie-going public to put this feature into cinemas, as it adds nothing to a film which is essentially empty of any point anyway, but allows us to be charged an extortionate fee to see it.Luckily, I did not pay to see this one... but I did see families exiting another showing a few days later. The little girls seemed happy, the mothers looked bored and the fathers looked as if they had a noose they would be hanging from the bathroom ceiling about 20 minutes in.Final Thought: A diseased cash-cow which should be residing on nickelodeon, if not in the cutting room bin... thanks corporate America!Rating: 0.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I had even one tread of respect for Justin Beiber before I saw this movie, It's gone now. This movie is visual and auditory trash. There is no thought,creative plot, or logic to this movie. It's simply Hollywood's way of cashing in on a teen idol that's just a flash in a pan. If I could rate this movie in the negatives, I would. If I had one wish, I would rid the world of Justin Beiber all together. This movie is painful to sit through. Do not waste your money. There's no thought process whatsoever. This talentless teenager belongs back where he started; on Youtube. He definitely shattered all hopes of ever being on the big screen again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would love to say everything good about this movie, to be fair to the multitudes of prepubescent girls that would stab me through the eye with the broken shards of a Bieber CD rather than listen to me, but there is a small problem.audialThere is nothing good to say about this movie.I honestly don't understand why anyone in their right minds would voluntarily sentence themselves to two hours of mindless torture. Bieber's voice sounds like the annoying wail of bad Superbowl singer trying to hit another octave at the end of the Star Spangled Banner. And his lyrics...honestly, I don't understand how he can be such a baby. For crying out loud, he's sixteen freaking years old. He hasn't had a chance to find love or heartbreak, not even close. The Taco Bell quad steak burrito has better songwriting, better singing, and better musicianship than anything little Biebs has ever done, or I suspect ever will do. It's a shame that a talentless barely even adolescent kid like him become so famous and so idolized when actual musicians (anything from Rush to the Beatles to Guns N' Roses in their day to Gustav Holst to J. S. Bach to Avenged Sevenfold) are ignored by the brain dead masses.There is nothing I would like to say more than spoiler alert, Justin Bieber dies, but alas, he lives on.******SPOILER ALERT******** This movie will cause you to rue the day you were born, and the audience may cause you to feel the rational need to commit seppuku. ******END SPOLER***********This is not a disgruntled music fan spitefully arguing against a terrible movie, this is a warning to the masses, especially to the parents who may see the billboard and decide to see it to find out what all the hype is about. DON'T SEE IT. Plain and simple. You will regret it for the rest of your life. And if that is not reason enough, he might actually be getting money from the movie sales (assuming he's smart enough to realize he's entitled to it). Therefore, if you the reader go to the movie, then you are indirectly feeding the Bieber, which will cause him to stay and annoy us longer.Please say never, for the sake of all of our sanity, say never. If the movie doesn't make enough money, there might not be a sequel. At this point, that is the best case scenario.Final notes: -If I could give a negative rating, I would. 0/10-I wish I had four hands so I could give it four thumbs down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER* My god...that was by far the worst movie I've seen in years. I shall give you a brief synapse of what the "documentary" covers: A prepubescent boy squeals at young teenage girls about "love" he has never felt. The little girls love that they think he's gay, and have yet to mature to the point of realization that he is an untalented "sensation" who will lose his career when puberty finishes its course.Pretty much sums it up.Common...the kid grew up in the suburbs with divorced parents. Whoop-dee-f**king-doo...the same could be said about millions of other kids. The only difference is that other kids didn't suck thick dick for a career before they were 15.</fullReview>

Worst movie ever.What a waste of almost 2 hours of everyone's life.and what a waste of one more minute of my life by writing this review, but i have to warn moviegoers so i guess at least this is worth it.horrible horrible horrible movie oh my goodness But I suppose if I must, I will to save others from not just this film but the processed cheese that is beiber as a whole.The fan shots clearly show the masses of mindless tweens who have sadly missed out on the originality that was 80's and 90's music.Beiber himself lazily puts in a minimal effort as he knows he can do so and still be revered as the second coming of Jesus in his fans eyes.The rest of the film just point out how mindless his fans are, truly a tour de force of terrible</fullReview>

I heard a couple of his songs, didn't like them, but I've stayed out of the whole chain of events.Now comes the review on this film, and this film alone. I can guarantee you one million percent that the good reviews on the last pages are fake. No-one, not even his biggest fans, could find this film even remotely "inspiring". The entirety of what I saw of this film was nothing more than a shameless plug, in a desperate attempt to woo a few more underage girls with no genuine acquisition of the musical world. To say it was cheesy would be paying this bunch of crap a massive compliment.I'm going to stop writing now, because this film doesn't deserve the anger that persuaded me to write this review.

I was not previously a person who hates justin beiber but this movie makes me hate justin beiber. i have no idea how this even made it to theaters. watching this movie is like getting stung by a swarm of angry bees, having a class of 1st graders screaming directly into your ear, and having your teeth pulled while someone is scratching their nails on a chalkboard all at the same time. please everyone reading this take my advice... no matter how much your 11 or 12 year old daughter begs you to take her to see this, Don't.

		<fullReview>I thought it was excellent. An easy one out of ten. See, that's talent! Except for the 'music', the 'acting', and the fact that Justin Beiber is in it. My 6-year-old sister loved it though! She loves his music.But, as much as I hate him, I can only imagine how much p***y that guy gets. As long as the girls' parents aren't around, or the boys' (to each his own). Movies like this are for when the artist is retiring (I use that term loosely with Beiber, not hitting puberty doesn't make you talented) not just starting out. My sister made me see it opening night. All the screaming little girls really added to the experience! And their parents will probably have to take them several more times, that's why kids are so great. And when it comes to DVD the girls are going to play it until the machine burns out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie as originally a person on the boundary of the liking and not liking Justin Bieber. After watching this film however, I find myself more in the disliking category. The film was unnecessarily shot in 3D which seemed pointless to me and just seemed as if it was jumping on the 3 dimensional bandwagon and some of the scenes also seemed to drag on longer than they needed to. Overall I think the film wasn't great and I think only the truest "Belieber" could remain loyal after this atrocity. The acting on the non essential characters' behalf was sub- par, with the exception of Miley Cyrus who was on form as per usual and the acting of Jaden Smith was comparable to Tom Cruise as opposed the quality expected of the Smith name. I can see why the film would appeal to the hard core fans, but as an average viewer, it did not appeal to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reminded me how much I wish I had lived in the 80's where music was good and little singers with average talent and no apparent pubic features were shunned and ignored. I have never felt so upset after seeing rubbish being paraded as a film in my life. furthermore, the total lack of need for any 3D effect was even worse. Don't be fooled by the thought that this film may change your opinion on bieber, all it did for me was fill me with rage and tears. I only wish there was another documentary which showed the downfall of real music, and expressed how stupid little girls have no idea about the real qualities needed in singers and music artists that should be listened to in this day and age.Don't go and see this film, it will only make you sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected more. Usually, when movies are made based on famous superstars, it's because they've created a legend for themselves, like Michael Jackson. These are supposed to be inspiring and touching. This movie tells it's viewers how to get pubescent girls to like you by singing in a high voice.I'm quite certain the plot was thought of when the writers took a dump on the script containing the summary of Bieber's life. Bad plots aren't the worst thing in the world, but at least Tron and Avatar had good special effects.Sure, the kid can sing. So can millions of millions of people around the world. Most, I'm sure, in a better voice. Most with actual talent, from even humbler beginnings. If a movie was made for everyone that could sing, everyone would die before they could finish making them.I'm really quite sorry there isn't a 0 star option. 1 star seems too kind, in my opinion. Never see this movie.</fullReview>

If you wanted to make a movie that will pull in money because kids will see it no matter what, you have succeeded. if on the other hand you wanted to make a decent film....*facepalmbasically, the movie is like a lame version of 8 mile.congratulations Jon Chu and Justin Bieber, you have managed to make me praise 8 mile. I hope you're proud of yourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage, this movie is an insult.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie briefly goes about Bieber's not very difficult life before he became a "star" and than goes about glorifying him in an all too sickening way with Bieber fans screaming for half of the movie. As the title implies, the movie almost tries to deliver the moral message of not giving up, but it fails when most most musicians don't get famous because they don't receive endless resources through endorsement. That's all irrelevant compared to the actual movie though, but in comparison with the movie documentary on the band Rush called "Beyond the lighted stage" the filmography of this movie was terrible. I sympathize with any parent who will inevitably have to bring their daughter to see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am not one of those idiotic internet trolls that have swarmed this page. I am mother of three girls aged 5, 9 and 12 years old and a 16 year old boy who chose not to see the movie with us.The four of us walked into this movie expecting 100 minutes of fun. Sadly, we were all disappointed. This film is nothing but an go trip for Mr Bieber, at least 80% of the film is either poorly recorded music that we could have just listened to on Youtube or old footage that has been shown to death on every documentary, interview and breakfast show.If you love Bieber you WILL hate this film, you will be far better off listening to your Justin Bieber songs at home, you'll hear a lot more songs, that are far better sound quality without the boring Bieber home videos we've all seen a million times.But if you don't really know much about Justin or his songs but like what you've heard so far, I guess you might like this but again, just downloading the music may be more efficient and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tweenage girls rejoice! Your second coming of Christ has made a "movie"! As for the rest of humanity, please don't see this movie. I did not waste the $10 to see this, instead I saw the movie on another unnamed source and I'm thanking myself every second for not wasting money like that. I probably robbed myself the experience of going to the theater and laughing at the brainwashed and culturally-deprived Bieber fan base that would have been there. I did plenty of laughing anyway. The movie was awful from begging to end. I could have watched the movie in a different language and the experience would have been the exact same. This is definitely your cliché rags to riches story. They try to make you feel sympathetic for the kid, but I felt nothing but apathy. The best part were the fan shots. I didn't see ANYONE who wasn't a girl above the age of 16. It's kind of depressing how anyone could consider this culture or art. If you don't believe me, go look at the other reviews on IMDb. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is awful, is and imbecile in their eyes. But I digress. Seriously, if you have an iota of sanity, do not see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this from a documentary about Justin Beiber. He's 16, nearly 17 so hasn't even lived his life so shouldn't be able to have a documentary on it. Terrible Movie overall. Sad thing is the teenage girls will see it not knowing how awful it's going to be. I just hope he doesn't get the urge to create a second movie as it will have the same fate as this.This documentary is just about Justin Beiber running around with his high voice, still not hitting puberty and all the other stars that have been in music videos with for e.g. Ludicras or Sean Kingston talking about how 'good' it has been to star with this teenager. I hope these actual music star sensations don't get dragged down from this awful performance of a 'Documentary'.</fullReview>

I feel these were put in to just brainwash the fans even more. Every time his face came on most of the girls in the audience went crazy and I wanted to yell at them to shut up. The rest of it was just about him getting sick. Everywhere I looked it seemed there was an Illuminati reference somewhere. Bieber's acting was just terrible, even Trolls 2 beats Never Say Never. He's only 16 and they are already trying to market him with a movie about his life. I thought biographies were supposed to be made when you're an adult or dead. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it's a waste of my money. Bieber is just a marketing ploy for record companies to steal more money from little fan-girls who have no taste in music.

		<fullReview>I am very sorry to anyone who IS a Beiber fan. Those people will be extremely let down by this so-called "film" that should rot IN HELL. I'm bracing myself for Armageddon, because the people who are behind this film must be in league with the antichrist. This piece of sh*t is worthless, revolting, and the epitome of TERRIBLE. I was bored out of my mind until I actually felt myself leave my body. When I returned, I became incredibly ill and I vomited all over the theater floor,leaving about 45 minutes in. And you may be surprised to know that I am a 14 year old girl. I've never been a fan, but I don't hate Beiber, as he's never done anything to me. I only detest his image and the fact that this mass hysteria is TOTALLY undeserved. He somewhat has talent, just not the kind that should be showcased in a film when he's only 16, and in 3D? What were they thinking? Oh, that's right, they weren't thinking AT ALL. And I've seen terrible films before, like the #2 worst film of all time according to the IMDb list, Manos The Hands of Fate. That film (even the MST3K version) left me feeling sick at my stomach and I was depressed for days afterward. This film made me vulnerable and I got the flu which I have only just recovered from. I wanted to gouge out my eyes and would have happily gone to have an amputation without pain killers just so I could forget the documentary. My parents feel they made a terrible mistake when they made me go see it with my little 8 year old sister (and even she hated it, she said it was boring and silly) and I was on the verge of a mental breakdown (including thoughts of self-injury) and had to go and see a shrink to "let out my anger" afterwards. I am in the process of healing now, but I don't think this scar will ever go away.To Beiber: I am SO sorry and I am proud of you for not taking your own life as soon as you saw this film. That takes true guts, and I have respect for that.DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT waste your money like me and my sister did. Although I can't say I'm really mature, I don't think I'll ever live this down. I feel humiliated and I don't think the psychological damage will ever leave me. The people who made this should be sued for emotional suffering experienced by viewers. A rating of 1 isn't deserved. I give it a negative 9999999999999999999 and to infinity and beyond.</fullReview>

Justin Beiber has not contributed anything outstanding to music that has not already been done before ala the Monkeys, Milli Vanilli, any boy band, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, the list is near infinite. The difference between Justin Beiber and the unending list of forced pop artists is that the latter has produced something interesting at least.Back to the movie.

There is really nothing in this film which makes it worth seeing, it is documentation about a guy who is barely out of puberty with no experience in life. The only audience this film could possibly have - 10 year old girls - should be protected from this movie as they fanatically follow a stupid illusions. It might be correct that he is a handsome and talented musician, but with all his success in his life i think this concatenation of pictures proves that he lost the sense for reality. Real musicians publish their concerts on DVD for fans, and then it is usually about their music, so they are entertaining their interested audience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have been witness of the growing fame of Justin Bieber, with his albums. But was necessary a BOOK? or better told A MOVIE?? and in 3D???? I don't have anything against the biebs but this only looks like a marketing move for Usher and All the people to get Wealthy with the fame of Justin.All the movie(Documentary? AutoBiography??) is about Justin but all the thing we see is Justin practicing and singing in pre-concert and concert and some parts of his youth??.If you are a Fan of Justin well you are going to see it anyway but if you aren't a Fan of Bieber avoid it to any cause.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. Even the worst trash-films, something like "Bloodsucking Freaks", were less disgusting than this abomination. Me and my pal were drunk and decided to waste our money on this abortion. Thousands of little stupid girls with signs of some kind of mental disease screamed every time, when that retarded boy showed up on the screen.This was a real mind***k! It's like mixing sh*t, p*ss and fresh vomit together and then spewing this atrocious cocktail in someones mouth.My eyes and ears were bleeding after seeing it. I beg you God - Make me unsee it! The worst thing ever made!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justin Bieber: Never Sing. NEVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw this movie because my little sis is a Justin Bieber fan and she asked me to go with to her to see the movie But, only 10 minutes later the movie started, I wished to be dead. This is a movie (If it can be called movie) made to promote and give even more fame and money to Justin Bieber. When it finished, I felt like I stupidly lost an hour and a half of my life. Everything I hate about a movie was there: Silly, Corny, pink, pointless, painfully long. Of course, my sis (as well as all the other girls between 8 and 15 year old that saw the movie that day) loved it. But I just hated it. And also other adult people whom I asked their opinion. Any adult and mature person would agree with me: Justin Bieber: Never Say Never is an ultimate form of torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can live through this 'movie', then congratulations; you managed to live through this nightmare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is nothing but absolute trash. Starting from the obvious, why is (Miss) Bieber having a documentary made about him at such a young age? Due to this, it's fairly easy to see that this is just a marketing ploy used by Bieber's promoters to make money out of the little kid's fame. The singing scenes are dreadful-every time I hear that idiot's voice it sounds like nails down a chalkboard. I could feel my eardrums being shattered as his voice destroyed my sanity, to the point where I couldn't stand it anymore. When will Bieber realize that as soon as he becomes an adult, his 'fame' will be crushed? Then the only time people will ever see him is on the news-having died from a heroin/cocaine overdose.Bottom line, this 'movie' is dreadful. Only watch it if you love to inflict harsh amounts of pain in one sitting.P.S: Oh, and don't believe the ten star reviews. They are obviously written by Bieber's female fans to desperately deny the harsh reality-he (and this movie) are failures. You might as well just flag all the positive reviews to prevent the truth from being covered up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been pretty ticked off with Hollywood lately. The army of bad remakes and sequels, rubbish romantic comedies and just pure garbage but THIS takes the cake. This is basically just a cash in manufactured slice of trash that only little girls will want to see. It makes me very angry that this no talented kid is so popular, not just with music but now he's taking a shot at the film industry.Watching this movie will basically be watching this little twit boasting about his life and how great he is when there are millions of REAL people who need to work hard and EARN their money. Bieber makes me sick.Great movies are dying an its because of modern disease like Bieber And the reason the movie is so badly rated with few people actually voting high is because most of Biebers fans are too young to use the internet or understand the voting system This film is a 0/10, I don't even need to see it, I see enough of his pathetic face plastered over TV making me feel sick.To ANYONE who thinks its a shame if people bully this little creep they seriously need to wake up and get a grip.This 'little boy' is a menace to music, his singing is manufactured. No one hates him personally, they hate what he is and what he is doing to music. While this little creep is out there, boasting about his life, earning millions and brainwashing half the little girls around the world he is damaging other bands who seriously need to work to make it, not just by some mother posting videos. He was created by producers and is a puppet to make money, his voice is auto tuned and why do we need a movie just to remind us of how messed up it all is.Bieber is a joke, modern music is a joke. If Bieber was to try and make it back in the 70s/80s period when music really was talent he would be laughed at.Why did they make a film out of this? Because of a word called GREED. They knew they would make a lot of money from naive little girls so of course they would make a movie. There is no other explanation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK.I made a previous review of this movie and, surprisingly I found out that today somebody marked it as a personal offense and they just deleted it! So I checked and read once and again the page's guidelines for reviews and I did not find why they deleted it. This is the first time it happens to me, despite I have written a lot of reviews before.I went to watch this movie, because my 8 year old niece wanted to see it for her birthday. I cannot described how disappointed she was, not to mention how bored and angry this movie made me feel.You have to consider that this is a 3 D movie, so you'll have to pay more to watch it and when you pay, you expect to get something good and this wasn't good at all. My niece loves his songs, but not even this saved the movie for her.all what I saw where random episodes of his very short life, some videos and performances... Bad editing, bad songs and a lot of close ups of JB. The "dramatic part" of the movie (the sore throat), was boring and not surprising at all.If you like Justin Biever, not as a singer, but if you feel attracted to him, you'll get what you want from this movie. because this is just the most egomaniac expression of himself.0.5/ 10 2 thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't waste your hard earned money on this Bull! It is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the cinema will be full of 10 year old girls who will scream the whole way through the movie, and even if you get it on DVD it is still air headed cr*p that we've all heard before. This movie requires no brain to watch, it is just Justin Bieber for two hours and personally I'd rather run into a wall made of knives than watch this movie again. I'm sure everyone has seen some movie that tells you to 'chase your dreams' or 'never give up'. Sure, that's okay, but since this movie is full of it, and some publicity, it really is just painful to look at.Movie fail!</fullReview>

But upon seeing this I have to say this is very bad.This is the story of a 12 year old boy who dreamt of being a star, uploaded a few songs onto YouTube, and found himself playing Madison Square Garden by the age of 16, even though everyone told him it would never happen.The footage you get to see is very ugly. The 3d effect is not even worth mentioning. And the story line really sucked. No one even dies in this movie.This is my personal opinion. That's all.</fullReview>

For the rest of my review for your the consumers sake i will point out all the flaws in the movie and what you should rather watch. First and foremost the 3d was just insanely bad i got free tickets to this move but the 3d annoyed me because i saw a 15 or 16 year old boy yet to hit puberty for the most of the movie. Secondly the presentation it was horrible you would find better presentation on a biography channel documentary about a monkey than this movie because all you see is a teen boy "chilling" and "hanging out" with his friends. Now to my last point the movie itself was full of bad music and a bunch of people talking about how Bieber got so far with it. The movies i recommend seeing if you have not already are Black Swan if you are a man go watch Black swan just really good and i am number 4 those 2 are my recommendations for movies that you should spend your hard earned money on than this pile of garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie-wise it's garbage, but a decent moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film tells a bit about Bieber's younger life and how he got involved in the music industry and then goes on to show him performing at Madison Square Garden in front of a sold out crowd.This movie is not worth your time if your looking for something with the slightest bit of intelligent content. In fact, its not worth your time at all considering that you'll probably lose IQ points just by watching it. There are literally thousands of celebrities that could tell a story of their life and have it be just as interesting as Bieber's. While the kid undoubtedly has some degree of talent (and wow, is he ever confident) there are many superior artists that go unnoticed. Bieber has yet to prove to me that he is anything special, and that he brings to the table something that others do not.It is pretty frustrating to consider that the only reason this movie exists is to satisfy the need for pre-pubescent, blonde haired, effeminate teenage boy among 12 year old girls. This movie could have easily been shortened to 30 minutes and have been a straight to DVD release (in which case it would be doing everyone a favour). I honestly feel for the fathers and mothers that had to accompany their daughters to the theater and purchase two full price tickets for this embarrassment to film.The only thing that this movie has going for it is the moral behind it all. Sure, it's been said before but it is always nice to be reminded that you can accomplish anything with a strong desire and hard work. A few scenes are quite inspirational if you can get past the fact that Bieber is rather undeserving of his excessive fame.In any case, Bieber will join the likes or Jesse Mcartney and Aaron Carter soon enough... Just another teen sensation coming and going. Once those balls drop Justin can kiss his career goodbye</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never heard of this kid until my friends daughter wanted to see this movie. I had no idea it was even a documentary.I saw a lot of brainwashing tactics and illogical thinking. The fans being interviewed don't care if he's good or not, and they are dedicated for life only because he is advertised as super popular and that every girl should like him, or they are outcasts.The music was highly inappropriate for children as it was all about love and heartbreak. This kid(and his producers) is pushing emotions onto our children in a brainwashing matter making it seem normal for 12 years to be in love and face all types of adult scenarios. Furthermore, the role models portrayed in the movie are rappers....do I need to elaborate? I went with a friend and her daughter to see this. She wasn't the type to scream during every picture of the beibs. In her words "Why does he smile like that?" "He seems so proud of himself". "He needs a haircut" For a little girl she understand what a shat-eating grin and a large ego looks like.Anger, does not describe what I felt when I saw the other parents tolerate the retard screams coming from their child. Boys are not that important for a little girl to be so excited they will pass out from lack of oxygen. The more you tolerate the media portraying that this is okay, and the fact it belittles your child into an almost servant like attitude because he is cute and sings doesn't sit right with me.</fullReview>

You must me be either family related to Justin or on his payroll or just brain dead to rate this so call documentary movie with something more then one star. To go even further for the first time i am sorry IMDb don't have anything below this undeserved one star,so i can properly rate this. And I'm not calling it movie any more because there are movies rated with one star,that I'm not ashamed to call by a real name. Young,spoiled brat taking videos of him self,or even worse paying someone to film him being "glorious" and failing badly is just sad. Someone may ask why i even watched this,well the answer is i honestly don't know. I guess i wanted to see this horror till the end,and just see for my self how low can people drop,all for just a few more buck's a? And to finish this if you have anything else to do,do it instead.

Nothing but an untalented kid squealing for a stretched amount of time. If I was in charge of the money spent on this movie, I would have put it to good use, I would have fed every starving person in Africa. I would have bought Justin Bieber, then feed him to the sharks. (Ok, maybe not that) But still. It is THAT BAD. No one wants to know about this stupid pathetic teen accept maybe 10 year old fan-girls who surprisingly seem more mature than him. I hate this movie, stay as FAAR away from it as possible. If you see this movie in wal-mart (Which most likely you will find 10 copies because no one wants this crap) buy every single copy, light it on fire, then bury it. In fact, once I was at wal-mart, I took a bunch of movies out of the clearance bin, put this movie at the bottom, then buried it under all the bad movies like the Super Mario Bros movie, and Double Dragon, North, Blank check, even THE ROOM. all the crap I would rather be watching than this.

		<fullReview>After visiting my local cinemas and seeing this title, I thought it was a late prequel/sequel to Never Say Never Again, the 1983 unofficial Bond film.What I saw once I entered the cinemas though, has scarred me for life. Not only was it not a Prequel, It was nothing near a Bond film, more-so some documentary about a kid I've never heard of. Not only was the acting horrendous, the camera work is what you would get if you taped a camera to a cat. In fact, a cat could probably do a better job. The soundtrack was not to my liking, it was way to poppy, and the singer was horrible.Not only was I refused my money back after I walked out 30 minutes in, but apparently I am now banned at my local cinema. It's an outrage, they really need to state what the film is about.I wish I could give it lower than 1 star, because it was a horrendous excuse for a movie.</fullReview>

The first thing I have to point out is how boring it is, I swear I was turning delirious by the end of it...It has a load of mumbling on about how "talented" he is from people such as Usher, and I hate the fact that Bieber is trying to seem all down to earth, when he's just a proud little ass (could of said something worse but I don't really want to use foul language). And i swear, every 5 flipping minutes there had to be a reminder about how "hard-working" he is...Well, I sat through about 50 minutes of it, and then forced my self to watch the rest of it the next day.AND as well as that, the music in it is terrible, and there's a hell load of it.

		<shortDescription>Why was this made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was forced to watch this movie because I work at the local movie theater and let me just say I can't think of a good reason for this "movie" to be made. Granted, I'm not the target audience for Justin Bieber, nor I plan to be, but it's still a movie, and movies are supposed to be watchable. And watchable this is not.Consider a scene in which Bieber waves his hair in slow-mo as many girls try to imitate him. It's not enough that he does it, its that it gets repeated about three more times! Why?! Why indeed. Why was this made? Kid's not dead, so there's no reason for a tribute. The kid's fame is not in downfall, so it's not a desperate attempt to get back into the missing spotlight. So why was this turd made? Alas, it was made only to maintain the glossy girlies entrapped in Bieber's media monster brainwash machine. Nothing more. This is all part of MTV's plan to push this kid into the mindless teenage wave.Oh and mindless they are! There's not another word to describe them. Consider a small child (11 years old at the most) who smirks malevolently while she enunciates: "I WILL marry Justin Bieber, we WILL be husband and wife!" She's like 11 years old! Where are her parents? What do they think about this? Do they think this is natural? And a grown woman (boyfriend by her side, mind you) telling the camera that Bieber is "gorgeous" and that "she wants him for herself"?! The kid's sixteen, maybe fifteen at the time of the recording for God's sake! So it's okay to be a pedophile as long as it's Justin Bieber?! And speaking about Bieber, yeah, the kid's got talent, I won't take that away from him. In fact, I don't hate him. I don't know the kid, so I can't really hate him. I do, however, hate his music. I think its complete and utter trash. He seems like a nice kid, but sometimes I feel all of this is too fake. Yeah, the kid who grew up poor, etc. He had a better drum kit than my parents could ever afford! So, um, yeah: he was poor alright. He can sing alright, but someone tell me he's not lip-synching at the MSG concert!The "special guests" are put there for no other reason than to fool Justin's fans into thinking that everybody wants to sing with him. Boyz to Men? I'm pretty sure they badly needed a paycheck. Miley Cyrus? She hates the kid, you can see it in her body language! Jayden Smith? He's famous ONLY because he's Will Smith's son. He has absolutely no talent whatsoever. Snoop Dogg? Ludicrous?! I mean, c'mon! It's infuriating that such performers are getting behind this kid instead of true and talented musicians. In conclusion, Scooter (I think) gave the best line in this whole thing. He says Justin Bieber will not fade away like other child superstars. Sorry Scoot, but unless he does a "Justin Timberlake" in the next five years, he WILL fade away. He may have a profitable second album, but I give him five more years before people forget him. And his documentary/movie? Yeah, it sucks. And the 3D? It sucks as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm gutted that I cannot vote this less than 1 star. It was woeful. I don't know who did the soundtrack but most of the songs were a phrase that IMDb restricts me from saying, but they weren't good. . This is the last time I take part in a Secret Santa in work. I bought my coworker a top notch batman money clip and in return I got this. This. I mean, just... why would anybody do this. I would go as far as saying that this was the worst film I have ever watched. I thought that it would at least be interesting. How wrong was I. I sat there bored to death whilst the protagonist droned on making himself appear to be the greatest person to have walked the Earth.Please, for your own sake, don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, you're the number one pop star in the world. You could literally snap your fingers and have, or have sex with, any noun imaginable. You're worth more than any human being on the planet. Is a documentary about how awesome you are really necessary? At this point i'd like to quote rip torn and ask you another question which i'll answer myself..."Neccassary? Is it necessary to drink my own urine? No! But i do it anyway because it's sterile and i like the taste!"... The movie was nothing but celebrities licking his asshole spliced between shots of him winking at the audience of pre pubescent girls who don't realize that the only reason there downstairs tingle for him is because all there friends and the media tells her it should. The kid is a perfect gleaming example of the way this world works and this movie is nothing more than another paycheck for team bieber. I just really hope that our society eventually realizes how blatantly retarded we've become and comes around to listening to real music, and watching real movies and TV shows again. But for that to happen the whole world needs to die. Which i'm fine with, please anyone, if you have a massive plague just laying around now would be the time to unleash it. Go for it!

I have a low tolerance for the Beiber after watching him on some insipid TV show on MTV where he was given and played with all sorts of ridiculous toys like a mini race car with "JB" painted on the hood, but I'm hoping this is the movie I can throw some popcorn in the microwave and get some good beer and just fall over rolling at. However, if it's pure garbage, please let me know. I'm really not sure what else to say about this movie but I need to reach a certain number of lines so let's see if this is it now!Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never See This Film... Never</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always despised the boy named Justin Bieber. When I first heard him on the radio, I actually thought I was listening to a 20 year old female musician. The film, as I expected, was abysmal. But I think we all know why JB made this documentary- money. Money, money, money, oh, the money. The budget was about $18 million and it's made $70 odd million. It contains nearly every single piece of information about JB in the film that you can find on the Internet. I mean, why give some squeaky superstar a camera? Look what happened to Mini Me when he did that sex tape. Ooft. So much for my first review... what a terrible, terrible doc.

		<fullReview>This movie is very bad and makes Little Fockers look like an award winning movie. in the movie there is a scene devoted to Justin's hair containing him flipping it in slow motion for 2 minutes. When i saw this movie on demand it was so boring that my child fell asleep during the screaming fans (which are so annoying and take up a third of the entire audio in the movie itself). The whole move is a bunch of non sense to make Justin look so much nicer and better than he really is. I learned that Justin is a good singer and has a teenage mom which i think could be bad for a G rated movie. I am so angry I paid 5 bucks to watch a movie less entertaining than watching paint dry.

		<fullReview>I am actually a fan of j Bieber, and was excited to see this, so i am not biased on this review. This movie was just disappointing.I was also annoyed by all the unnecessary screaming, all the girls in the theater did almost every time he came onto the screen. There was nothing new we learned about Bieber, just the typical, i am from Canada, small town etc scooter discovered me so on and so forth, nothing exciting, nothing new. At times the music was deafeningly loud, or the lights were blinding. I guess i was just bored by the repetitive experience... i did like how he played the drums though, i knew he could play, but the whole 3d thing made it seem extra cool!If your one of the girls that adores him, then yes this movie is for you, if you don't like him then you most likely will remain indifferent with him</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haters Gonna Hate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, this isn't a movie in the normal sense, it's a documentary. Movie implies plot, direction and a narrative, which are completely vacant here. I am in no way a Justin Bieber fan, i saw the song "Baby" on youtube once and that's as far it goes for me. After watching this film, i doubt this is going to change. The film does not inspire anyone who is not a Bieber fan to seek out any of the artists material. It focuses entirely on pleasing the existing fans and giving them what they want. There's no room for newbies here.Hence the problem, people who dislike/hate Justin Bieber already that go and see this film are not going to change their opinion, it may only serve to fuel their dislike of the boy.One thing this thing really needed was more humanity. We are told all about this entity of Justin Bieber, where he came from, his musical talents and the build-up to his status today. But not once in the film are we told what he is like as an actual person, the people who talk in interviews throughout the film are his family/management/freeloaders and they will not say anything negative about him for the sake of keeping the films feeling positive and upbeat. Dare i say, I would have liked to see an actual interview with Bieber himself, there is no time to reflect on his personality beyond the angelic layer of perfection the media creates. All the non-concert footage of him is either old home video footage or just pointless scenes of him rambling to nobodies back-stage. Let's get into the production of this thing, the editing is absolutely horrendous. Scenes are cut so quickly the picture is almost impossible to take in. It would cut to a dance sequence for 3 seconds then cut to a fan reaction for 1 second then back again, it might even cut to some overhead tracking shot for a few more seconds to pad out the movie some more. The 3D? Just as bad. Maybe worse. 90% of the film is shot in 2D with no conversions at all. It's Justin Bieber and 3D, Two gimmicks rolled into one to earn more money from ticket prices. The dizzying editing and nauseous camera work, in combination with some scenes shot in 3D and some not at all really does become almost unbearable to stand after a certain point. The ending also has more false stops than Return of the King. The other celebrity appearances in this film were a mix of hilarity and cringe-inducing, Jaden Smith (Will Smiths son) is someone who is only famous because he has famous parents, he's not a good singer, he's not even as good as Bieber. He comes across as a snobby little brat who's just cashing in on Biebers success. Miley Cyrus is visibly repulsed to have to do a duet with Bieber, and she's not as good a singer as Bieber either. And Ludicrous... 10 years ago this guy was rapping about how bitches should get out of his way, now he's rapping with Justin Bieber on the encore of his show about falling in love at 13 on the playground? is this a joke?There are many negatives about this film, but i should try and equalize it a little with some positives. Justin Bieber has genuine musical talent, he is a very good singer and a fair guitarist. The scene which features him playing the drums was also rather impressive from such a young person. The kid himself comes across too as quite a nice person and very respectful to his fans, the life message he tells them are cheesy, but feel honest. The concert scenes are badly filmed yes, but sound great. The booming audio pulls the viewer into the film and creates an almost genuine concert experience.But my absolute favourite thing about this film is the fans reactions. The fans in this film got some of the hardest laughs out of me in my whole life, in this regard "Justin Bieber: Never say Never" is one of the greatest comedies ever made. Lines like: "He's cute and loves music", "He's an inspiration to us all" or "I Love Justin Bieber more than life". Had me in fits of laughter. The best one is almost quite sinister, a young fan saying they WILL be married. These latter points save it from getting a 1 star rating from me, but as a non-fan of Bieber's music i can't say i liked this film at all. He does have his audience, i saw them in that theatre watching it too and they loved the film. Bieber is really just a fad in the long run, these young fans he has will grow up and in about 5 years they will look back on their wasted lives and think "what was i doing?".I don't think this is going to be the only Justin Bieber cash-in made, we can only wait for the hype from this one to die so we'll get some peace before the next one comes around.I will close by quoting Justin's song U Smile; You ain't seen nothing yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justin Bieber, the new pop phenomena that drives girls from the age 9-18 crazy. First I would like to point out that the majority of people who either works as a professional reviewer or just doing it here on IMDb as a hobby are not doing it right.As a reviewer your job is to grade the movie based on what viewers the specific movie turns to. In this case, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never turns to the fan group. So if your a fan you would probably like this movie. But many reviewers tend to make a more personal statement about what they think about the movie, and that is not our job.So I would yet again say, that if you are a fan of Justin Bieber and would like to know more about his early years before becoming a star, then this is the movie for you. If your not a big fan of Justin but maybe you like the music a little and would like to know more about Justin, then this is the movie for you. Its a rather plain musical documentary, if you could call it that. There are no great special effects, you have heard the songs probably a 1000 times by now, you also may know a lot of things that are told in the movie, but not all.If you are not a fan of Justin Bieber, if you don't like his music, if you are not interested at all about Justin, then save your money and time and go see a movie genre that you like.</fullReview>

Why call the movie "Never say never" if the kid never had to deal with hardship? I don't get it. If he was a crack baby that grew up in an orphanage, I could see the reason to make a movie. THAT would be inspiring. But growing up in Canada? Hardly an accomplishment.It's not that it's a BAD movie, it's just cripplingly dull.

I can't stand hearing people, especially him, talk about how persistent he was and how he never gave up in&#xfeff; the face of adversity. What adversity? He made his first million before he was old enough to drive a car. Is he aware that there are people out there that have been trying to make it the music industry longer than he's been alive.Adversity is working a sixty hour week and still not having enough to pay the bills. Persevering in the face of adversity is finding the strength to&#xfeff; work your fingers to the bone every day of your life for pack of ungrateful children and a menopausal spouse without turning into an alcoholic. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on whether or not they like his music.But, it is not a matter of opinion to say that he is abnormally&#xfeff; famous and wealthy at a remarkably young age. In other words, everyone else has worked harder for less. He never said never?!?! Of course not, he didn't have time between getting potty trained and learning how to talk. Don't tell me about perseverance you little queer, a hard days work and a cold beer would literally kill you.Justin, by all means, enjoy your success, but never make the colossal mistake of forgetting what you really are, lucky and blessed. More so than almost&#xfeff; anyone else on the entire planet... Seriously, just say "thank you" and quit acting like you spent the last thirty years curing cancer.</fullReview>

I hate him, but if you take all the songs out of this movie then Never Say Never is a not bad film. We get to see his real life and what goes on. I must say I hated the first act of the film because Justin seems to be mean and bratty. But once you get to know him a bit well you might give some respect to him. I actually "and I feel sorry for myself for saying this." felt sorry for him on one part. He goes to the doctor because his lungs aren't doing good. We find out that his lungs are swollen and he has to cancel the concert at Madison Square, its very scary of what the doctor says about his lungs. But anyways a few days later the concert is on and Bieber turns on his auto tune lungs. Yeah, I hate his songs. Except Never Say Never because its less whinny and annoying. Just Give this movie a shot I say, once you watch it you might like it.VERDICT: 73/100 B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie for Bielibers and Non-Bielibers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a Justin Bieber fan. I listen to his songs when it's being played and I wouldn't change channels when his music video is on MTV but I'm not a hard-core-bieliber. I really couldn't understand why there were girls crazy over him.If I probably have 100 reasons why I don't like him, his fans would definitely have 1001 (and beyond) reasons why they adore him. So it's a wonder why I watched his Justin Bieber: Never Say Never movie on one weekend at 1 in the morning. And surprisingly, I found myself enjoying it and even watched it twice.Honestly, I was not really interested in watching the entire movie. Since it's my habit of checking the ending first (not always but I do that, ha-ha), I decided to check the last 5 minutes of it. What I saw was an arena full of screaming female fans (majority of it) making the love heart sign with their hands and chanting Justin's name. I can't explain why but even without seeing the full movie yet, I felt over-whelmed. And that made me decide to watch it?thoroughly.I thought it was just a simple-concert-turned-movie kind of crap but I was wrong. It was Justin's story. It's a narration of his humble beginnings as an aspiring 14 year old artist, his struggles of entering main stream US music industry, and his success as a 16 year old music icon who conquered the music world in barely two years.When I heard Justin's first single "One Time", I initially thought that he was just another Aaron-Carter-wanna-be and for sure his popularity will not even last a year. His voice was very young and his songs were suitable for audiences of Nickelodeon or Disney. Scooter Braun was right when he said that DJs wouldn't play a record of a 15 year old kid. So they decided to work on another plan. They've let Justin perform live in different radio stations all over the US whether they play his record or not. This was where I saw how Justin and his group started from scratch and broke my notion that since Usher was co-handling him?everything came his way-it wasn't like that. He and his team worked hard for it.What I really like about this documentary was the sincerity of the people behind Justin Bieber's success. No matter how talented or how charming he maybe without these people, he wouldn't be who he is now. I know that they get millions of dollars now from Justin, but when he was still starting, there was no guarantee if he'll succeed. Nevertheless, they stood for him and gave him their 101 percent support.They also knew the importance of Justin's fans. They knew that they owe Justin's success to them. And the good thing is they never forget that. Let's admit it, with what's happening with the global economy right now, not everyone can afford to buy a ticket for the front rows or anywhere within 10 meter distance from the stage. Some can't even pay for the tickets at all. Imagine what a die-hard fan would do if she gets a free ticket very close from the stage?Yeah, you're right?you get screaming fans. And this was what the team did.Now for the funny part, the avid fans. I really find most of his female fans annoying and overacting. Hey, I'm not being mean okay? I'm just being honest. Hello?! He's not from outer space! He also has the same organs as you do. He eats the same food as you do (it's just probably more expensive). He breathes the same air as you do. He lives on earth as you do. And above all, he p**ps too. So I don't get it why these toddlers, middle school kids and teens think he's the hottest guy on the planet. I was once a kid. I also had my share of artist crushes and time to time craziness but not all the time! I have nothing against Justin Bieber fans. They just go overboard most of the time.I know a lot of Justin-haters or simply avid movie goers don't like the movie. I respect that. We all have different perceptions. I'm still not a Bieber fan and I'm certain I wouldn't get the so-called Bieber Fever. However, after seeing this documentary-concert-movie, I somehow understood why his fans adored him so much. There are only few people who are naturally born charmers and Justin was one of them. He has a commanding presence on stage and he really is adorable. I also realized that he is human too and he is like any other teenager. He just got lucky. Ha-ha. :) Though I liked the movie, the little critic in me won't give this a full ten. There are some shots that just suddenly pop up out of nowhere and it makes the movie a bit confusing. I found those annoying. Justin fan or not, I'll score this 2 starss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I wanted 105 minutes of someone talking about how great they are, I'd ask the most egotistical person I know to tell me their life story. This is just crass, some random Canadian kid who somehow made it big with one song that didn't even make it into the Top 40 feels he has the privilege of making a documentary on how great he is for it, whilst established musical artists such as Jeff Lynne and Freddie Mercury have had 30 to 40 years of musical experience and have topped the charts globally on numerous occasions haven't had a major documentary made about them, well not a documentary as expensive as this waster.Justin Bieber is a terror to the music industry and has started a trend for children his age and younger with huge egos to go out and make songs that have become the worst ever written. I am of course referring to the dreg that is Rebecca Black's Friday, but that's going off topic. If there is one person you should make a documentary about, it is not this miserable kid, he's a disgrace to music and now a disgrace to film. He's arrogant, he's pretentiously over the top, he doesn't know where Germany is and he walked into a door on live TV. I can safely say he's not acting the fool, he's being is genuine self in this one. A snivelling egotist with a horrid taste in music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why many girls are infatuated with him is beyond my comprehension. However just watching this movie from a critics stand point wasn't very good.1. It didn't make me connect with anyone. He had a lot of different guest stars and family members but when it was all over I forgot completely who any of them are. My teenage cousin went to go see this movie with friends and even she didn't seem to care for it. 2. The songs are very forgettable. The most I know about these songs are that they are sung by Justin Bieber and most of them are pop. That's it.3. As a document itself it wasn't really a document. It just shows music performance, backstage, celebrities, awards and maybe five percent talked about Justin Bieber. So it doesn't do a correct job at that.This could have been a decent document but it fails at doing that. It didn't get me invested into what it what's trying to teach which sucks because I like movie documents. Sorry Justin Bieber fans but this isn't very good. I won't comment on the kid himself (though I will say nowadays he seems very arrogant) but I didn't get invested into his movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just had to glance over the plot-keywords and stumbled across this little gem: ?Prodigy". Of course I spilled my coffee and people around me thought that I had become hysteric, asking whether they should call a doctor but that was worth the best laugh I had in a very, very long time. Comparing "Prodigys" like Mozart and Bieber is like comparing Beluga caviar to a greasy hamburger at McD's.But then I thought about the "good, old days", when there used to be talented musicians, who worked their way up, who recorded timeless classics that can still be enjoyed in a hundred years. I thought about the future, what savvy producers might find on YouTube in the next hundred years and throw on Madison Square Garden, so they can record a "documentary". Suddenly the joke wasn't so funny anymore.Then I looked at those screaming 10-15-year olds in the audience, imagining in a few years time, that they might be a wee bit embarrassed, blushing when admitting to their boyfriends that they had actually been to a JB-concert. However, I felt for the parents, who had to net out their hard-earned money for this tripe. I even felt a little sad for the Bieber-Kid, thinking what inevitably will happen to his "career", once the hype has died down and the money-monkeys will cease to whisper delusions of grandeur into his na?ve teen-ear. Perhaps there will one day come a sympathetic soul, who'll point out the "careers" of Frankie Lymon and a whole legion of similar wrecked teen-stars (but I doubt that somebody like that would make it past the bodyguards).The mandatory 1/10 (and maybe one day IMDb will give us that 0-rating, so it can be bestowed on "works" that don't deserve one point; it worked for Roger Ebert, did it not?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would be Happy because this and Justin bieber sucks.Plot: The film follows the pop star Justin Bieber during 10 days counting down to what is considered his biggest performance, that of August 31, 2010 in Madison Square Garden, which sold out in 22 minutes. It shows footage of the performances during this period from his My World Tour. It shows excited female fans, and several instances of the "One Less Lonely Girl" routine of inviting a girl on stage for him to serenade and give flowers to, and of surprising random girls with free tickets to his concerts. The main people around Bieber, being like family and good friends to him, are interviewed, but Bieber himself is not. Various instances of praying together before a show are shown.The film also includes a visit Bieber made to his hometown while being in Canada for the tour. He is scolded for having damaged his voice while having fun with his old friends. Reluctantly he accepts the postponement of a performance in Syracuse. He is not allowed to speak for some days, and thus recovers enough to do the next performance, at MSG.Also included are some stories and old videos of Bieber's childhood. He was raised by his mother but also had a very special bond with his maternal grandfather. The latter still gets emotional about the time that Bieber and his mother moved to Atlanta.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie follows Justin around while he performs all of his favorite songs, like baby baby baby and I will Never say never!. And it pretty much all of the songs hes put on you tube. It has a few backstage scenes. It is not interesting unless you want to stare at Justin Bieber for an hour and a half of the movie. I guess you could check out some of his cool clothes. And don't forget about the hair flip!. It shows him performing on stage like one would expect. Overall, it's a drab movie unless you are a girl that really has a strong Bieber Fever case. Not that fun to watch,. It is easy to see most of the audience is girls from 5-years to -15 years old. They like to sing along with his songs. I don't remember anything interesting in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bieber was on the right time and the right place. The internet has became a more important place in our community, especially among teenagers, he became in no time a pop star. The then 14-year-old singer was best put by a team in the market, using numerous radio broadcasts, and social media. A nice time image.Never Say Never shows how talented little boy on YouTube end up and came in a sold out Madison Square Garden. In addition, the documentary counts the last nine days for the concert off and that is also interspersed with clips of his performance. There was not really a watertight structure in the documentary. The idea to build suspense through to count down to the concert has no meaning: we know he is there and that, for example, the throat problems that threaten to throw a spanner in the works, will not spoil the fun.The documentary should also not really having the 3D. The concert was recorded at Madison Square Garden with special cameras, but it do not make it better. Director Jon Chu, last year still responsible for Step Up 3D, uses the technique only in a part of the documentary, and even a few short fragments which are therein but it is entertaining. The 3D concert registration by U2 from 2007 still stands lonely at the top.Despite its shortcomings is Never Say Never become a reasonable documentary. For example, it is interesting how Bieber on one side got much willpower and shows talent, but on the other hand also wants to be simply a riotous child. Of course the question is to what extent that is possible. But the most fun on the documentary is to see the youth culture in operation. Not only from the marketing, but also from the fans themselves. The hordes of teenagers deliver funny, annoying and endearing trip on fragments. So, my conclusion is: Good movie for 12 year old kids. Adults, do not watch this movie! It's a waste of time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bieber screamathon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching out of pure interest regarding the Bieber phenomenon, which seems a bit of a pop enigma to non-tween masses. However the blockbuster documentary is not a dissection of his career, its origins and the interesting sociological issues it could entail (such as the youtube revolution or impact of fame on child psyche). Instead it is a glorification of a pop icon tailor made as a simplistic straightforward money grab at the delirious Bieber fan-base.The documentary itself if professionally filmed and cut, following the most basic structure to get across an album selling message: Justin is sweet, ueber-talented musician, who is just an normal good kid under all the fame. Hence multiple scenes of Bieber and crew handing out tickets, joking with his audience, handing out autographs cued with multiple sequences of screaming fans.For a limited time the movie is mildly informative when presenting how this craze started, but this quickly withdraws into lap after lap of adoration from family, managers and helplessly bewitched adolescents all en route to the big one: a sold out concert at Madison Square Gardens.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>His story as recounted in this concert film/biography puff piece is of some undeniable interest, as he is the first plucked-from-YouTube singer to achieve major mainstream success offline. That factoid aside, this is most definitely what it appears to be--something strictly for those stricken with Bieber Fever, for the documentary bits (largely not in 3D, it must be noted) don't delve any deeper than an E! or MTV profile; and the main drawing card is the ample concert footage. Director Jon M. Chu does make some sort of attempt at a dramatic arc-- the countdown to Bieber's sold-out Madison Square Garden concert-- complete with 11th hour crisis, but said crisis (vocal issues a couple of days before the show) fails to register when clearly all the concert footage already shown throughout the film was shot at that show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was okay. The fans are obviously going to love it. The nonfans are definitely going to hate it. When I saw this movie the first time I was just a middle of the road person on my opinions of Bieber.To be honest I liked the movie. I didn't really know anything about Bieber besides his songs so it was cool to see the personal side of him in the film. I also enjoyed learning how his rise to fame came about and found the movie informative on that subject.The movie was somewhat entertaining if you can tolerate him. It got pretty suspenseful for a moment when he lost his voice so it made you want to keep watching at the end. However, overall it didn't really have much substance.Same goes for the music. You'll like it if you can tolerate his music. If you can't stand bieber then... why are you even looking at his movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse Movie Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I went with my 8 year old daughter who has the "Bieber fever" to see this movie on Bieber. I was thinking I could just sleep thought it to get through torture faster and with as little harm to my sanity as possible. But I found that sleeping in the theatre was next to impossible since all the girls there where about 6-18 years old and had extremely annoying high pitched voice screamed so loud every time this kid did something I found it was impossible to sleep. Now about the movie its self, it is so horrible. Does this kid have a interesting life? No. Does this kid have a tragic back story? No. Does this kid even have a single atom of talent? No. Should you see this movie? No, avoid it like it's small pox.So this kid lived with his single mother in Stratford Ontari before he found fame. A lot of the reviewers here who have the "Bieber fever" thinks that this is so tragic and his life was so hard because of this. I lived a single mother for most of my life before I moved out, most of the time we where quite poor and my mother had to work a lot to buy the food and pay the rent. It was not the best life but there is a lot worse that could of happened and millions of kids everyday live with a single parent so its not that hard. The music in this movie is mind numbingly bad, his voice his auto-tuned to hell and back and his lyrics want to make me puke they are so cheesy and bad. All this kid sings about is girls, there is nothing wrong with songs about love and girls if they are done right but this kid has no idea how to do them, he acts like be rejected is the end of the freaking universe. He does play guitar and drums and a few other instruments but as a guitar player myself I don't think he is very good at it, just sticking to basic chords and not doing much else. There is nothing wrong with making songs out of basic chords but with his horrible lyrics and singing it is horrible.In the end this movie was so horrible I would of rather ripped out my own eye balls and swallow glass then watch this. This was just made for Bieber to get some more bills in his pockets before his voice cracks. This does not even deserve a 1/10 that is far too nice, this film does not even deserve a 0/10 or even a -10/10, it deserves a "EPIC FAIL/10". My final words are "DO NOT EVER SEE THIS MOVIE"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would firstly like to admit that I am not a Justin Bieber fan, but being open minded, I thought that maybe the film would at least change some opinions I had about the 17 year old star. Sadly, and very depressingly, I was incorrect.The movie isn't rewarding. In fact, it's just as boring and repetitive as the lines of the verses sung by the star of this gag-fest. There's no aspiring message, there's no moral. It's a constant attempt to theft money from the pockets of fan girls, and a rub-in-your face reminder of just how popular he is. Throughout the film we hear only Justins pretty voice, whether he's blabbing on about something that's no where near remotely interesting, or whether he's -gulp- singing. You only see his face whether he's on stage or, whether he's showing off with his mates, playing guitar, basketball, etc... Given that the fan-girls are already aware of his talent - as well as the bieber haters - we're not seeing anything new. He has no real story to tell, besides the fact that he grew up singing -there, that's all you need to know. He busked, as all singers do, great. Where's the entertainment? The title 'Never Say Never' sounds promising. I actually expected to see another side of Justin. I do particularly enjoy watching stars crumble before a big show. Katy Perry's 'Part Of Me' showed a great deal of inner conflict and an exclusive and thorough look into her life on stage. With Justin, it's just the same ol' stuff we've seen from the 'Pro-Active' commercials. In conclusion, he's not telling any story. Instead, we're just watching him on screen, doing nothing but showing off his talent. For fan-girls only.</fullReview>

I wasn't a fan of his songs, but I will give credit where credit is due, and he is a very talented. I didn't know he could play the drums and guitar. It is interesting to see how he got his start. Regardless, he is still a cocky little wigger. This film documents the discovery and marketing of a teen pop star. You will also get to witness how scary females can be. Scenes like these are a step backward for womankind. Apparently, Justin Bieber also does not have any male fans.It was nice to see fans made happy with free tickets and Bieber attention, but then I realized why they were so happy, it made me want to bury my head in my hands. Maybe one day, there will be something people can be happy and excited about, that isn't so completely ridiculous.</fullReview>

So after people dared me to see it for a month I finally sat to watch this garbage and I know you want to know what I think of it. Well Here you go.The film centers around the princess of high singing voices as he is finally going to preform at the Madison Square Garden. And thats about it.The film includes cameos from Boyz II Men, Usher and Miley Cyrus(Oh Don't Worry We'll Get To Her Later) and these cameos are really pointless. The film is not a documentary and more of a concert performance. The absolute worst part of the DVD is a bonus feature title R.I.P. Hair Flip about cutting his hair. REALLY?!!? This is undeniably the worst movie I have ever seen so do not see it. Any way my next movie like I said is going to be on Hannah Montana The Movie.And by the way only see a movie in the theater once twice if you come in late not 26 times just see it once in theaters and then pay 10 bucks for the DVD and watch It over and over for free because guess what the theater costs money.Rated G.Theatrical cut: 1hr 45min/105min.

		<fullReview>There's gonna be times where people tell you that you can't live your dreams. This is what I tell them: Never say never!The words resonate within viewers ? bringing the powerful dynamic of Justin Bieber, not only as a singer, but also as a powerful icon of ambition, into the viewers' living rooms. The powerful moment when Bieber shouts these words to his fans, Beliebers, captivates the way in which the film captures the concert experience. Although the film does a great job capturing the concert element, the rest of the movie proved to be disappointing, to say the least.The movie's picture quality was poor, which was most likely intended to give the film the same type of raw, behind-the-scenes, voyeuristic feel of the popular concert-related movie, Michael Jackson's: This is It. However, the majority of the film is essentially a compilation of home videos, so the poorly lit interviews of Justin's friends, family, and acquaintances looked pitiful by comparison. Furthermore, many of these "acquaintances," a term I believe most aptly describes a number of individuals in the movie who do not appear to have personal connections to Bieber ? make the movie seem significantly less insightful. Moreover, the movie is essentially a concert-film interspersed with homemade videos of Justin and the aforementioned interviews, which, due to the sporadic nature of these occasionally insightful interviews made it impossible for non-Beliebers to follow his rise to fame. These factors also made segments of the film somewhat boring and redundant for his fanatical fans.Justin Bieber: Never Say Never proved to be a weak film from a cinematic standpoint, and the movie is really only for die-hard Bieber fans (of which there are a great number). Fans of his music will most likely be let down by parts of the film, but satisfied with the powerful portrayal of his concert. Individuals who do not like Bieber's music will be dissatisfied with this film for its lack of focus on Bieber as a person and its poor production quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this movie is for kids and teenage girls. Second, it's a documentary, not a movie. Third, it was actually somewhat refreshing.To be able to have a movie about a pop star that parents can allow their kids to actually watch was pleasant and welcomed. This kid has a good story, a strong work ethic and real talent. I knew nothing about Justin and had no idea that he played drums, guitar or was discovered on the Internet. I thought he was just another bubble gum kid that LA Reid created in the studio. He's actually a tough kid that really cares about showing up to work, working hard and delivering a good performance. Good story for kids to see about faith, hard work and sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent documentary, and you should like this movie if you are a fan :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As said in the summary, it's a decent documentary, not a great one though, but since the quality of documentaries is often low I would say that this one at least is among the top half. And sure, if you don't like Justin Bieber you may not find this documentary at all interesting, but that is the way it usually is, so I don't know why people who dislike him even watches this in the first place.. but but.. I guess the haters can't even keep an open mind when it comes to rating a movie at IMDb, cause it sure as hell deserves a higher rating than 1,6, that it has when I write this. And I have already wrote far more than I though I should about this, so I'm just gonna end with something that I think should have been obvious for everybody even before watching this documentary.. If you are a fan of Justin Bieber, you will like this and if you are a hater you will also hate this, I i'm pretty sure it is that easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing it for what it's worth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, so tonight I watched "Never Say Never" for the first time at a friend's house. I was a neutral viewer, harboring neither affectionate nor antagonistic feelings about Justin Bieber, maybe just annoyance at hearing his name all the time. But anyway, after seeing the movie, while I wasn't turned into a "Belieber", I did gain more respect for him. And Here's why. Jusin's story is one of hard work and yes, a bit of luck, but certainly a lot of talent. I mean come on, you have to respect someone who can play the drums at an age when most of us are still trying to clap on beat. Nonetheless, the documentary humanizes him by showing his vulnerabilities with a hectic performance schedule, something many of us forget about when watching anyone perform. The movie does what any documentary sets out to do, tell the audience about what they might not have realized before; who knew members of his crew went around giving out free tickets to a few lucky individuals?! If you're a fan, certainly watch it for your own enjoyment. And if you're not a fan, watch it anyway. At the very least you'll be encouraged to go for a dream of your own, and maybe even to "Never Say Never"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inspiring tale of success against all the odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not one for crying but I have to admit I cried my eyes out during this movie. Justin Bieber reveals himself to be a thoroughly likable guy with a good nose for a pop song. I thought it was amazing how he continued fighting against everything that came his way to achieve his goal of success as an artist. I cried profusively in the final scenes.Watching this heart-rendering movie made me re-evaluate my own life-goals and career. As someone who dreamed of being the next Buddy Holly as a kid I can't help but think I lost my insperation somewhere along the long and dusty road. Doing what I do now is OK but it's just not what I signed up for. As Justin says, "never give up on you're dreams." The man is a true inspiration for all and this movie proves what a decent all-round lad he is and what a superb role model for youngsters. This movie has it all - twists and turns, interal and external demons and a story of success and redemption.I recommend highly. Best movie I've seen since 'Terminator' with Arnie back in the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inspiration - I was so surprised.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People that love blood and guts horror movies rate them high, people that hate them rate them low - the same with westerns, and the same with this movie. It's a documentary about Justin Beiber - so, if you don't like Justin Bieber, you won't like this movie, I'll bet. My daughter rented this, and I was in a band in high school and college, and I love watching almost anyone perform, so I watched it with her. What really caught my interest was the amazing story of his childhood - raised by a single teenage mom, and how he taught himself to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet, as he grew up. The footage of this is really outstanding in the movie. As the story unfolds of how he was discovered on YouTube by an executive in the recording industry, Scooter Braun,and then watch how he truly impressed Usher and L.A. Reid, the story becomes real. To see anyone watch their dreams come true is truly an experience, even if it's a young teenage pop singer. I was amazed that I would actually get emotional watching this. The perseverance paid off for him as he and his managers hit the streets in the movie, going to every radio station that would let Justin in, and arranging concerts - his first one on a very rainy day in front of 40 teens (and pre-teens). The movie's behind the scenes reality is very enlightening - comments from his vocal coach, commentary about his musical ability at 5 and 6 years old, watching his support team pray with him, witnessing a specialist tell him he has to cancel a concert because of vocal cord infection, and getting frank and sincere observations from those closest to him. Whether it's watching Secretariat, Rocky, or October Sky, the theme is the same - overcoming the odds, and being tenacious about your dreams. That's what the title is all about - Never Say Never. And even though it's very popular to hate Justin Bieber - I see it even with my own teenage son - he will still succeed, no matter what the IMDb score on this movie says. It just proves that he won't ever let anyone stop him chasing his dream. People love to get in on a negative dogpile -- just start bashing something, and everyone will just pile on and chime in like a bunch of chickens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Justin Bieber: 4/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never been a fan of the Bieber, never will, not even after watching the film. Justin Bieber in 3D is probably some girl's dream, but my dream is to see an entertaining film. The movie's tour documentary premise as it was advertised was not there at all. Instead, all you see is not much of the popstar himself but his family and friends. This is not a character study of Justin Bieber, but they want to present him as this great inspiration that people look up to. The idea might sound great, but inspiration wasn't what I got out of this. It's more like they want to make you want to be the guy instead of inspired by him.Throughout the film, we see him do his usual popstar stuff like doing his hair, taking off his shirt, saying "yo", and fist pumps. The movie's build up was the concert at Madison Square Garden where the popstar's career will rise. The concert was somewhat spectacular and great looking. But by the end, we learned nothing about Justin Bieber but that he has a talent for drums and the people around him are alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Cinematic Record of A Music Artist Extraordinaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Chu made the essential creative choice to film this brilliant concert documentary in 3D and it is the only format that could possibly capture the dynamic stage presence of Mr. Justin Bieber. This motion picture serves as an important cinematic record of the stunning power of a Bieber performance and captures beautifully the genius of a young man who has entranced millions of followers. After setting one stage after another ablaze with his talent, finally a film does justice to the overwhelming artistic gifts of arguably the greatest music artist of our time. Even those somehow unfamiliar with Bieber will find this a moving, awe inspiring, electric experience of towering proportions. The insights into the man himself as well as his music will prove invaluable to those who have just discovered this artist as well as the fans who have recognized his majestic presence for many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st i used to think that Justin is tagged as gay from what OTHERS call him..but my opinion about him changed drastically once i watched his movie. I think this movie has got a good head start of emotional content and passion for music in Justin Bieber. His family background, his gifted talent for musical instruments. And having the courage to rise up high in-spite of family problems.. Even though i'm not a film 'critic' in that sense, but after some collision, my heart and brains have given this film its rating.After all, getting the approval from Top artistes like Usher and others at such a young age..and selling out a landmark like Madison Square Garden is definitely not a joke. And winning the hearts of almost every girl out there in the country? Doesn't seem 'Gay' from any angle..maybe the guys out there are simply jealous.</fullReview>

It's a good message, he followed his dream and it's paying off.

If you have no opinion on Justin Bieber I would advise to just wait for the DVD and don't waste your money seeing this. Now if your a big fan of Justin Bieber then go and see this as you will probably enjoy it. I believe that it was a mistake for the "documentary" to be produced in 3D. Personally I found the movie boring as I already knew about Bieber and how he became famous, I only went to the theater as my younger sister wanted to see it.

		<shortDescription>Good movie to know more about Bieber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be sincere, viewing this movie as a concert documentary or entertainment film for fans, it worth good compliments, on the basis that i'm no Bieber's fan or hater, after this movie, I become more like this artist. On the point of documentary, it combines many home video and preparation works, to my surprises that the editing is in a good flow and tight, every single cut has it's simple idea to express, but none of them are meaningless, the combination with live concert is good in it's field. The time with family shows the sincerity of Bieber, that's kind of touching moments in the movie. All the videos in this movie showed the personal character of Bieber, that he is optimistic, sincere, talented, and kind. The instrument talents since his childhood also astonished me, no majestic skill, but very neutral, music is in his blood. On the point of entertainment film for fans, there are plenty of home videos that show how he live beyond stage, and how the concert and album made, or watch the best moments of the concert, all of it were done in a good place, thanks to the good editing of this movie. To sum up, i'm a neutral audience to Bieber, however this movie catched my eyes because it's really put things right; but if you don't like watching many trivial things about a normal boy, or you simply don't like his music, this movie would not be a good choice for you.</fullReview>

Just look at the Rotten Tomatoes review, 64%. I find it sad not only that people are hating so hard on the film, but also that people hate so much on Bieber himself. Whether you like what he makes or not it is is still music and it is no reason to despise someone.

		<shortDescription>How Biebermania might just be justified.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to lose the real Justin Bieber within the Biebermania that has swept the world, turning most of the young star's concerts into ostensible national events, regardless of location. If a bit of traffic and squealing girls was all it was, most wouldn't mind too much, but Biebermania is not something that you can easily escape. Social media platforms, notably Twitter, have become circle jerks for Bieber fans to reassure themselves that they are still the majority, and therefore cool. In fact, the more one considers the whole phenomenon, the more one has to accept that it is not Bieber that drives or affects the hatred a great many have with him, rather it's the manner in which his fans show their affection.Thankfully, for all concerned (except perhaps the real haters), Chu's film focuses on the source of Biebermania, not the effect. Beginning with the first YouTube videos of young Justin strumming his guitar to NeYo, we get the real Justin Bieber story, told by those who were there before love for Justin was determined by how loud they could squeal or how quickly they could get something to trend. His grandparents, who helped raise him, are wonderfully supportive and charmingly unaware of the impact of Bieber's brand. His mother, far younger and attractive than I certainly expected, is as proud as you would expect, and in a media landscape where mothers are often shown to expect so much of their offspring, it's comforting that she really does seem to have her son's interests at heart.And finally, there's Bieber himself. Thrown into a world and a level of stardom that he surely can't have ever imagined, he doesn't appear yet to have let it sink in. Shown enjoying the company of old school friends and hawking outside a local theatre, Chu manages to establish enough of a link between the Bieber of YouTube anonymity and the Bieber of Madison Square Gardens to convince you that while the brand may grow and develop daily, Bieber himself has not changed. You can manufacture to a point, but can you teach the musical ability (Bieber plays a host of instruments), the charisma, the voice, the showmanship? Probably not.There is something for everyone in this, it really is a marketer's dream. For the fans, the insight to Bieber, his entourage and his general being will have them buying DVDs. For those who aren't fans, this isn't just a marketing tool, it's an expose about teenage stardom, about the power of viral media and the value of hard work, regardless of age and experience. You might not necessarily be converted to his music, but you'll enjoy the musician (and a musician he is).Concluding Thought: You can dislike the music, but it's hard to fault the work ethic, the charm and the determination to succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I'm really surprised at all the horrible reviews out there. Is it for the movie or for Justin Bieber? Honestly folks he's not that bad and certainly doesn't warrant all this venom.The film itself will never be a contender for any Oscars even in the documentary category. It's nothing more than a compilation from the Bieber tour from last year together with some home video of little Justin growing up in Canada with a single parent. Other than his talent it sounds like he had quite the normal life up to a point. So those who rent the DVD could actually listen to him without all the accompanying screaming from his pubescent and prepubescent fans.He's a pop bubblegum singing star the latest in a long line of them who last a few years and then fade away and live well the rest of their lives if they've saved and invested their earnings. If Justin is managed properly he'll have a longer lasting career. Only time will tell.I will say this in his defense that I had no opinion of him at all pro or con until I heard a story that during some down time when he decided to do normal adolescent things, he got bullied at some arcade where he was doing video games and he was accused of homosexuality and I mean with the crudest kind of slang in that regard. From how the story was related young Mr. Bieber went out without entourage because normal kids don't have an entourage and he wanted to be normal.I have enormous respect for him because he could have just downplayed the whole thing, but instead chose to lend his name to an anti-bullying campaign in his native Canada. And for you Justin, I hope Justin Bieber: Never Say Never does well in the DVD market and you have a long and prosperous career. Show all the doubters, young man.</fullReview>

But the fact that these annoying 2 year old girls were screaming and almost killing each every time Bieber came on screen was so irritating. The only reason I didn't leave halfway was because it was fun with your friends to really make fun of him. And half the movie was just Usher praising his talents. I recommend any body who wants to see the movie should just wait for the DVD. Do not waste $15 on this movie. And my respect for Bieber has seriously decreased.

		<shortDescription>Justified Bieber Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time Magazine recently listed Justin Bieber as one of the most influential people in the world. Kudos to them; they are astute in keeping up with world culture. Beyond the millions of people that are captivated with him, Bieber is a fascinating figure. His existence inspires irrational hatred and confused admiration in seemingly all who encounter him. He is an ideal subject for a movie, and his presence appropriately compelled me to watch the documentary Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. The film is hardly well-fashioned, but has enough meat to warrant a viewing even for those who are uninterested in him.The movie is actually quite repetitive and these three sequences repeat constantly: biographical information from a family member or production personnel, comment from a fan, except from a performance. Bieber began as a middle class child of a single mother living quietly in Ontario. He demonstrated musical ability from a young age and learned how to play drums before he was 10 years old. His mother began recording videos of him covering songs like "Respect" by Aretha Franklin and placed them on Youtube. As he became more popular, he was eventually signed and became a celebrity overnight.Almost immediately after he became famous, Bieber was subject to strange, personal disgust from a lot of people. I did an experiment and asked several people why they did not like him. "I'm not sure," was a common response. His fans aren't sure either. Many of his contemporary fans are interviewed and provide us with intimate information about their level of devotion to him. Many read multiple gossip columns about him daily and berate his girlfriend Selena Gomez with death threats. Bieber grew organically through the tween and teen population by the sweetness of his music and his androgynous appearance. One fan says she doesn't want to have sex with him, only that he's so cute. It's apparent that, for now, Bieber has a nice niche as the younger counterpart for girls who are not old enough to crush on Robert Pattinson and Johnny Depp. A lot of the hate he receives may be people's response to the larger cultural shift of greater tolerance femininity within men. It may also be why some of his fans see him as more of a friend than a potential romantic interest.The frequent music clips, included because this is ostensibly a concert film, are actually unwelcome. It would have been a lot more insightful if more interviews had been included, especially of non-fans like the parents of concert-goers. Instead the movie pauses for a few minutes as more footage is revealed. The filmmakers should have released an official concert slide show and left the movie as a pure documentary. The only people who are really going to appreciate the clips are the fans who haven't attended a concert. Everyone else will be as entertained as they are open-minded even if it's a big advertisement.Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On A Par With 'Michael Jacksons This Is It'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its clear from the other reviews here that Justin Bieber is not the most liked figure on Planet Earth. However, rating this as a documentary/concert movie, this surely is the best we've seen since Michael Jacksons This Is It. I was a never a fan of his and I'm still not a fan now, but John Chu makes a groundbreaking insight into the mindset of the worlds biggest global star and how he got to be where he is from his humble beginnings in a small town in Canada. It was inevitable that this film would be labelled as a cash-in due to the gimmicky 3D and this biographical film being rolled out so recently in his career. However this is the highest grossing concert movie since 1984, and I would urge people, fans and non fans alike, to see this.Counting down the 10 days until Biebers biggest concert in Madison Square Garden,N.Y, concert footage from that show is interwoven with the buildup to this concert and the obstacles he had to overcome as a child to get to where he is. Its undoubtedly a fascinating story, not just a Disney-manufactured child star, a kid who had talent. His friends and family, R'n'B star Usher and manager Scooter Braun all give insights into Biebers sudden rise to fame.Whether you like his music or not is irrelevant; this is the true underdog story, how someone talented enough was able to reach the giddy heights of global superstar. Yes he's cocky, yes this film is an exercise in his evergrowing ego, but if you can see past that than this is a truly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just before I start, I admit I am a belieber, and I'm proud of it too! Firstly, I went to see this film when it came out in the cinema, and although I am a massive fan, I didn't expect it to be incredible. How wrong I was. It tells the story of Justin Bieber's rise to fame in a very interesting way, and shows just how incredible it is that he went from being a normal kid to a global superstar in a matter of a couple of years. This film is a down-to-earth, true story which inspires many people, and was filmed very well. Justin isn't everyone's favourite person, and a lot of people put him down to being an over-hyped, teen heartthrob. However, this film shows him in his true colours; he is a genuinely talented person who can play guitar, drums and piano extremely well, and also has a breathtaking voice. So for all you haters: if you don't like him, just don't see it. But if you're not sure, then just give this film a go, because even if you don't like him personally, please appreciate the fact that he is a normal boy who made it big, and has extraordinary talent. Love you Justin, you're incredible and just keep doing what you're doing. Never Say Never ;-D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first, i honestly didn't want to watch this movie.i just watched because a friend of mine happens to be of Bieber's adoring fans. but as for me, i'm not a big Justin Bieber fan nor am i anti him, so i really didn't expect much from this movie. Honestly, i thought it was nothing but a waste of money and time. Why pay for something you can watch on you-tube or search in the net..As i watched the movie, i felt slightly moved by the story. it's not that unique or anything, we've heard it before, and thats how stardom starts. the only thing different about his was the fact that he was discovered in you tube. However, what i liked about this movie was the honesty in it. this is not very common in other autobiographies. you may feel the pouring out of emotion that each member of his team showed which was a bit touching. the simplicity of his life was a pleasant. i admire many people worked hard to make his career possible and the commitment, passion &amp; perseverance that Justin Bieber showed.in my own opinion, i wouldn't say that this is a waste of money because if you are really a Justin Bieber fan or as they say a "Bieliber", then this movie wouldn't be a waste of money at all. in fact you'd probably enjoy it. But if you are anti Jb, might as well not watch it because it's a waste of your time. but if your just like me, neutral about him, Its not so bad. its okay but nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Justin Bieber: Never Say NeverThe best part about being a child star is that when you're older you can sell your teeth online.Fortunately, the teen idol in this musical/documentary/commercial has not got to that stage in his career, as of yet.With only days to go before his sold-out concert at Madison Square Gardens, singer/dancer Justin Bieber begins to loose his voice after a play-date with his old friends.Meanwhile, the young performer's life is recounted via home videos and Youtube clips of him singing on Canadian street corners.Eventually, Justin's past and present biographies converge on stage, where rabid fans bare witness to Justin's My World Tour - featuring Ludicrous and Sean Kingston.Pre-packaged for the tween market, this 3-D biography/concert will enrage his detractors, but appease his admirers.What's more, it's proof that contacting a young boy that you saw on the Internet, whom you'll later exploit for profit, isn't creepy.

IJustin Bieber - Never Say Never even listed Mr. Bieber (tongue in cheek) as one of my Top Ten Reasons Why Twitter is Stupid. When my wife asked me to rent his new movie Never Say Never, I decided to try and earn some husband points and watch this monstrosity.I admit it, I liked it! Surprising, although I still don't love the music, I really did like the movie. The kid is very likable and it's wild to watch the sheer insanity of thousands of 13-year-old girls lose their minds. The movie also does a decent job of marketing him as a "down-to-earth" 15/16 year old trying to balance his super celebrity status and his desire to still be a teenage boy.As a social media addict, I loved the sub-story around the power of social media for Justin. I ended up writing an article based upon this - feel free to take a look if you want to see the value that social media had for Bieber.http://bit.ly/lRvhtL Bottom line, Bieber haters aside, the movie was definitely not a "1.3". It's a feel good movie about a hard working kid (hate or love his music) that has done good. He's scandal free (which will hopefully continue) and definitely more watchable for kids than the Lady Gaga, etc. madness. I can only wonder what my 2 year old boy will be "entertained by" when he's older.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone but not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a mother of a young daughter so naturally, this movie was a big deal. Because I knew that young girls love to scream when they get together, we did not go and see it in the theatre... I could only imagine the insanity. At home we watched the movie and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. I do find it a rather inspiring story about a little boy who dreamt a big dream and actually had the drive to accomplish it. Here's my beef: The reviews of other viewers. Here's some of the most common complaints about the movie: 1.) He's overly confident- Yup, he is sometimes but stop and be honest for a minute. If you were the hottest thing and making millions while you sleep, wouldn't it get to your head a bit? I mean, come on.2.)He's not talented- He made it big via youtube. Obviously there was something there otherwise he would've just been like the millions of other people on youtube that live forever in obscurity.3.) His music sucks- He is a tween/teen pop singer. If you don't like that style of music, you probably won't like this movie. You also wouldn't have like a movie about N'sync 10 years ago either. Bottomline, this movie is not for everyone. I thought it wasn't too bad. It's important to remember several things: He's just a kid; He's a popstar; this is a music documentary which are traditional not that good and shallow. Don't try to read to deep into this movie and accept it for what it is &amp; you might enjoy it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone check me for Bieber fever symptoms?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of Justin Bieber through his song, "One Time". His next hit song, "Baby" soon followed and I loved it, too! I found myself singing along with it every time it went on the radio. I then did some research on the kid. After lots of videos and some Googling, I decided that I didn't like him. He seemed too stuck-up and there were many Justin Bieber haters. I thought, "If there are so many haters, there MUST be something wrong with him."My DISLIKE for him slowly changed to LIKE after I really gave the time and listened to all his albums. My LIKE for Justin Bieber changed to ADMIRATION after attending his concert. He was sick during his concert, but he since he still managed to deliver a kick-ass performance despite his sickness. My ADMIRATION changed to RESPECT and LOVE after watching "Justin Bieber: Never Say Never". This movie made me a Belieber.This movie slash documentary gives people a chance to see what happens in Justin Bieber's real life. It's a delicious treat for Beliebers. I didn't get to catch this film when it first came out since I wasn't a huge fan of him yet. I did however, hear lots of positive comments about it. One comment that stood out the most was, "People who disliked Justin Bieber will change after watching this film." I refused to believe it when I first heard that comment. It made the movie seem like a big phenomenon. I thought that it was too good to be true! Let me tell you, I was wrong.This movie isn't like a normal documentary as it was portrayed to be. It's fun and it really gets your attention. We see photos and video clips from Justin's childhood and we get to see how Justin's fame and everything started. In between these memorabilia, we see Justin's concert in Madison Square Garden. I love that. It gives people (who didn't get to catch his performance in MSG) a chance to see what went on during that concert. Aside from that, we see just plain old Justin. He behaved like any normal teenager. He was laid-back and carefree in the clips that were shown and it made me like him even more.After all that, let me just ask: IMDb users gave this a 1.2 rating? Are you serious? How many people actually paid attention the film? OR EVEN MORE SO, how many people actually WATCHED the movie? I used to dislike Justin Bieber, but I never let hate cloud my judgment. Haters should really just stop and think. Did you rate this purely out of dislike for Justin Bieber? The hardcore JB fans who scream their lungs out are just as annoying as the JB haters who hate for no legitimate reason at all.This was a great documentary. I just hope that nothing was edited to make fans happy. I'm also thankful that I didn't watch this in the theaters since I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have liked him, when loads of screaming girls were around me. Pretty good film. The fans are crazy, though. This movie proved it.Viewed on: May 16, 2011</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the truth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 48 years old and took my 13 year old daughter to see this. Intended to get a nap while there but I HAVE TO NOW SAY IT WAS PURE ENTERTAINMENT! The way the film is put together is fantastic. Tells his life story and his achievements, IMDb should block all the Beiber Bashers who are just doing it for the same reason that kids say they hate school dinners, cos it ain't hip to like them. This film inspires young people, never say never. Justin followed a dream and achieved it. I truly believe that this film tells the truth about Justin and people who aren't real fans push back against it as it actually proves that he is very talented and has achieved what many people want. their dream. Jealousy is a sad trait. But I suggest you forget if you like his music, watch this film and enjoy it for what it is. A fun story, well put together, about a person who has achieved the ultimate. What he said he was going to do when he was 5 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not sure why it got such bad reviews. Its not really my type of music but the kid has real talent. To be able to play any instrument and sing in key takes talent. You get to see it from an early age. At times during the movie i felt a little sorry they are working the kid to death. He seems to really enjoy what hes doing though.I found it interesting how he was found threw you-tube. That should give hope to a lot of other talents out there.I think i may of seen him perform once on late night talk shows jimmy Fallon makes fun of him a lot. I kinda wanted to see who he actually is and i watched the whole thing from start to finish.I even enjoyed the previews must of caught me in a good mood?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marvelous observation of youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the film itself may not be the most original with it's structure or format, it is a very important embodiment of the genuine emotion in (modern) youth. Behind all the showboating and the cheese, there are many real moments to experience that are more real and more effective than 90% of what you get out of most movies and TV.Bieber is the newest child prodigy and will no doubt be looked at as a legend in the long run. It is amusing, upsetting, and not very surprising that the majority of the people commenting on the film out there are ignorant males who are either bitter and envious, or simply can't take the time to observe the kid's back story and understand that he is not just a manufactured puppet like most pop stars, but instead a miraculous case who seemed to just be born with godlike musical abilities.I am a 26 year old dude who played in metal bands for years. My favorite films are Evil Dead, Enter The Void, Altered States, and 2001: A Space Odyssey to name a few. I'm into extremes: violence, sex, discomfort. And, even I can see that was Bieber has is very comparable to MAGIC.People whine that it's Bieber's "ego" that bothers them. But, his ego is just what makes him so fascinating. Yes, he is living in a different world. A world that allows him to be full, if not overflowing, with positivity, charm, and bliss. For you to have the opportunity to observe this for a couple of hours on a big screen (in 3-D) if you must, is a marvelous opportunity. Just because you are old and you hate your life does not mean that you should stop appreciating the power of youth and what they feel. It's NATURE and it's one of the most powerful things in the world (and apparently in the world of American entertainment). But in Bieber's case specifically, we have an even more rare scenario - a kid that is actually bursting with unbelievable talent.Push it away, or get over yourself and allow yourself to enjoy the greatest capture of modern youth in some time. There has never been anyone quite like Bieber in the exact place that he is now - only 1 year into his career and selling out Madison Square Garden off of one album, 17 years old and at the peak of his youth (not yet burdened by the pressures we feel as we carry over into adulthood). It is beyond human, and fascinating, and if you can't appreciate it I feel sorry for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provides a New Side to the Justin-Bieber Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first went on to IMDb today and checked this film's page, I was super surprised that it got a 1/10. I started reading through the reviews, and they all really say the same thing: 1/10 because it had too much of Justin Bieber singing, 1/10 because I hate Justin Bieber, 1/10 because it just showed how conceited Justin Bieber is, 1/10 because of the annoying screaming girls in the theater.First, I'm going to say that I am completely partial in this review. I personally don't have a taste for this particular artist's music, but what right-minded male would? It was written for tween girls.Second, you really get what you came for. If you went into the movie thinking, "Well this movie is just going to reinforce my hatred for Justin Bieber", then guess what? The movie will reinforce your hatred for Justin Bieber. However, if you came to the movie with an open mind, you might enjoy the story of a pop-sensation, no matter how corny his music, that rose to stardom seemingly overnight. I also don't understand why you would see a movie that was part concert if not to hear the music of the artist. All it would have taken was a simple click on the movie's title to realize that a major part of the movie was to be taken up by singing. That's how the film producers created it, because they wanted to draw Justin Bieber's audience. You can't capture little girl's attention with a documentary. You need something to keep their focus, and that place was filled by scenes from a concert I'm assuming very little of those girls got to go to.Third, I would like to point out that this movie did what it was supposed to do. It showed the day-to-day life of Bieber and his story up to now. Isn't that the purpose of a documentary?There were, of course, problems with the movie, but that's to be expected. The 3D was unnecessary if not bordering on outright annoying. The whole movie was a bit too long for my taste, with a run-time of about 2 hours there really is only so much of Bieber you can watch in a sitting. So for those issues, 5/10. Don't be so quick to judge a book by its cover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a Justin Bieber fan; I never was. The only reason I went was because my cousin (Bieber obsessed) dragged me along. I am actually glad I went to it because it was surprisingly enjoyable. I like Justin a lot more and I think he has a genuinely good voice. He was absolutely adorable as a child and very talented. I even got goosebumps at some parts because I never realized how good this guy is. The only reason I never liked him before was the fact that his screaming fans are unbearable. I have seen a lot of movies that were terrible but I wouldn't class this as one of them.There wasn't many in the cinema I went to and there was no screaming, thankfully. The 3D was very good when he was in concert, especially near the end. Overall I think that if you keep an open mind and leave your previous opinions about him behind you'll actually enjoy it, because I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beiber film a good barometer of the times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never Say Never showed me a young kid who is extremely musical and is caught up in his own dream. This is not a negative thing; his dream is the dream of many. That he is not full of attitude, behaving badly, or found to be a corrupt and duplicitous fame grabber perhaps puts people off, or makes them think he's not real. That's understandable. But that DOESN'T discount his great musical ability top up with not a little charm. He was generous to his fans, hard-working, full of life and connected to his roots. His success as a pop singer seems to irritate many of the reviewers here, but one has to ask, "Why did they fork over the money to watch this in the first place?" Me? I'm an older guy who was curious to see the 3rd largest grossing documentary in history. And to see this pop phenomenon I had heard quite a bit about but I really had little idea about. I was hoping that the 3D aspect would be more integrated into the film, and be more than just the concert footage, but it wasn't, and the use of it was somewhat contrived and not all that well executed. But the look into the Beiber's back story was great, as was meeting family &amp; friends, and I was quite charmed by the kid and his grounded-ness; not something I expected from a young teen with the world in the palm of his hand. The way he related to young kids, his friends, and even a young girl busking on the streets of his hometown were all quite real &amp; charming. In case it doesn't show, I was quite impressed by this kid.His music isn't what I'd call sophisticated, but then he wouldn't be much of a pop star if it was. That said, his voice *is* very nuanced and he is quite a talented musician (I noted in the credits that he shared the composer credit with a variety of people, plus did a few covers) so I look forward to what he might be offering up as he matures; not something I would've thought about when I entered the theatre, I assure you.As an aside, the night before I went I happened upon HARD DAYS NIGHT on TV and watched most of it, enjoying the small bits of 'drama' as the Beatles went from one song to the next. Richard Lester did a fine job of this film, it looked good, was of the times, and I enjoyed it once again, albeit yet another pop star vehicle of the time. To see NEVER SAY NEVER almost 50 years later gave me some perspective on this film that others may not have enjoyed. So although I give Bieber an A for Affort (!) I gave the film a 7 because I had a smile on my face the whole time and was thoroughly entertained by it.Rock-Docs tend to be fawning ventures in most cases, with little reality and even less honesty. I thought this film had much of the latter and was pleased to see it. I would recommend this to anyone who isn't a fan and is curious as to what this young singing sensation is all about.The film was a little long, but then I saw the Director's Fan Cut, so it is to be expected, I suppose.</fullReview>

It gives us insight to a boy who is going to be the biggest star in our generation... You older folk may have the Bee gee's and Micheal Jackson. But we have Bieber.How great would it have been to see Michael Jackson's transformation into a star? Well our generation get to!! with Justin. He doesn't come from a well financed background, just with a lung skill set and talented musician.Anyone who is a hater of Justin SHOULD see this movie to get a better perspective.Even my husband has a healthier respect for the guy... doesn't mean you have to like his music. Just respect where he has come from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My little girls have moved on from Miley and the "Joe Bros" and are now fixated on the dreamy-haired Justin Bieber. I expected all the bubble gum pop concert footage that makes tweens swoon, but I didn't expect a lot of behind-the-scenes storyline and historical footage...which was the most interesting to me and a pleasant surprise. I went in wanting to bash the kid for his early success, but came out with a new respect for the kid. He has busted his hump to earn everything he has gotten to this point and, while I'm not sure his star will shine forever as an artist, I think he'll have a huge career in the music biz. For being such a young guy with wheelbarrows full of cash, he seems to have his head screwed on plenty tight. The fact that he allowed an entire segment to be dedicated to making fun of his "fabulous" hair (looks like a fairly normal haircut to me), makes me like the kid even more. The only thing I didn't care for was a cameo by Snoop Dogg. I don't feel he's the best role model for little girls, 8-12 years old...but that's just me. Bottom line...if you're little girl wants to go, take her. You won't hate it, trust me.</fullReview>

Also, you guys are only giving it a bad review because you are all jealous, spineless pricks that don't know what a good movie is. The movie teaches you that not only is anything achievable, but at any age, any height, and size. It shows you Justin's quick rise to fame, and how he did it. Scooter Braun had made the best mistake ever, and Usher is lucky he didn't pass him by the second time. Bieber will not have a short career, he will be a legend. He kills it on the stage, and he kills it in this movie! PLUS. I recommend this to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK I'm not going to come on here and bash Justin Bieber, because that's OBVIOUSLY been done. Instead, I'm going to say what I saw. My 9 year-old daughter dragged me to this, and she loved me more for it after wards. I saw her leaning forward in her chair the WHOLE movie, and didn't say a word for the duration. And these girls that were in the movie, NUTS! I think they legitimately love this kid! That being said, I'll answer some other people on here, where they stated the fact that this kid's career is just getting started. So why put out a movie about his career? Well, quite frankly, has anything like this ever happened in history? A kid, talented in singing and instruments his whole life, was found from youtube, basically. That is a first, and that makes it original. They wouldn't have made a movie about it if there wasn't an interest. What I really saw about this kid was that he DOESN'T like doing the music he does. I think, quite frankly, he'd rather be in a 4 piece rock band. And, we'll probably see that. But, history has to run it's course and he has to do the teeny-bopper thing first. We've seen it before, and we'll see it again. I think that the wrong people found this kid, and hooked him up with the wrong people. If the lead-singer of Creed would've taken him under his wing, the music would be much better. But, less capitalizing! Remember, folks, it's all about money. This golden boy is making serious bank for himself and a bunch of corporate folks. That's going to continue! Get used to it! And yes I AM jealous of him. I'll admit that. I make 40,000 a year and work my butt off every day. This kid makes 40,000 a day and does nothing but sing well. Good for him. If I could, I would! As for the movie, yeah it sucked. But it's not in my demographic interest, so it gets a 5, not a 1. Grow up. I'll bet a 7 year old would give Gran Torino a 1, so that's my comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's good. Why do people waste so much negative energy on hate?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I am not a 16 year old girl, nor was I a Justin Bieber fan before seeing this movie. I was just curious to learn about this boy who was all over the media. I think it is sad to read all of the reviews with people saying hateful things and saying that it is okay to bully Justin Bieber. That is a horrible message and no one deserves to be bullied. That is a serious issue that you should be ashamed to be supporting. I am not saying you have to write a positive review if you didn't like it, but seriously lets try to be a bit more mature. It's kind of weird to see how many people state that he has no talent and doesn't work hard. Clearly this kid has talent. There are several videos of him as a child that are not edited or auto-tuned and you can tell the kid has talent. I mean, if you have spent any amount of time on youtube watching people sing, there are many, many, many people out there with no talent. This kid is not one of them. And he obviously works hard to succeed. So what if his fans are all teenage girls. That doesn't mean that he doesn't work hard at what he does. And if you don't want to be in a theatre full of screaming girls, go to the movie at a time when kids are in school or in bed. I went to a late show and there were 3 kids and the rest of the people were adults. Okay, so it's not the greatest movie out there, but after watching it I can honestly say that I have respect for this kid. He has talent and is genuine to his fans. So stop being hateful! It does nothing but create more negativity and hate. I mean, many of the people saying negative things haven't even seen the movie. I'm sorry, but are you not supposed to watch the movie BEFORE reviewing it? Silly peopleAll in all, good movie. Talented kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this on a promise that i would take my little cousin for her birthday, initially i was a fan of his music and thats as far as it went, I thought it would be torture to sit in a cinema with a hundred odd screaming girls though. However it wasn't too bad, yes they screamed a little but i dare anyone to sit in a cinema screen and not sing along, its almost impossible. I came out still a fan of his music but also with a lot more respect for him, he's a 16 year old that works his ass off even when he is really ill and tired/run down. Also i do think this film is a must watch for even non fans, Its really inspirational and shows you any dream is reachable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Parent Approves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this, I really had no clue as to what Justin Bieber was all about. My wife rented this on DVD for my 6 year old daughter so I ended up watching it over and over one weekend. I was pleasantly surprised. The 'documentary' or whatever you want to call it was informative and shows Justin from when he was a baby and how he showed musical prowess even as a toddler. It really is an amazing story and shows how with hard work dreams are attainable. As for the music, some of the songs are actually great. I knew the 'baby oh' song (which I never liked), but there are a few other songs that I heard that got me watching, particularly "you smile". Listen to his phrasing, he just has impeccable timing and his intonation during live performances is stunning. Not to mention the dude plays guitar really well, as a lefty too, and he's an incredible drummer. My own musical tastes are vast, but my favorites are progressive rock, especially Yes, Floyd, and old Genesis, as well as the Cure and Smiths/Morrissey. I was surprised that I actually was singing and playing along on guitar and piano to a lot of the songs because I've never been into pop. Overall it's a good watch for parents, obviously if you rented or watched this and you aren't a fan or parent you have serious problems - I have read some of the reviews here by twenty-something males &amp; the fact you are not only rating but reviewing this movie is pathetic. I understand there are haters - Back in my day a lot of people joked about NKOTB, but I think at least we acknowledged well these dudes are traveling the world, making millions and banging every girl in site. Kids today seem a lot more angry, hateful and jealous, content sitting in their house playing video games. The kid has serious talent, how some of the most respected musicians in the industry think so but you don't, maybe just maybe you are the one with the bad ear here? Just a possibility I am throwing out there. Peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming biop of the Biebster that takes us beyond the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a long experienced performing arts/drama teacher with a distaste for celebrity hype and a fear of seeing my own students sucked into the 'system'. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly pleased and not a little moved by this very entertaining look behind the scenes of this talented, charming, friendly Canadian teen who stumbled into mega-stardom almost by accident. Shame his music is so bland and that the screamers do dominate some screenings. I went early to a showing in Jerusalem - of all places - and the noise was kept to a minimum. The film is really worth watching, quite entertaining in it's own right - though the 3D process has little to do with it. We're shown vignettes from his childhood, which do establish his genuine musical ability, but we're also given glimpses into his charm - which seems to be the real secret of his success. Backstage views are fascinating, and John Chu has done an excellent job of putting it all together, because it holds one's interest from beginning to end, and it winds up being an invaluable documentation of the whole teen celeb process. Does it answer the question as to how this youngster catapulted into the stratosphere and shows no signs of stopping? Not at all. It continues to remain an unfathomable mystery, since his evident talent and charm do not add up to a sufficient explanation. But the film does succeed in showing him as a perfectly ordinary, likable human being - swept up into a whirlwind.Too be honest, I would really rate this an 8/10, but I've given this a 10/ 10 simply to counteract the childish haters who both reviewed and responded favorably to the previous reviewer's negative rating of 1. The petty jealously and resentment surrounding this youngster have now become very wearisome. The celebrity machine is indeed an alarming beast, but the boy himself is not at fault, and the film itself makes him very human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie and very inspiring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because my daughter wanted to go. I am a fan of a few of Justin's songs, but I really became more of a fan after seeing the movie. I thought the movie very inspiring. It talks about his love of music and carries us through his early childhood until now. I was amazed by this young man's talent. He not only has a beautiful voice, but he plays numerous musical instruments, writes much of his music and dances. This movie made me laugh. Justin is a very funny guy. This movie also made me cry. This young man is totally dedicated to his fans who basically got his career moving in the right direction. I think we will see this young man continue to grow in the music business...I personally think he would be great in the acting world...he has a wonderful personality. He is an amazing young man with a family and group of friends that stand behind him. As an adult and a lover of all types of music, I am really discouraged by all the horrible comments/reviews regarding Justin. For goodness sake he is a child. A child who is growing into a wonderful young man....I do not understand the hate. I have a feeling that half the people that wrote reviews, never liked Justin Bieber in the first place or didn't even bother to see the movie. Me...I would definitely watch the movie again. The kid makes me smile, what can I say. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you take the time to look beyond all of the flashing lights and young screaming girls, then you will see an inspiring story about a young man who stopped at nothing to make his dreams come true. Justin Bieber started out as a young man with a dream of singing, and thanks to his perseverance and no giving in attitude, he succeeded. Despite his mother giving birth to Justin at a young age, Patty raised her son well. Since he was young he had a natural talent for music, and in the end he was able to share that talent at Madison Square Garden. Justin Bieber is a wonderful role-model for people of all ages, and he teaches his millions of fans from all over the world to never say never.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw that most of the reviews here in IMDb.com was all a no-go. But for me, this movie changed me a lot. It made me feel how important it is to keep chasing your dreams and never saying never. I had mixed emotions watching this. I went from pumped-up to sad to happy to "awh..." and to "whoa!" Watching Justin's life change changed me. I learned that it's not easy to be a star. You gotta deal with different dilemmas and problems. I learned that a life of a star is hard but cool. This film affected me a lot. I felt a deep want inside my heart to chase my dream of becoming and International Country Pop Artist. Yeah, Justin is one of the many people in the list of who inspired me to chase my dreams of becoming a star just like him.I'm trying hard here and I know that I can be who I want to be if I just keep chasing my dreams and NEVER SAY NEVER!Who cares if you'll rate this down or, or maybe called me fag or whatever you call me. I say that this movie was awesome because it changed me a lot, inspired me a lot, and kept me chasing my dreams.Thanks for reading my review and if you may, please check out my YouTube page: http://www.youtube.com/shane243546covers also please follow me on twitter: @shane24354657I'll be happy for the support you can offer to me.

		<fullReview>reading the reviews on this site I was mightily apprehensive about viewing this movie. But to my delight the reviewers missed the point and were viewing with a prejudice, this film is for the fans, 8-15 year old girls, and to that extend serves its purpose. The 3D is a red herring as only 10% of the movie is actually 3D but as a documentary of Biebers life and the tour that was being used as a backdrop I found it to be good viewing. I knew nothing about the boy and was dragged by my 10 year old daughter but I found it enjoyable and discovered how the modern music industry works and how social networks play a major part in the industry and also that the central figure was a normal and talented 16 year old.</fullReview>

It simply shows if you strive hard enough for your dreams they will come true.

It is so wonderful that he has been able to fulfill all of his dreams and wishes. It is also wonderful that he has so many amazing fans that support and love him.

		<fullReview>I for one really enjoyed this movie. I liked this movie because it really captured how Justin's world got so big, so fast. It explains how he wasn't scared of anything, he had talent and wanted to show it off. It really took a long time to get where he is now and I really respect him for all of the obstacles he's come across. I am a 20 year old guy who happens to like Justin Bieber very much, I got all of his albums, two posters, his book, and Never Say Never on DVD. What, a 14 year girl can like a male pop star but, a 20 year old guy can't? Anyway, I was not surprised when I saw this movie got such bad reviews because people take one look at him and make judgments. So for all you people out there that think "Oh, I don't like Justin Biber and know nothing about him, so without seeing the movie I'll just give it 1/10 stars because everybody else does." Lighten up and see the movie because it really lets you know that he had a once in a lifetime opportunity come at him at full speed.In the end, I really enjoyed this movie and hope I helped anybody wanting to see it. 10/10 stars for me because I understand his story and will not be a part of the negative life the Bieber haters want to be in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent success story on Justin Bieber!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>( may contain spoilers) First of all I would like to congratulate Justin Bieber on his success. I know myself growing up in a small town in Ontario, Canada it can be quite challenging. We don't all have the same opportunities that many Americans have. Thankfully because of the internet, you-tube, twitter,the early support of many fans, Usher, and many others who introduced Justin to great people to help make his success possible in the United States. Along with Justin's brilliance he was able to be noticed and given the opportunity to show case his talents to the world! I don't know why so many people are giving this movie a 1 out of 10. It's the story of his life, a documentary. How can you give his true life story a 1 out of 10? I thought it was very well directed and it showed a lot of the obstacles he faced through out his life to get this far and how despite all of his success he still has many obstacles to face in his present and future. It was very raw and real! I can understand that if there are screaming fans in the theatre while you watch his documentary that is may be quite difficult to enjoy the movie and hear what is going on. That is no reason to give a 1 out of 10 that just means maybe renting the movie may be better for you.Justin is a fearless young man, and would sing in front of anybody no matter what. He is not afraid. He wants to please his fans and has a extremely hard work ethic for a young kid or for that matter for anyone at any age. He grew up in a very supportive environment around is Mother, Father, Grandparents, and family. He followed his dreams and made his dreams come true.Just imagine what this world would be like if we all had the courage that Justin has to follow our dreams! If you are a fan of watching someone live out their dreams then I encourage you to watch this documentary! If you are someone who is jealous of Justin's success and feel that you just want to take another opportunity to write a bad review about him. I say do yourself a favour and save your criticism for yourself and your own insecurities about your own life.</fullReview>

Are you serious?Anyway if you're NOT really a fan of Justin Bieber but for some reason you do want to see this movie, you should not go &amp; see it in theaters, because there will be girls screaming, dancing and singing so loud you won't hear nor see a thing and they will make you hate Justin even more(However, if you are a fan, it's an awesome experience:).It's a movie you should see at home by yourself. Just to see how talented this kid really is. I just hate hearing people talk about how Justin has no talent but they don't even know him. And I don't mean, they don't know him personally, 'cause I don't either, but from the videos or movie. You can't judge him on Baby video. I have a few friends who were talking all kinds of bad things about him but after seeing a movie they left theater singing one of his songs.So yeah, watch a movie(at home if your not really a fan), &amp; then judge, rate and hate. But I'm 99% sure you won't hate him after seeing it. First hand experience.P.s.: Sorry about the grammar. P.p.s: I saw it with my family and we all liked it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not to show off, to get publicity, or to get attention. This is a just the story of an amazing 17 (almost 18) year old Canadian boy from Stratford, whose ultimate dream came true. No, it's not a horrible movie. I know people who didn't like Justin Bieber, and this movie really changed them. It makes them look beyond his image. You really get to know him, and you find that all of this isn't just some stupid act. Justin is truly a special gift to the music world, no matter how many people disagree. Whoever says "ewww he sucks" and "eww he's so gay and ugly" is just jealous because they didn't sell out America's biggest and most iconic venue in 22 MINUTES. They're just jealous of someone's success because they got lucky. Just because you "hate" Justin Bieber, it doesn't mean you have to rag on him and diss his movie. No matter how many of you haters there are, there will always be over 40 million fans backing him up. He's not just some stupid fame whore. He's really working hard to entertain us and make us happy. So, I'll say this movie was amazing and it changes your perspective. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never really liked Justin Bieber. I didn't hate him or anything but I thought he was a little girl with no talent. So I saw this movie by force and I found a respect for him. He is talented and pretty inspiring. I had no idea that he could play so many instruments and could actually sing somewhat. Honestly, the best part of the film is when he goes up to a little girl and tells her not to give up on her dreams because he used to play on the same steps as her. If that was the whole point of the movie, it would have been excellent. His monologue about how people told him he'd never make it or he'd never sell out MSG, was again inspiring. It was a movie made for his fans, teen girls, who need someone telling them not to give up on things. It wasn't exactly the best made film, I mean the 2-minute obligatory devotion to his hair wasn't exactly Oscar worthy. It was an enjoyable movie though, it was funny if you laughed at the crying fans and such. It definitely doesn't deserve a 1 by any means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the worst movie I've ever paid to see in a theater, but it was far from the best. I can't say I was expecting much, and what I got was about what I expected. I saved a few bucks by choosing not to see it in 3D, and I'm grateful I did. There is nothing in this movie that should have warranted it being in 3D. NOTHING! I am a 40-something man, and I saw it with my daughter who is a mild fan. She's not like ANY of the little girls portrayed in the movie. She, herself, thought the movie was just okay. To call it a movie, I think, is a stretch. It was 2 hour documentary about him and his journey into the heights of the music business. It' not necessarily boring, but not really exciting stuff either. The entertaining parts are the sad little girls screaming and crying about him. After seeing the film, I am left with more respect for him and the talent he has. He has great potential. But, with that, comes a huge price that many before him with the same or even less abilities have fallen, and fallen hard. I couldn't help but wonder how long he will last. At times in the film there were different music biz people around saying how amazing he was and singing his praises, and you could just see the dollar signs in their eyes. It's a tough business, and it eats people up. He is potentially, as good as Michael Jackson was, but we all know how that story ended. I hope Justin's ends on a better note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing all the negative reviews, I was shocked. I think that this movie was AMAZING!! I do not see how people rated it a 1 out of 10. Honestly, there are so many haters... But why? This movie shows just HOW MUCH commitment a 16 year-old boy puts into pleasing his fans. Sometimes he just wants to go home, back to Stratford, but he pulls through, and does it all for his fans. He does it to show the haters that he can rise above. That is why I am so shocked with the reviews. Because he has worked his butt off for this movie, and had given away so much of his privacy. Jon, the director did an AMAZING job on documenting the film, and I absolutely LOVE how you get the chance to meet all of Justin's closest members. You get to see a new side to the "Baby" singer, with the heart-stopping hair flip. Be thankful for what he has done, because he has done it all for you. He has sucked it up, and performed through the hardest points of his life. He takes the criticism with pride, but it obviously can't be easy. Stop being so negative about the movie, and open your eyes and see how great it really is. Justin Bieber is an inspiration to over eight million Beliebers all across the world, and you don't get that many fans for nothing.So lastly, I would like to say that i support Justin through everything he does. I think that he did an AMAZING job in his movie Never Say Never, and I want to see it over, and over, and over (even though I've already seen it four times!). Ignore all the negative comments, and when you go to see this movie, sit back, relax, and prepare to be blown away, by the cutest 17 year-old on the planet! I promise, that you will not be disappointed... And don't be surprised if you let out a little squeal when Bieber preforms his flawless hit, "Runaway Love!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Justin Bieber I learned back when he was not known to a large audience. I learned about him since his first covers of famous songs. And the voice I liked it. In general, I like to look on Youtube "singing" of people. Them there are many, but few people are lucky. I can only select Justin Bieber and Cody Simpson. Careers Justin is developing rapidly. 4 albums, books, movies, millions of fans around the world, but there are no such people who would not be haters. And they have Justin very much. I've heard a lot of bad words in his direction, but any worthwhile thought they had not. Why insult someone who you has done nothing wrong? So, what makes us happy movie? First, it video, which shows the life of Justin. Secondly, this video from the concerts. In Russia he was not, and I was not in America, Europe and Australia, respectively, I is not been to his concerts and I was wondering to see what they are. Plot of the film does not, it's just different spots, to unite, but fans of Biber, whom I am, this should be interesting. Of course, this film contains all of Justin's favorite songs: Baby, One time, etc. Since Justin can still be called a child, many adults (and only) he's not like it. But believe me, soon, it may not be your idol &#x2116;1, but he will be of interest to you. Especially because now he starts to rap. Won't Stop - listen to this song, you should like it, the more sense it is very good (haters said that in his songs does not make sense). In general, about the film I told him a little as principle the talk is nothing but admirers of the young Canadian singer, who last week turned 17, the movie seems interesting. P.S. Justin has merited everything that he has. You are just jealous of him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing movie, exceeded my expectations.I did like Bieber before the movie but now I'm a Huge fan. Many of my friends hated him but after taking them to see it they are all fans, even the guys. I have yet to meet someone who did not like this movie.It is not a concert movie, it does have scenes from his concert but it is not the main focus of the movie. It shows his rise to fame and that he had to work for it, it was not just given to him. It has some funny parts and some touching moments with his family. It shows how proud they are of him.The 3D also made it even more exciting to watch.The main theme is to never give up on your dreams, and never say never!I've seen it 4 times and it is well worth the money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone needs to cut this kid some slack! He is a very talented 16 year old and he works his ass off! I took my 8 year old daughter and my 17 year old son to see it and we all enjoyed it very much! Except for my daughter we were not big Bieber fans but we liked the movie and had a great time. The music was great and the 3-D effects were fantastic! No its not going to win any Academy Awards but it was a fun afternoon to spend with my kids. What I like about Justin B. is that he acts like a normal 16 year old and not like a 30 year old super star. All of the bad reviews that people have given this movie is unfair and is really sickening! What were you expecting? You haters need to move on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i actually enjoyed it. A lot. But that's what happens when you go to the midnight show of a G rated movie while you've been drinking cotton candy vodka all night... That being said, i think a lot of the reviews for this movie just come from haters of the Biebs. I doubt many of them have even seen the movie. It was much better than i had anticipated. I hate his music, but after seeing his tour and getting a glimpse of who he really is, i think i have some inkling of respect for him. The target audience is little girls. little girls will like it. you will not. don't complain.Overall, it wasn't terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only for Fans - Just that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe me or not: Justin Bieber is not as much as another polemic singer made of what fans like nowadays. Some time ago was Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, a lot of time before it was Madonna... some other time Marilyn Monroe, you know, the ones who are controversial for each time in human evolution. At this point we have the same faces everywhere: Justin Bieber is one of them, like Hanna Montana, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato are, in fact as far as I know many of them where ''hooked up'' with him some time. Believe me when I say: I don't follow the trends. But... you want it or not you'll suffer this again and again and again... if it's not Justin, there'll be another replacement for him. In the times to come is gonna be another you'll love or hate, but a trend who we all stop by for a little of our lives... I cannot say anything else without being subjective. If is this what you want I can say I hate him. Doesn't look sincere, and of course a movie doesn't tell anybody the whole and cruel truth as it really was/is, whatever. If you're a fan, you'll love it. If not, don't waste your money going to see what you know is gonna be disappointing for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My daughter and friends LOVED it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm surprised by all of the negative feedback about this movie. I took my daughter and some friends on opening day, and they absolutely loved it. They had the best time. The movie was nearly sold out. Every time a song came on, lots of the girls in the audience ran down the aisles to the front and danced. It was so funny to see them acting that way. However, I'm sure if I was a preteen or teen, I would have done the same. I thought the movie was put together very well. There were lots of funny moments, and it was nice to see the non-celebrity side of him. His Mom is fabulous! I was blown away that she was a teenager when she had him and she has done a wonderful job raising him (my sis was a teenager when she had her 1st, and she has done a great job too, it's nice to see a movie that showcases how someone young can make good choices for their child). I love that there was so much prayer in the movie. It is nice to see a movie that wasn't overly concerned with being politically correct. Overall, I think it was great. I will buy it for my daughter as soon as it is released on DVD. She is a huge Bieber fan, and I think he is a good role model. I hope he stays grounded, and that he continues to have good influences in his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVED this movie...I have seen it 3 times already and can't get enough. This movie is a gift to all of Bieb's fans. That's the long and the short of it. His fans are CRAZY for him, and any "eye candy" that they (myself included) can get their hands on, they eat it up. He's a teenage heartthrob, and this movie is to quench young girls' Bieber Fever. This movie has gotten a lot of press and endorsements. It shows his story from rags to riches. Many celebrity guest appearances, like Boyz II Men, Usher, Miley Cirus, Will Smith's kids. The music rocks. Hands down great movie. I had a smile on my face the entire movie, which stayed with me through the day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a little boy anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been watching Justin Bieber for a long time. I always knew he was talented, but I saw him more as this young boy being hyped up for little girls. After seeing this movie, I no longer think this. Justin has worked hard his whole life for this opportunity and continues to work hard everyday for it. His mom and his grandparents keep him grounded and his producers and vocal coach push him hard. Watching this movie you cannot help but "aww" at the young pictures and videos of Justin and be amazed at the talent he possessed at such a young age. I love his music, so I was singing along, but I also began to see Justin as this maturing, hardworking, young man. He is almost 17 now and should stop being called "like 12" by everyone. He has worked harder than most and I think he deserves all the success he is getting. Congratulations Justin! I am definitely going to see the extended cut this weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was seriously a great experience for all the Belibers out there. It tells how the whole Biebermania got started. It is a great story worth watching. It shows Justin growing up and everything he had to go through to make it to the top.It's sort of like a concert/biography. They pass a little of his life and then a song live at the Madsion Square Garden. For a person who's never been to a concert her whole life, this was seriously AMAZING!!! I felt like I was there seeing him live. It was the absolute Bieber experience. In conclusion this movie really inspires many people (especially teens) to follow their dreams and to Never Say Never.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once in a Blue Moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a blue moon a star arises. This blue moon starts in London, Canada in 1994 where Justin Bieber was born but was raised in Stratford, Ontario. Son of Pattie Mallette, who was just 18 at the time. A self taught musician, learning to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet all on his own. By accident a former marketing executive of "So So Def" Scooter Braun found Justin's videos on Youtube.com. Very impressed by what he saw he tracked down Justin Bieber and this is their incredible story. Loved the here and now filming technique of the story. The floating slide show was brilliant and the real audience testimonies was superb. A Privilege to know that in my life time I witnessed the birth of another Blue Moon.

I know Justin Bieber is just a 16 year old kid, but he does so much you just gotta respect that. I think you should go see it especially if you don't like him. I mean i think he's great, so it's obviously a good movie for fans to. They don't make a movie about someone unless they are truly great. and I honestly am sick of seeing negative reviews about this movies because i think the people writing them are all under the age of 20, and have a great dislike of him for absolutely no reason.</fullReview>

Being able to see what he deals with and how he still manages to act like a kid made the movie so enjoyable. I laughed through pretty much the entire thing. And the sentimental scenes made him seem not so much like an icon but just a real person. Anyone who is a fan of Justin will love it. And anyone who isn't should still watch the movie. It definitely made me look at him in a completely different light. Along with the music and comedy this is something I will definitely be buying when it comes out on DVD. I hope to see more things like this in the future from Justin :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i thought this movie was amazing and its not just the fact that i actually do like Justin but the fact that the film shows the challenges he had to tackle to get to where he is. To start, the film is in fact a documentary of the start of his career as a performer, it shows everything he had to go through to get to where he is now and shows that it actually isn't easy at all and takes a lot of work. This film is great for people who do want to become famous because it shows them what they would have to go through to get anywhere in a performers job. Justin has actually worked really hard to become as great as he is, but people don't give him enough respect and any time to actually just listen to what he has to say. These people who are silly and just say rubbish about him, i would love to see yous in his shoes for a day!. you wouldn't last a minute!. So people out there, just give Justin a chance! i no you think only little girls like him but its not true!, also its not just about becoming a fan of Justin..but chasing your dreams, just as he did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not at all a fan of the Bieber, but I am fascinated by the fan behavior shown in the film, and Justin is actually very charismatic and his story is incredible. The footage of him as a toddler is amazing--this is a truly unusual kid, with a natural talent that I had no idea of before seeing the film. I think he will eventually prove himself similarly to Justin Timberlake. The movie is extremely well edited, so it's enjoyable to watch even if the content is disturbing/nauseating. I expected to HATE this film and actually was very glad I saw it--it raised a lot of questions that I continue to ponder over in the days since...for example, how is this overwhelming celebrity going to affect Bieber's sexuality development? Is his "team" really devoted to his best interests or are they cynically exploiting him? What is going on emotionally in the internal lives of individual fans as they participate in this mass hysteria? Now if only I could just get his music out of my head!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd first of all like to point out that most of the reviews i've read so far are by middle aged quacks with nothing to do but write hate reviews about a movie meant for teenagers they they haven't even seen. I'd also like to point out that if you are doing this and you are talking about how unoriginal this movie is go pound sand because if you are just hating him without even giving him a chance you are following the sheep herd and jumping on the hate bandwagon just to make yourself feel important. ooh! i hate Justin beiber I'm so cool! Anyway, i think this movie is much better than i expected i am a decent fan of Justin beiber and this movie only shows how he managed to go from being a poor Canadian boy to the biggest teen pop sensation in the world. it also shows that Justin is just a normal kid like you and me and in his defense he is like the only star out there that hasn't been photographed doing drugs (miley Cyrus) partying (miley Cyrus) and pole dancing (miley Cyrus I'm not saying i don't like her I'm just saying Justin has a much better hold of his head than she does) If you are a true fan of Justin beiber not a 40 year old loser who's only seeing the film so he can write bad reviews about it online because he has nothing better to do with his life i genuinely think you will enjoy this movie as much as i did. :)</fullReview>

The fact that this movie is rated well below "Baby Geniuses 2" is hysterical. Whatever would drive somebody to participate in this down-bringing is beyond me. They obviously have very little experience with movies, and they would do best to avoid a website that partakes in the honest rating of them.Keep it in your pants, little boys.

He started from poverty in a small town in Canada, and rose to fame without any drug, sex, and alcohol problems. He's very close to his family, and God, and this shows it. This movie shows who he really is. A down to Earth kid, not wanting to disappoint his his friends, family, and fans. Its shows how professional he is, and his more teenage side, where he loves to joke, and have fun. This is a phenomenal movie. Obviously he has talent if he rose to stardom in just 6 months. He's where some artists aren't at, and hes only 16, almost 17. I strongly encourage everyone to see this movie, with an open mind and heart. You wont regret it. Never say Never.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm almost 20 years old I guess you can throw me into that 'screaming 12 year old girl' group. I am a pretty big fan of Justin and was pretty darn excited to hear that he was putting out a movie. I was kind of surprised considering you normally have to be dead or almost dead to have a documentary made about your life, but either it was a big money stunt or he's doing really well for himself. I'd say both. What other guy has such control over 87% of the female population? Sure he might be all media but that's what little girls believe in. They rely on the magic of songs from singers like him and Hannah Montana. Even me, a 20 year old female, loves to listen to his music, why? Because it makes me feel good about myself. It's the kind of heart music that girls need to believe the world still is good. That's what his movie is about. It takes you through his childhood and how he became who he is today. (Who he really is and who we see might be completely different but to the little girls there's no difference.) I loved the music and I think the reason they shot it in 3D was for the extra cash they would bring in AND any girl Bieber fan would LOVE to see the Biebz in 3D. Even I did! All of us in the theater were dancing and singing along to the concert scenes and we all had a blast. To all the little girls out there Justin Bieber is hope. Little girls need that.</fullReview>

I admit that I may be a little biased, seeing as I was already a Belieber before I saw the movie but, I thought that this movie was very inspirational. It showed actually what he goes through, and that he's not a superficial singer with no values, rather someone who would like to just sing because he loves it. I also felt that it was true to life, who cares if he's only 16? His accomplishments in one year are better than some celebrities accomplishments in their whole life. So, I think it is good to point them out. I also felt that the 3D was so interesting because you could actually feel like you were at the concerts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Message For Kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took my daughter to see this movie and I must say that I enjoyed it. I think he is a very talented kid. If you have ever seen any of his YouTube videos, he could play 5 instruments by a very young age. Unfortunately, when you get into the hands of the corporate players, they are going to sell you for what they can. Even if that means not showcasing your talent. Not to mention when your fan base is consisted of a bunch of crazy girls, you tend to not get taken seriously. But he has done a lot of good, is part of a lot of charities and has handled a lot of extreme criticism with a lot of class. Not really the traits you see in an average sixteen year-old. Especially, in a sixteen-year-old being handled by Usher where most of his mentors are other rap artists. I think he has a good head on his shoulders and can definitely have a great career if he makes the right choices. From some of these reviews I have read, I am not sure if all of these people have actually seen the movie or are just giving a review based on their personal feelings about Justin Bieber. Either way, the movie sends a good message to kids about following your dreams.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made me appreciate him, you could really tell from his childhood tapes that he had a drive to do this stuff no one forced him to...he was just born to be, which made me feel bad about myself...and jealous. He is 16 and has accomplished so much, he doesn't forget where he came from and he seems very down to earth...unlike jaden smith who seemed like such a cocky little spoiled kid...and what was with miley? she looked so awkward with him on stage? really unattractive... The 3D was alright, the concert looked the best and the backstage stuff. He is just starting off so give him a break; 10 -15 years from now when he comes out with a bio it will probably be packed with a lot more drama heartbreak and struggle..all the crap everyone wants to see, but he hasn't been in the spotlight long enough and hes still a baby. so i think this was good enough for me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JB's first movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bieber's story is one in a billion, lightning in a bottle, and he's successor to the crown, long may be entertain. I don't think that the movie would have a nice story. The film raises many intriguing aspects of Bieber's rise, first and foremost being the fact that he is surrounded by a loving family and road crew, he is in safe hands, he is disciplined like any other kid, he cleans his room at his grandparents' Stratford, Ontario house, roughhouses with his devoted staff backstage and stays friends with his childhood buddies. Follows Justin Bieber with some footage of performances from his 2010 concert tour.It's one big, two hour lump in the throat of feel-good wonderfulness with catchy tunes. Bieber is the undisputed social media star of all time. He has 4.5M Twitter followers and conscientiously keeps them cared for, entertained, and up to date. The point is raised that it took In Synch and Backstreet Boys years to make it; it literally took Bieber months because of his ? and his fans use of social media. You think The Beatles came fast and hard? This country boy's way out in front.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>America's got talent! We've had Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Ernest Tubb, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, The Rat Pack, Elvis Presley, Lief Garrett, Bon Jovi, Cindi Lauper, Madonna, AC/DC, Christina Aguliera, Lady Gaga, and now we have Justin Bieber. This little guy started his career on Youtube, and worked to become an internationally known child star who is now loved and cherished by pretty much every adolescent female in the USA. Never Say Never showcases him in a different light.The film is what some might not expect. Unlike Michael Jackson's This is it, this film is a look in Justin's personal life and how he prepares to perform in front of a sold out crowd in NY's own Madison Square Garden. We go as far back as when he was a tween, and making videos on Youtube showing off his talent doing cover songs by artists like Chris Brown and Ne-Yo. To think this kid made it as big as he's made it in only three years is insane. I make videos on Youtube and write reviews on my website and I'm still waiting to be discovered.As for the 3D, it's the absolute worst 3D film I have ever seen. Even worse than The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Only the scenes with him in the concert and the text are in 3D, the rest is just in regular 2D. This is the kind of thing that really pisses me off. Of course they knew they couldn't remaster old clips into the new 3D technology, so lets enhance the footage of him in MSG a bit more to make it slightly in the third dimension, and add some clips made exclusively for this film. Great way to scam more money out of us.I found this out because every fifteen to twenty minutes I remove the glasses to blink a few times, and to relax my eyes so they don't become fatigued or irritated. I happened to do it on a scene where it's an interview and I discovered what I was watching wasn't even in RealD. What a cruel way to pretty much double the price of a ticket. Make film that isn't even in the third dimension 75% of the time. Is this the future? Because if so, I like living in the past.As for JB himself, plain and simple; I don't love the kid, I don't hate the kid, I respect him. Bring on the hate! I must give the kid credit for doing all of this before he even reaches the title of "adult". Whether I like what someone has to offer or not, if they are a few years younger than me or a few years older than me, I support what they are trying to get across.I too have major sympathy for the kid as well. Look what this kid has to live through (most not showcased in film): gay rumors, death rumors, being called "a faggot," school stress, work stress, people constantly bothering him, overprotective parents, etc. I know the kid brought it on himself some of the stuff dealing with stress, but I do feel sorry for him in a way. When I told my friends I was going to see the kid's film everyone jumped on me saying "I'm secretly gay". Is this the kind of homophobic society we live in? Back to the topic of the film, my favorite part besides the end is where Scooter Braun (JB's manager) explains why fans are so worthy to him. They feel like they discovered him on Youtube. We see a complete montage of videos by teen girls singing his song "One Time". It's nothing but amazing to see how one sixteen year old acquire millions of fans. Thats the beauty of it all.The concert is entertaining, but I find it rather pointless. This is the beginning of his life, why do we need to see it in the making? Though he is big now, I can pretty much guarantee in ten years, maybe five, people will be saying "who the hell is that?" when is name is mentioned. He'll live in the moment and fade out like many others. It happens. We don't need a concert showcasing his life in the making, we need to see it when he dies or when he goes into retirement. Not right at the beginning of his career.The thing that I laughed about were the girls in the film at a concert of his literally crying their adolescent heart out. My laugh was an interesting one because it's a shock to me that girls are genuinely moved by his music. Same goes with when he picks the "one less lonely girl". You may have one less lonely girl, but there are about two million jealous girls in the bunch.Never Say Never is like Kenny Chesney: Summer in 3D. It's a pointless concert film, that may provide some good music, but we question it's existence. Never Say Never is worth it for the music factor, but only for "true" fans of Bieber. The theater I was in was rather quiet, but I saw a lot of cell phone lights illuminate in the middle as they text their girlfriends saying "I'm @ the Bieber premiere. He iz sooooo hawt lol ;)" This movie is sure to make girls "awwwww" at the pictures of little JB, "ooooooh" and "awwww" when his shirt comes off, and maybe shed a tear during some of his performances. It's entertaining and engaging, but their isn't a whole lot to recommend to people looking for a good or well made film.Starring: Justin Bieber, Usher, and Scooter Braun. Directed by: Jon Chu.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Losers who complain and hate on Bieber, I think that this was the best movie. In my opinion if u don't like Bieber it was obviously going to be a waste of money for you. Why did you bother seeing it? Its like when you keep eating something you don't like... just stop and put yourself out of misery.If you knew going in that you hate Justin Bieber (for no reason), then stay the heck away and leave his fans alone. Justin and his fans aren't doing anything to you, so you have no reason to hate them. In conclusion, if you don't like Justin Bieber don't "waste" your time seeing and writing bad reviews about the movie. Love, A Person who actually Reviewed the movie based on the storyline not on the star of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was and is a VERY GOOD movie! My friend who doesn't like Justin Bieber said it was pretty good. The 3d WAS HORRID! Other than that it was awesome. It had some clips of songs from his concerts. However it wasn't a concert movie. It had a lot of unseen clips of home videos. So if you LOVE or HATE Justin Bieber go and see it... you may change your mind about him. I love him and their was a lot of cool things I learned about him. It was worth the money. Let me just say their were lots of screaming girls (in the theater and movie). So if you get headaches often I would wait for the DVD to come out. Over all I loved it!

		<shortDescription>A truly inspiring documentary we can all relate to with the universal concept of going after your dreams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you're a Justin Bieber fan or not, you'll find something great in this documentary. When you look at the big picture, it isn't really about Justin Bieber at all, but about following your dreams and never giving up on them. There's just a universal connection that everyone can have to it. It's way different, I think, than what anybody expected to see. While it does carefully integrate concert footage into the story, it isn't a concert film. If you take Justin out of it, it's just a story about a character who has big dreams and aspirations for his love of music; something he's very passionate about. We follow this character on his journey of making his dreams come true because unlike so many people, he only used discouragement to help make himself stronger and wouldn't give up on the thing he most desired. I think we can see that story reflected in so many of our lives and I think you'll leave the theater with a sense of hope and encouragement; maybe more motivation to keep going after your dreams. After seeing this, I have a profound new respect for Justin. He is a very talented, passionate, dedicated, hard-working kid and the scale of this Bieber phenomenon is unreal. While a lot of the fans that were interviewed seemed to be more about loving his looks and coming off a bit psychotic, I think this film will really open their eyes to who he really is as a person living the crazy life that he lives and working hard to be his best at what he loves. The concert footage was presented in 3D and was pretty exceptional in making you feel like you were there. This kid has so much energy on and off the stage, but he stays very grounded and humble, recognizing that without his fans he wouldn't be where he is and he really tries to deliver everything for them. I was definitely impressed by his stage presence because it really resembled that of Michael Jackson's and you can just tell that he really was born to be performing. The whole thing is really just the emotional journey of a lifetime and is summed up beautifully in the film and with a very vocally and lyrically powerful song during the end credits, "Born To Be Somebody", that was written by Diane Warren.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the phenomenon named Justin Bieber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've studied classical music and jazz all my life. I love pop music, worked in the music industry, &amp; have been lucky enough to see many great acts over the years including Hendrix, the Doors, Janis Jopllin, Rolling Stones, Tina Turner, Sinatra, Aretha, Stevie Wonder, Steve Winwood, Teddy Pendergrass, George Jones, Stevie Ray Vaughn, James Brown, Prince, Michael Jackson, and many more.After seeing NSN3D, to my mind to state on the internet that Justin Bieber has "no talent" is madness. Everyone in entitled to an opinion, but to my eyes &amp; ears Justin is one of the most natural performers to ever hit a stage. This film documents how a cherubic kid with no formal training, no musicians in his family, &amp; hailing from a tiny town in the middle of Canada (hardly a hotbed of music action), lands in Atlanta where he drums, strums &amp; sings his way into music history. One of the songs he wrote at age 15 has been viewed nearly 500 million times on YouTube. Half a billion? That's only one of his songs. Mindbogging.This documentary movie is cleverly constructed as a rags to riches saga. Justin is portrayed as a workaholic, precociously shrewd, preternaturally inspired &amp; occasionally mischievous teenage superstar.There is much phenomenal concert footage. This kid is no fluke. He commands the stage as well as any performer I've ever seen.I left the theater wondering how Justin is really doing psychologically and emotionally. There is a brief interview with Miley Cyrus where she comes across as burned out, completely jaded &amp; overworked by the Disney machine, but smart enough to appreciate the money. She knows she's set for life, but appears truly bitter to have paid with a piece of her soul. You have to wonder how Justin will be able to process what's happening to him. With his massive global success there is, of course, a certain amount of backlash which is not shown in the film, but has certainly shown up on IMDb in the reviews &amp; rating of the movie, which I don't understand. If you don't like the phenomenon, why not simply stay away or watch something you enjoy instead? The infantile bashing of a kid who was born to entertain is nonsensical.That said, it's been reported that the Biebs earned $100 million last year through the merchandising &amp; marketing of his brand w/o middlemen @Disney or Nickleodeon to take a massive chunk from the Bieber coffers. Nice. That should cushion JB from snide internet bashers, but also create a boatload of other problems few of us will ever remotely comprehend. After the box office receipts from this movie are tallied up, Mr. B. will have enough money to do whatever he wants forever. All accomplished while still too young to buy a beer.It will be interesting to see where Justin goes from here, and if he is able to remain grounded &amp; stable enough to continue his career. He'll still want to entertain people as he was born to do, but will have to reinvent himself as he grows older. In the meantime, this documentary will stand in time as testament to a legitimate phenomenon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems half the reviews on here are just bashing by people who probably didn't even see the movie or pay attention. It's quite sad that so many people are jealous of such a young kid living out his dream that they always have to look on the negative side. They won't get anywhere in life with that kind of view. The movie was wonderful, it was full of different emotions and left me speechless. Justin Bieber was born to be someone big. It's a fun film to watch and see what happens behind the scenes and see how much heart he has put into his music/world. Also, nice to see an Eddie's Attic clip in it! Being a music person from Atlanta myself made me feel a connection to him and understand it a little better. There's no way anyone can deny he's got talent. Look at everyone he has backing him, Usher, Snoop Dogg, Miley Cyrus, Boys II Men, Britney Spears, etc. I highly suggest everyone see this movie before passing judgment on the kid, and if you still hate him afterward, I feel sorry for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Their is a Reason I saw this Movie Four Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I am a little biast when writing this review, I must say even as a "Belieber" this movie was better than I had expected. I have had respect for Justin since I saw one of his videos 3 or 4 years ago. I completely understand at first why people may not like Justin, but I am actually kind of surprised about how much these people hated the movie. I personally thought that the movie was made in a pretty cool way, interviewing his old neighbors and the 3D itself. Yes, of course it was cheesy. But that's because that is a part of his teen sensation concept. All of my friends who hated him before that I took ended up gaining some respect. Although I do agree they displayed him being sick as a bit dramatic, the movie was able to portray his wide range of talents. I must agree, his lyrics are kind of corny, but that's his genre and his style of music, just like the other teen bands. At least he is a good kid who helps out a lot of kids in need. Plus it is able to show how you can go far from not coming from a lot. I'm sorry if you don't like his haircut or style, but I don't think that's a reason to hate someone with this much talent, eh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie on the opening night, but it wasn't as crowded as I thought it was going to be. I thought the movie theatre was going to be filled with screaming little girls, but it wasn't, it was actually quite the opposite. There were a lot of high school girls there (myself included) and there were even some teenage couples there which surprised me. Anyway...the movie was way better than I thought it was going to be. I thought it was going to be like the Jonas Brothers Movie, like a concert we got to watch for only $9.00. But it was actually entertaining and had somewhat of a plot. Another good aspect of this 'documentary' was that it had actual Bieber home videos! Who knew Justin was such a cute little baby?!? All in all, I would most defiantly recommend everyone to go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, with all the hype about this movie in the past week . . . I went to see it today. I must say, this is a very impressive story. Truly a dream come true . . . and the dream isn't even over yet. The movie was done very well. Yes, this is NOT a Concert Movie. This is a very well made Documentary. It shows how this group (mainly Scooter Braun) outright created a new way to make it to the top just by realizing the change in the times. The movie shows how Justin bypassed the traditional walk down the Yellow Brick Road. He took a detour and vaulted himself right into the Emerald City.The story is just unbelievable. What Justin has accomplished is just absolutely extraordinary. This kid has the right people around him and the right attitude to take himself to the next level and beyond. The movie shows this using a lot of behind the scenes footage, early home movies, and interviews with his family, friends, and crew. Some of the stuff you see Justin do at a very young age is just incredible! This kid is very talented! I don't care what you jealous Haters say out there. This kid has got it! If you can't see it after watching this movie then lay back down on the couch and go back to sleep.This is a great movie/documentary! It held my interest the WHOLE time, even past the ending credits to the very last click of the mouse. I'm actually ready to go see it again, seriously! You need to go see it no matter what age you are, male or female. This isn't a teeny-bop movie, it's a very well made documentary showing how a hard working teenager with the right people surrounding him made it to the big-top. GO SEE IT TODAY!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most amazing, inspirational movie I've ever seen. &#x2665; It talks about how Justin got started, what his mom had to give up, and how he got where he is now. The full cast and crew of his team talk about what their daily life is like. Ryan Good, the man who found Justin as a kid, is seen frequently and tells about when Justin met Usher. Never Say Never features some other famous people too, like Jaden Smith and Miley Cyrus. There a scene that talks about how Justin sold out Madison Square garden in 22 minutes. But a few days before, Bieber ran into an issue with his throat. He has other struggles as well. Meet his grandfather as he emotionally talks about when Justin moved away from Canada. But of course, learn about his accomplishments as a singer/dancer too. Watch the movie to find out(:</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film with my kids (7 and 8) I was really moved. The movie is as much about the fans as it is about Justin Bieber and that was my favourite part. You can see how much he his part of so many people's (well girls' mostly) lives.There are nice insights into the great pressures of being the centre of an entire organization at the age of 16 and how so many things have to be in place and working for this phenomenon to be pulled off. It's easy to see how a young pop star can end up off the rails so quickly.P.S. Ignore the rating (1.3/10). It's obviously being gamed by some haters. I saw an NSync concert film some year back and it was stomach turningly horrible. This was very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will make a BELIEBER out of you!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this movie all I could think of was "My daughter wants to see this. I like Justin Bieber but my daughter has shown me all of his youtube videos so I don't know if I can sit through this whole movie..." This movie is NOT just about concert footage as I read it was before going to the theatre. If you read that also, you may be apprehensive as well..and don't be fooled by that because: THIS MOVIE IS FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Director John M. Chu does an amazing job capturing not only Justin's talent but in capturing the heart and message that is clearly here in this movie and missing from other documentary concert footage movies. It starts by taking you back to where you saw him in the first place (youtube) and you once again remember why you've come to the theatre to see him... Several times during the movie you will hear screams and cheers from girls and wonder if you are at the movies or a concert. The audience definitely has Bieber Fever. Then you will find that you may have it too when you suddenly start cheering too! This is not just about him performing songs either, this shows exactly how he started and takes you on a personal journey with him and his family as they all do their best to help make Justin into the man he is meant to become. A great moment in the movie is when Justin's father Jeremy has this "look" on his face and you can make the assumption, which I think may be correct, that "yes this is my son but I've seen him sing before" kind of "look" before Justin's concert and it was quite beautiful seeing his father crying as he witnesses his son perform and is completely in awe. The movie also takes you through the heartbreak of seeing Justin want to perform, and cannot because of an infection he gets in his throat and the complete "human-ness" of Justin Bieber in getting sick and resting and everyone worried because he's a 16 year old and doesn't want to rest. If this movie says anything it is that it will leave you wanting to start right now because its never too late in making your dreams come true. All the people you've associated Justin with (minus The Beadles) are in this movie and many others that you will be "meeting" for the first time, all are part of Justin's team and support system. They never lost faith in him or doubted him and more important, Never Say Never tells us that we should never lose faith in ourselves and our own ability to dream and become whatever we have always wanted to do and be. Where would be all be if we didn't have all the doubt or negativity that some of us have in our lives? If we had someone telling us "we can" instead of telling us were not good enough? Justin Bieber is definitely a role model for all ages. He also shows us here that he is a teen, that he is in fact human that he has a heart and soul and that we are all good enough and in receiving we must also remember to give back. What a wonderful message and fantastic experience you will have seeing this. Start beliebing today!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NEVER SAY NEVER was a pleasant surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was preparing for a headache and silliness going into JUSTIN BIEBER: NEVER SAY NEVER? I was not prepared to like the film as much as I did! NEVER SAY NEVER is the story of Justin Bieber's journey from Stratford, Ontario to his first sold out show at Madison Square Garden, the biggest venue in the US that a musician can ever play. The film skips between his daily routine as he prepares for his big show and home movies that show just how talented this kid truly is! It also jumps between songs performed in 3-D for all you crazy Bieber fans out there. I was absolutely blown away by the home movies of Justin performing. There are clips of him beating on a chair, or playing the drums that had my head spinning! How is this kid, at an age that has to be 5 or younger, keeping such amazing time with the music? As his hands hit a kitchen chair this amazing rhythm comes pouring out. This is far beyond simple music lessons, and disproves any theory that this kid is a manufactured product. Don't let the pop and r&amp;b songs fool you? he is extremely talented! In a way, Justin is a genius when it comes to music. Something inside of him just clicked at an early age, and he just understood it. You can see this in a clip where he is playing an acoustic guitar that is bigger than he is, and not only is he keeping the time, but it sounds amazing! After putting up some videos on YOUTUBE.COM, Justin's mother (Pattie Mallette) was contacted by Scooter Braun, a talent manager who was interested in signing Justin. He convinced them to come down to Atlanta, eventually moving them there. When record labels kept saying no, Scooter had Justin sing for Usher, and that's when things really took off! With his first album being released in 2009, he shot to the top fast! Of course, this didn't happen without hard work. The heartfelt part of this film is hearing the tales of his mother and family trying to raise money so that Justin could get his first big drum set, and just how much they support him. The film definitely has a family angle that any parent would appreciate. The film showcases the relationship that he has with his mother, and just how close they really are. It's quite heartwarming. His father is only seen for about five minutes in the film. It might not have been intentional, but it gave the impression that his father isn't around too much. It's also crazy to see just how little downtime he actually has. When Justin does get some time off he spends it with family and friends. Of course, he also makes it a priority to stay in touch with his fans, even if it is just by twitter. And yes, that is him twittering the whole time, not just someone on his team. He, as well as his team, understand just how important the fans are, and they go out of their way to show their appreciation. Justin Bieber is so dedicated to his fans, that he was visibly devastated when he had to cancel a show due to an infection in his throat. They ended up putting him on vocal rest, and trying everything they could to rest his voice for his big show. The crazy thing, and it's not necessarily negative, is that they show his vocal coach lecturing him, and others around him about him screaming with his friends when he has down time, and on how he needs to take better care of his voice. At one point, he wanted McDonald's and the scene turned from him joking and batting is eyes for chicken nuggets to her lecturing him about his commitment to his career? all over his playful desire for fast food. It was sad in a way. We take for granted the little things in life. I hope his fans realize everything that this kid has and continues to give up so that he can be at the top of his game. The 3-D concert in itself rides backseat the the actual story for me. Having said this, I am sure that this is the part that all of the little girls are really stoked to see. Never fear! There are plenty of winks, hair flips? and he even reaches out to the audience on multiple occasions to make it feel like he is actually singing to you, and not the group of girls sitting behind you. Don't worry, you're special! It also showcases a ton of special guests, such as Usher, Miley Cyrus, Boyz II Men, Sean Kingston, Ludicrous and Jaden Smith. It must have been quite the event to see live. I really thought that I would be sitting through a cheesy, lame teeny- bopper movie. I ended up sitting through a fantastic documentary that was both entertaining and eye-opening. Whether you like the kid or not, I highly recommend this film!

		<fullReview>The world is full of Bieberphobes who are just jealous of his success. Anyone who has a problem with a singer they haven't met personally, are in reality just coveting there success. They are so jealous, that they don't have as much attention as them, so they have to take it out on others in order to hide what they truly feel inside. I am not one of them, and I will back up JB until the day I die. This movie truly shows that dreams can come true if you truly believe in them, and put what or who you believe in first. No matter what Fox news says. For people who truly have a heart, it is not easy to walk out of the theater untouched by the story of how the poverty Justin faced over years with his mom by his side, has turned him into the appreciative, non materialistic, and hardworking man he is today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Never Say Never on Wednesday at the premiere, and saw it again last night with two friends. So I've been in an environment where there's been some HUGE fans who were willing to pay for VIP tickets, and around people that thought it was going to be a terrible movie. And, I was shocked at how my friends reacted.Although I'm a little biased since I've liked Justin since before he even became famous, this movie surprised me. I've always had to deal with people being extremely harsh on the 16 year old popstar, and saying things that nobody should be saying to anyone. So, I'm so glad this movie came out.During the movie, it starts off with someone opening e-mails and seeing youtube videos, and then Justin's version of "With You" with only 50,000 views at the time pops up. It flashes forward to him being backstage about to perform at MSG, and flashes back and forth to the clip.This movie has plenty of interaction with fans. They're interviewed, and talk about why they love Justin, and they're shown being ecstatic over being given tickets by Justin and his crew to have amazing seats to the concert. But, it wasn't just about the fans.You see the difficulties Justin goes through. There's a point in the movie where Justin gets really sick, and is distraught over having to cancel a show. You see him at the doctor getting his vocal chords inspected (and gagging trying to do so), and you see him hug his mom and grandpa in his tour bus and laying in a dark room trying to find relief from being sick. You see clips of him trying to do homework and eat at the same time, and you see him try to be a normal kid. He was running around with his friends with everyone staring, and at one point his vocal coach said how "sometimes Justin talks about wanting to be normal, and we say 'you gave up being normal. This is your new normal.'" You get to meet Justin's family and hear about his mom and dad, and his grandparents and friends, and much, much more.In the end, you see the story of how a normal kid with a dream ended up living it in a way nobody thought was possible. You see how even though he's the biggest popstar in the world, how he's totally a normal teenaged boy who likes to do teenaged things. It's extremely inspiring because of the fact that a 16 year old is doing what no other 16 year old has done before. And, it shows that if you follow your dreams and don't give up, that anything can happen. Justin got told "no" by so many record companies and told that he needed to have a platform like Nickelodeon or Disney to get him anywhere. But he wouldn't give up.My friends, who walked into the movie thinking it was going to be terrible, walked out extremely surprised at how much they liked it. I've had many other friends who admitted they were almost ashamed at how much they liked it. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. If you love him, you'll love him more, and if you hate him, you at least would be able to understand him a little better before you judge him. Justin is a sweet, caring, hilarious 16 year old that's just living his dream and trying to be normal at the same time.The only thing I could think of negative is that some of the parts in the trailers isn't in the movie, or a lot of the parts you see in the trailers are in the credits in just clips. So some parts give off the impression that there's more that you're going to see of that particular part, but in the end, I think everyone just wants a little bit more of Justin. And I'm sure that there's much, much more to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've got Bieber Fever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a HUGE Justin Beeber fan. I have a lot of posters, cassette tapes, etc. I've seen him in concert twice but this was better than both of those concerts combined! The movie is one part documentary and one part stage show. It's a little bit like Michael Jackson's This Is It except Justin Bieber isn't dead.The 3D makes it really awesome! I saw it on a big IMAX screen and this is the ideal way to see it. It's like you're there with Justin. Wow.I know Justin is only 14 years old but he presents himself very maturely. It shows home videos of him as a kid playing with instruments and banging on buckets like drums. His whole family and some friends are in the movie and talk about silly things he did as a child.***(Minor spoiler) His grandmother tells the story of Justin's friend Kyle where Kyle ran around yelling "JUSTIN BEIBER IS BIG STAR! BIG STAR!" LOL! I highly recommend it. I gave it a 9 because it wasn't long enough! LOL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cinematic event. A real-life rags to riches story of a modern time told in a visually dynamic way. Jon Chu worked his magic on this movie piecing together family home videos with hi-def 3D footage from Justin's journey to and the concert at Madison Squate Garden.It may not change minds as those who don't like Justin are not going to be willing to see this movie. Those who give it a try will be pleasantly surprised. There are moments both funny and somber. You see Justin and his family at his highest moments and at his lowest.***Spoiler*** The moment which really seems to be universally seen as an emotional moment is the time when Justin finds out his voice is failing. We see Justin's team rally around him to support him. We see him in the chair as the doctor inspects his vocal chords and see Justin slide into depression over having to cancel his concerts prior to the MSG concert. Some saw his tweets from that time and Never Say Never shows you the emotional toll it took on him.Give the movie a chance, you might just surprise yourself.3.5/5 Stars</fullReview>
