		<shortDescription>It's about the atmosphere...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right. Listen up out there. You could say this is Juno without the baby...or almost as useless and watered down as a straight to DVD movie...but you would be missing the point--not that every movie has to have a point.N&amp;N is not trying to sell something or be something--it's not even trying to be great...because most love stories that try to be great fail. When you see N&amp;N (and if you're in the mood for a lighthearted enjoyable movie, you should), don't go with an expectation of grandeur or even for the entire thing to be great. Alexis Diziena is as useless in this film as she is anorexic and whorish--her part is almost explicitly sexual. And there are so many subplots that their lives appear at times to be exaggerated. What matters almost seems to be camouflaged by what should be secondary.The movie succeeds in a number of understated ways, though. Ari Graynor's part is by far the funniest character of the bunch and Ari plays the part extremely well. The gay band Michael Cera is a member of adds a quirky afterthought to his character's back story. And what's most important--the characters Nick and Norah act like slightly more interesting versions of normal people. They have their flaws and their disagreements but they're capable of finding the beauty in each other and their story along the way.Movies should be about the creation and expansion of a spark of magic--not about giving you exactly what you expect or want. The perfection of the movie lives in its imperfections. The love is in the relationships that are real and what is fake gets left behind in a sketchy area near 10th street (that's not a spoiler). It amplifies grace with its soundtrack and hope with its random culmination of peculiar events over a single-night.So just let the infinite playlist play and enjoy it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unlikely Film of Soul...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this age of super-broad comedies and sexed-up teen films, there comes Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It's all-too-easy to groan at the thought of sitting down to a high school film these days, yet 'Nick &amp; Norah' attempts to make you rethink that. It tries to achieve that so rare of an achievement; it tries to make a genuine and honest teen comedy.It succeeds.Michael Cera, that king of adorable dorkiness, stars as Nick, the sole straight member of a queer-rock band. Kat Dennings plays Norah, a rocking rich chick who is just as unattracted to teenage pettiness as the rest of us are. These two meet through a random encounter and together set out to try and find the secret show of the aptly titled rock band Where's Fluffy? They cruise the town like grown adults, yet underneath both are incredibly naive. They argue, fight, flirt, and, yes, fall in love; what makes the film great is how mature and honest a relationship they create. We know from the beginning that it is the destiny of Nick and Norah to get together, yet when they do it is nothing short of soulful. With a wonderfully witty script along for the ride, it's apparent that this is much more than your average teenage comedy. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and silly fun with an indie rock backdrop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It's not as raunchy as its teen comedy predecessors, yet not as cloying as the usual chick flick. Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist manages to strike up a nice balance between the two with a dash of hipster thrown in there. However don't let the title fool you. It isn't all about the music! The movie is very character-driven and, fortunately, the cast was strong enough to carry it. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings make one quirky and fun on screen pair. The supporting cast members also shine in their roles. Ari Graynor, for instance, plays one of the most ridiculously likable drunks I've ever seen. The performances delivered by this young cast are really what make this movie.Overall I enjoyed what I saw and can't wait for the DVD release. You don't have to think too hard about this one. It's a quick glimpse into the NYC music scene, light on the drama, but romantic and funny where it needs to be.Ah, and, for the record, you don't have to be into the hipster subculture to appreciate this movie. It's definitely an accessible story, whether you've heard of Vampire Weekend or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun romp through New York's night-time music scene.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, teenagers have connected with one another through music and the discovery of new and different bands. Even though technology has allowed music to be more widespread and portable, there is still the thrill of late-night adventures seeking live performances from favourite bands. In Peter Sollett's Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, he brings this out on screen in a fun manner that shows you do not necessarily need crude humour or death-defying encounters to make a night out with friends an interesting and worth telling story. Throughout the film, the audience becomes more enriched by the characters and their ideas. Nick and Norah could have easily become a smug "teenagers rule over all" tale like this year's Charlie Bartlett, but is instead is a sweet romance between two individuals that most people can easily relate to.Nick (Michael Cera) is the guitarist for a queercore band with his two friends Dev and Thom (Rafi Gavron and Aaron Yoo). He is currently grieving over the separation between his former girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena), but decides to join his friends for a performance out in New York City. In an act of desperation, he encounters Norah (Kat Dennings), who asks Nick to be his boyfriend for five minutes. After her drunken friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) runs off into the city, Nick and Norah along with his friends scour the city in search of her. Meanwhile, Tris is decides to go after Nick to find out if it truly is over between them.One of the key successes of this film lies with the ensemble cast of talented young actors. Adults are barely featured in this film, as the teenage characters are given the overall spotlight here and Peter Sollett has hired some very good actors to play these parts. Michael Cera is still playing the awkward individual he has been doing since Arrested Development, but he still grows into the part well, as his character is not quite as nervous as previous roles. He proves to be likable and relatable in the part and his chemistry with the other actors comes off very well. Kat Dennings surpasses him, though, giving Norah a sarcastic wit and coming off as very easy to relate to. The way Nick and Norah progress throughout the film is handled very well by Cera and Dennings. Ari Graynor deserves some acclaim for her wacky, but still nuanced performance as Caroline. She is given the bulk of "stunts" in this film, particularly when sharing the screen with a piece of gum that ends up becoming a separate character by itself. Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron and Jonathan B Wright allow their best friend roles to become more than just simple stereotypes as they prove just as likable as the leads. Jay Baruchel also does a fine job in a small role that is definitely very far from the meek actor he played in last summer's Tropic Thunder.Credit should also go to first-time screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, adapting the original source material by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan. She writes a funny and intelligent script with well-developed characters who evolve effectively and realistically as the film goes on. She also does not go the Adventures in Babysitting route by showing New York after hours as a grungy underworld, instead opting for a more light-weight approach to the material. She understands the independent musical scene of the Big Apple and she portrays it effectively throughout the course of the film. Director Peter Sollett and Cinematographer Tom Richmond also do well in lighting the city and allowing it to breathe. Even though the large majority of Nick and Norah takes place at night, there is still plenty of light that shines through, particularly in showing the vast culture. Legendary locations like the New Jersey Turnpike, Times Square and Pennsylvania Station also make appearances to give the film an even more New York feel.Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist simply wants to be a fun, breezy ride through New York's music scene and the audience is happy to go along with it. The characters are easy to relate to, the writing is intelligent and the direction is solid. Though there have been plenty of "one night in the city" films, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist manages to stay fresh and original and unique through its running time. Overall, this is definitely one to watch at the evening showing with the buddies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Tunes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On one particular night in New York City, an elusive band by the name of Where's Fluffy? have announced a secret concert. The word spreads through the city's underground punk scene faster than it can go out of style and before long, it reaches Nick and Norah. Nick and Norah don't know each other when this news reaches their ears but before the end of the night, they will each find something infinitely more important than Fluffy. NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST is a contemporary romantic comedy that sets itself in an entirely unconventional place and time (can you think of another way to describe a straight romance in the queer punk underground?), but presents itself in a sometimes far too conventional fashion. While it can at times be too cool for school, it is the roughness around its edges that give it an unexpected and genuine warmth. Like any finely balanced playlist, it works its way into your head and your soul.Nick (Michael Cera) has been down as of late. It seems his fragile heart has been trampled by Tris (Alexis Dziena), a girl so clearly wrong for him but whose physical beauty is apparently capable of diverting people from noticing her lack of a soul. Norah (Kat Dennings) has some trust issues as she naturally assumes that any man interested in her is likely more interested in her connections (her dad is an enormously successful record executive). As a result, both Nick and Norah have withdrawn ? not externally as they both still function amongst the other humans but they do so at arm's length. Like sleeping beauties though, they are both awoken from their waking comas by a shared impromptu kiss. Suddenly, worlds they never knew existed have become possibilities and an ordinary evening becomes an adventure. While the twists the evening takes are at times unrealistic, they do give the night and the film a sense of spontaneity that makes the viewer believe that anything can happen. Peter Sollett is a delicate director. His first feature, RAISING VISTOR VARGAS, in which a group of Hispanic youths in New York's lower east side figure out how to stop playing and how to be themselves instead, was a singular revelation. He created a strong sense of hesitation in face of the unknown and a desire to be something more. He has an ease with creating simple, real spaces that foster intimacy and humble his characters and Nick and Norah are no exception to his treatment. Outside of these two though, the remaining ensemble are little more than comic relief and functional plot progression pieces. They can come across as occasionally transparent and one-dimensional but thankfully never enough to distract from the delightful romance budding at the center of all the chaos. Cera proves his versatility once again by showing that there are hundreds of facets to being an awkward teenager, that awkwardness does not define you but is rather just how who you are can come across. Dennings is his perfect counterpoint; she is sharp and strong, a worthy adversary, but frightened underneath it all, an ideal match. The two are so strongly suited that they transform the sometimes too facile script into something much more mature and meaningful.NICK AND NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST made me want to fall in love. It also made me laugh and swoon, delight in the magic of music and believe in the transformative properties of one crazy night. It made me long to be in New York City. It made me wish that I was that young again and that believing in possibilities was that easy to do. It may not be perfect but it is almost better that way, more real. There is something so genuine at the heart of this film that makes it almost impossible not to want for Nick and Norah to realize their potential ? a potential that is just as infinite as the playlist they are about to create together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that made my day, put a smile on my face, and made me believe in films again. One goes to the movies to be entertained, to see something that doesn't happen everyday, and Hollywood, as of lately, seems to be think there are only two types of good movies: The ones that make a ton of money, or the ones with a "serious" message that end up winning all the awards. Apparently, the other ones aren't good enough, and boy, are they neglecting most of the good stuff.For starters, this is a joy to watch. It has the same tone of "The Breakfast Club" a whimsical and true recollection of what it is like to be a young person, searching for companionship and understanding, and still not bound by society's adult demands. When the characters interact in the film, there is much fun to be had, even when the practical options are well, more logical. Kids go out, meet, enjoy a good concert, have too much to drink and have consequences to deal with, but it's all lighthearted, and everyone knows it's some sort of imaginary fantasy.After all, people don't fall in love in seconds, and you don't get to have all your dreams come true overnight, but where else are you going to have a piece of chewing gum with that kind of history? Then there is the chemistry between the two leads, something that is rare in movies nowadays, one that offers you an insight into the working brain of two young people with much more than sex and special effects in the script.People will talk about this film for a while because it is enjoyable, fresh, and something worth discussing. It has a couple of shocking moments, but they are funny moments, silly stops on the trip that Nick and Nora allows us to become a part of. As they said in '39 "follow the y..." wait a minute, wrong movie, but same ton of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great night out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If they gave an Academy Award for Most Adorable Movie, this would definitely win. I'm NOT a teenager, so I'm certainly NOT the target audience for this movie. That said, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought the casting was perfect, the performances were delightful and the music was terrific. What more do you want from any romantic comedy, except for it to be funny and romantic? This qualifies. You're rooting for Nick and Norah, almost from the first frame. And all the supporting characters are wonderful. Also, there are some fun cameos, which gives the movie that Inside Baseball feel that makes it that much more of a hoot. I may even buy the DVD (which makes this a rave review!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a small feeling about Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist that it was going to be a decent hit, with the popularity of Juno, not to compare, but this movie had similarities. This movie has my main pet peeve with the younger generation of today, the people who are the "I heard this band before you did so I have better taste than you do" type of mentality. The independent rock music movies are just not my thing, so I wasn't too excited to see this movie, but when some friends invited me to go see it with them, I had low expectations and actually ended up having a great time watching Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It's honestly one of the better comedies that is out in theaters right now, although I have to admit I feel so dirty watching all these horny teenage girls, I'm a girl, and it just made me feel uncomfortable, this is how teenagers act? Scary; anyways, the story is really fun and gives you a great time laughing.Nick is having a hard time after his rough break up with super slutty Tris, he continues to mix CD's for her that her fellow student, Norah listens too and enjoys it. By chance Norah meets Nick not knowing that it's Tris's ex and says that he's her boyfriend to show Tris that she's no prude. But when Norah learns that Nick is the ex, Nick also won't shut up about Tris, but they find out throughout the night that maybe they're musical soul mates and can really dig each other's vibe. But in the mean time with their crazy friends, they try to find their favorite band that is hidden in New York.Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is definitely worth the look, I would say that it's worth full price. The only thing I have a problem with is our leading man, Michael Cera, this guy is a nice actor, but he hasn't really expanded himself into different roles, he's been playing the same character since Superbad to be honest. But I'm seeing Kat Dennings more and more, I'm enjoying her presence on screen, she's very lovely and has potential. But the person who definitely stole the show was Norah's drunk friend, Caroline played by Ari Graynor, she was just beyond hilarious and stole all the laughs. Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is a great new teen comedy, though I really hope teenagers don't act like this... if they do... oh, I'm praying that our future is going to be alright.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick and Norah's Passionate Playlist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' turned out to be a sweet and cool surprise. I was just expecting another usual teen flick and while the main storyline does follow the formula, its the treatment that appealed. The director really shows that even though there is a physical attraction between the two leads, they also have characteristics that repel each other. But, what really brings these two people closer is their passionate liking for music. Both have the same taste and the best parts of the films are the sequences where the two talk about their favourite songs and singers. The movie pretty much takes place during an entire night and Sollett's portrayal of night in the city is amusing and exciting. Lighting is cleverly used and the yellow tinted colour adds more excitement into the night. With the exception of that Spice Girls track, I like the soundtrack. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings suit their parts wonderfully. They maintain a good chemistry (even though their love scene looks a little awkward). Aaron Yu, Rafi Gavron and Jonathan Wright provide some fun comic relief as Nick's friends/bandmembers. Ari Graynor is hilarious.I like the title of this movie and how the movie stays true to it. It's a charming little film that is perhaps best enjoyed at night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVE indie comedies,and hell,with a little bit of romance,ever better. Saying that,I found this film AWFUL. There are many many reasons,of which I will now list. 1.Michael Cera-I like him,he's a funny actor,but he is quickly getting typecast...seriously,If I see him play another sweet dorky boy who plays music,I might vomit. 2.There was absolutely NO character development,most of them were unlikeable,especially the main characters.The only saviours were the drunken friend and the camp friends. 3.The plot,the premise was just stupid....it just left me walking out the cinema thinking "who the hell cares" 4.The fact that it was one of the most pretentious films I have EVER seen.It felt as if the writers had simply thought of all "cool" and "alternative" teenage things that they could,and randomly spat them into one film. It just felt contrived. 5.The "non-wit" of the characters. Juno it was not. 6.The fact that the audience is expected to care,and empathise,with two people who have just met, being jealous of each others exes,etc...THEY HAVE JUST MET!! Why would they care,unless they were annoyingly neurotic. 7.It feels like it was written by a child...you know in English where you have to write a story and try to pack EVERYTHING in....This epitomises it....Then they did this,then they did this..then they did thiiiiis....cue marginally exciting ending. 8.The epic love story...seriously....they shag..after meeting a few hours previously,and were expected to think its sweet.Its not.The film had a few funny lines,but it wasn't enough to save it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is one of the most sweet teenage romantic comedies of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in Maryland to see my sister's firstborn get baptized, we both decided to see this movie when I was there. This was a nicely cutting edge teenage romantic comedy about two strangers played by Michael Cera and Kat Dennings who find out about their similarities only after their friends accidentally put them together. Cera still is pining for an ex he puts a mixed CD for while Dennings is friends with that ex. Michael's character is also a member of a band whose other members are gay while Kat's character has a girlfriend who likes to drink. And all this happens while Cera and Dennings and their friends ride around New York City all night looking for their favorite indie band. Plenty of sweet and funny (and a little gross) moments abound and while my sister and I might have a little problem with a sex scene with the leads, the romance was good enough to overcome that. So on that note, I recommend Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. P.S. There are cameos of a couple of current SNLers I pleasantly noticed right away...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has nothing to offer that will make you care about the characters let alone whether or not they find Fluffy. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings had absolutely no chemistry at all. Watching them act side by side was the equivalent of watching a balloon deflate very slowly. I'm all for love at first sight, fate induced romances but this movie really kicked the bucket. The only good thing about the movie is the little drunken blondie roaming around New York. Out of the entire cast I must say that she really showed superior acting skills. I believed she was drunk. Did I believe it was love at first sight for our star crossed indie lovers? About as much as I believe a meteor the size of Texas is coming to end life as we know it.On a positive note this movie made me realize that Michael Cera needs a good supporting cast in order to make his type casted awkward/shy shtick shine. In Arrested Development and Superbad the outgoing supporting cast allows Cera to have minimal spotlight allowing the viewer to not become bored with the character and at least allowing some comedy to manifest from it....which is what this movie is lacking entirely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because this movie was absolutely nothing like the book. The plot was completely changed, the relationship between the main characters was flipped, and the whole story just played out WRONG. The casting choices, in my opinion, could have been better. I am a huge fan of the novel, and I was really disappointed.And, to yessdanc's comment, if THEY knew anything, they'd know that the screenwriter did not choose the character's names; Rachel Cohn and David Levithan did. If you read Cohn's website, you'd learn that she intentionally chose the names of the characters to pay tribute to the movie."I wanted to write about two New Jersey, straight-edge characters named Nick and Norah (after the Thin Man movies)..." "...we weren't trying to write an updated Thin Man (though the temptation to put a dog named Asta in our book was certainly there). Mostly what we both always liked from the original books/movies was the warm and fun banter between Nick &amp; Nora Charles, and we hoped to somehow infuse that spirit into our teen characters."</fullReview>

This may go down as the film that ruins independent comedies for those of us that like decent film-making. The cast and crew need to realize that not every other teen comedy has to be Juno.

		<shortDescription>Uninteresting characters make for a snooze-fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having liked "Juno", I thought that I would like "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" since it had many attributes similar to that little winner: quirky teens, a protagonist played by Michael Cera, a setting in the North-East of America and a prominent use of indie-music. However, things don't always turn out how we expect, and it actually transpired that I disliked this film. It runs for around 90 minutes, but it really did feel ten times longer than that. I kept on looking at the timer on my DVD player to see how long was left, and there were numerous points when I felt that I ought to simply turn it off altogether and give it up.The problem is mainly to do with the fact that the characters just aren't all that interesting and are hard to sympathise with; Nick, Norah, and their friends, are essentially anxious and/or lazy teens. Their worries don't really seem all that sincere and it's easy to lose interest in them. Norah's drunken friend, the obvious comic-relief figure, is also just not all that amusing. Perhaps if I were a few years younger and still felt like a breakup or a friend's homosexuality were major dramatic events worthy of international media coverage, then I would feel differently. But I think that to anyone over the age of 17, these characters and their misadventures would seem bland.The film, I should mention, takes place over the course of a night, and ends at around 5 or 6 in the morning. I became so bored, however, that I kept on posing myself the question: wouldn't all these people just want to go to bed by this point? Obviously I'm simply becoming middle-aged in my early 20s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Cera plays pretty much the same character he played in Juno -- and that's pleasant enough. Kat Dennings is okay as his new love interest, and Alexis Dziena is plain awful as his old flame. But maybe that's what the script called for. Who knows? I'm in the wrong age demographic for a peripatetic, all night high school chase from night spot to night spot in search of a particular band that the kids all love. And the music, for me, held zero appeal. Still the premise is mildly interesting and Cera, though reprising Juno, is again rather charming. If this movie is supposed to be in the same league with Juno, however, it flunks calculus; hell, it flunks arithmetic. It's neither sweet (in fact, with the passed-out drunk girl who is Kat Dennings' pal, it's rather disgusting in part), nor is it in any way compelling. I'll go again with mildly interesting for adults. Perhaps another demographic will find it wildly funny and love the music.</fullReview>

In the beginning of the movie, when it was shown that Nick has a passion for music and constantly burns CD's of his favorite songs in order to woo his beautiful but very young looking ex-girlfriend Tris, I mistakenly assumed it had the potential to be a good film. You see, I was the mix tape queen in high school. And like Nick, I would send mix tapes to my boyfriend (now husband), including decorating the cases, all the time. But unfortunately, the movie went down hill from there.This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it's definitely the most boring. Why, you ask? There are many reasons--the main one being that the main characters Nick and Nora are both very vanilla. They're nice kids, but I wasn't given enough info and back story to want to sympathize with them and care about their lives and their blossoming relationship. Also, the actors' who play Nick and Nora have absolutely no chemistry together. I believed they liked each other, but didn't believe it was the hip version of 'Romeo and Julliet' the movie was making it out to be. It was more like a one night stand at best. Also, the movie itself tried too hard to be artsy and cool, and utterly failed at it. Instead, it was more like a gross-out teen comedy minus the comedy and double the grossness. Beyond making me want to lose my lunch, I found it to be very very dull. The entire movie involves Nick, Nora and their friends going to various venues in NYC to find their favorite band, Where's Fluffy. Yep, that's it. Honestly, I think I've seen more interesting things take place on C-Span in the same 90 minutes.Also, the movie is extremely unrealistic. There is no way in real life Nick would be able to date anyone like Tris or Nora. He's very average looking, working class &amp; acts kind of nerdy. Perhaps being in a rock band would give him that extra charisma needed to attract very rich hotties, or maybe he's just good in bed and word got around. It's slightly possible but still it's not enough to be believable. Also, these kids are 18, 19 at the oldest (all are still in high school), how are they able to roam about NYC club hopping at ungodly hours? Don't you have to be 21 to get into these clubs? And all their parents are okay with this? (I know a few parents are like this but most aren't) So, I suppose that it's not only a 'comedy' but a 'fantasy' too.Maybe if you're 13, you'd like this movie because it seems 'cool'--that is, if you're an immature 13 year old. If you're over that age, and especially if you're an old fart like me, who saw 'Sixteen Candles' and 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' at the movies, you are not going to like this film, trust me on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist to be somewhat boring and very lame. The movie was very pointless and the writers tried to make it like real life. That was the problem. It had no plot. It was just about Nick (Michael Cera) who meets a girl at a concert- Norah, they don't know each other but they're friends and friends with one another (they have connections to others). The intro to each character was real lame and stupid. All the characters in this were annoying and I was hard to actually care what was going to happen. I didn't care for the character's at all.The problem is mainly to do with the fact that the characters just aren't all that interesting and are hard to sympathise with; both Nick and Norah, and also their friends, are essentially anxious and/or lazy teens. Their worries are not really all that sincere and I soon lost interest in them. Norah's drunken friend - the obvious comic-relief figure - is also just not all that amusing. Perhaps if I were a few years younger and still felt like a breakup or a friend being gay were a major dramatic event worthy of international media coverage, then I would feel differently. But I think that to anyone over the age of 17, these characters and their misadventures would seem bland.The film, I should mention, takes place over the course of a night, and ends at around 5 or 6 in the morning. I became so bored, however, that I kept on posing myself the question: wouldn't all these people just want to go to bed by this point? In the first hour the basic whole plot was just them going around partying, going to bars/restaurants, and to find their drunk friend. The rest of the film from the time they find they bimbo was them trying to find a band. It got real boring from the last 30 mins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails to live up to its promise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his roles in mainstream hits such as "Superbad" and "Juno," Michael Cera catapulted himself to the head of the class as the modern-day geek of choice for teen comedies (he's sort of to the 2000s what Molly Ringwald was to the 1980s, a figure average adolescents can relate to). In "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Cera continues in that mode, playing a straight member of an otherwise all-gay rock band who can't get over the fact that his pretty but snooty girlfriend, Tris, has dumped him for another guy. One wild night, while in the city with his band mates, the lovesick Nick hooks up with Norah Silverberg, a less pretty but far more authentic girl who attends the same Catholic girls' school as Tris and who discovers, much to her delight, that, in Nick, she may have finally found her "musical soul mate." With a screenplay by Lorene Scafaria (derived from the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan) and direction by Peter Sollett, "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" is an amiable but scattered little comedy that never seems to completely find its footing or to come up with any kind of purposeful meaning or direction. Filled with jokes and comic concepts that either don't lead anywhere or that simply fall flat, the movie fails to do justice to its youthful and exuberant cast that includes, in addition to Cera, Kat Dennings, Alexis Dziena, Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron, Ari Graynor and Jonathan B. Wright.The movie does an impressive job not overly stereotyping its gay characters (though a little of that sneaks in anyway), and there are fleeting moments of tenderness and charm as Nick and Nora work on cementing their relationship, but the movie's lack of a clear-cut focus proves yet again that "niceness" alone isn't enough to guarantee a quality movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about an eventful night of a bunch of high school friends, who are in search of a drunk friend and for love.From the title, I thought "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" was a children's film. After realising it is not, I readjusted my expectations and tried to enjoy the film. However, I found the plot very contrived and actually pointless. Filming the youngsters moving from one place to another is simply not interesting or fun. The characters are all poorly developed, especially the band members who serves no clear purpose in the film apart from being a vehicle to perform the songs.I found "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" tortuously boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New Jersey, the straight high school student Nick (Michael Cera) plays guitar in the gay band Jerk Offs with his gay friends Thom (Aaron Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron). Nick misses his sweetheart, the bitch Tris (Alexis Dziena) that despises the CDs he gives to her. The teenager Norah (Kat Dennings) that studies in the Sacred Heart school with her best friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) and Tris, has never had a boyfriend and does not know Nick but loves his musical taste, and collects the CDs that Tris throws in the garbage. In the weekend, Norah and Caroline hang around to see the concert of the Where's Fluffy band and they meet Tris dating Gary (Zachary Booth). Meanwhile, Nick drives his old Yugo to meet Thom, Dev and his boyfriend Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright) and play in the same club where Norah, Caroline and Tris are. Tris gibes the lonely Norah and she asks Nick to be her boyfriend for five minutes without knowing that he was the ex to Tris. When the alcoholic Caroline is completely wasted, Thom and Dev offer to take her back home and ask Norah to date the brokenhearted Nick. Along the night, they learn that they are soul mates."Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" is a typical teen romance for teens. However, it is possible to an older guy like me enjoy this forgettable film. It is just necessary to remember that one day you were a teenager and you may enjoy this teen romance. The characters are very charismatic and it is only hard to believe that a pretty and cool girl like Kat Dennings does not have a boyfriend. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Nick &amp; Norah - Uma Noite de Amor e Música" ("Nick &amp; Norah ? A Night of Love and Song")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful movie - had me hoping it would be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie -- the starting intro with Chris Bell's "Speed Of Sound" made me think this would be indie rock's High Fidelity in New York music scene. Nick and Norah would talk about which album was better -- The Replacements' Let It Be or Minutemen's Double Nickels on the Dime? Which is the better Belle &amp; Sebastian album? It would keep music junkies into the movie and make the characters more likable.Instead, it became a very gross and stupid comedy that was vaguely about music. The bands weren't real and neither were the characters. I couldn't even tell why I should like the characters at all in the movie. Norah's dim-witted friend vomiting in a train station bathroom then getting her piece of gum out of the toilet was purely for shock value and was like most of the movie. Pointless and rather disappointing.Honestly, if the movie consisted of mixtapes being traded back and forth and Nick and Norah not aware of each other would have been a more compelling movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TIFF 08: Where's Fluffy? Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you cast Michael Cera as an awkward late-teen/quasi-geek; a sassy, smart, attractive girl who is a better catch then she thinks; a killer Indie soundtrack; and comedic side characters that deliver the goods? Juno? Not quite. What we get is Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. It is a real good time; maybe not as fresh or original as one would hope, the laughs are there and the story is enough to hold your attention. Taking place during the course of one night in New York City, searching for an elusive band's secret gig, two lost souls find each other and discover what love is despite the preconceptions they had before meeting. Reminiscent to me of Adventures in Babysitting?the journey's detours and mood, not the story?Sollett enhances the based-on-a-book script with songs on "five star" rotation from his iPod, (he told us after the screening, it's true), and some great work with his actors to stay realistic and keep all that awkwardness of adolescence intact as these young kids open up and find out who they really are.It's an interesting twist on a common premise?guy gets dumped by girl and makes a series of "break-up" mixes, leaving them at her door, complete with handmade packaging. The egotistical brat ex-girlfriend Tris is, each disc is carefully discarded only after showing how sad Nick is losing such a great girl as she. Enter fringe outcast Norah to scoop up the discs and discover how their maker has her exact taste in music and may be her soulmate, without even knowing who he is. That set-up can only lead to a chance encounter at said sadsack's next gig with his band, completed by his two gay friends on vocals and guitar. Norah sees Nick onstage, has a connection to him and eventually cons her way into using him as a fake boyfriend to prove she isn't a loser to Tris. Only she doesn't know that he is her Nick?oh the battle is on as the trio discovers the relationship each has with the other and both girls embark on a journey to win the geek over. Wow, if only real life could be this good for the nerdy sadsacks ? only in Hollywood.While Nick and Norah slowly open their eyes to each other and see how compatible they are and Tris journeys on her mission to grab her ex back, (no way can he go from her to Norah), we also follow Caroline's drunken stupor through the city. Known to have specific places to throw-up in, Norah enlists Nick's bandmates to help her find the lost and clueless friend while also hoping to uncover Where's Fluffy?'s concert location. Our cast of characters here meet up with some interesting creatures. Sollett spoke how he tried to get each locale to be that from the book, actual East Village/Lower East Side haunts he himself frequents. They all needed authenticity in detail and therefore needed waitresses of equal loathing and bands that would actual play there. The look and feel are definitely genuine and help give us, as an audience, the ability to believe it all despite the conveniently contrived plot progressions utilized.The supporting characters we meet are usually a lot of fun, especially cameos from Kevin Corrigan, (he does wonders without even uttering a word), and Andy Samberg, (a riot as a homeless man Cera's Nick stumbles upon at a church around 3am). Sollett spoke of Samberg's willingness to improv and the multiple takes filmed. His favorite alternate take was hilarious and probably better than what was used, but this is a film trying to get a PG-13 rating, so all you out there will have to wait for the DVD to hopefully see a gag reel. I really hope it gets on there because I'd love to see Cera's reaction to the raunchy exchange. The larger cameos, those of friends on screen often, are very effective as well. Aaron Yoo and Rafi Gavron are fantastic as Cera's bandmates/best friends, trying to show him that Norah is the girl he wants, not Tris, while also just having a good time being themselves ? never pushing the gay comedy far enough into stereotypical drivel. Ari Graynor is wonderful as Caroline, inebriated throughout, she brings some big laughs and a few cringes, especially when playing off her wad of chewing gum, a character worthy of credit itself.The true winner of the film, though, besides the amazing soundtrack of people you will probably start hearing about with their next albums as the mainstream moves to include them, is Norah herself, Kat Dennings. This girl is perfect for the role. She is cute in a humble, "I don't think I am" kind of way, with a biting wit and sarcastic defenses. She is the kind of girl you would fight for, but also the one that will not make it easy for you to win. Intellectual and unassuming, she shies away from her father's fame?you should figure out his job early on, but I don't want to be the one to ruin the reveal?and attempts to be original, much like Juno and even Jaye from TV-show "Wonderfalls". Her exchanges with Cera are always endearingly funny, if not laugh out loud?love when she drives his car?and while the awkwardness gets overplayed, ruining some of the chemistry, you do want to see them get together in the end. Not because you know they probably will, but because you agree with Yoo and Gavron, she is the one for Nick and nothing should stand in the way. Oh, the power of music, Sollett has something with his idea to use breakup tapes as unknowing relationship builders. It may not be as good as those it tries to copy, but it definitely deserves a place snuggly next to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Teens will appreciate it, but it is doubtful anyone else will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick (Michael Cera) is a bit of a mope, being freshly dumped by the girl of his dreams, Tris (Alexis Dziena), and is the only straight guy in an all gay band called 'The Jerkoffs'. Norah (Kat Dennings) is one of those lonely souls, searching for the right person and pines after the Tris' stalkerish ex, who she has never met. By chance, they meet at a club the band is playing at, and then begin a night's adventure searching for a secret concert being put on by their favourite band, Where's Fluffy.It may not sound like much on paper, but after seeing the trailer for Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, I was kind of hoping for something that would be more than your typical teen flick. And with Cera coming fresh off Superbad and Juno, I could have only hoped that my own hopes would not go unanswered.Of course, I may have been expecting too much. From the moment the movie starts, it is clearly aiming itself directly for a young teen audience. Yes, the whole idea of being able to search for this mythical band until all hours of the night seems like a bit of a stretch for a normal teen with curfews, but the immature and inexperienced attitude it took about relationships, life and hard drinking seem heavily seated in the realm of a young teenager's fantasies. This is the type of movie I would have been hard pressed to not have enjoyed five or ten years ago, and I imagine most young people feel the same way.But looking at it as an adult, the film only makes me feel older. It has a very nostalgic aura about it, and a type of innocence that only a person in high school could appreciate. It lacks the real world implications of Juno (or even Dennings' own turn in The 40-Year-Old Virgin), and lacks the all around appeal of Superbad, or even seminal teen flicks like The Breakfast Club or Rebel Without a Cause. So how can one who has experienced the life of a teen, appreciate it when they have moved past that stage in life? Should it not have even made a sheer attempt at being able to be accessed by more than one demographic? One problem it has is a lack of focus. In 90 minutes, the filmmakers seem to want to throw every sort of issue a 17-year-old might face, from sex, to making adult decisions, to relationships, to understanding life, into a subplot for the main characters to face. And unfortunately, these two characters are not written in a way that makes them able to deal with all of these things. Yes, the dialogue between the two is incredibly awkward, but both Cera and Dennings seem quite able to play it into something that still sounds natural. But this comes at the expense of never quite understanding the full motivations of either character, and merely having a small idea of where either is coming from. Sure, there are glimmers of issues either faces (Dennings' Norah seems to have an orgasm problem, in one very out-of-place subplot), but never more than a hint. By the end of the film, I was still attempting to totally grasp how these two lost souls managed to find each other in the first place (other than for the sake of a fantastical teen romance).What is worse is that the supporting characters have a bad habit of getting in the way of the two main characters' story. There is an ongoing bit about trying to find Norah's drunk friend Caroline (Ari Graynor), but every scene she has just seems forced and merely placed as a means of padding out a movie that feels too long already. Much the same goes for Nick's gay bandmates Thom (Aaron Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron). Sure they get the most poignant and hilarious moments in the film (alongside their gay friend who is credited merely as "Beefy Guy", and is played by Jonathan B. Wright), but their importance to the film seems a bit skewed. Taking away the fact that their being gay feels more like a gimmick than anything else, all three just seem to have little bearing on the film's events other than to drop hints of wisdom and help search for Caroline and Where's Fluffy. Jay Baruchel, fresh from Tropic Thunder, does okay in a small role as Norah's on and off boyfriend, but he does not get nearly enough screen time to make an impression.It seems the only person who is right on the money is Dziena. She plays the manipulative and spoiled ex-girlfriend to great effect, and seems to be the only person who wants to be taken seriously by all the non-teens watching the movie. She takes great pleasure inflicting pain on Nick, and her brazen control-freak chemistry with Cera is a particular joy to watch. Sure Cera basically ends up playing the same shay and nervously introverted character he became famous for last year, but Dziena's extroverted, over-the-top performance contrasts it so well that Cera almost comes off as being better than he actually is here.I think with a little more focus on appealing to all ages instead of just teens, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist could have truly soared as a film. As it stands, it has the makings of a good movie, but not the proper creative output. More development on the main characters, and less scenes with the supporting ones could have only helped make this film great. At least it packs a hell of a good soundtrack.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist" is a romantic teen-comedy directed by Peter Sollet, based on a book of the same title by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan. It's meant to be sweet, charming romance between two people who find each other through the eclectic melodies of the modern urban music scene, their near-identical music taste bringing them together in the chaos of high school and downtown New York. Music has served as the impetus for many relationships in this day and age, and "Nick &amp; Norah" seeks to present a unique yet quintessential story of two people who fall into this kind of romance. However, this "Infinite" playlist comes up aggravatingly short. For all the hype the movie gave itself about sporting an indie playlist featuring names like Vampire Weekend and Band of Horses, "Nick &amp; Norah" is not a movie about music whatsoever. Take a movie like High Fidelity, a romantic comedy centered on music. High Fidelity used its encyclopedic knowledge of great music to explain the inexplicable complexities of life and relationships. You'd think that a movie about two people's infinite playlist would imply that the film would focus on using good music to effectively accompany some important adolescent-romantic moments, or that they would at least talk about a song or two, of which it does neither. Other than their brief tour of Electric Lady studios and a timid Cure reference, "Nick &amp; Norah" either leaves the music on this infinite playlist as an indefinite pronoun (Nick &amp; Norah's indefinite pronoun, rather) or stays so cozily in the comfort zone of mainstream music (think of two people reveling in their serendipitous mutual adoration of The Beatles) that it comes off as utterly phony. The most irritating thing about this movie is how it scathingly mocks the lives of true music enthusiasts by starring two teenage pseudo-music enthusiasts who use the movie's musical obsession, the fictional band "Where's Fluffy," as a superficial social segregator. Protagonists in the movie love "Where's Fluffy." Antagonists utter things along the lines of "oh yeah, I love Whose Fluffy," to which our cool Nick and Norah sigh and roll their eyes. Throughout the movie, our heroes search for this mystery concert. After all their searching, all we see or hear of this illustrious band is a few enigmatic slow-motion clips of them waltzing onto a stage in ripped jeans and dingy converses to plug in a few guitars before N &amp; N, satisfied entirely with their discovery of the concert, up and leave before the first song, god forbid they actually enjoy the music they blabber on about to each other. "Where's Fluffy" is the macguffin-like, shallow embodiment of "good music taste" in the movie, that certain hip quality the writers wanted Nick &amp; Norah to have that would identify them with the obnoxious hipster crowd. It is not a movie about two people who find each other through music, it is a movie about two teenagers who pretend to be music enthusiasts who use "good music taste" to socially profile the rest of the stereotyped cast and to serve as a hollow excuse for their affection. Sollet would have done well to watch a few music-centered romantic comedies before he got started on this bile-evoking byproduct of adolescent pretense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the slickly-animated opening titles to the hipster-jukebox soundtrack selections to the casting of Michael Cera as the neurotic hipster-kid who just can't let go of his manipulative bitch of an ex-girlfriend, "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" sets out to be the "Juno" of 2008, but falls short of entertainment...and substance. While overrated (particularly in Roger Ebert's glowing review), the latter film was a tricky balancing act of aching-to-be-hip dialog and seemingly loose characterization that, surprisingly, worked its way inside-out to leave an endearing, heartfelt impression; the energetic and caustic lead performance by Ellen Page didn't hurt, either. While "Nick and Norah" pines for the same audience (and will likely get it), its shallow story (two star-crossed, would-be lovers exchange missed signals under the New York City skyline over a night-long search for a show by underground rockers Where's Fluffy) is all about pretty faces and surface qualities; the cast is attractive, but the characters never feel more than two-dimensional (and some are simply grating), and most attempts to elicit an emotional response from the audience come from dishonest manipulation (preferably by some swelling, low-key ballad on the soundtrack). That Nick (Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings), the star-crossed, would-be lovers in question, hook up by night's end goes without saying; it's the artificial roadblocks that stand in their way that make the film tedious amid some genuine laughter and emotion. It's not bad, but certainly not inspired, especially standing in a shadow as immense as "Juno." 5.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Playlist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can you make a movie with a title like Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, with a "meet cute" plot-line sparked by painstakingly decorated, home-made, lovelorn mix CDS being collected by a different girl than they were meant for and then...not have a single memorable tune in the soundtrack? Boy, the music director on this film really missed a great opportunity there. Nick's Cure ring-tone, all five seconds of it, was the catchiest hook in the entire film.Check out the track listing on the soundtrack if you don't believe me. There was no scene in which music was well-matched with the mood so as to build emotions, and no great songs chosen, so all you ever hear, in cars, in clubs, is just a few blasts of innocuous music here and there. But nothing memorable. I blame the writers as well as the music director for not having created a believable underground music scene or scene-goers at all.Another scene that demonstrated writers' Cohn &amp; Levithan's ignorance of what it is to love music or be a musician was the totally absurd scene in the recording studio! Firstly, we'll just overlook the fact that the owner of Electric Lady (or any other pro recording studio) is not going to let his teenage daughter bring people over there on random social visits when the studio's not in use at night (and why isn't in use BTW?), and we'll even be so kind as to further overlook how rather unlikely it is that the daughter of a studio boss would necessarily have recording engineering skills herself, in fact we will even be extra-generous and overlook the impossibility of Nick dating someone who had a friend whose Dad owned Electric Lady without said item of teen gossip ever having reached his ears; yes, we'll swallow all that and just skip straight to the scene where she offers to record something, even letting him play a priceless Strat that is just lying around(?). OK, so swallowing all that too; there they are, all set up, got sound in the cans, guitar is plugged in, all Mic-ed up. Yeah! Maybe we are finally going to get to hear an actual song maybe? Nope, denied! For inexplicably, mere seconds after hitting record, Norah suddenly decides this is the ideal moment to leave the control booth, go in the live room, discuss Judaism briefly, and then get down on the sofa. Leaving tape rolling. Oh yeah, with the live Mic right next to the sofa. I have rarely seen a more improbably twisted set-up for a lame comedic moment (moment being camera panning from them making out on couch to the peak meters going red in the control room).Can I tell you why this scene stank to high heaven for anyone involved in music? Well, I am a singer-songwriter myself, and no matter how much I liked a guy, if he's invited me to an after-hours recording session at one of the best studios in the world, and we've set things up and I'm just about to play my song, I am going to be super annoyed if he suddenly emerges from the control room and starts getting talkie then sexual, at the top of my first take! What? Ridiculous!Any musician is gonna be (yeah even a guy would be) taken aback and say: "Um, excuse me, aren't we rolling tape? What are you doing out here? Is something wrong?" It is not romantic for her to join him in the live room just then, but doesn't make any sense at all! In no way is it credible that any musician, including Nick, would just take it in stride and similarly have amnesia about the fact he was supposed to be recording something. I kept waiting for him to say: "Um, do you mind if we lay down the track before we, uh, lay down ourselves? Or at least stop recording?" Then it might actually have been not only a funny scene, but closer to the way people respond to situations in real-ish life. (That cheezy pun, by the way, is a hilarious gem of wit compared to the jokes in the script.)The only good thing about this film was the giddy performance of Ari Graynor as Caroline. The whole movie should have been about her drunken night of misadventures!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I love this movie. After I watched I felt like I had to read the book, so I did. Both are amazing, but I like the movie better, which is rare for me. The city lights, the late night music, the seriousness and anger in these people, its all great. I think someone besides Michael Cera could have done better for this role, I would suggest Shia Labeauf, but he still did good. All the other actors did amazing. I loved the story, and the overall point of the movie.One of my favorite scenes is in the beginning when Nick calls Triss and his Voicemail gets erased, and he uses fu** perfectly. In PG13 movies, that word is only allowed once, and if used, it must be used right. It was definitely used right in this one.I love this movie, and I'm surprised it has a 6.9 here, I give it a 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Cera reprises a role he does best (a good-natured dork) as high school student Nick O'Leary, the only straight guy in the mostly gay-punk group The Jerk Offs. Nick makes 'closure' CD soundtracks (up to Vol. 12!) for his bitchy ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena, another stereotype for most annoying girl ever--originally hated her in Fool's Gold). Nick meets Tris' best friend Norah Silverberg (Kat Dennings), a mysterious, brooding type, when she asks him to play her boyfriend for a few minutes (another old trick in the book).Just like the characters' purported awkward age, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist was painfully awkward in its acting, story and editing. There were a few highlights and seriously funny moments, but they are a sad sprinkling. Ari Graynor's antics as Caroline, Norah's drunk and ditzy friend, seemed genuine but it wasn't established how and why they remain friends. Some of the dialogue is hilarious but you are rewarded by these handouts only if you're patient enough not to sleep through this infinitely long-drawn out teen flick.Oh, the soundtrack was perfectly ambient but not particularly memorable (which is the saddest part!), however, I thought the escalator kissing scene was really sweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to give this movie a 6, but it just did not do it for me. I did love the soundtrack and I intend on taking a listen of some of the bands featured. My favorite part of the movie was how the city played such a big part and it reminded me of all of my times running around the city until all hours of the night. That part of the movie the the most entertaining, but other than that I thought it was surprisingly weak. I have to say that Michael Cera is one of the funniest human beings in the world in my opinion, but this movie did not work for me. His character is incredibly cool and likable, but somehow a jerk some of the time and awkward at the same time. If his character was more consistent it would have helped. Kat Dennings was pretty good too, but the relationship and the characters were not consistent. There supporting cast was a big plus and the one drunk friend reminded me of a friend I had from undergraduate. Not so much the drunk aspect, but her insecurities and her short comings as a person, but the great amount of love she had for her friends. Overall I did not hate the movie, but it suffered from a pacing problem and the characters did not feel consistent, especially Cera's character. I can think of very few that I would recommend this movie too, but it did make me laugh quite a few times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Cera plays Nick, a rock musician who has recently been dumped by his girlfriend (Alexis Dziena). The rest of his band forces him into the arms of a beautiful girl, Norah (Kat Dennings) who has showed up to their show. The film takes place over one night in New York City, and we watch the two kids fall for each other while some hip music plays over the soundtrack. The two leads are quite charming. We've seen Cera do this same role before, so Dennings is the real surprise here. She's stunning, and this movie's sure to make her a big star. The casting is quite off in this movie, though. It's the kind of movie where Norah is frequently chastised for being a nerd and ugly and sexually inexperienced, but she never comes off as such. Dziena comes off as far too sexy to have been dating Cera in any life. Jay Baruchel shows up as Norah's on-again-off-again boyfriend, and, if you're familiar with his career anyway, he's way too dorky and likable to be playing any sort of villain. Or even anyone cool. I did like the three gay guys who comprised the rest of Cera's band. Aaron Yoo is quite good. He was also in the underrated film Rocket Science last year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think making a screenplay of a well-written , successful book, where the whole plot takes place in less than twenty-four hours would be pretty easy, right? As a screenwriter, you're being handed something on a platter. Well, they managed to take a fun, funny, fast-paced book and turn it into a SLOW, boring movie. I could barely make it through.And given that one of the main bonding points for the two main characters is music, you'd expect a good soundtrack, too. Considering the characters are all running around trying to locate a PUNK band, wouldn't that beg for lost of fast, punky music? Nope - slow, overwrought, bland musak for a soundtrack.This could have (easily) been such a good film, but the makers totally dropped the ball. I recommend the book - it's much better.</fullReview>

I'd have gotten angry and went home after that.Oh and one more thing, why didn't Nick and Norah stay and listen to Fuffy after all of the effort? Pfffffft this was a light weight movie that seemed to be made up as it went along. I WANTED to like this movie but it kind of fell flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist prides itself on being hip. However, aside from a few quirks and some witty dialogue, it offers absolutely nothing fresh or original as a teen romantic comedy. To be honest, if you took away the indie rock and the weird cars, it would be just like any other teen comedy. It's been done before and it's been done better. However, Nick and Norah is still fairly entertaining and offers several laughs due to some fairly clever writing.The story goes something like this: Nick (Michael Cera) is depressed. His girlfriend, a controlling little prep named Tris, has broken up with him. Instead of focusing on his band (consisting of two gay guys and himself ? and no drummer), Nick spends his time leaving Tris various voice mails and making her enough mixed CDs to last a lifetime. Tris doesn't really care. She cheated on him the whole time they were together and throws away his CDs without listening to him. Tris's somewhat-friend Norah (Kat Dennings), however, loves the CDs. She feels a connection to Nick, but they've never met. One night, Nick and his band are playing in the same venue that Norah, Tris, and their mutual friend Caroline happen to be. Nick and Norah meet through strange circumstances and, because of how depressed Nick has been, his friends scheme to get the two of them together. What ensues is a night that the two of them will never forget.As far as acting is concerned, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist offers nothing special. Both Michael Cera and Kat Dennings are good in their roles, but neither one of the actors are invoking any new territory. They've played these roles before. Nick comes off as kind of a cross between Cera's characters in Superbad and Juno. Norah is a carbon copy of Kat Dennings' character in last year's Charlie Bartlett. All three of these films were infinitely (no pun intended) better than this one. None of the other actors have a chance for a standout performance and are essentially forgettable.The best part of this film is, arguably, the scenes between Cera and Dennings. They have some chemistry and the scenes during which the two of them talk are well written and seem real. The rest of the film hinges on ridiculous and offers some scenes that feel out of place (such as a disgusting scene involving Norah's drunk friend.. you'll know what I mean). There are several genuinely funny moments and some convincing heartfelt moments, but these are few and far between. This is basically the typical romantic comedy formula masquerading as something else through the usage of indie bands, old yellow cars, and a lot of chaos. It's not a bad film, really, but it's also not very good.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre movie at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this movie was nothing fantastic. The screenplay was a typical modern teenage romance movie. Nothing is going to draw much emotion out of you in this movie. Sure, there are some sweet little "awww" moments, and some laugh out loud dialogue but I think this movie completely failed in inducing anything real.In my opinion the script was really bad. For example, the character Tris. We know that she is an obnoxious bitch from the get go. But the movie does not relent in pounding that fact home, and it becomes so tiresome seeing the same facet of a character from the same one-dimensional perspective over and over again.The supporting characters were largely underdeveloped. Caroline is a character used completely for comic relief. Sure, there is nothing wrong with that when executed tastefully, but it is plain silly and a waste of time watching a character that has no actual purpose in the movie but to look stupid horsing around on screen.There are so many plot holes and ambiguities in the movie that leave you wondering "Why?" and everything seems much too prefabricated.In the movie's defense though, it's got a banging soundtrack (which I will be sure to buy when I get the chance), the acting was nice, the pop culture references are relevant, and the overall feel of the show is warm.Don't expect any tears, of sadness or from laughter from this romantic comedy. As mentioned, it's a mediocre movie at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Picture of The Quintessential Teen Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist after bugging my mom for quite a while. I was so intent on seeing the movie that the upcoming movies seemed like torture. I never read the book but the movie was awesome in itself. The adorkable Michael Cera from Juno played Nick, a loner that gotten broken up with his longtime GF Tris (Alexis Dzien) and keeps making mixes for her. Tris throws them out but her "friend" Norah saves them from Metal Hell. She listens to the mixes and thinks the unknown maker is her soulmate. That's all I'll reveal.Onto my opinion, I honestly think N &amp; N's Infinite Playlist shouldn't be in the chick flick genre. I'll admit that I'm a fan of cheesy romantic comedies but this is totally different. I wouldn't say it's a love story because in a normal chick flick the characters are introduced right away and from some unfathomable magic I don't understand they click and are instantly in love. The whole "Would you be my boyfriend for five minutes?" had me laughing my butt off and I hate to admit it but I'm jealous of Kat.There are lot of words to describe this. Alexis Dzien plays the role of "bitchy slut" perfectly. Ari Graynor scenes are funny too.The part where those random people asked them for a ride because Nick's car looked like a cab and then treated Nick and Norah to an all too graphic make out sesh...EW! All in all BEST MOVIE EVA!If possible, I would've given it an 1000/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so, having read(and fallen in love with) the book that this movie is based on, I was kinda hesitant about seeing this movie. But I was pleasantly surprised despite the fact that the movie is only slightly similar to the book.They basically mangled the book and I still liked this movie.Anyways, the only thing that actually irked me about this movie was that Tris went in the COMPLETE OPPOSITE direction than in the book. In the book, she's not a vindictive, selfish bimbo that cares about nobody in the process, she actually cares about Nick and has her human moments.Yes, I know it's about Nick and Norah but you can't really have a great movie without some sort of three dimensional background characters. I didn't have a problem with Tal-he was sleazy enough, an idiot that tried to come off as smooth and I liked his personality(what little you actually saw). Caroline was hysterical and I have to give props to Ari Graynor for pulling her off so effing well-and her basic storyline was "I'm a free spirited drunken woman roaming around the city and so help me GOD if I don't keep chewing the same piece of gum the world will end"All in all, I liked it. It's not terrible enough to not go see it in the theater but if you wanted to wait to rent you wouldn't be missing out on anything except quality time in the world with friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Karma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peter Sollett's "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" is the sweetest and most charming movie of the year. It is also hysterical. Yes, "Nick and Norah" is predictable by virtue of being romantic comedy. However, Writer Lorene Scafaria's adaptation of Rachel Cohn and David Levithan's book is more than just teen angst and high jinx. "Nick and Norah" surprises in its characters' authenticity, and here the journey is as joyous as the outcome. Scarfaria's screenplay may win an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. It is that good. "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" has the genuine feel of last year's "Juno", and the great music to back up its title.Michael Cera and Kat Dennings are amazing as Nick and Norah. Cera is perhaps a Tom Hanks slacker version. He nails the universal teen enduring the world with a big heart. Dennings gives a breakthrough performance. She is deceptively funny, pretty and very smart. In a wonderful scene gay band mate Thom (Aaron Yoo) says to Nicky, "You still haven't figured it out yet?" The Beatles got it?"I Want to Hold Your Hand". He grabs Nick's hand and tells him, "?It's about this." For temporarily obtuse Nicky, Thom is talking about Norah.Nick (Cera) is a high school senior and the straight bass player for the gay band "The Jerk Offs", along with is buds Thom (Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron). As we first meet Nick, he comes off as a well intentioned pathetic loser. He records CD mixes of his favorite songs for his ex-girlfriend Tris (hot and vapid Alexis Dziena). Though it becomes immediately obvious that Nick is not at all a loser, and that Tris is beyond bitch. The latter of course is transparent to Thom and Dev, and lost upon Nick.Norah (Dennings) and her best friend Caroline (cute and scattered Ari Graynor) attend an all girls' school with Tris (Dziena). Tris painfully mocks and discards Nick's CDs. Norah, who listens to the CD discards, may have found her soul mate in Nick, whom she has never met. The thread that binds them all is finding the secret concert of their favorite band "Where's Fluffy" somewhere in New York City. For director Sollett the city is a living and breathing character. He and Scarfaria also make the most hilarious and creative use of chewing gum.Dev and Thom coax Nick out of his self pity exile to play a gig at a club in the city. Norah and Caroline are also at the club, along with Tris and her "mall stalker" boyfriend. Norah notices Nick playing in the band. Caroline remarks, "You're practically blowing him with your eyes!" Under contrived circumstance Norah asks Nick to pose as her boyfriend for 5 minutes. Norah soon realizes that Nick is Tris's ex. It's Nick and Norah's karma.Cera and Dennings have amazing chemistry and heart which are the hallmarks of "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist". We cheer for their Nick and Norah, because they are just decent and authentic souls. Their journey is wrought with angst, humor, and all heart. Nick ridiculously suffers over Norah's ex?Tal (funny arrogant Jay Baruchel), who is her "friend with benefits". He still hasn't figured out that he and Norah are falling in love, and that Tris (Dziena) is all wrong.Cera perfectly plays Nick as a guy, who thinks way too much, when he should listen to his heart. Dennings embodies Norah as the girl, who really doesn't get that she is amazing, overshadowed in insecurity and compensating by having it all figured out. She can't see that she has it all over Tris. In a very nice scene Nick tells Norah, "You're beautiful." Cera and Dennings have many memorable moments be it arguing in Nick's yellow Yugo or Nick giving Norah his jacket to protect her from the cold. One that stands out: Norah while nursing drunken Caroline says to Nick, "I was thinking about Brown? It would be kind of nice knowing someone an hour away." Nick gives Norah a moisten hand wipe from the last time his family had Chinese food. Smart funny writing, amazing performances, and good karma make "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" among the year's best movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peter Sollett's love story is the perfect remedy to a broken heart, a short charming thrill and even a look up icon for other wannabe film makers.This 2008 release shows how a small cast a minimum budget and young actors can break formula to dazzle and entertain in a story that isn't concerned with rules and flows as in real time, all within one evening that feels more realistic and emphatic than any romantic film that has been screened in a long time.Starting with a simple humorous ex boyfriend ex girlfriend story and developing into a tale of jealousy and musical vibrancy is the perfect empathy for a lost soul or a blissful hour and a half synchronisation of teenage lust and love.Michael Cera continues to rise as an actor. I watched Scott Pilgrim vs the world a few weeks before watching this and have seen his improvement and yet here he fits the lost soul role like a glove and whilst it isn't his funniest creation there are some great moments.He is upstaged by Kat Dennings, a fresh face who plays another confused teen who you sympathise with constantly and yet she carries this vibrancy as Norah so you can laugh and move along with her.The two blend together well and as the story moves along their characters tackle various obstacles in friendship and doing the right thing. The disappearance of Norah's friend causes some great scenes between them.And all the while this film boasts an appetite of musical freshness that should delight many viewers. The variance of pop, metal, rock and dance are all engaging and especially the last song lives up to the hype.The journey to find the mysterious band gives the plot its freshness in the romantic genre and for that reason, along with its great cast, direction and soundtrack I strongly recommend you view this film as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teenage rom-com INDIE movie, this movie fits this definition a little bit too much for my own taste. The Michael Cera character, the guy listens to the most obscure band possible, drives the crappiest and most unknown car ever, has the weirdest of the hobbies (creating dozens and dozens of mix cds) all of his friends are gay... Basically he's just some fantasy character. The Norah character get a lot less developed and she is only used as the quirky insecure girl that will open Michael Cera eyes and make him face reality...I wish the writer/director would have tone down on the extreme indieness, as it puts too much weight on the story. So yes expect a good dose of elitist east coast, alternative, intellectual, left-wing material... (just quoting an ep from 30 Rock). The rom-com part was nicely done but gets definitely out shined, too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I never wash my pants...I like to keep the night on them."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Peter Sollet, here stars Michael Cera (Superbad, Juno, Arrested Development) and Kat Dennings (40 Year Old Virgin,The House Bunny) in this cute romantic comedy.Based on my favorite book by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan...Nick (Cera) is the bassist an all gay band, The Jerkoffs, and is depressed over his ex lover Tris(Alexis Dziena) leaving him, so he occasionally makes her mix CD's. Meanwhile, Norah (Dennings) coincidentally gets ahold of Nick's mix tapes when Tris throws them out and falls in love with the music. This draws in these two mysterious teens to each other and they coincidentally meet at the Nick's gig where Norah ask Nick to be her boyfriend for five minutes to save herself from Tris's bitchy mouth. Norah and Nick then agree to spend he night with each other looking for their favorite band called Where's Fluffy and they end up finding each other...OK, I'm 15 years old, so you can say I fit the film's demography, but even if I was an old man I still would have enjoyed it...First of all, I loved the performances. Michael Cera rocks tight skinny jeans, which makes him look pretty metrosexual and cool, and a tight green hoody. Both the pants and hoodie are from American Apparel, so I guess he really wanted to fit the whole hipster-rock fashion style in this movie. Also, just like in the book, he wears the jacket (it's basically a Dickies Eisenhower jacket) with the words "Salvatore" stenciled on it. Sure Cera does the same role in this one, but it suits his character. Anyway, Cera's character here is more funny and confident than characters Evan (from Superbad) or Paulie Bleeker (from Juno) that he played. However, his character can be a bit too stone-like and boring sometimes such as when his friends tried to get him to do the "sandwich" (basically dancing and rubbing their body on each other at the same time) with Norah, but he tries to move away. With a girl that sexy, I would do a double cheeseburger on her. Moving on... Dennings is a great actress herself. She is so pretty that you may not believe or follow the whole "I think I'm unattractive" gag. However, she makes you feel and understand her character. Norah does have her times of being annoying and unlike-able such as when she punched Nick hard in the neck when he called her "jealous" because even though I'm a boy, if a girl did that to me...I'd maybe have to do that back to her to let her know it feels. In Contrast, Dennings' chemistry with Cera is amazing. They have many great scenes together such as in "Electric Lady Studios" when Norah makes a reference to the "Tikkun Olam" causing Nick to say "maybe we're the pieces" which was so sweet.Dziena does good in her part as playing a pretty but cold hearted snake, but I felt they could have made her character more understanding, like in the book, where it shows her having a caring side. Norah's friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) has many funny scenes as a drunk teen out of her mind, but some scenes with her are annoying and makes you want the scenes to go back to Nick and Norah. Disturbia's Aaron Yoo and rising stars Rafi Gavron and Jonathan B wright star as Nick's gay, funny, and helpful band-mates and friends. Usual geeky Jay Baruchel (Knocked Up) plays Tal, Norah's ex or not boyfriend, who is the best rival for Cera. I love the cameos of Devendra Banhart, Andy Samberg, Eddie Kaye Thomas, and many others.Other than the performances, the soundtrack is awesome and I am going to add it on my ipod. The scenarios are beautiful and fits the movie. The movie has many funny moments like nick driving a Yugo and funny gags like the whole gum being passed around thing.In Conclusion, the movie does have some awkward moments though, but its one of the best hipster rom-coms ever. It breaks out of the usual teen comedy traditions and does its own thing just like in "Juno". This movie may not be better than "Juno", but it sure comes close and is more fun. Believe me, you will enjoy yourself watching this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Night To Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, never before have the cinematic elements of plot and character been so well represented in a coming-of-age romantic comedy. Lets start with the cast. Michael Cera has, in terms of roles, moved on from his Superbad/Juno counterparts into a character equally dorky but much more mature. Since his career thus far has been portraying role after geeky role, he plays his part perfectly. Kat Dennings shines as the not-hot-but-beautiful girl who he eventually 'Finds Fluffy' with. The excellent supportive cast is mostly made up of non-stereotypical gay guys, a hilariously drunk best friend, pesty ex's who we love to despise, and an indie rock band, confusingly entitled "Wheres Fluffy?". The plot consists of a wild night through the underground indie rock scene of New York. However cliché'd this sounds, I am amazed at how original this unoriginal plot basis turns out to be. The score is what pulls this movie together for me, since the music in this movie is nearly a character itself.What separates this movie from any other movie in this particular genre, is the relationship between the two main characters. At the end, they aren't admitting their undying love for each other or asking each other to marry. I don't know how to describe it. It's much more than a hookup but less than lifelong love. This movie isn't a love story per se, but a movie about opportunities.This is not a movie I will easily forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent juvenile comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt the almost complete absence of juvenile comedies on commercial cinema on recent years weird,but compensating that,we have the excellent movie Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist which,under Peter Sollet's precise direction,combines intelligent and funny humor with honest and realistic romance.This movie is based on a book,and that can partially explain why it has perfectly constructed characters,who empathize with the spectator.Besides,I admired how the screenplay avoids every single cliché from juvenile comedies...in other words,we will not find athletic villains,idiot adults or love declarations on an airport,sport event or at the graduation party.Nick and Norah... perfectly captures the emotion and confusion a lot of teenagers experiment.I think this movie is a combination between After Hours and Before Sunset,but on a juvenile way.On the one hand,it portraits a never-ending night in which the relationship between two young people is developed.And,on the other hand,Nick and Norah... shows the bizarre night adventures in New York a group of eccentric characters live,at the same time their trip is more important than the final destination.The best element from this movie are the characters and the way in which they interact,which is not why the screenplay says so,but because the illusion of reality is perfect and they simple interact as normal young people.The soundtrack is also excellent,because every song accompanies the tone of the scenes,so their presence is not arbitrary.The only fail I found on this movie is that a few dialogues felt a little bit forced.But,in spite of that minimum fail,I liked this movie very much.Nick and Norah... is a brilliant juvenile comedy with an excellent screenplay,solid performances and a competent direction,and those attributes are not usually found on the sub-genus "juvenile comedies".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite DVD movie release of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite movie that was released in 2009 next to Zach and Miri make a Porno, The Rocker, Pineapple express, and Step brothers! This movie is for people who love romance comedy's, Love Indie rock style, and love great actors... but like me I love this movie because of the Chemistry between Nick and Norah. The cast includes Michael Cera who is famous for Superbad and Juno, and Kat Dennings who is famous from the 40 year old virgin. I just got the DVD yesterday and I love it, and since I got mine from Best buy it came with a "Where's Fluffy T shirt which is Maroon with a yellow bunny logo, it also says "Nick and Norahs infinite playlist on the back of the t shirt. Mine came in Large so thats great! and it was just 5 dollars more. I love the special features on it, and This is the first movie where I heard the Commentaries with the actors and I loved it. One of my favorite movies of 2008 and 2009, And I'm about to go watch it again!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is, well ... pointless. Now I'm not a snotty movie critic who feels no character development and so on and so forth are mortal sins; I've watched many a pointless movie in my day. The difference here however is that all those movies like Dumb and Dumber are either funny or at least enjoyable for some other reason. Nick and Norah on the other hand, is not funny and the whole time it had me wondering exactly why I was watching it. Michael Cera gives a mediocre performance, and the only other recognizable actors are short cameos from Saturday Night Live regulars. To put it simply, Nick and Norah is the latest movie aimed at teenagers that is "not mainstream" and cool to like. However with this movie unlike Juno which did have some original ideas and was a likable movie, this is predictable, over-clichéd, and overall feels sloppy. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very slight but does have a detached, awkward charm to it that is helped by fairly frequent laughs and amusing moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick is a bassist in his friend's band, which is today called The Jerk-Offs. He goes to play with them at a small venue despite his broken heart and unending attempts to get back with Tris through the medium of mixtapes. At the venue he is not only confronted with Tris with a new guy but also with the equally geeky and awkward Norah, who has admired Nick unseen by listening to his mix CD's when Tris bins them unheard. Their love of similar music sees them seeking out a secret gig by the band Where's Fluffy but things go wrong along the way, throwing them into chaos which may morph into a first date.If the title and the (very good) soundtrack doesn't tell you what to expect from this film then the main cast almost certainly will because we are firmly in "awkwardly-cool" territory. With this in mind it is best to approach with caution if you're not a fan of this because there is not a lot more than this to win over the casual viewer. The narrative itself will not be enough because the story is a pretty loose thread about Nick and Norah falling for one another against a backdrop of a "cool, crazy night in NYC"?, which is a thread that doesn't really work. The style of the characters is of geeky detachment and this does have the knock-on effect on the story by never making the viewer really care that much for the characters as real people or getting that engaged in the story. Fortunately, if you like this sort of thing, you will find that it does have enough awkward charm to carry it off as a sort of quirky youthful piece but even then you won't find a romance that has much beyond this superficial charm. Instead the film rides this free-wheeling charm for as long as it can. As my partner observed, few people this age are really this sorted, cool and free but the film needs them to be for this to work so they are. They have the run of NYC without limits of space, time or money to hinder them and in this regard the audience is drawn into this world and it felt fresh and fun. The laughs are sporadic but frequent enough to hold the attention while generally the aforementioned charm held me in a genial state where I was happy being even when the film wasn't working that well. The side characters help this a lot as they have no pressure on them narratively and so can be superficial and fun and still work.The casting of Cera is hardly a stretch since this awkward stuff is his bread and butter. It would be nice to see him do something else (although I still want the Arrested Development film) but he is solid here, doing what is expected of him. Dennings is the same, doing awkward/ironic detachment very well and complimenting the overall style of the film. As I said though, the problem is that, with so much geeky-cool detachment the central relationship doesn't really work even if their charm means we quite like the characters. Yoo, Gavron and Gaynor are all fun and light in supporting roles that add energy and movement to the story but I felt a bit for Dziena who is a very simple manipulative character without any sense of being a real person below this. I'm told that this is not the case in the book so I may read that in the future. As suggested by the title of the film, the soundtrack is really good and fits the characters and feel of the film.As a total product though, Nick &amp; Norah is not a film that will be embraced by a mass audience. It is far too slight and superficial to draw the audience into the central relationship and it does rely on charm and an energetic and youthful tone to carry it through. Don't get me wrong - I found it charming, nice and quite fun, generally enjoying it but the minute it ended the memory started to fade and it is one of those films that does the job but not to the extent that it makes any sort of lasting impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are no surprises in this teen romcom. Nearly all romcoms follow the formula of the two protagonists not realising that they are meant for each other until near the end, and this is no exception.However, it does have several things going for it. One is the unusual skeleton, which is to do with various musical matters - going to concerts, and trying to get to a secret concert (does New York really have live amplified rooftop concerts at 5am?). Another is Ari Graynor, who delivers one of the most delightful screen drunks I can recall. And the third is the screen personae of Michael Cera and Kat Dennings as Nick and Norah, who are eventually drawn together by shared musical tastes.Michael Cera is very good at projecting vulnerability, very nearly easing into "loser" territory, but with too strong a sense of self worth for that to apply fully. Kat Dennings, with whom I am not familiar, plays well, but comes over as a little too adult given the school hall sequence early on (ditto Alexis Dziena, albeit not quite to the same extent).Notwithstanding how slight this film is, I enjoyed it a lot. There are a number of solid laughs (mostly courtesy of Ari Graynor's Caroline) and one gross-out moment - and it really is gross, people in the cinema were groaning! What I enjoyed rather less was the bitch sitting in front and to the left of me who kept switching her mobile phone on every five minutes - it was like having a torch shining in my eyes. So for anyone reading this who tends to do this in cinemas, please don't. It's very selfish.Sermon over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's shamelessly clichéd, and yet the headline couple make such an awkward and adorable pair that they compel you to watch til the end. Both Cena and Dennings are very likable in their own inimitable styles, Cena his usual gawky yet awkwardly smug self, Dennings also typical in her independent, sharp-witted disguise that conceals a softer centre. Their midnight antics as they try to locate a missing mutual friend, and the oddballs they encounter is a great night out, something perhaps to which a lot of viewers could relate.Maybe a little uneven at times, there's a very awkward scene towards the end that seems superfluous and it surprises me that it made the final cut as it really had no bearing on the outcome. Not to labour the point, I just felt it was insignificant in the context of the plot and seemed disjointed and out of place.One of those films where the chase makes the movie entertaining, but the destination is not as gratifying. Solid effort despite the rather cryptic and clumsy title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film.I wasn't an indie band fan when I was a kid, and I never lived in NYC, and gay culture wasn't nearly so commonly accepted in the 80's, but I definitely remember one or two nights like Nick &amp; Norah's. -That is, being shy and confused and alive and in love and following a bizarre series of events with little meaning until dawn, doing stupid things with friends because I had the energy and, 'it felt right at the time'. -I remember euphoric madness warring with the pull to be adult and responsible. This film captured that well, I thought.I feel like I knew those people.Yes, yes, yes, this film *was* filled with cliché. Real life has more subtleties and layers, and with smart people it also contains a meta-awareness, a self-observation. But I think this film WAS the meta-awareness and self-observation. -It had a need to pull a bunch of brief and random treasures together into a 90 minute narrative. (Treasures like sidewalk gawkers cheering when the car door was unlocked; Observations likely collected from genuine experiences). I can forgive a bit of contrivance to get that job done, especially when the treasures were sweet and the contrivances were smooth and earnestly performed.But here's a strange thing: I notice that this film has touched more than one nerve or two; there are some very strong reactions in the reviews for this movie which don't seem to stem from legitimate literary criticisms, but rather something more personal. -Which seems odd, given that nothing terribly intense happened. With the exception of a couple of garden-variety selfish jerks, the characters were quite harmless and kind.Anyway, I'd give this film a chance. It may strike a chord with you, as it did with me. If it doesn't, well.., just stop watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt and original! Something you don't see very much any more in Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick is dealing with a bad breakup with everybody's dream girl, Tris (Dziena) Nick's outlook starts to get a bit brighter when Norah asks Nick to be his girlfriend for 5 minutes, so she can make an impression on Tris. It lasts longer than expected when they are forced to team up with Nick's buddies to track down Caroline's drunken friend. This is a very good coming of age film! It's got heart and originality in spades, something you don't see as often as you'd like in Hollywood. I'm sure there are many that will shake their heads at this, but Caroline's drunken adventures reminded a bit of Brenna's adventures in Babysitting! It's probably far- fetched, but maybe that was a tribute of sorts? Anyway, this movie has much more than meets the eye! It has two of my favorite things in this world! Romance and music. This film manages to combine both very well. I was really impressed by the realism and how genuine this movie was. A lot of the situations rang true for me. I liked some of the gags as well. A horny couple mistaking a yellow Yugo for a cab was hilarious. I'm not a huge fan of Cera's. His "awkward" shtick works very well in this movie, and I have to give him credit. His witty banter with Dennings felt like conversation you would see between two people in real life. I empathized with his situation. We've all had that girl we go crazy over...despite that she's a witch. Kat Dennings was the star in my mind. It's easy to see why she went on to stardom on 2 Broke Girls. Her character is easy to fall in love with and easy to relate too. She oozes charisma. Ari Graynor is likable as the dense best friend of Norah's. Alexis Dziena is good as the embittered and devious ex. I didn't think she was that hot though. Jay Baruchel is awful as usual. Andy Samberg has a cameo near the end. I can promise that you'll grin and smile at least a few times during this movie. If you want a feel good movie to uplift your spirits, this movie will do the job. Music buffs should love the soundtrack7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick (Michael Cera) is obsessively in love with Tris (Alexis Dziena). She rejects him utterly and shows up at Nick's band performance with another guy. Norah (Kat Dennings) knows Tris but have never met Nick even though she loves his music. So when Norah needs a fake boyfriend for 5 minutes to show off to Tris, she grabs Nick. What follows is a night of adventures to rescue Norah's drunken friend Caroline (Ari Graynor), search for a secret show of their favorite indie band in Manhattan, and escape from the jealous crazed ex Tris.Michael Cera and Kat Dennings didn't have the best chemistry at the start mostly due to his obsession with Tris. Luckily Ari Graynor was able to keep the movie going with her wacky drunk act. The group of actors seem to have a lot of fun. That fun is definitely transmitted onto the screen as great camaraderie. The movie is full of lovely moments, and great music. Cera and Dennings do have better chemistry as the movie goes on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best movie I have ever seen and also my favourite of all time, I am a massive Cera fan and this is the movie that really started my Cera addiction. Everything about this movie is brilliant, I now have all the soundtrack on my iPod its brilliant especially the end song performed by where's fluffy or rather The real Tuesday weld-Last words is my favourite song and most played in my iTunes library. The movie its self is simply amazing, the magical city of new york and electric lady studios is so picturesque and accurately describes the strange sense of magic in a city in the early hours of the morning. The relationship between Cera and Dennings is very fast and very cute with both of them being rather socially awkward but connecting so well with each other. The movie really has to be experienced to understand its awesomeness and I highly highly recommend it to anyone especially if you like music around the indie genre or indie rock genre as I do. So in conclusion an epic movie, cute storyline and relationship, strangely magical city setting and AMAZING soundtrack. So go watch it XD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im not going to go in depth on this review as I feel that the best reviews are the shortest so... Michel Cera plays a angst Teen who has just broken up with his girlfriend struggling to cope. This leads to him making mixed Cds (formerly tapes) which end up in the path of Norah one of his exes friends. This leads to a night where they more than cross paths. Thats it in a nutshell know comes to the good and bad... GOOD 1)Michel Cera is pro, not his best but still entertaining 2)The musical choice overall is good although that is subjective 3)The Supporting Cast overall is good and fun BAD 1)I don't feel the Characters are fully developed, I just didn't connect with them, Might just be me 2)Kat Dennings, OK don't get me wrong she was OK, OK. But opposite Cera I feel she lost all likability. 3)Story was very average and had a few holes and hard to believe moments. Verdict 6/10 Yeh its worth the watch if you like Superbad or Juno but otherwise its just okay I guess........ Just my Opinion.........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple meets under unusual circumstances on a night in New York, and embark upon a journey which changes the both of them for ever. It's a sweet enough story, but what lifts it from good to great is the cast.Stunning and sassy Kat Dennings and the instantly likable Michael Cera are down-to-earth enough to feel like regular, real people - an important trait in lead roles, given how invested in them we need to become - while the supporting cast is rife with delightfully over-the-top characters who offer some wonderful comedic moments.The plot centres on the duo's twin missions: to track down an elusive indie band's secret gig, and to relocate a drunk, missing friend. But the real journey is one of discovery - for Cera's character, to see how wrong his on-again off-again girlfriend is for him, and Dennings', to learn how to overcome her own feelings of inadequacy.These realisations come subtly in an understated manner which is nicely at odds to some of the overtly comical people they meet along the way (Andy Samberg in a very minor role instantly springs to mind - along with all manner of drag queens, bitter exes, profane musicians and a "Drunkzilla"). Against this backdrop, our heroes seem all the more relatable.There are moments of hilarity, and of real pathos; things we all recognise from our own youthful misadventures, and ones we know from our relationships. It's all played out by a well-capable cast, and boasts a top-notch soundtrack.This is indie at its finest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plug your Ipods in, put your CDs on and pump up the volume for this hilarious and heartfelt teenage comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review for "Tonight You're Mine", I mentioned that the music in that film was like listening to an eclectic mixtape you haven't heard in a while. I guess I must have had a mixed feeling about that mixtape while watching "Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist". Reader, that mixed feeling of mine was washed away as I got caught up in this hilarious and somewhat heartfelt teenage romantic comedy. To be clear, I never read the book by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan that the movie was based on. Had I read it and watching the film after that, my thought should've been: "Oh, well, despite some differences and an added subplot, it remains true to the book." It seems like it does remain true to the book, and while I'm still scratching my head thinking about that, the movie benefits really well from three leading performances, a superb supporting cast, a cool soundtrack, a funny and authentic script by Lorene Scafaria and terrific direction by Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas). The always funny and charming Michael Cera plays Nick, a New Jersey teen who was dumped by the cold-hearted Tris (Alexis Dziena) and plays in a "queercore" band known as "The Jerk-Offs" (He's the straight guy playing guitar with two gay friends). The supremely outrageous Kat Dennings plays Norah, a Jewish girl who loves music, has a drunk best friend, Caroline (Ari Graynor) by her side and a "frenemy" in Tris and also has been burnt by love. It all changes in one night, when the two are on a mission to search for a very surprise show in New York for a band called "Where's Fluffy?". Along the way, Nick desperately (and secretly) wants Tris back, but she's with Gary (Zachary Booth), a slightly boring fellow, in order to make him jealous. Even Norah has a problem trying to keep her on-again, off-again FWB Tal (Jay Baruchel) in check. Throughout the movie, Nick and Norah travel in a yellow taxi-cab-like car known as the "Yugo", trying to find Fluffy and to also find Caroline, who, being the drunk best friend that she is, disappears from Nick's friends' van. Also, they learn about themselves, fall in love and also that a night like this should carry a playlist for when to start ahead. "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" does have its ups and downs at some levels, but 90% of the ups are more better than the 10% downs. Keeping a mellow, but edgy PG-13 vibe (the book, I guess, was more edgier) to make every 13-year-old being capable in going for a night like this, the movie has its charms and it also has a very real feel to it. Can you imagine 18-year-old teenagers going out to indie shows or to see someone you know play in a band? Sure, you can. I like Cera and Dennings here, their chemistry is spot-on sweet and funny as Nick and Norah. Ari Graynor is the scene-stealer perfection, especially when she has scenes by herself (including that scene when she's in a Port Authority bathroom and while she's chewing on a already-used gum) that shows a very unique, but drunk quality to it. The supporting cast is terrific, from Ravi Gavron and Aaron Yoo as Dev and Thom, Nick's gay friends to Jay Baruchel as Norah's Boyfriend with Benefits, who still loves her, but he wants his music career to blow up. (Did I ever tell you that Norah is the daughter of a record producer?) The one tiny misstep is Alexis Dziena as Tris. Don't get me wrong, Dziena is pretty and likable here, but to put her in as a mean girl with a somewhat semi-established personality about why she is who she is, it kind of threw me off. But still, I enjoyed the movie. It rocks on so many levels, and it is a night you won't forget. So, turn up the music and believe in the magic. Trust me on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick, Norah and company are a fun group</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teen romantic comedy set in the world of indy rock wannabes, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist gives Michael Cera a slightly less pathetic role than usual and wonderfully recreates the free flowing, borderless anarchy of your late teens. Add in the beautiful Kat Dennings, who's a much better actress than I think she gets credit for and gets to play an actual person here instead of just a girlfriend, and you've got a fun and funny little film. This thing does have an ending that's one of the most pointlessly extended dénouements I've ever seen, but by that point spending a little more time with these characters is not something you complain about.Nick (Michael Cera) is a high school kid still mooning over his ex (Alexis Dziena) when the other members of his struggling band drag him out of his depression and to a gig in New York City. There he runs into Norah (Kat Dennings), a Jewish Catholic school girl who's out for a night on the town with her BFF, the adoringly inebriated Caroline (Ari Graynor). Nick's ex is there too with her new guy, and she also happens to be a schoolmate and frenemy of Norah's. To defy taunts about her datelessness, Nora lassos Nick into pretending to be her boyfriend and helping her get the drunken Caroline home. Nick's bandmates then push Nick and Norah together by agreeing to take care of Caroline. Things don't go so smoothly for anyone after that, but Nick and Norah are stuck together all night looking for Caroline when she goes missing. I don't think anyone could possibly be surprised at how things work out but most everyone will enjoy the ride.This may be one of the best roles in which I've seen Cera. Nick is similar to his type but has much more of a spine and his pitifulness appears to be more the product of his heartbreak and depression, rather than just being a loser. There's a basic strength and togetherness to Nick that's visible early on and it's refreshingly realistic. This is a guy and not a high school archetype. Likewise, while there's a bit of the "poor little rich girl" to Norah, the film shies away from that and instead focuses on the paradox that Norah can be so forceful when it comes to protecting her friend and so weak about protecting herself. There are moments of this screenplay that perfectly capture that awkward and even combative aspect of extended adolescence where you're desperately trying to connect with someone else while just as desperately trying to define yourself, though they'd just be words on a page without Cera and Dennings so nicely bringing them to life.Now there is a lot of aggressively prominent music throughout this movie, which is normally something that drives me up the wall. Pop or alt-rock songs swelling up on the soundtrack for repeated segues or montages is one of the worst habits of this era of cinema. It's become beyond cliché and too often features just terrible songs that no one besides hipsters ever like. Here, though, the music is good and its constant presence fits the milieu these young people nestle and swim in. It's an effective atmosphere rather than an intrusive bit of product placement.Besides Cera and Dennings, their fellow castmates are quite entertaining on their own and are given just enough to do so that they're more than props surrounding the two stars without ever competing with them for the viewer's attention. Ari Graynor, in particular, has a role that could have gone very wrong, very easily. Yet, there's enough restraint to the part and enough ease to Graynor's performance that it adds a great deal to the whole.The ending of Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is not good. Essentially, it comes to an appropriate climax (so to speak) and then remembers a heavily stressed plot point is unresolved. So the movie has to keep to going for that and they decide, to kill time, to have Nick and Norah repeat the emotional challenges they triumphed over just 10 minutes before. It's as awkward as any teenage moment in the rest of the film.I liked this motion picture enough to recommend it to anyone wanting a teen romantic comedy that's lighter on crudity and heavier on intelligent characterization. Give it a try.</fullReview>

Michael Cera (Nick) and Kat Denning (Nora) do superb jobs of playing two people, soul mates, unknown to each other except vaguely through a friend that dumped him.He's strung out over her and yet gradually realizes how much more he has in common with Nora. This plays out over one evening in new York.It's really something like a NY version of Before Sunrise.The film is highlighted by some great rock sounds throughout and when it was over I felt great.The only unexplained aspect was what an openly Jewish girl (Nora) was doing attending a New Jersey Catholic girls school.</fullReview>

It's a romantic-comedy with no big laughs, no real twist, a few nice one liners (mostly from Kat Dennings, who is the best person in the film). What the film makes by being a solid and easy watching film, is lost by a lack of real ambition. The film takes no real twists and doesn't really go anywhere. It's basically a stream of conscienceness from the eyes of the film makers. It's what I like to call 'Good Movie Waffle'. Michael Cera is charming and witty as he always is and Kat Dennings is beautiful, funny and incredibly easy to develop a crush on. The music is very good and probably the best thing about the film. It's well worth watching, once. Viewing suggestion: Watch this film when ill, in bed and half brain-dead, where watching something even slightly complicated would strain oneself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harmless stuff - but lacks any conflict or drama to retain any interest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally when making a film I would assume that a prospective filmmaker must want to do one of 5 things: 1/ Make something that resonates with an audience.2/ Make a statement, and artistic one if you must.3/ Showcase either an idea or some talent to "boost your stock" and raise awareness.4/ Make some $$$$$.5/ Practise and learn the ropes.Ideally whichever aim someone has in mind ends with objective 3 or 4, ideally both being achieved, as without impressing or making someone money a long career in the game is unlikely.This is where Nick and Norah is perplexing, they don't really say anything new, it is basically a gen Y romantic comedy, I don't think it blew the box office away and the two leads, while likable are already pretty well known and I would think already categorised as "not able to carry a film solo".Maybe Nick and Norah might resonate with the Gen Y crowd and become one of those "you had to be aged between 18 and 23 to "get it" things, something that you unrealistically elevate to a status it doesn't warrant out of sheer nostalgic value. And that's nice but who does that help? So I dub Nick &amp; Norah as a training effort, a high(er) budget student film. Therefore I set my expectations low and hope only to be mildly entertained or at least distracted for a while. (But TV already does that!) ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() Michael Cera is Nick. He is 20 something, recently dumped and is pining for his ex, who we later meet and discover is a (hot) idiot devoid of personality and intelligence. Ordinarily I would highlight the bracketed part and stress we should never underestimate the relevance of the fact, but apparently Nick is sensitive, nice and considerate.Soooo? This does not add up. (TDNAU) Kat Dennings is Norah, a teetotalling, down to Earth loyal friend who happens to have absolutely moronic friends, one a p*ss-head skank who spends the entire film drunk and mostly lost, the other the aforementioned hot ex-girlfriend of Nick, a self-obsessed bitch only concerned with what is cool and image friendly.TDNAU.Nick is in a band, the other two bandmates are both gay, therefore they are nice, genuine and friendly, because anything portraying gay people as otherwise is gay bashing. His band is playing in the city one night.Norah likes music and going to see bands. She goes to see the band Nick plays in.Do I even need to give you another 300 words or so? After the gig Nick and Norah share a "moment" and the gay cavalry decide to match make, taking drunk-girl off their hands and sending them off to look for a mystery band named Fluffy which is playing somewhere that very night, and tickets are much sought after. Apparently Fluffy are awesome.Nick is still fixated with idiot-ex-girl despite the fact she is obviously and openly a bitch to him and everyone else.TDNAU Idiot-ex decides that she is jealous of Norah and gets back on Nick's case, using all of her "assets" to lure him back. Norah it also turns out, has an idiot-ex who basically uses her connections for his own benefit, he decides he needs Norah that particular evening for his own devices.TDNAU. Not the fact that they exist but that a nice guy would yearn for an unrealistic airhead when he had a perfectly nice pretty girl all night in the passenger seat. And not when it is obvious that user-idiot-ex can't say two sentences to nice, down to Earth Norah without either taking her for granted or straight up asking for something for himself.So we have two people who are obviously way better suited to each other than the other boneheads on the scene, no-one does or says anything overly offensive to change that situation and we are left with 90 minutes of two people getting along with plenty of endearing awkwardness for all.Usually the allure of a rom-com is the perceived differences between the two people on the DVD cover, "Oh he's a big business playboy and she's a nice family gal", "he's a rich tycoon and she's just the maid, how could they ever find happiness?".In this case we have a guy and a girl both in the early 20s, both are nice and friendly and love music. Where is the mystery? We know they are going to get together unless "something dramatic" happens and they fall apart (at least until the last 20 minutes), that doesn't happen here.What is more unlikely is that they weren't together in the first place, or even that they didn't see each other across a crowded room and in unison think "Gee that guy/girl is way better than this vacuous bint that I've been hanging around with for months".I didn't laugh once, the byplay between the two was rarely less than cordial and the drama and second guessing of the appropriateness of them coming together was non-existent.The whole pairing was as unlikely as a famous rich athlete and a Playboy model or a Kardashian.Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. I dunno, this is nice and harmless, but without any conflict or reason for momentary doubt does a story like this even need to be told?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighthearted fun movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨The world is broken into pieces and everyone has to find them and put them back together. ¨Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist isn't just another teen rom-com with stupid humor, clichés, and one dimensional characters; it is very original with an interesting chemistry between the two leads (Michael Cera and Kat Dennings), a very good soundtrack, and a beautiful backdrop of New York City's night life. It is a very different kind of movie that doesn't have a clever script like Juno did, but it is still pretty well written by Lorene Scafaria, and has its up and downs moments. The movie only lasts about 90 minutes, which is a probably a good thing because it began to drag near the end. Peter Sollett directed this film and does a pretty decent job mixing romance and comedy with music to create a unique movie which some teens can identify with.The movie takes place in New York where Nick (Michael Cera) is having a hard time getting over Tris (Alexis Dziena) after a six month relationship. He keeps on calling her and making her mixed cd's begging her to come back with him, but she just isn't interested. Norah (Kat Dennings) and Caroline (Ari Graynor) study at the same Catholic school with Tris but Norah can't really stand her. Tris doesn't even listen to the cd's she is given, but Norah secretly listens to them and loves every single playlist without ever knowing who Nick is. Nick plays for a band with his two best gay friends, Dev and Thom, and that night they have a gig together at a bar where they run into Tris, Norah, and Caroline. The entire movie takes place on that single night where the kids will end up driving all over the streets of New York in search of an underground band named Where's Fluffy, and at the same time in search of Caroline who they lose along the way. Nick and Norah develop an interesting relationship, but the question is whether they can get over their past love lives. Michael Cera surprises me every single time I see him on film because he seems to play the same role in every single one of his movies, but he still manages to get my attention and sympathy. He's an interesting actor who fits this type of role, but I don't think he could do anything different and only time will tell how long he can get away with it. For now I have to say that he has played some very funny roles and I still haven't had enough of him. Kat Dennings is also a very interesting actress who seems to have great charisma on screen. She does a great job in this film and her chemistry with Cera works really well. She will play Darcy in the upcoming Thor movie. Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist works really well as a rom-com and I really had a good time with this funny, different, and short movie. It probably won't be a very memorable film, but it is still a fun experience well worth your time.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not another teen movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find watching this movie is a highly enjoyable experience. First of all, I find the acting very good and quite realistic. Especially Norah, she is very adorable, I think I'm in love. Second, love the atmosphere of the movie. Makes me want to go to New York and living it. This is another side of New York, never thought it could look as romantic as in this movie. Though sometimes I think some of the plots could be improved. Such as when they have to search around the city of New York to find Norah's best friend, it is very hard to imagine bearing in mind what a gigantic city NY is. All in all, as the subject says, this movie is distinct from another teen movie, and a must see for those who are in favor of romance and happy ending. Cheers</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A teen romance for the NYC indie rock crowd.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick &amp; Norah is a nice little date movie for indie kids. At times I think that it tried to hard for the "cool" vibe, but at Nick and Norah's age, didn't we all do the same?Being from a small town and living in a small-ish college city, it's cool to see the nightlife and culture of NYC. It would be pretty awesome to be able to spend a night going from show to show with a sea of faceless people with similar musical tastes. I think I enjoyed that aspect of the movie more than the rather typical love story that was the the primary focus.Michael and Kat were pretty perfect for their parts, but it was Ari Graynor who completely stole the show. Her character was absolutely hilarious. That girl seriously needs to be a bigger star, because she's got great comedic talent. Nick and Norah won't blow you away, but it's guaranteed to appeal to a certain kind of viewer. It's charming, funny, and a breath of fresh air in an overcrowded genre.I recommend it whole-heartedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wanna be American Graffiti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An OKish movie that tries really hard to be an indie version of American Graffiti but ends up more of a collection of far-fetched, unrelated, uninteresting scenes.Start with the plot, or lack thereof. Bored rich kids go looking for some fun in the city and chase after a band called Where's Fluffy. That's pretty open ended and that's OK as long as the characters or situations are interesting. N&amp;N gives us fairly run of the mill characters. Michael Cera is Nick which is to say Nick is Michael Cera, i.e. the same nervous self effacing character he plays in every movie. Opposite Nick is Nora, who is a character with no character traits whatsoever. To be fair, the writers don't give them much to work with. There are no universal truths discovered here and the romance comes across as forced. It has to be since we're only talking one night. I guess because N&amp;N both like the same music that's supposed to be enough for us to buy into them making a love connection.The supporting characters aren't handled much better. Nora spends too much of the movie looking for and worrying about her drunk friend. Eventually the movie runs out of uses for the friend and she passes out. Oh no, what to do! How convenient that Team Uber Gay comes to the Rescue to whisk her away safely. Nick's old girlfriend is really nasty which means she's due for some comeuppance but when it finally comes, it's nothing more interesting than leaving her on the side of the road.Because so little happens you unfortunately find yourself being overly critical of what does happen. Like, since when did clubs get so lax about letting underage kids in? Where's all the alcohol coming from? Why would a rich owner give the keys to his recording studio to his minor child? And where are all these kids' parents anyway? Do they really allow them to roam the city all night unsupervised? The good in the movie for me is Michael Cera. He's reminds me of what a teenage Woody Allen would have been like. Yes, it's the same character he plays in every movie but he plays it so well. He's like an old comfortable sweater. Alexis Dziena was OK too. At least she had a defined character to work with. Kat Dennings: I'm not getting it. I find her voice annoying and her acting wooden. Her range of expressions are all variations on looking pouty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody do the iPod shuffle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" is a routine romantic comedy in which an awkward guy (Michael Cera) falls in love with a sultry girl (Kat Dennings). They don't get along, they realise they have similar musical tastes, they fall in love, they have sex, the film ends. This formula - a giant male fantasy - is so pervasive, it's found in virtually every "romantic movie", be it teen comedy or critically praised art-house fare.At least "Playlist" has gorgeous ambiance, the film taking place exclusively at night, city lights, fluorescent bulbs and the low level hum of midnight traffic creating the kind of atmospheric backdrop Kar Wai Wong wishes he were able to cook up in "My Blueberry Nights".Comparison's to Kar Wai Wong's film are apt for another reason: both "Playlist" and "Blueberry" end with love scenes being "captured" by technology in a world in which technology itself "captures" art. In "Playlist" we have the act of intercourse being unknowingly captured by a sound recording studio, love/sex being recorded as and likened to music. In "My Blueberry Nights", however, we have kiss/love "captured" by an overhead security camera, romance being recorded by and likened to cinema. Both films are thus about, not only a love of art, in which music and cinema become our soul mates, but love itself as "art". Love is always a kind of artistic performance, a desire first formed in the imagination, and always imported into the body from outside (often via the fantasies of song or screen).Unfortunately, other than the gorgeous mood director Peter Sollett instills (his earlier film, "Raising Victor Vargas", was similarly beautifully shot), "Playlist" is too clichéd to work. Perhaps the film would have played better had it satirized the kind of white-middle-class hipsters it tries to endear itself to. This is a film populated by kids who go out of their way to latch onto "non-mainstream" fashion, alternative music and fringe clubs, all in a desperate attempt to be "individual, man". Observe how one character frets over being the first person to discover a particular band, how another wants a guy solely because she can't have him and another identifies with a boy simply because they have the same tunes on their iPod. Similarly, a trio of gays wear their homosexuality as a badge of non-conformity, whilst an entire city itself seems to be searching for the club in which a rare band is playing, not because they're any good, but simply because nobody knows where they are playing. This is romance reduced to fetishized designer labels, scarcity as commodity, uniqueness as social currency, every choice made based upon notions of being "alternative".7.9/10 ? Like "Adventureland", another recent sex comedy, superb ambiance is undermined by an unimaginative narrative. Worth one viewing. See "Charlie Bartlett", "Pump up the Volume", "The Spectacular Now" and "Ghost World".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indie Teen Comedy with a Great Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember back about a year ago I stumbled upon a film called Juno, one of the stars of which was Michael Cera. Now, one of the many things I really liked that film was the understated performance of said Mr Cera. And so we come to 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist', a really bad title IMHO. It's not a bad film, there's a lot to admire, it just fell slightly short of the mark for me. But more of that later, let me tell you a little of the rather complicated plot?Nick is depressed, he's been dating Tris for a while and she's dumped him. He spends his time making mix CDs for her and generally feeling sorry for himself. Oh, and he's a huge fan of a band called 'Where's Fluffy'. Anyway, he is in a band himself, and the other band members, Thom and Dev, who are gay by the way, decide to take him out into New York, where they have a gig. Meanwhile, Norah and her best friend, Caroline, are also planning a night out in the Big Apple. They know Tris from school and Norah has been listening to, and liking, Nick's CDs that Tris has thrown away. Nick's band is playing in a club when Tris walks in with her new boyfriend. Of course Nick is distracted by this. Caroline has got drunk and Norah is left alone. When Tris comes up to her and asks her who she's with, she says she's with her boyfriend and proceeds to go and kiss Nick, who she's never met before. (Complicated enough so far?) Deciding to help Norah take Caroline home, Nick helps them to his car but before they can leave, the rest of the band decide Nick and Norah should get together and offer to take Caroline home so the couple can go and find where 'Fluffy' is playing that night (it's a secret). From here there are adventures, love, hate, kidnapping and a whole bunch of stuff you're better off finding out by watching it yourselves (he said, wanting to keep the spoiler count to a minimum).I found it quite an engaging film for the most part, with a really good soundtrack and some good performances. The budget was obviously not the biggest, but I thought they production team did a great job despite this. So, good performances from Michael Cera as Nick, Kat Dennings as Norah, Aaron Yoo as Thom, Rafi Gavron as Dev, Ari Graynor as Caroline and Alexis Dziena as Tris.It's a nice gentle teen comedy with some really great moments in it, but, for me, it kind of lost its way towards the end. When I felt the story should be building to a big finish, it all kind of fell flat. Nothing to do with the performances, I think the writers must have just run out of ideas. For all that, it's a pretty nice watch and I kind of recommend the first three quarters? but you'll watch all of it, I know you will.My score: 6.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The heroine played by Kat Dennings is worth spending time with. She's gorgeous and likable. And Michael Cera's got a nice presence, but considering these are high schoolers running around night clubs, I kept thinking about the Polanski debacle. The buzzkill was in the gratuitous mention of a religion in a movie that didn't need it. The movie is about how high school relationships change overnight in an urban environment devoid of adult supervision and cops. This takes place in a sort of idealized playland where the only real troubles are of the love connection kind. There's a funny recurring bit about an almost all gay band and some more gay scenes later on, but it's mostly the Nick meets Norah saga. Everybody will be familiar with many of the characters some done very well, like the evil heart-breaker, Dev.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just about a chance encounter with Nick and Norah who are music buffs, and they embark on a journey through NY with a literally gay indie band to find a secret show of a legendary band. I didn't have high expectations for this film, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Although just about everyone in this film seems like they are from a alternative universe with obnoxious hipster everywhere and portray gay people as being special and make a big deal out of it. The characters in the film the filmmakers want you to hate, and you end up really loathing them. This film is definitely worth a look, especially if your watching it with your gf or friends. Michael Cera been playing the same character for just about every movie he is in, but his character fit very well in this role and actually funny. What I enjoyed the most of about this film is the atmosphere it just felt magical and the film doesn't try really hard to be great, it is what it is but it's still enjoyable. This is a good teen comedy that is worth a look, it's a fun little love story. Oh and how does Aaron Yoo still look like a high school student? 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was good, yet not great. The characters and script were pretty decent, but it felt incomplete somehow. My biggest complaint would be all the indie music. I personally find the whole "indie" music scene to be a bunch of kids who look down on anyone who listens to any album that's gone gold, or anything that plays on mainstream radio stations.I didn't know any of the music they were talking about, for the most part. I assume most of the bands they saw were made up/fictionalized for plot's sake, but it would have been better (for me) if what connected the main characters was something I could relate to.But I've come to accept that I'm one of very few people with a dislike for the indie scene, so this movie is probably something most others would enjoy, especially those into the music scene that annoys me.The one spoiler I have, and the most disgusting scene, is the one where the girl's friend fishes gum out of a toilet.

		<shortDescription>An "After Hours" Revamp as a Smart, Affecting Teen Comedy with an Indie Rock Beat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was all prepared to trivialize this movie for what I expected to be another hipster teen comedy taking advantage of the success of "Juno" and "Superbad", especially given that Michael Cera is the co-star of all three films. However, this 2008 movie is really a quirky, sharply played variation on Martin Scorsese's 1985 "After Hours", this time focusing on two misfit teens, kindred spirits when it comes to their taste in music, who find themselves traipsing through New York's indie rock scene for one hilariously sleepless night. Their chemistry is predestined by their names, a tribute to the scintillating married couple played by William Powell and Myrna Loy in "The Thin Man" series of golden-era Hollywood classics. Their nocturnal misadventures are driven by Nora's search for her hard-partying best friend Caroline, who escaped in a fit of paranoia out of a van, while gay-band bassist Nick is nursing a broken heart over Tris, the shallow, man-baiting ex-girlfriend who continues to play him.If the movie simply limited itself to the odyssey, it would have been satisfying enough for its intended audience, but what director Peter Sollett and screenwriter Lorene Scarfaria have done to transcend the genre is make the lead characters' mutual passion for music the focal emotional point of their growing attraction for one another. Nick keeps sending Tris idiosyncratic mix CDs (like "Road to Closure, Vol. 12"), which she tosses into the trash only to provide Nora an opportunity to retrieve them and listen to reflections of his broken heart. Neither is able to articulate their feelings otherwise, as shown by their comically bumbling conversations, so the music plays a vital part of their burgeoning relationship. I still don't find Cera terribly versatile, but he has been resourceful in using his now-familiar screen persona of a dweebish sad-sack in suitably well-turned material.Familiar as Catherine Keener's edgy but ultimately caring daughter in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin", Kat Dennings comes into her own as Norah, capturing the insecurity of a character who leaves herself wide open to the pain inflicted by those around her. There are scene-stealing turns by Ari Graynor as the constantly drunken Caroline, Alexis Dziena as self-appointed goddess Tris, and Rafi Gavron and Aaron Yoo as Nick's club-friendly gay bandmates. There are a couple of "Saturday Night Live" cast cameos thrown in - "newscaster" Seth Meyers as the horned-up passenger mistaking Nick's yellow Yugo as a cab (with Scarfaria as his girlfriend) and Andy Samberg as a bum lurking on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral. The alt-rock music is appropriately underground to fit the story. There really isn't that much more to the movie since the fate of these characters is clear from the outset.It's simply that the film has good energy fueled by the constant barrage of music and smart dialogue to fill the love story that emerges from their long night's journey into morning. There are a surprising number of extras with the 2009 DVD starting with two separate commentaries, the first with Sollett, Cera, Dennings and Graynor discussing the production details, and the second with Sollett and the source novel's writers, Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, in which they discuss more of the story and screen adaptation. There are deleted scenes and outtakes, some quite funny but understandably excised, and an amusingly off-kilter Nick &amp; Norah puppet show by Dennings. Rounding out the extras are storyboards, photo galleries, Graynor's video diary, a music video, and a funny faux-interview with Cera and Dennings.</fullReview>

The performances by these young stars are surprisingly good since I can vividly feel their emotions and conflicts. I would have to give up thumbs up for the script since as a teenager, I can clearly imagine myself saying some of those stuff and the plot is engaging as well.

Norah knows Tris and in order to not seem like a loser picks a guy at random and kisses him saying it's her boyfriend. Well, she picks Nick whom still seems stuck on Tris. Norah loves the CD mixes that Nick has made for Tris, so he gives her a ride. But, Norah's friend, drunk Caroline, goes missing, so they are tracking her down throughout much of the film. Tris starts wanting Nick back because she is jealous. And also, Norah must contend with her ex. All the while the two are also trying to find out the mystery place their favorite band, Where's Fluffy, is playing.Two problems I had with the movie were first Caroline because the actress looks like she's 30 to me and she is supposed to be a high school senior. Second, they make Norah out to look cheap at the end because she's a teen and just met a guy and lets him do "some things." I don't think that needed to be in a teen film.FINAL VERDICT: It was OK. I liked the lead actors and they made it more interesting since there really wasn't a whole lot to the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie Not Much Worth Caring About</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" doesn't add up to much of a movie. It's a moderately diverting tween romance about two soul mates who venture out into the New York night and figure out they're meant for one another only after a series of incidents keep them from reaching that conclusion sooner. The incidents aren't of much note; I appreciated that the film resisted the urge to descend into the outrageous scenarios films like this are prone to, but at the same time I wouldn't have minded if something, ANYTHING, had happened to our two protagonists.Michael Cera plays Nick the way he plays every character in every film. There's something obviously appealing about Cera (after all, he keeps getting cast in roles like this), but he's only ever as good as the movie he's in, and this movie doesn't give him much to do besides look dopey and cute the way that a bedraggled puppy would look cute. Kat Dennings plays Norah, and there's something vaguely unlikable about the way she does it. She tries to give Norah an air of awkward and aloof bravado, obviously hiding the usual batch of teen insecurities, but doesn't pull it off in a way that makes her winning. If you're going to name your characters Nick and Norah in an homage to William Powell and Myrna Loy of "The Thin Man" series, you damn well better make sure they have chemistry. It's not that Cera and Dennings don't have any, they just don't have enough to make them or the movie worth caring about.Mostly, the film just made me feel old. Is "straight edge" what kids are saying these days to describe good kids? And can a bunch of high schoolers really drive around New York City getting into any and every club they want to?

		<shortDescription>Infinite awfulness, minimal charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a touching scene early in this film where Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) have just met and kissed for the first time. They sit in Nicks car and exchange glances that tell us love has just blossomed. This happens 15 minutes into the film and I felt that it should have just ended right there.I'm not saying this is a terrible movie, but it's a waste of time. You go into any romantic comedy expecting the leading man and woman to fall in love by the end, but in this film they fall in love very early, yet they don't ride off into the sunset right away. That's because the plot keeps putting them together, then breaking them up, and then putting them back together again until the credits finally roll.Nick is grieving over being cheated on and dumped by his ex girl friend Tris, who for unclear reasons is friends with Norah, who she constantly insults only to boost her own insecurity. Norah gets even by making out with Nick, unaware that he's Tris's ex boy friend. This kick stars the romantic plot which is on auto pilot from the start.While running around New York City Norah runs into her ex boy friend Tal, who dated her because her father is a powerful music producer. Why anyone would like Tal is a mystery. He's the clichéd jerk character who only exists to be hated.Will Nick and Norah fall in love, or will they retreat back to their cruel and unlikable exes? When you know how its going to end there isn't much reason to care.The script struggles to develop a strong sub plot go along with the mediocre romance. One attempt at one is the search for Norah's friend Caroline, who gets sloppy drunk and stumbles all around New York city without getting mugged or sexually assaulted. How she manages to do that could be it's own movie.The other sub plot is the search for a secret concert for a band called "Where's Fluffy". A secret concert is probably the worst idea in the history of music. The only way to reach the location of the concert is to find instructions scribbled on a bathroom stall. If a miraculous Beatles reunion was being held at a secret location I doubt anyone would make it.The gorgeous actress Kat Dennings and Micheal Cera build minimal chemistry, but it's tiring to see these two easily playing to the usual types they always play: Cera is the sensitive, likable guy, and Dennings is the slightly bitchy sarcastic smart girl. It works for them now but they should learn that nothing great has ever been achieved by playing it safe. I also hated how their characters bond over their connection to music, which they talk about in nearly every scene, but you never get to hear it. It's like porn without seeing sex.Maybe this experience is funny you may be asking? Well the big recurring joke involves piece of gum that travels from mouth to mouth, gets covered in mucus, falls down into a vomit filled toilet, and finds its way back into various peoples mouths. Hilarious right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet Story in New York</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dumped and broken hearted, Nick (Michael Cera) still holds a torch for his ex, until one eventful evening he meets Norah (Kat Dennings) and thus ensues a sleepless night of finding friends, music and love changing their lives. Think 'American Graffiti' think 'High Fidelity' put these in a film with a MySpace generation dialogue then you get 'Nick and Norah'.From the opening credits it will be relatively easy to see where this film is heading from the slow guitar music to Cera, painting his career in to a corner effortlessly playing the ever jittery, romantic man-child we've seen in 'Arrested Development' and 'Juno'. The film almost seems reliant on its soundtrack, which although sits well with the film, there is nothing quite as defining as 'High Fidelity' largely due to the drama unfolding in front of us not being able to lift it and a lack of the same sharp wit and dialogue.The above is not to say the film is bad as Cera is charming and works on screen as Nick opposite the unconventionally beautiful Dennings in a nice dynamic chemistry. It is also one of the few rom-com's that gets it right, managing to tell a sweet, well paced story over one night against the backdrop of Manhattan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cute, naturally flavored teen comedy is somewhat of a relief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every so often it's nice to take in a breath of fresh air from today's over-sexed teen comedies. "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" doesn't exactly absolve itself here, but it bravely doesn't lean on sex like a comedic crutch either. It's a sweet and sometimes even naive teen romance -- not terribly clichéd, but not terribly funny either. "Nick and Norah" remains steadfast in the belief that movies more closely resembling reality are inherently better and it makes an okay case for it.The movie takes place all in one night as music-loving rich teenagers from suburban New Jersey head into Manhattan because some apparently amazing band that never reveals the whereabouts of their concerts is said to be performing sometime that night. Nick (Michael Cera) is the recently dumped member of a band composed of himself and three gay friends who play a gig early that night, when he meets Norah (Kat Dennings "40-Year-Old Virgin") the be yourself type girl that tells it like it is and loves music for music's sake. Both pretend to be dating for split second to upset Tris (Alexis Dziena), Nick's manipulative ex and Norah's pushy friend. From the get-go we know Nick and Norah will end up together for real; the only question is how long will they have to fend off annoying supporting cast members before it happens?Cera and Dennings are good. Much to my surprise, Cera's restrained/quiet humor style that made him the ultimate lovable loser character in "Superbad" and "Juno" holds off from getting stale at least one more film, perhaps because "Nick and Norah" relies more on natural teenage awkwardness for laughs than the contrived dialogue kind. Dennings is the film's real talent. We're more in touch with what her character is feeling and going through than any other. Unfortunately, as unfair as it both sounds and is, her rebellious goth look will probably always limit her career.The only other likable supporting roles in the film are Cera's gay van-cruising buddies. Major kudos to the acting and direction here -- never before has a movie handled gay characters so normally, as sad as that sounds. The gay characters are sweet and not horrifically over- stereotyped like nearly every comedy. In other words, they come off as characters who happen to be gay, not "let's put gay characters into this story." They're the most sincere and likable roles in the film. The cameos in the movie are also first rate, from John Cho to Andy Samberg.Other roles such as Norah's drunk stereotype friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) who throws up a lot and has the movie's worst recurring gag with her Violet Beauregarde chewing gum habit, are petty annoyances to the natural chemistry of Cera and Dennings. The ex-girlfriend is another one of those parts, but at least we're supposed to hate her."Nick and Norah" is one of those movies that will never amount to anything more than "cute." It's a love story that successfully gets us to want its main characters to be together, charming us long enough to overlook its overall okay-ness and generally praise it for not laying on the raunch like most of its kin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sweet little romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick is heart broken since his girlfriend has dumped him. he Still continues to make he mix CD's which she dumps in the garbage. Norah rescues the CDs and is amazed that his tastes mirror her own so well. Over the course of the evening, as everyone tries to find the secret location of a performance by a favorite band Nick and Norah come together.Nice little romantic comedy set in and round the New York music scene. I thought it was utterly charming in its way. Another film that is not the be all and end all of romantic comedies, but its still worth a look. It also gets extra points for a great ending which sums up my attitude...7 out of 10. Its sweet and not too deep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic American Pie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't a bad movie, but it felt like an artificial construct. The indie rock backdrop with no real music behind it, the cardboard characters including the dorky but good looking nice guy, the bitchy ex, the gay best friends and the pristine new girl, the New Yorkish set. I mean, wth? You can have real romance without resorting to some reinvention of the high-school drama.Overall it was OK to watch, not good, not bad. I would have loved to see an original and smart romantic movie be it even a comedy, but this was not it. I rate it completely and utterly average. The bitchy ex was hot, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable diversion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are any number of reasons why "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" will be frequently compared to 2007's indie hit "Juno", chief among them the presence of Michael Cera, the male lead in that film, again opposite a peppy brunette who isn't quite sure what she wants in life (neither is he, for that matter). While not in the same league as "Juno" in terms of character or story (though possessed of a far less annoying soundtrack), it is worthwhile for anyone looking for an entertaining film about teens.The titular Nick is the depressed guitarist for a queercore band (meaning, all the other members are gay), and thoroughly depressed over being dumped by his girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dzienza); at the urging of his bandmates, he goes to their latest gig, largely because he has learned that his favourite band ('Where's Fluffy?') will be playing at an undisclosed location (which seems counterproductive to selling, to me, but what do I know about hipster music?). Norah, meanwhile, is a nominal friend of Tris' who has never met Nick, but knows of him through the CDs he is continually making and sending to Tris ("Road to Closure, volume 12" the most recent example), which she picks up after Tris discards them. A chance encounter leads to them meeting cute and pretending to be together, sparking a multiplicity of sideplots involving a jealous Tris, Norah's drunk friend Caroline (Ari Gaynor, who deserves some kind of prize for playing one of the least appealing drunks in recent memory), and, of course, the question of "Fluffy".This is the sort of production that (like "Before Sunrise") hinges on the main actors' performances and chemistry, and Michael Cera and Kat Dennings succeed wonderfully in that regard. Cera, as most reviewers have noted, is basically playing the same character that he played in "Juno", "Arrest Development", and "Superbad"; it's a popular persona, one that he has honed to smile-inducing precision, and, in his defence, he is nowhere near the first actor to develop a schtick (indeed, most of the greats refined a persona and either played to or against type). Cera might try something different in the near future just to give a better idea of his rang (serial killer!), but I won't hold that against him. Kat Dennings, meanwhile, strikes a very individual note; Norah is extremely well-characterized. Dennings does a good job of showing her uncertainties and conveying her frustrated attitudes towards the still-hung-up Nick. The rest of the cast does a good job in small parts. The crew makes the New York nightlife look tremendously appealing.Recommended as a light entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual but good and entertaining movie set in NYC.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to start with the premise of the movie. High school kids in New Jersey, wanna-be band members themselves, embark on a weekend night hunt for "Fluffy", the name of a band they all adore. Hints are given by the media but finding where Fluffy is performing is some sort of treasure hunt.Enter the characters. Michael Cera is "Jerk-Offs" guitarist Nick, who it seems has been recently rejected by his girlfriend, Alexis Dziena as Tris. She is a manipulator, she won't answer his calls, she cheats on him, but she gets jealous if some other girl shows an interest. Nick has been making music CDs for her, great mixes in hopes of getting her to come back. But Tris just discards them.But one of Tris' school friends is Kat Dennings as Norah, who intercepts the discarded CDs, and enjoys them, even though she has no clue who Nick is.Then, out in NYC by sheer coincidence Norah goes up to Nick and kisses him, because she has told Tris that she has a new date. That sparks all the rest of the events of that long night into the pre-dawn hours.The script is very smart and very funny, and all the actors do a good job and resist the urge to make this just a gross-out movie. Although my wife could not watch the bathroom scene, especially after the drunk girl vomited into the toilet then she reached in to retrieve both her cell phone and her gum! Norah, as it turns out, is the daughter of a famous music producer and owner of a recording studio. Plus Nick and Norah seem perfect for each other, after they got to know each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this isn't the best movie I've seen lately, but it's not the worst. It's got a cute love story to it, and some funny parts. All in all, this movie is a cute, funny, light-hearted love story. And if you're into indie music, you'll probably like this movie. The movie isn't really about anything, other than two young kids falling in love with each other, while trying to find Fluffy...a band that everyone in the movie is obsessed with. Michael Cera is so cute in this movie! Love love love him! I'm not sure this is one of his best, but it's not the worst either. He always make me laugh. If you're a fan of his, you'll probably enjoy Nick and Nora.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun, heartfelt and memorable contemporary romance with plenty of charm.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indie music and indie cinema; ostensibly, both make the perfect couple, like the jock and the prom queen- as ironic as that analogy may appear to be- both share common principles; basic instrumental accompaniment to heart-felt reflections on life in quirky yet considerably human ways; low-fi characters with small ideas but strangely larger than life philosophies on life's most simplistic qualms; and of course, a certain degree of pretension. Like it or not, both have common pros and cons that define what they are and who they indeed do or do not attract.While Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist cannot rightly be called an indie picture because of its production values, at its core lays a very simple, true-to-heart depiction of love within the big apple; youthful, neurotic, impulsive and warm to the touch. In this regard, director Peter Sollett crafts a picture that strikes on the same homebrew chords that your average independent record or movie usually hits, and does so with enough conviction to make an enjoyable ninety minutes out of it. Granted the movie's insistence upon the more youthful, contemporary teenage romance will no doubt shun away those disconnected to such "crowds", but like the music itself, Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist serves to satisfy those who are drawn to the twangs and echoes of a troubled heart in search for company and does so aware and confident in that assertion.In many ways, Sollett's feature here can be directly compared to last year's similarly themed modern romantic comedy In Search of a Midnight Kiss. Set over the course of one eventful night in New York City, Nick &amp; Norah is a tale of two people losing themselves in a midst of love, lust and romantic confusion. Of course, the movie doesn't set out to detail Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) doing this together for the entirety of the movie; as most romantic comedies go, both characters must first realise that what they had before was nothing compared to what they have found in each other. Rather predictably, the ending will be no surprise to anyone, but for what it's worth, the story is compelling enough, funny enough and touching enough to sustain the attention for the short but sweet ninety minute runtime.It's this simplicity and small scope that gives Nick &amp; Norah its real zest, portraying a night out in search for a mystery concert by each of the character's mutual favourite band -whilst also hunting down their drunken companions- in a concise and fleeting manner that reflects the movie's central themes. Like Midnight Kiss, Sollett manages to create a romantic, whimsy air about one seemingly insignificant day, so that by the time the credits role there is catharsis that resonates through its simple design. It's a tale that always feels natural and down to earth without succumbing to the much more mundane aspects of every day coming and goings; that is, of course, because this night is a special night for both Nick and Norah, as they both find what they have really been searching for all along.As far as this on-screen romance goes between Cera and Dennings, the result is compelling, but not entirely believable. Cera, who played alongside Ellen Page in last year's quirky teenage rom-com Juno, doesn't quite recapture the same emotional commitment that he had for Juno. Dennings too always feels natural and sure enough fits her character extremely well, but when put together with Cera, the result is mostly always lukewarm at best. In the end, the romantic aspect of Nick &amp; Norah ends up being better in concept than in what eventually results on-screen, but that's not to say that such tinges of roses and happily-ever-afters are without their potency. The conclusion, which, as mentioned above, will surprise nobody, at least carries with it a firm sense of pathos that draws once again upon the movie's theme of wistful love born out of unsuspecting moments we normally wouldn't look twice upon.Cinema, much like its musical counterpart, has its own little niches, flavours, genres, scenes and crowds, all of which are dictated by taste. Nick &amp; Norah is a feature that not only adopts this truth through its essence and themes, but also through the characters that make up its story. Each, you could argue, has their own "songs", some of which carry on through others, and thus bonds and divisions are made from nowhere. It goes without saying then that while Nick &amp; Norah certainly plays a well constructed song sure to attract those drawn to those particular sounds detailed above; those less inclined will be hard pressed to be converted. Yet with an airy, somewhat hypnotic and compelling story that has some great moments of laughter and romance, Nick &amp; Norah provides a teenage rom-com that will no doubt please its niche crowd willingly and without compromise; a fun, heartfelt and memorable contemporary romance with plenty of charm.- A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An endearing audiovisual trip.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick and Norah are obviously kindred spirits but as it goes in a movie universe, anyone could see that but themselves. We follow them on a past midnight adventure through the streets of the Big Apple as they try to find their favorite band's hidden concert venue. Along the way they both run into their ex's, Nick's uses him to boost her self esteem when she feels insecure, Norah's uses her to get his demo released by her big-shot daddy music producer. Playing full blown secondary characters: the backdrop of nightly New York skylines and her twinkly lights and a soft-indie soundtrack weaving the scenes together. The best scenes involve a sound mixing board lighting up from loudening moans, an empty (but cozy) recording studio and the tasteful absence of the camera eye.There is one scene her which I felt detracted a little bit from the enchanting, charming experience that was watching NANIP, namely Caroline's regurgitation and subsequent digging for her gum in the toilet. I felt very strongly that should have been cut, as it is not funny nor of any interest to anyone. Luckily the rest of the film turned out to be tasteful. Speaking of tasteful things, Kat Dennings's Norah really is one of the more complex and authentic characters you'll find in rom-coms. The talented young actress did very well in highlighting both Norah's insecurity as her headstrong and passionate side. Two characteristics most performers would make indistinguishable on the screen, while they are fundamentally different feelings though they are often similar in symptoms, if you will. That requires subtlety. Another subtly different performance is Michael Cera as Nick. He is second to none at playing the awkward, endearingly naive teenager. Still, Nick shows a more brooding, artistic, deep side. I really admire the restraint Cera brings to his roles, and in NANIP he surely brings more to rave about to the table than ever before. In an era where most of the major movie critics disregard audiovisual qualities and favor reviewing almost solely based on scripts, NANIP comes in danger of being brushed under the mat as unambitious, trivial even. Yet what is so trivial about a slice of life musical experience? Isn't capturing the teenage condition what coming-of-age movies should really aim at? Now that the movie year has come to a close, NANIP sticks out as one of the most original romantic movies of 2008 and I hope to see more similar movies in the years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (2008): Dir: Peter Sollett / Cast: Michael Cera, Kat Dennings, Alexis Dziena, Ari Graynor, Aaron Yoo: Teen comedy about relationships that play out within one long evening. Michael Cera and his band scope the town in search of a band named Fluffy. He is dealing with a recent breakup. Kat Dennings plays Norah whose best friend gets drunk and goes missing. She and Nick hook up in search of her. Simple plot is basically a series of adventures of high school seniors in the late hours that includes no adult supervision. Directed by Peter Sollett who previously made the independent film Raising Victor Vargas. Here he is given great locations along with a screenplay that isn't so great. Cera and Dennings are capable young actors reduced to running from scene to scene with facial expressions that do not convince us that they are having a good career moment. Alexis Driena plays Cera's snotty ex-girlfriend who suddenly shows interest when someone else begins paying attention to him. Ari Graynor plays Nora's misplaced drunk friend who wanders aimlessly about before hanging her head in a toilet. We are even treated to a moment where she fishes her gum out of the toilet and puts it in her mouth. Perhaps it was her reaction to the news that the Academy Awards wouldn't be honoring her for this. Standard teen comedy that will likely be on nobody's playlist. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, this movie surprised me a little bit. After renting it &amp; just finishing up watching it, I found myself thinking that it was a pretty decent movie, especially since there's aren't really any deep, moving conflicts or overly dramatic issues. The idea of two people riding around New York City to track down a band doesn't seem like the ideal background for a movie but somehow the performances of the cast made it work. The on screen chemistry between Michael Cera &amp; Kat Dennings is spot &amp; I found myself slowly rooting for them the farther on the movie went. I was really surprised with the acting of Kat Dennings &amp; I think her acting made the movie as good as it was. In her role as Norah, she's intelligent, witty, down to earth, and very easy to talk to all at the same time as being easy on the eyes although you have to warm up to her character a little bit during the first few minutes of the movie. Although the plot starts out a little like a college frat party, it really takes off with the interactions between Nick &amp; Norah. The situations that all the characters put themselves in are not only amusing but the plot is also interesting enough to keep you watching. Keep an eye out for this one because you won't be disappointed after you watch it. My opinion, it's just a good fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a high school sophomore who was looking to go to see this movie in theaters. It looked cool and interesting. I couldn't have been more wrong. The plot might sound unique at first, but it is not at all. It is just another stupid movie about teens getting drunk and falling in love. I have ADHD, so I have trouble watching movies that are too long. But whether or not this was long, it was seriously painful to sit in the theater. It was so boring, that after about 45 minutes, it came to the point where I really didn't care about the characters. It is a movie that I vow to never watch again except under extreme circumstances. But one of the reasons why this film annoys me so much is that someone might judge the teen genre based of of this movie and hate it, when there are so many good ones out there like Charlie Bartlett, Super Bad, and Juno. This is one movie that I can't stand and I know that I' not the only person who feels that way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's best and most delightful surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a true vibe of believability in the characters of Nick &amp; Norah that make them jump right off the screen. It's rare to see or even say something like this for a teen film, but not since Ferris Bueller's Day Off have I felt this kind of excitement for a film of this kind. Funny and wholly realistic, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is not only funny, but it has its heart in the right place, and thanks to winning performances from its two leads it also manages to make it an intelligent teen film that has more to it that what the trailer has presented to us.As our story opens, Nick (Michael Cera) is an aspiring straight guitarist in a queercore band called The Jerk Offs who has recently been dumped by his girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena) and is having a hard time getting over it. So hard, in fact, that he continues to make mix CDs for her. CDs that she secretly throws away only to be salvaged by her friend Norah Silverburg (Kat Dennings). Norah is a rich girl living in the shadow of her father, but is also quite lonely and without a boyfriend of her own. However, on this night, at a gig in Manhattan, Nick &amp; Norah will meet, pretend to be together for five minutes to make Tris jealous (She showed up with another guy), and realize that the night has only just begun, as Norah's drunk friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) will get lost, Nick's bandmates will go far to change his unhappiness, and while on the search for a secret show by an ultra-secretive band, Nick &amp; Norah might just discover that their love of the same music won't be the only thing that have in common.Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist has all of the elements of being just a normal teen comedy, but with this being based off a very popular young adult novel, the idea begins to transcend off the page and into our fresh movie psyche. The film has a lot of ideas and almost all of them work (even the one with the gum, which might gross some out. Believe me, my audience felt that hard!) Still, there are a lot of laughs to be had throughout the film. Just the fact that our main guy drives a Yugo is funny by itself. It needs no explanation because of what we see on screen.Even its soundtrack seems to be an infinite playlist onto itself as well. As the film unfolded before me and every song played, I knew that the feeling I had was that I was something truly special unfold in front of my eyes. The songs are so infectious that they could have been the movie itself and it still would've worked. Just look at some of the choices they made (Bishop Allen, We Are Scientists, The Dead 60s, and Vampire Weekend among others) and you can sense that director Peter Sollett took his time in choosing these songs, as each one of them describe this night bigger than just a slight memory, but more as a big adventure. Even the underscore by Mark Motherbaugh feels the same vibe (even though it seems more routed in 1980s mentality with a touch of modern day sensibility), which I really loved as it carried the film through its end.Still, the film earns its four-star rating because of this: The final 10-15 minutes, which are as perfect as I have ever seen for any film in at least a couple of years. The film almost stops the comedy and goes for broke by capturing our hearts in a way that few films can. This infectious finale is not only perfectly executed, but also goes for a unpredictable moment that seems very funny on one hand, but on the other touches us deeply. It is a testament to Cera and Dennings that this finale works as well as it does. I thought it was impossible to really do a perfect finale, but director Peter Sollet and his actors managed to pull off an ending that is as mesmerizing as anything I've seen this year.All of the performances throughout the film are excellent, and Cera and Dennings are perfect casting as Nick &amp; Norah. Not only are their performances winning, but they are truly relatable and they both have great chemistry throughout. Even when they do a scene involving bickering, the romantic tension is there to tell us that anything can happen as the night continues.But in the end, Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist reminded me of all of John Hughes's teen comedies, which always had something more going on underneath the surface. In that sense, this film goes for that same kind of go-for-broke attitude that not only pays off, but it pays off big with some real intelligence, which is the one thing I didn't know if I would see if I watched this film, but I saw it. None of the characters are stupid (some may be caricatures, like Norah's ex-boyfriend Tal, played very well by Tropic Thunder's Jay Baruchal, but that's as far as they go. In fact, Tal kind of reminded me of the oily bohunk the sister was going to marry in Sixteen Candles). Even the character of Caroline is played for broad laughs, but she is never dumb, she's just a misguided caricature.Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist may not change the world, but it stands out as one of the year's biggest and most delightful surprises. I knew I would like this film, but I never expected to walk out feeling like the film was staying with me. Leaving the film, I was floating on air from it, as I didn't want this to end. There isn't a wrong scene, nor does the movie provide anything extra, it just flows continuously like water down a stream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist The story revolves around one night, which is somewhat uncommon in movies. We travel from early night, to early morning with characters Nick and Nora, no last name simply just Nick and Nora. Recently dumped Nick, deals with the heartache of unrequited love. Witty Nora intercedes in Nicks life by bluntly making out with him. Little was it known to either character that Nick was the mystery man making the lot of mixed CD's that fed Nora's musical soul. Rendezvousing with the excitement of New York City night life, two teenagers deal with ex's, scavenger for a drunken miscreant, ache to find the momentous band 'Where's Fluffy?', share a questionable piece of bubblegum, and trek with their new tumultuous relationship.This movie was strictly comedic. No logical thought was needed to view this movie. In the exact opposite, intellect would probably hinder the movie viewers enjoyment of this seeming less silly tale. Mostly filled with dumb jokes, I was pleasantly satisfied not to hear a single fart joke or see a single bare bottom; as most teen comedy movies do searching for the pitiful laughter of the dim adolescent mind. I did think that the queer band mates, as sinfully hilarious as they were, was borderline pathetic. So to anyone searching for a deeper meaning I caution to stay away.Overall, I believed it to be a horrendous knock off of American Graffiti. Although both Nick and Nora were college bound appearing to be in the same ball park as 'AG' it was closer, stylistically, to American Pie. Of course they should not, and in this piece, will not be judged by the same standards considering that one movie was proposed to share the story of a generation, whilst the other was a mechanism of comedic relief.To get more personally into depth about the cast selection, it was mainly typed cast. Michael Cera will always play the dorky cute guy that be by the name of Paulie Bleaker or Nick. Kat Dennings forever stands as the misunderstood hottie of our generation. The rest of the cast would be labeled as 'new Hollywood' seeing as to how none of them stared in anything remotely profound for the general audience to take notice. This will not be a breakout role for any of the stars of the movie. It would see clear that not Michael nor Kat took this movie thinking "I smell an Oscar nomination!" The traveling gum is what really stuck out to me. I kept pondering what that disgusting chewed objects purpose was in the movie. It is preposterous to think that writers would show close ups without it being significant. So I thought of every feasible theme that gum could hold. Representation of both characters in a impossible to eradicate world? Played-out views of love, easily transmitted from person to person? The real location of 'Where's Fluffy?' At the end of an hour and a half's time, I found that no such theme existed. All some form of cosmic joke to those of us who enjoy elegantly crafted innuendo. Like I said before do not come to the theaters wishful of bringing anything out of that movie more than a smile on your face.The greener grass was easily the conversational lines transferred over the night. Personal favorites of mine consisted of "I love you so much, its retarded", "wake up, bitch!", "you don't need to yell. It's not in a train station. It's a tiny little car" and "do you think the worlds ready for fire Jews?" These new lines will be posted up on blog walls and myspace pages soon.Most of the scenes I thought were appropriate. However, was the scene in the recording studio necessary? Towards the beginning of the movie, discussion was held about the beautiful magnitude of holding hands. Yet later in the movie Nick and Nora have sex proving that holding hands is not the greatest attribute of a relationship. What is with the condescending sex scene? For me to believe that this relationship would be one full of love and long term happiness would mean to take things slow. The fact that they had sex knowing each other for less than twenty four hours proves their relationship to be more of a sprint. They narrow down the reasoning to be that they were 'musical soul mates.' Yes that's spreading a good message to young America.A few seconds were incoherent because the laughter from the audience was held a bit longer than the length of the joke. The man sitting directly across from me was at the edge of his seat for a good majority of the movie. Give it an 'aye' ? This movie is a must see. Must see in theaters? No. More like must see in general. At some point of your life, maybe a schedule free night, this movie might enter your life. At the end of the movie I exited nine dollars and fifty cents poorer. Was it all worth it? Given the choice of two Starbucks coffees or a ticket to Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist I chose the legal caffeine stimulants. Only one thought can describe this movie, join the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Most Original Movie, but a nice story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot, Nick (Michael Cera) has been dumped by his girlfriend of six months Tris (Alexis Dziena) and has made mix CD's for her. Tris doesn't like them, doesn't want anything to do with them, and simply throws them away. Norah (Kat Dennings) picks up one that was trashed and is interested. Nick also is in a band with a few of his friends, and is at a gig that Norah is at. Norah in an attempt to make Tris jealous tells Nick to act like her boyfriend for a few minutes. Tris didn't seem too convinced it was believable. Caroline (Ari Graynor) gets way too wasted at this gig, and the band members are supposed to take her home. Along the way (the entire movie except the 1st 5 minutes is shot at night), Caroline escapes, and the band, Nick and Nora set out on a quest to find her. Also, everyone is determined to find one band, and tries to find the clues to figure out the location of where they are playing.Which woman does Nick want? Is Norah even remotely interested in Nick? What does "infinite playlist" really mean? This movie is 85 minutes not counting credits, it gets right to the point, and moves at a great pace. What works I think is the chemistry between all of the characters. For the record, I disliked "Superbad", I didn't think it was funny (I didn't laugh once), but Michael Cera does a good job with this. As I heard some people leaving the screening, one word kept coming out, "cute". I agree with this. It is funny, it is romantic, and although it isn't the most original idea in the world, it is well done. I would consider seeing this again, maybe to catch a few little things, but just for something different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could be filed under "Comfort Food for teens." There's no reason to analyze it or try to get anything from it, it's just a great time at the movies for young people. Michael Cera shines in his first leading role, and Kat Dennings really breaks through as Nora. The supporting cast is very good, especially newcomer Ari Graynor, who is drunk nearly the entire movie. A lot of actresses would ruin a role like this, but Graynor comes off as funny and likable. Their are also a lot of cameo appearances from comedians like Andy Samberg and Seth Meyers.The use of atmosphere in New York is one of the best parts of this movie. It really sets it apart as the characters roam around from venue to venue searching for a certain indy band. For the 13-19 year old age group, its an feel-good, if flawed, movie that will really entertain younger viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I feel dirty now... and not in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps this movie really speaks to the under 18 set. I usually have no problems with teenage comedies. I get them. I'm still young enough to relate. I couldn't relate to these characters at all. The movie seemed like it was going to go somewhere, and it didn't. The characters did not develop in any meaningful way whatsoever. It left me with a lot of questions, such as: How do high school students manage to get into so many drinking establishments and drink loads of booze when they don't even remotely look old enough to be in there? Isn't the drinking age in NY 21? They don't even get ID'd. I suppose I'd understand if they flashed fake IDs.How are there no parents involved whatsoever? I suppose this explains how they were able to stay out until sun-up.Was it a Friday night? What was the point of this movie? I thought maybe Nick and Norah would have some big moments of clarity, where they made it very clear to their exes that they were done with them. Instead, Nick's character still seemed like he'd take the other girl back. Gross.Why is it that sadly, the traveling gum is the only part that makes sense, adding a little bit of continuity to the film? But then they can't even deal with that properly... It would have actually been funny had it landed in the original guy's mouth... not smacked him in the face.What does it prove exactly, that Nick could make Norah climax in a matter of 20 seconds? Was the machine recording? Will her dad completely freak out on Norah when he hears that? Why did we have to be a party to Norah's first orgasm anyway? It was squeaky, awkward, and childlike. It made me feel dirty, and only adds fuel to the argument that teens shouldn't be having sex. Because it sounded very child-like, which made me feel like a dirty dirty pedophile for even watching that part of the movie.Why didn't I walk out of the movie early on, when I realized that it was pointless and was going nowhere? Because I kept hoping something would happen.Will I ever be compensated for the time and money I wasted on this film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd Stereotypes with terrible casting...ugh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movies blows chunks. The basis of this opinion is based solely on the material and story. Everything in this movie is a cliché. The jokes aren't funny and every stereotype is overplayed, over and over and over and over and over... There are too many unexplained events and series of frustrating sequences that make little to no sense here. I would throw spoilers in this review but the whole movie is so bad that there's really nothing to spoil. The casting for this couldn't have been worse and even Cera seems uncomfortable. The dialogue between the main characters (Cera and Denning) is blah! The only bright light in this movie is Ari Graynor's performance as Caroline but even her character is a cliché. There are a couple of funny moments but I believe I had already seen them in the trailers. Even the gross raunchy parts were just that...gross and raunchy and not funny. This is not the worst movie ever but it's close. I would give it a 1/10 but Graynor's character (Caroline) will allow me to bump this up to a 2/10. Find something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8 for Cera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, so first of all I'd like to say that I was never a big Cera fan. First movie I saw him in was Superbad. Kind of liked that movie but I didn't like the character he was playing. After a few movies ( Juno, Scott Pilgrim and Youth in Revolt) I started to see that he's not acting. He is that shy, nerdy kind of man who looks like a sixteen year old and I like it and from that moment on him. Now, about this movie. I know I am kind of late but hey I live in Austria. We get movies like a 100 years later And I don't understand why people say they didn't like it. It's funny, simple and it has everything you need to feel good after. You have love, the character you can hate, the one you can love, and the music. I mean, it wasn't my time, but these songs are good. So, I recommend you watch it and like it. Don't try to interpret to much in such a movie. I give it an 8 out of 10 just because I watched it and did't regret the 90 minutes I spent. I liked it, and you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay so i didn't have high hopes for this film going into it, though i do like a lot of Michael Cera's work his awkward manorisms sometimes get on my nerves. This film was no exception to that but he fit the part very well, he's shy but charming just like Nick is. This film being a teen flick will obviously appeal more to that age range, but i think everyone can say they have been in one of the situations that occurs in this film, it's cheesy at parts which i love, it left me with a warm happy feeling after watching it, like a good film should. It's also quite unexpectedly hilarious at times, it's a great easy watching film which i would definitely recommend or even watch again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To infinity and above expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist has a lot more life than one would expect. It seems like a stock rom com, but when you dive into it you'll likely see it is sure to impress in the field of characters, events, and style. It is almost like an eighties film in present day. It takes place all in one night, similar to American Graffiti, and has a certain retro quality about it.Michael Cera plays the same character that he plays throughout his entire filmography which is certainly not a bad thing. I say if you're really good at doing a certain character, keep doing it. Cera plays a good sweet and innocent boy in everything he does. In Juno he was great and same with Superbad. Kat Dennings, who looks like a younger version of the Survivor winner Parvati Shallow, is a little new in this one, but she does a great job because of her "born this way" attitude. She's very independent and very calm most of the movie.The plot involves depressed and lonely Nick (Cera) who plays for a band called "The Jerk-Offs" being suddenly paired up with this girl and before they know it they are on the search for their favorite band called "Where's Fluffy." The girl is Norah (Dennings), a good friend of the girl who recently dumped Nick, Tris (Dzeina).Also looking for the band are the rest of "The Jerk-Offs) played by Aaron Yoo and Ravi Gavron. Nick and Norah are first in search of Norah's drunk girlfriend Caroling (Graynor), but assuming she's in good hands, go out to hunt for the band.The plot is sweet, but not execute very well. It portrays New York too safely. The characters never seem to be in any danger even though they are driving through some of the scummiest sidestreets in the city in a Yugo getting mistaken at various points for a cab. Also, I must ask this simple question, where the hell are the parents? With all the aside, it manages to pull through and not have all the characters play the roles they should. It's almost as if screenwriter Lorene Scafaria actually knew Nick and Norah and this is a biography. The characters don't seem forced or idiotic. They seem like pretty normal high school students.With a pretty poor trailer and an odd marketing campaign, it seemed the only thing Nick and Norah had going for it was the soundtrack. Thankfully it isn't a one note comedy and actually manages to make itself better than a lot of twenty first century comedies. It's harmless and original. Two qualities movies of its genre should all be.Starring: Michael Cera, Kat Dennings, Aaron Yoo, Alexis Dziena, Ari Graynor, Aaron Yoo, and Jay Baruchel. Directed by: Peter Sollett.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My title sums it up. If you enjoy the quirky romantic comedy types with lots of indie music, this is your movie and you will greatly enjoy it. It makes you laugh, Cera and Dennings have great chemistry together. It's a little predictable and it goes exactly where you expect it to go, but it is an RC so I can't really complain about that. While you do know exactly where this movie is going, it keeps you thoroughly entertained while it takes you there. The only thing that keeps this from being a 9 or 10 star movie for me is the fact that the characters aren't as sympathetic as they could be. They are a little whiny and it takes a while for the viewer to actually care about them, but they do bring it around in the end and get you to like the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice feel good movie. The plot is far fetched at times and the characters aren't always well drawn but I found myself liking most of them.Musician Nick is heartbroken after splitting up with high school student Tris. She goes to his band's gig in New York City with two of her schoolmates, one of whom is Norah, who is cool but not very confident. After the gig Nick and Norah meet when she asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend (don't ask why!). They discover they both like the same music so they search in his decrepit Yugo for ubercool band, "Where's Fluffy?" who are playing a secret gig somewhere in the city. Meanwhile Nick's gay band mates agree to take Norah's very drunk other friend ? Caroline- home in their van.So we follow these characters around NYC as the night turns into morning. Nick and Norah like each other but then fall out. Tris gets jealous of Norah and decides she wants Nick back. You can see where this is going, right?So nothing wildly original but the movie does have a few things going for it. The cast seem to get on really well and appear to have enjoyed making the movie. Michael Cera plays the same character he played in Juno and Scott Pilgrim (and indeed Superbad). You have to admit he is good at playing the likable nerdy guy. He and Kat Dennings, who plays Norah, have good chemistry as the erstwhile couple and you want them to end up together. Ari Graynor is particularly funny as Caroline, who is drunk for 90% of the movie.There are a few negatives to the movie. The plot stretches your disbelief to the limit at times. On street parking seems to be no problem in New York City. Towards the end of the movie a plot line about Norah's lack of sexual experience is raised rather needlessly in my opinion. However it is resolved reasonably well in a scene at the climax of the movie. (That line is funnier if you've seen the movie!). Nick's ex-girlfriend Tris is a character with no redeeming features. She is the complete opposite of "good girl" Norah, which jarred a bit for me."Nick and Norah's??." is partly romcom, partly teen comedy and partly farce and it will keep a smile on your face for most of it's running time.It also gets an extra star from me for a couple of brilliant romantic lines at the end of the movie, after Nick and Norah leave the "Where's Fluffy" concert early.Norah - Are you sad that we missed it? Nick - We didn't miss it. This is it.</fullReview>

This movie did have some cases of cheap humor, but it was mostly revolved around romantic dialogue. Michael Cera has been in a lot of stupid movies, but this movie made me want to see more of him. I think Kat Dennings is gonna be the Will Smith of teen acting. The jealousy in this movie was perfect; Nick couldn't get over Tris, who just broke up with him the day before. Norah started to like Nick, and this caused Tris to become jealous. Norah's ex boyfriend, Tal, becomes jealous, for Nick is with Norah. The soundtrack for this movie completely fit. In my opinion, this may be one of the best romantic comedies ever made.</fullReview>

Cera is a band member who Dennings spends some time with as a lark and then they quietly start growing on each other. The stars have some real chemistry and they are believable in their roles, I was unfamiliar with them before seeing this.

		<shortDescription>Loses sight of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every genre has unique structural elements that make it a challenge to write well. But the most difficult genre of all may be the love story, especially the romantic comedy. The love story turns on two contradictory requirements. On one hand, a love story should take only ten minutes. Two people are attracted to one another, and the rest is negotiation. On the other hand, the story must last a long time for the love to be believable to the audience. The audience can't just see the two people fall in love. They have to feel it, and that takes a lot of screen time.These two contradictory elements account for many of the 12 unique story beats that make up the genre. For example, when the two leads first meet, they always fight. Of course, this is completely unrealistic; next time you're interested in someone, go start a fight with them and see what happens. But starting a love story with a fight makes a lot of structural sense. Remember, you have to create more than ten minutes of story.If we look at Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist, by Lorene Scafaria from a novel by Rachel Cohen and David Levithan, we can see writers struggling with the special challenges of the love story. The film relies on textural details, especially music, to make it feel original and fresh. But because the writers never cracked the structural essentials of a good romance, the audience gets little story and no feeling of love.The key structural mistake in this script has to do with Desire, one of the 7 major structure steps in any story and especially crucial in a romance. The main desire line in a romance, and the spine of the story, is the desire the two characters have for each other. This is why the classic Hollywood love story tracks the man's quest for the woman. She opposes that desire for most of the story, and they finally get together at the end.Notice that approach establishes a desire line and conflict for 90 plus minutes, and solves the first big difficulty of the love genre. But notice also that this is essentially the structure of an action story. And while this structure gives the audience plenty of time to feel the love developing between the two characters, most of what the characters are feeling toward each other is not love, but conflict.The writers of Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist wanted to use a different love story structure, one not based on the guy chasing the resisting girl. That's a great idea in theory. But in practice, they chose to change the primary desire line from a passion between the two characters to an outside desire the characters share, which is to find where an underground band is playing. True, this gave the writers a line that extends for 90 plus minutes, with plenty of time for the two leads to get to know one another and fall in love.But at what cost? The story is extremely episodic as the leads go from one location to another in search of a band the audience doesn't care about. Which means that while there are multiple events, there is no plot. And because the driving desire is not between the two leads, this remains a friend story, not a love story.The screenwriter, apparently realizing the lack of urgency in the main desire line, added a secondary desire where the leads search for a drunken friend who is lost in the big city. But this just adds an unrelated story line (not a true sub-plot). And watching a young woman stumble around drunk for 90 minutes is anything but funny.We can certainly learn some lessons here. If you want to write a love story that doesn't rely on the old man-chases-woman schematic, by all means do it. It will set you apart and give you the opportunity to write what I call, in the Love Story Class, a "true love story." But don't make the mistake of substituting an outside desire line for the desire that must be the spine of any good and moving love story, which is the craving that each has for the other. Never lose sight of what is really at stake in a love story, and that's love itself.If you would like to learn all of the beats of a great love story, along with how to write each of the many sub-genres of love, including romantic comedy, take a look at the Love Story Class and Love Story Software. Very few writers have mastered this tricky form, but it can be done. And the payoff is huge.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this film but the producers shot themselves in the foot by including a subplot so disgusting that it was all I could do to keep watching. The main plot was cute - not especially original but the cast was so good it was able to overcome triteness. The two leads were both charming and fun to watch - the female especially interesting and a real beauty. The idea of a gay band with a straight lead was cute too and for once the gay guys were presented matter-of-factly which made them more interesting and the plot more plausible. Since I'm pushing 70 I'm not up on current music but the music in the film was enjoyable - usually I have to take off my headphones or mute the sound when most current music is played but not with this film which was a relief. I couldn't name a single person in the current music scene but I imagine the soundtrack had a few of them. One hole in the script (I write scripts so I know all about holes)was the fact they never showed the band everyone was running all over town to see - that was a major disappointment. I suppose they could have used a real band but they probably didn't have the budget for that.</fullReview>

Wright, Jay Baruchel, (Cameos: Seth Meyers, Eddie Kaye Thomas, John Cho, Kevin Corrigan, Andy Samberg) Entertaining and funny rom-com for the MySpace generation ala vintage John Hughes about one crazy night spent in NYC's LES with two NJ-ite teens (baby seal incarnate Cera and Addams Family second cousin Kennings as the titular pair) who wind up together despite the odds of their friends, their exes and each other, in an attempt to find their favorite band in an after hours rare live performance. The two leads have chemistry, baby, chemistry and are a winning couple in a post-ironic, self-deprecating waycool way (way!) Graynor steals the movie as Dennings' Drunky McDrunk-Drunk gal pal whose inebriation is a cinematic marvel of ill- inducing slapstick involving her ever-present chewing gum (trust me it's up there with Cameron Diaz' 'gel doo' in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY for ickness factor for laughs). In spite of the Gen-Next indie music jukebox (which this Gen X'er totally can't appreciate; what can I tell ya, it all sounds the same to me ? unmemorable static) the film runs on all cylinders thanks to a shrewdly clever screenplay by Lorene Scafaria (who has a memorable cameo involving Cera's Yugo-as-taxi-makeout sequence) based on a novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levitan, and rollickingly droll direction by Peter Sollett.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist - Two kids in the various stages of bad relationships, Nick and Nora (Michael Cera and Kat Dennings), meet each other at a concert. They have a night of hi-jinx involving taking care of/ searching for Nora's drunken friend and an elusive cult band. This is directed by newbie director Peter Sollet and written by newbie writer Lorene Scafaria.This move is cute and at times delightful. The target audience, based on the trailers that preceded it, is definitely girls (and, judging by who the mass majority of the audience was, they succeeded). The studios have hit on the fact that the girls like this Michael Cera kid. I have mixed feelings about him overall. He's not an actor. He's a star. The difference is that actors can play a multitude of different characters, often with the audience forgetting it's the actor. Cera has awkwardness down to a finely tuned craft, but he's only as good as who he is paired with. And therefore I'd say the bigger credit goes to Kat Dennings, who is a fine young actress and I expect big things from her in the future.I did not come out of this hating Aaron Yoo, a fact that surprised me. Kudos to the makers for including gay men in the main cast. This is the 21st century. Gay men can and should do more in movies than be bffs to the leading female (that this movie breaks that mold depends on your opinions of Michael Cera's masculinity) and fashion designers telling Anne Hathaway how fat and unattractive she is. Aaron Yoo, Rafi Gavron and Jonathan B. Wright provide able comedic support in what I hope is not a career ending move for the latter two.As I said, it's a cute movie. There are a few moments of lag or predictability and others of questionable character motivations, but it is a teen comedy after all. There is one moment near the end at the recording studio that left me roaring. I would have paid extra for a scene after the credits between Nora and her father regarding what happens in that scene. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Ah it's probably best to leave it to the imagination.Ironicaly most of the soundtrack to the movie is forgettable, but I'd take it in a heartbeat over the Juno soundtrack. All in all it doesn't matter what I say. This movie is going to steamroll everything else in theater. Girls are going to see it mostly, but boys who are dragged along will find they had a good time as well. Hooray to Michael Cera scoring another girl way out of his league, thanks to the magic of cinema.Good but not great, Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist gets a B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Guy Meets Nice Girl</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever had that sweet guy friend who brings you soup in the morning tend to date the bitchiest girls? Or have you had the nicest girl friend who always has your back but tends to hook up with assholes? Well this movie is about the two paths of the Good Guy and the Nice Girl crossing.I saw this movie at an advanced screening the other day and to be honest I was very skeptical. As a HUGE fan of Micheal Cera and the movie JUNO, I was certain that this movie was attempting to be another JUNO. But to my surprise it was a whole another entity. Mainly because this movie was based off a book (which i just bought).This movie is much more diverse and vulgar in some ways such as language. There are gay characters in the movie that play a supporting role which I found delightful since it was unexpected and more relatable since I don't know many people who don't have gay friends. Cera plays the same boy next door as Nick but Dennings as Norah compliments him well. The two of them are opposites yet they have many things in common and one of them is taste in music.Overall, I thought the movie was perfect to take a date on. I was with my boyfriend and the movie was a prefect combo of cuddles and laughs. I highly recommend this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(this is a replacement comment. The original was not as rich as the film deserves.)Sometimes a film has no narrative whatever, and instead relies on the tone it sets. And sometimes it works for me. Not frequently, but in this case it worked for me. I have to admit that this is just the sort of thing I reject because it has no direct narrative. But in my case, the careful setting up of a situation that has romantic tendrils sets up a whole set of internal narratives that serves just as well. Better even.The tone is a carefully balanced set of desires and hesitations from both sides of the urge ocean. Its a tone poem in wanting to belong, colored by the search for music, ephemeral enough to entice our own unsettled desires lose.I want to recommend this because it worked for me. It still does as I remember it a week later. It will open your unresolved desires.Why it works, is because it shifts the foundation from narrative to place. Like Shakespeare's lone experiment in this technique (Pericles), the serial components of search for place are substituted for the discovery of story. Why this is such an extraordinary experiment is because it conflates place with music. I think you have to be of a fresher generation than mine to make this leap, but it seems so natural that I suppose most viewers won't notice it.So instead of mapping the typical search for self, or search for a love (usually the same) with some fabricated story as usual, we get mapped to a world of sonic architecture where character, song and place meld. Where instead of the ideal romance, the cinematic value is the ideal song. That's why we have the otherwise inexplicable lovemaking session on tape in a recording studio. When some novel experiment like this comes along that enhances the romantic narrative, it is cause for celebration. When it works, it is cause for a parade. I am sorry I did not celebrate this sufficiently in my original comment. I have discovered that it touched me rather deeply.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nope...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I liked the cast. They're all likable and usually great... with one exception... the vomiting, heaving, foul drunken blonde creature who ruined this entire movie for me. Now, it may be the script required her to be utterly grotesque in every possible way, but there's 'drunk, funny' and 'drunk utterly vile should be shot'... she was the latter.And it just all took too long... if a running around, looking for the hidden, is done well, a movie can just be a bundle of fun... but when so much time was spent on grotesque, vomiting, pulling her cell out of a vomit-filled toilet female who is ostensibly a slut, and yet, strangely, would like to make out with three previous guys but actually worries about being in a van with three others and runs away... what a mess of a movie.Nope, not for me. Apparently its high rating is because it appeals to people with too much time on their hands who think ugly drunk girls are funny and who think that waiting for any kind of romance is interesting and that really bad music tops it off. Biggest load of crap I've seen in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great throwback to when teen films let its characters just feel natural and real ... Juno, eat your heart out!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The teen romance genre is no stranger to formula. Often, the sequence of events will go: Audience meets boy, audience meets girl, boy and girl meet each other, and before you know it the sparks are flying and they're on the collision course of love. A thousand times this story has been told, in every genre, not just teen romance, and yet there's something innocent and magical about it in its simplicity it that keeps us coming back.Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist does not stray from the tried and tested plot arcs of its predecessors, but while the plot is expectedly familiar for the teen romance genre, what makes Nick and Norah stand out is how natural and real its characters feel. In a sense, Nick and Norah is a complete antidote to Cera's last film, Juno. As much as that film went overboard with attempts at wit and unrealistically setting up the characters for snark and pop culture humor, Nick and Norah plays the dialog and interaction completely genuine and real, director Peter Sollett simply lets his characters breathe and be the regular, real teenagers and human beings they are. The humor in the film comes from not forced wit and jokes, but only the natural conversation and glances that comes with youth and early romance, essentially what you'd find yourself laughing at in real life. Nick and Norah is probably the closest any film has gotten since Dazed and Confused to replicating the social teen dialog and conversational atmosphere.Cera and Dennings, although both limited actors, bring natural charm and energy to their roles, an despite the romance arc being intentionally predictable from the beginning, manage to create a level of believability and sweetness to their courtship through the night. By the end of the film when they do cultivate their romance, it's hard not to find yourself happy that they did. The real star of the film comedically however, is Ari Graynor as Caroline, almost pitch perfectly playing the puking drunk girl we all knew and loved from our high school past. Never slipping into total absurdity or farce, Graynor's lost and drunk encounters throughout the night, including a certain piece of gum, an encounter at a train station, and of course, the toilet, provide the biggest laughs of the film.Peter Sollett shoots the film in a fairly low-budget, natural way, which benefits the naturalistic feel of the acting and dialog. For the most part however, his contribution lies in the interaction with the actors over attempting anything artistically behind the camera. The film doesn't truly get going until 20 minutes in, as Nick and Norah aren't as interesting without each other, and Caroline isn't as interesting when she isn't drunk. However, as soon as the two title characters begin riding in Nick's Yuma and the script begins to unfurl the pitch perfect nervous conversational techniques between the two, the film takes off.Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is a film where the storyline may not be new and the end is foreseeable from miles away, but nevertheless, like a fairy tale you've heard many times before, you can't help but enjoy yourself along the way once again. As a nice throwback to teen romances like Say Anything or Sixteen Candles when the characters were allowed to feel real and as they are, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is a great and charming addition to the genre.Review written for Worldofkj.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jimmy Stewart meets Anne Hathaway, and like awesome magic stuff sorta happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie analogous in general genre terms to Scorsese's 'After Hours:' it's an all-night ramble in New York City with lost and found people and other complications and a sine-wave of emotions. Its talk and its hero's choice CD-mixes mark it as a picture of and for if not by the iPod generation, white bridge-and-tunnel version. Nobody gets seriously hurt, not anybody we care about anyway, though there's some serious grossness in sequences involving a drunk girl, who's a good friend of the protagonist's soon-to-be new girlfriend. He is in the process of breaking up with his previous girlfriend, who shows her unsuitability by doing a sexy dance in front of the hero's Yugo car while he's at the wheel watching. It's not what he wants anymore. He's discovered you can have a good conversation with a girl. His response is to back up and drive away, leaving her alone and unattended in a remote-looking part of one of the outer boroughs. Why is that okay? Because Rudy Giuliani made the town safe.At the center of it all is the playlist, or the man who makes mixes which the new girl happens to love even more than the old girlfriend. What bands you like among the American high school set defines you. Nick O'Leary (Michael Cera) is the guy, and his nocturnal wanderings in search of love have a focus: he's the one straight guy in a Queercore (i.e. gay boy) band whose current name is The Jerk-Offs (can that really be original?). They're thinking of other names and their Asian member Thom (veteran token Oriantal Aaron Yoo: watch for him--he's good) favors Sh-t Sandwich. This is the kind of thing that keeps you watching when otherwise not much is happening other than cars being recklessly driven around New York City and gay boys looking cute. The gay boys are in a van; Nick chooses to drive his own valiant but battered yellow-orange Yugo. That the new girlfriend (spoiler alert) wrecks it, even though she can drive stick shift, sort of, and Nick goes right ahead into the diner to talk to her right afterwards anyway, shows that she has like totally already won his affections.Norah is the new girl. And why does she deserve it? Actually she arrives by chance, when Nick asks her to to pose as his girlfriend just for five minutes so he can avoid recapture by his ex, Tris (Alexis Dziena). What a five minutes. Kids change fast.Norah is Kat Dennings, who has survived 'Sarah Bartlett' and 'House Bunny' to arrive at this more distinctive venue. She's a beautiful girl with big lips, who looks more like Anne Hathaway than Anne Hathaway does in her downbeat indie mode for Jonathan Demme's 'Rachel Getting Married.' Norah has understated caché. She gets everyone into any of the clubs, because, it turns out, her father heads one of the most successful recording studios in New York. But she's modest about that, and doesn't brag, though she shows off the studio to Nick later on in this long night. Like wow. And wow. And can I hold that guitar? And can I hold you?The whole band outing has another purpose--the only thing that gets Nick out of his house to join them. Rumor has it that a cult indie band he and the (other) Jerk-Offs and also Norah all adore, called Where's Fluffy? is playing at some as yet not quite determined exclusive venue. Several bait-and-switch club runs occur before, in the wee small hours, Where's Fluffy is found--but--another guarantee of true (newly discovered) love--Nick and Norah forget about Where's Fluffy? and leave the club to be with each other and go back to New Jersey from whence they both come--Englewood and Hackensack.Another plot device is the drunk girl, who Norah cares about. She's called Caroline (Ari Graynor), and she's the one who (spoiler alert) does some nasty things with vomit and a toilet and a cell phone and a wad of gum that I would rather not have seen, though such stuff is a lot more harmless than serial killers or Abu Ghraib. Caroline has to be carted away, and the gay band boys volunteer to take her on so that Norah and Nick can be alone together. But then (spoiler alert) they lose her, somehow, and everybody goes looking for her again.None of this matters. It's the thinnest pretense for a plot to keep things moving along and turn a lot of noise and stickiness and bad band names into a dream first date. Rachel Cohn and David Levithan wrote the gay-friendly and Jewish-friendly but persons-of-color-free young adult novel on which this charming little film is based. Lorene Scafaria did the screenplay, in collaboration with Ms. Cohn.The main reason for watching is to see Michael Cera, the young actor from a suburb of Toronto, in a more sustained role than he's had before. His appearances on TV have been many and date from when he was 10; he's now 20. This is not exactly a case of Arrested Development, but many know him from that series. On the big screen he was arresting in both Superbad and Juno. The Apatow "Freaks and Geeks" folks may have sought him out, but Cera strikes his own balance between Freak and Geek, hottie and nerd. For sure some girls love him, because he is sweet, and he continues here to show the same alarmingly authentic-seeming quiet straightforwardness. Cera's line readings are so well timed and simple they feel like it's a real person talking. With his understated but original looks and style he's a born movie actor, a young Jimmy Stewart for our times. I hope people will remember Michael Cera better from this movie than the traveling wad of gum. But I don't know. I hope I will. But the mind can play tricks on you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick And Norah's Infinite Playlist was a fun, fresh, cute romantic comedy. It had a lot of everything in the movie. It had comedy, some fighting, and lots of other stuff. I liked the story a lot and thought it was creative how the whole movie took place all in one night. I think the story was smart and pretty different in a good way. I think the movie was was very good for teens to see but also for people who like to see romantic comedy movies. The movie makes you think more of who you really are and what kind of person you are. The acting was very good. Michael Cera is a great young actor and did a terrific job. Kat Dennings was funny and fun to watch. The two together were very funny and made the whole movie good. The movie has many different places that they filmed at. The movie was consistently good and made you laugh pretty much the whole time. Overall the movie was fun and very entertaining to go see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun little love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty typical, but still quite a lot of fun to watch. The scenes just between Nick and Norah are where the film shines the brightest. Cera and Dennings have a great chemistry in both comedic and romantic moments, and they are just a joy to watch all the way through. The film should have just been all about them, but it got bogged down with pretty pointless subplots that got tedious after a while. The entire story with Triss trying to get Nick back was boring and didn't add anything to the film, and while everything with Nick's gay band members was kind of funny it wasn't vital to the story and took screen time away from Nick and Norah which is where it should have been. However there is one subplot that was absolutely hilarious and always made a for a lot of fun and that was Norah's friend Caroline who gets ridiculously wasted at the beginning and spends the entire night lost in the city completely out of her mind. Ari Graynor steals the film away from the two leads in a big way. She dominates every scene with some of the best comedic work of the year. Her scene with Kevin Corrigan (who is dressed as a chef, doesn't say a word and just looks at a sandwich in his lap with a scarily depressed face) is far and away the best scene in the film and probably the funniest of the entire year. It had me dying. Overall, it's a cute little love story about finding your true soul mate in the midst of one chaotic night. A good watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because it's actually funny, the jokes aren't tasteless, there where about two jokes I found tacky. But still a fun movie. And the two characters in the movie where likable and real in a funny way. And it was quite enjoyable. Everything My Best Friend's Girl wasn't It begins with Nick(Michael Cera from Juno and Superbad) is still trying to mend from a broken heart, after his tramp girlfriend Tris(Alexis Dziena) dumps him. One night decides to go out with his band to night club, when they had a gig. They also want to find a secret concert. Nick runs into Norah(Kat Dennings from The 40 year old virgin, Raise Your Voice, and The House Bunny) who asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend for a few minutes. But decides to help with her drunken friend Caroline(Ari Graynor). But Nicks band friends try to push him and Norah together. So they take a drunken Caroline, in hopes Nick and Norah will hook up. But the plan goes awry, when the band loses Caroline, and soon adventure and misadventure will follow.It felt like a John Hughes movie from the 1980's. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings are very appealing and have wonderful chemistry. And the rest of the cast do well also. Not an all great film, but an entertaining and funny film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Party in NYC, 2008</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A romantic comedy that portrays a contemporary slice of youthful culture in New York City. The cute, charismatic actors and actresses are an appealing part of this typical not so interesting story. What is interesting is the believable, somewhat realistic portrayal of the youthful, "hip" culture of NYC nightlife. Contemporary music, styles and attitudes give a "slice of life" and feel of the pace, place and the times. It rings very close to home, witnessing the abysmal drunkenness of the scantily clad night goers, slopping around the train station like hungry, nauseated and tired animals, waiting for the late night train back to the burbs. As the kids drive around we witness many of the NYC landmarks, not the statue of liberty and Lincoln Center type landmarks, but rather, those bars lounges and eateries infamous to the downtown night hoppers.It's the type of movie when viewed several years or decades in the future will render a "oh my, what were we thinking back then" in reference to the styles, music and culture such as we do today when we watch 80s movies.Movie also contained one of the most amusingly, putrid scenes ever caught on film that makes you turn your head in disgust but since it fosters that unique reaction it is for the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie tried so hard to be cool but it ended up just being kind of pretentious and average. Fifteen minutes after walking out of the theater I had completely forgotten I had seen it, seriously. There are a few lines that made me genuinely laugh, but again, there were few. Michael Cera is definitely believable and the supporting cast is fine. The plot is the main problem. The movie has a pretty good idea for a semi-indy film, but it ends of confusing itself and turning into a cliché. You can't help but feel a little annoyed that Cera's ex-girlfriend is very attractive while Nora has kind of a vampirish face and needs braces. Honestly, can we have a film where the new girl is equally as attractive as the ex? Bottom line, interesting musical entries, pretty good acting, average plot. I'd avoid unless you are really interested in the music or are a Michael Cera fan.6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Infinite Playlist keeps a fresh tune By: Morgan GrodeckiNick And Norah's Infinite Playlist ? Movie ReviewStaring Michael Cera (Juno) and Kat Dennings (Charlie Bartlett), Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist ? which will be referred to as Infinite Playlist from here on ? is a light-on-it's feet comedy that provides a nice break from the Judd Appatow driven comedies of the summer. Not that the two types of comedies aren't equal in their own right, it is merely refreshing to be witness to an Aww-inspiring moment, as opposed to being forced to shield your eyes from view while the rest of your audience groans in disgust. Following our two protagonists, Infinite Playlist revolves around Nick and Nora, two awkwardly-realistic (or realistically-awkward) teens in Manhattan. Nick, a guitarist for a Queer-Core band The Jerk-Offs, and Norah, the average-Jane who knows nothing of fashion, meet throughout a night on the town, bumping into one another more than once. Both having their own inner demons, they slowly begin to realize just how alike they are as dusk turns to night, and night to dawn.Throughout the film, we are shown Nick's laundry-list of insecurities, perfected in a way only Michael Cera can manage. Channelling his similar characters from previous films, Cera stumbles over words, shies away from confrontation, and wallows in agonizing pain from the break-up with his ex-girlfriend (whom he would never manage to get in real life). Mirrored and embodied in a self-conscious, indie-music listening teen is Norah, played perfectly by budding actress Kat Dennings. Although she is playing a role much younger then her 27 year old self, Dennings is able to reach back and pull her childhood forth, and focus on just what it felt like to be alone and scared. The supporting cast consists of cheerleaders, wash-outs, and flaming gays, who are sure to put a light although feminine smile on any viewers faces.A Juno-reminiscent movie, viewers are almost forcefully fed an array of Indie music from various bands that are sure to be on every 15 year old girl's iPod within a month of its release, each of them claiming that they knew the band "before they were cool!". While the movie tries it's hardest to stay within the realm of a teenage reality, the viewers can't help but be yanked away from the movie by certain "Wait?what?" moments as the plot falls to pieces time and time again. Luckily for the well-meant movie, the overall charm and atmosphere manage to keep viewers enthralled and entertained enough for these trivial errors to be over-looked almost entirely.Director Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas) is by no means an artistically talented director, but one does not go into Infinite Playlist expecting to be enthralled by beautiful horizons and jaw-dropping scenes of a beach at dawn. You go to this movie to enjoy the warm, fuzzy feeling that you experience as Nick and Norah slowly bicker back and forth as to whether The Cure is a good band or not. An all-around enjoyable movie, this is sure to be a success with viewers and critics alike. Here's hoping it doesn't get overblown like a certain Ellen Page movie we all know.3 ? out f 5 Stars</fullReview>

We'll take that as a given.' And she was right, we love him.There were cringe worthy moments, in that, they were moments that we've all had that we wish we; and there were laugh out loud moments.

		<shortDescription>Two beautiful girls fighting over a geek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Nick (Michael Cera), the only straight band member of "The Jerk Offs" has recently been dumped by his hot girlfriend, Tris (Alexis Dziena). Nick believes that he can win her back by sending her special songs on CDs that he has mixed just for her. Nick has sent her about 10 CDs, but Tris only throws them in the trash. However, Tris' best friend, Norah (Kat Dennings), has retrieved most of them, and she loves them. Norah has never met Nick, but the music he loves touches her heart. Norah and her friend Caroline are at a nightclub where "The Jerk Offs" are playing, and Norah is attracted to Nick while he is playing his guitar. Tris shows up at the same club with her new boyfriend. Norah doesn't want Tris to think that she is dateless, so she asks Nick to pretend to be her boyfriend for 5 minutes and gives him a big kiss. Then Tris tells Norah that Nick is her ex-boyfriend. Now that Norah has Nick, the heartless Tris decides that she now wants him back. A night of searching for the band "Where's Fluffy" will end up with one of these girls winning Nick's love.(My Comment) This is a cute romantic comedy written for the teenage audience. Teenagers will connect with the thrill and discovery of new music and the pitfalls of being in love. Nick and Norah embark on an adventure searching for the band "Where's Fluffy," and find something unexpected, just what happens in real life. The only thing is that in real life, a geek like Nick will not be fought over by two beautiful girls. I can relate to Nick's yellow Yugo, and the car troubles he has when you are young and can only afford to drive a piece of junk. There is one individual story about a piece of gum that travels throughout the whole movie that is actually disgusting. They could have left that part out. Overall, the movie gave me some laughs and is a good date movie, especially for teenagers. (Sony Pictures, Run Time 1:30, Rated PG-13)(5/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless Drivel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film but honestly it kept on trying to have this forced young feel that I hate so many movies are trying to live up to. Whenever I see movies like this I know it's made from some person in their late 30's or 40's trying to connect with today's youth and it sad and pointless drivel. The acting feels pretty phoned in. I like Michael Cera a good bit, but the actress playing Norah I just couldn't like. She's been in other movies I hate as well so maybe that animosity is just carrying over. The so called humor falls flat and feels very forced. Again it feels like the producers are screaming "HEY KIDS IPODS indie rock, youth of America love this!!!". Most of all why I think I don't like this film is it's a studio trying to do a Juno type film. I don't mean the story as this story is a soul-less studio abortion, but the dialog tries to be trendy and of course they play all the trendy indie bands, kids relate to so well. To sum up simply don't ever watch this.</fullReview>
