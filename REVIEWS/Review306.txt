		<shortDescription>Tough and surreal Noir classic gets better and better with age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Kiss Me Deadly' is an overlooked crime gem that has proved to be a major influence on subsequent film makers from the French New Wave to cult classics 'Repo Man' and 'Pulp Fiction'. It's a movie which gets better and better with age. Director Robert Aldrich manages to put lots of style and interesting touches which sometimes border on the surreal into this toughest of tough guy movies. Ralph Meeker ('Paths Of Glory', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'The Anderson Tapes') is well cast as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. Meeker's Hammer is brutal and his performance really makes this one work. The supporting cast are all very good too, especially Albert Dekker ('The Wild Bunch') as Dr Soberin and Maxine Cooper as Hammer's "assistant" Velda. Also keep an eye out for the debut of Cloris Leachman is the striking opening sequence. The "great whatsit" which Hammer searches for is one of the great movie gimmicks, and the ending will blow you away - literally. I loved this movie from beginning to end. I think it ranks alongside 'Out Of The Past' (Tourneur), 'The Asphalt Jungle' (Huston), 'Double Indemnity' (Wilder), 'The Killing' (Kubrick) and 'The Killers (Siegel)' as one of the greatest and most influential American crime movies, and I'm sure Scorcese and Tarantino would be the first to agree. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly is an absolute joy to watch. There are no big-name stars, the director has never been mentioned in the same breath as a Hitchcock or Huston, and it's basically a simple Mickey Spillane story. How its presented on the screen is the genius of the picture. Right from the opening credit sequence, you know you're in for something fresh and innovative. This is a must see for fans of Quentin Tarantino, and there is a curious box containing a certain substance that glows when opened (Pulp Fiction, anyone?). It is one of the finest of the "film noir" genre, predominantly because of the moody black and white photography and its amazing 'timeless' appeal (I would rank it alongside Touch of Evil). It's great to know the film has been "rediscovered", and be sure to see a copy of the film containing 2 different versions of the mind-boggling final sequence shot at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an utterly bizarre film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago and I still don't know what to think about it. Ralph Meeker as a fascistic Mike Hammer, a crazy hitch-hiker, an opera fan and a box that can destroy the world. I dunno.From what I understand Alderitch (the director) hated Mikey Spillane's story (which was about a briefcase full of drugs or money or something else), thought Mike Hammer was an image of brutality and fascism and made a film that reflected it. He makes Hammer out to be some kind of sadist and makes the suitcase out be some kind of nuclear device. The movie turns from a simple detective story to some wierd-ass, sci-fi cold war parable. It's sort of like the X-Files meets film-noir PI, or something to that effect.All that being said, this is a GREAT film and is well worth watching by anyone who like apocalyptic film-noir (in fact, this may be the only film in that sub-genre). Anyone who is a fan of bizarre camera work, weird symbolism and a stranger storyline, should really check this out.Observe the many bizarre inconsistencies (clocks that jump ahead and back, screams that don't jibe right with the soundtrack, camera angles that jump mysteriously) and keep in mind that these were INTENDED! When you get a feel for this film and start noticing what the director was attempting to do with this bizarre film I think that you will enjoy it even more. Truly a unique piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir for a Nuclear Age</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sleazy, tawdry B-noir doesn't get any sleazier or tawdrier than Robert Aldrich's jazzy and astonishingly entertaining "Kiss Me Deadly." This film was released late in the life cycle of the film noir genre. By 1958 and Orson Welles' "Touch of Evil," true noir would be just about washed up. Any noir film from that point forward would be self-consciously aware that it was tipping its hat to an established genre. But "Deadly" came out when films still didn't have to work at being noirish---they just WERE, and dazzlingly so.Born-to-play-a-bully Ralph Meeker plays tough-guy detective Mike Hammer, who's in the wrong place at the wrong time and picks up a mysterious panic-stricken girl (Cloris Leachman), who's just escaped from an asylum. From that moment forward, he finds himself tangled up in a barely lucid plot, in which a bunch of baddies want to get their hands on something the girl either had or knew about. Hammer doesn't know what it is, but he knows that if so many people want it, it's something he probably wants too, and the race for the great "whatsit" is on.If you wanted to teach a film class about the look and attitude of a film noir, you couldn't pick a better film than this one. I found myself on a recent viewing of this film pausing my DVD player and studying the frame (because, sadly, this is what I do in my spare time), rehearsing in my mind what I would tell a class about any particular composition. And aside from the style, the film is steeped in noir sentiment--it's not simply cynical, like the glossier studio noirs of the 40's; it's downright apocryphal. It's not simply one man undone by the vengeful forces of fate here, but an entire civilization on the brink of extinction.So pop this in and have a great time with it--feel free to quote it liberally, as there are plenty of juicy lines worth quoting. But as you watch it, you might want to stay away from the windows, for as Mike Hammer's hot-to-trot sometime girlfriend, sometime secretary Velda says, someone may "blow you a kiss." Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike Hammer, detective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich was a no-nonsense film director. When he undertook the direction of this film, little did he know it was going to become the extraordinary movie it turned out to be. The fame seems to have come by its discovery in France, as it usually is the case. Based on Mickey Spillane's novel and adapted by Al Bezzerides, the movie has an unique style and it's recommended viewing for fans of the film noir genre.Right from the start, the film gets our imagination as we watch a young woman running along a California highway. That sequence proved Mr. Aldrich's ability to convey the idea of a disturbed young woman that seems to have escaped from a mental institution. The plot complicates itself as Hammer learns that Christine, the young woman, has died. He decides to investigate, which is what he does best.Some excellent comments have been submitted to this forum, so we will not even try to expand in the action but will only emphasize in the tremendous visual style Mr. Aldrich added to the film, which seems to be its main attraction. For a fifty year old film, it still has a crisp look to it thanks to the impressive black and white cinematography of Ernest Lazlo, who had a keen eye to show us Hammer's world as he makes it come alive. The great musical score by Frank DeVol fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the L.A. of the fifties.Ralph Meeker made an excellent contribution as Mike Hammer. He dominates the film with his presence. Albert Decker, Paul Stewart, Miriam Carr, Maxine Cooper, Fortuno Bonanova, and especially Cloris Leachman, in her screen debut, make this film the favorite it has become.Fans of the genre can thank Mr. Aldrich for making a film that didn't pretend to be anything, yet has stayed as a favorite all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kiss Me Deadly" had few similarities with Spillane's story about a gang of dope traffickers? Instead Aldrich reworks the plot so that the criminals are mixed up in the theft of priceless and high1y dangerous radioactive material which they are planning to smuggle to an unnamed power? The complicated story begins with Hammer picking up a scared girl on a lonely road at night and continues through the girl's subsequent death, a kidnapping and a series of very brutal killings?Spillane's Mike Hammer remains the ultimate in violent private eyes? The killings seem to matter less than the sadism? One scene in which Hammer deliberately breaks the irreplaceable records of an Italian opera lover in order to get the information he wants is more repellent than any of the murders in the film? Furious but stylish, "Kiss Me Deadly" is a film of great power and stays unique for its mixing of art and pulp fiction?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest detective thrillers ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If The Maltese Falcon (1941) was the definitive true detective movie, The Big Sleep (1946) the definitive glamourized detective movie, and Chinatown (1974) the definitive allegorical detective movie, then Kiss Me Deadly is the definitive sleazy detective movie.Mickey Spillane's sadistic private eye Mike Hammer, turned from successful private eye to sleazy bedroom dick, is the quintessential anti-hero, doing just about anything and everything wrong to get a piece of the pie that the characters call "The Big What's-it."The movie survives by giving the usual Spillane buckets-of-blood story and its protagonist new dimensions. Right from the electric opening scene and the audacious opening credit sequence, the audience is drawn into Hammer's seedy world, where morality is suspended, and the credo of the end justifying the means dominates Hammer's actions. His reckless abandonment is almost never questionned and the film seems to understand his brutality as what he must do to get the job done in an equally brutal world.Director Robert Aldrich observes all of it with an objective eye that neither glorifies nor condemns the action on-screen, letting the audience draw its own conclusions--even where the plot is concerned. The pace is unrelentless and the plot turns are never fully explained, forcing the audience to participate willingly in all that Hammer does to, hopefully, see the story through to its ending.And what an ending! I'd de damned to a special place in Hell if I elaborated, so I'll just say that it's one of the greatest I've ever seen. That goes same for the movie itself, which is one of the most stylish, jarring and truly entertaining movies of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's The Bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This late entry into the film noir genre has some harsh and memorable scenes and an ending unlike any other film noir. Of course, most of those weren't made during the A-Bomb scares of the mid 1950s, as this was.The movie features a tough, no-nonsense Mike Hammer-like private eye, played well by Ralph Meeker, whose tough-guy dialog is a little dated but still fun to hear. This is one of those noirs in which everyone is a tough-talking, tough-acting mug and one never knows who to trust. Except for Cloris Leachman, who is only in the first quick (but haunting) opening scene, the females in here are unfamiliar actresses but people with interesting faces and personalities.That opening with Leachman is a real attention-grabber and is one of the best starts I've ever seen in a crime movie. It's very creepy, as is the unique ending. I also appreciated the cinematography in here a lot more once the DVD was issued.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few B movies can enthrall the Noir enthusiast more than the insane inspiration of Robert Aldrich's bizarre amalgam of Noir/Sci-fi/Horror/Comedy---KISS ME DEADLY As wonderful as the visuals are in KMD--and they truly are amazing in their variety and creativity, and in the way some of them evoke a perfect Noir sensibility--And as terrifically complex and disorienting as the narrative can be---It's the characters that keep many of us coming back again and again.Ralph Meeker, as Mike Hammer, is a perfect embodiment of a detached, self-interested opportunist (who still has vestiges of humanity brought out by the sad and tragic "Christina"). He does a great job with offhand line delivery and is a unique member of the canon of Noir anti-heroes.Maxine Cooper--as Velda--is also sui generis in her way with dialog. The 'maypole' scene where where gradually reveals to Mike the names of two more 'persons of interest' is a case in point: an oddly phrased pseudo-poetic/playful performance. And who can forget Nick Dennis as Nick the mechanic ("Va-va-voom! Pretty Pow!!") a fully realized personage who idealizes his dashing friend and takes far too many risks to help him out. Nick's death is a still-shocking moments in a film of many delectable jolts. Fortunio Bonanova--the "poor man's Caruso" singing off-pitch to the great tenor's recording as Mike invades his apartment: this is the same actor who plays the singing teacher in CITIZEN KANE ("Impossible! Impossible!"). Gaby Rodgers: the seeming amateurishness of her acting is part of the character's duplicity. She's great: a small landmark in a long line of femmes fatales. The two Jacks, Lambert and Elam--their intimidation turning to screaming terror at the unexpected prowess of Mike Hammer (a nice re-tuning of Noir expectations). Albert Dekker--spouting frightening mythological imagery to an uncomprehending Gabrielle/Lily Carver. Wonderfully weasel-faced Percy Helton's unbearably real-sounding screams as Mike 'hammers' his hand in the desk drawer. And Juano Hernandez as boxing manager Eddie Yeager, who gets this memorable dialog exchange: Mike: "What did they pay you? I'll top it." Eddie: "You can't top this: they said they'd let me breathe." So many more small and unforgettable characters---not forgetting to mention Chloris Leachman as Christina, the girl who gets it all going?--They make the film add up to a three-dimensional, one-of-a-kind movie experience not to be missed or soon forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know whether the blame for this ought to rest on Spillane, Bezzerides, or Aldrich. Doesn't matter, there's more than enough to go around. It's unfortunate that this movie was "rediscovered" (I use the term with hesitation because I don't think it was ever discovered in the first place. Released, yes. Discovered, not quite) but even more unfortunate that it's received such a glut of critical attention lately. One of the "virtues" critics have been pointing out in this flick is what a great job it does capturing the "soullessness" and "spiritual vacancy" of 50s Southern California. One writer went so far as to liken Meeker to "Marlon Brando with the soul burned out of him." The problem is that the movie doesn't depict a soulless Los Angeles, but that it tries to depict a vibrant and lively LA and does so ineptly. Nick, the mechanic; the elderly Italian porter who gives Hammer a clue; the opera singing informant; the boxing manager; to a lesser extent, Velda, all these characters are lively and engaging and suggest a real humanity against this "soulless" backdrop. However, Ralph Meeker makes Mike Hammer about as interesting as a bag of doorknobs (betcha thought I was going to say hammers). The women characters are painted very shallowly and with trademark Spillane misogyny. I gotta say, I don't know exactly what that's about.These are broad complaints with the film. I've got a few very specific gripes, but they involve plot points, so be aware of spoilers below.First, the movie telegraphs just about every major event rather stiffly. Two seconds after Christina, the asylum escapee, says "If we don't make it to the bus stop . . ." viola, they are waylaid and don't make it to the bus stop. Every time the plot needs a forward push, Velda shows up and says "I got a few more names." Very convenient, very wooden, very unsatisfying.The dialogue is not stylized, it's unnatural. I would say that the delivery is bad, but I don't think this script could have been read well by anybody, which is to say Meeker and Cooper are not up to the task. I think one of the lowest moments comes at the end, when Dr. Soberin is warning Lily about the atomic pinata. In four lines, he piles on the allusion like cold cuts and mixes his metaphors like oil and vinegar to sprinkle on this ugly submarine sandwich of a scene. "What's in the box?" says Lily. "It's like Pandora's box," says the doctor. "You're like Pandora. Don't you know the story of Lot's wife? Please don't open the box, there's a Medusa's head in there. I'm barking like the three heads of Cerberus at the gates of hell." Well, maybe not that bad, but you can check the memorable quotes link for the terrible transcript. A smart mystery writer would limit the allusion to the one significant reference rather than trying to impress with the ridiculous repetition (Robert Parker titles one Spencer mystery "The Widening Gyre," then makes no further reference to this allusion throughout the two-fifty pages that follow).A final complaint is that there obviously wasn't much research done by Spillane or Bezzerides. Having the good cop Pat explain the entire atomic dilemma simply by saying "Manhattan Project. Los Alamos. Trinity," really sums up the problem. Rather than devising a clear plot, the writers opted to throw around a few atomic age buzzwords that seem to say something while saying very, very little. And then we end up with an image of the Malibu beach house exploding in the 1950s equivalent of a dirty bomb while a gut-shot Hammer clings to Velda in the waves. What is the parallel here? That the hardboiled Hammer will walk off his injury just as the fallout will roll off the back of this soulless Los Angeles?Idiotic. Reforget this rediscovered tripe and go rent "Out of the Past."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definitive Mike Hammer?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly starts out better than virtually any movie made in the 1950's--- Cloris Leachman is running down a deserted street barefoot in a trench coat and nearly creamed by Mike Hammer in his Jaguar. Then the film descends into a series of hits and misses--- the raw noir look is the glue that holds an increasingly audaciously convoluted plot together. Spillane's plot is on par with the worst Ramond Chandler film adaptation, so all you can do is watch it with your brain disengaged. That said, it has several nice touches: I love Hammer's ability to slide into some of the most awesome cars available in 1955 (the wrecked--ouch!-- Jag is swapped out for a ultra-cool black Corvette). The under-rated Ralph Meeker (examine his range in Paths of Glory; the guy could act) just might be the prototypical Mike Hammer... bitch slapping virtually anyone at the slightest provocation. Watch Hammer's face: this guy enjoys violence. He also takes an unbelievable amount of abuse in the course of the movie, getting beat up, shot and irradiated (!). Kiss Me Deadly ultimately falls apart from the crazy plot but earns points for it's sheer outrageousness. Watch it for how wild 1950's film noir can get, logical or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Modern for a 50s film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1950s standards this film is totally cutting edge. Just off the top of my head here is a list of things in this film that were VERY uncommon in the 50s: 1. African-Americans and non-Americans in several supporting roles 2. Main character has an answering machine (yes it's a giant wall-mounted reel-to-reel, but still..) 3. Location shooting (lots of exteriors and cool cars) 4. Risqué shots of bare legs, sexy actions by female characters, etc. It's implied the characters have a sex life (in most 1950s movies no one had sex EVER). 5. Violence - OK - there is no GRAPHIC violence, but lots of implied violence. Some of the camera angles are quite modern and unusual (punches into the camera, walking into camera to end scene, female character stepping over male characters outstretched legs, etc.) Censorship of EVERYTHING was the norm in the 50s. I don't know how this one made it past the censors but I'm glad it did - it's a quirky gem for film noir fans LK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this is top quality film noir, then film noir is overrated junk.Fortunately, this movie is not top quality film noir.Meeker is an unlikable Mike Hammer that makes Harry Lime look like Mother Theresa. Orson Welles made Lime interesting enough that you cared about him. I never cared whether Meeker's Hammer lived or died (though I knew he was going to live even after taking a bullet at point blank). At least when he gets shot the movie is almost over.I've never read any Spillane so I don't know how faithful the movie is to the book. I have to believe the books are better than this screenplay. Having read Chandler, Cain and Hammett, I know the movies don't always faithfully follow the novels but the spirit of the novels come through. But this movie feels like a bad TV show that gets a deserved cancellation after one week.Speaking of the ending, at least Tarantino had the good sense to never tell us what the glowing object in the briefcase was. Here, the atomic material burns Hammer on the wrist and later burns down the beach house after it "escapes" the magical container just by taking the lid off. And Hammer gets up after taking a bullet and finds Velda just in time before the house burns down. Maybe the ocean water combined with the radiation from the house cured the bullet wound.The opening with Cloris Leachman was interesting but it was all downhill from there. The plot turns were all telegraphed ahead of time and you know at the start of a scene if a character will get killed. Especially ridiculous is Hammer quickly escaping after being drugged. At least in Farewell My Lovely, Chandler had Marlowe struggle for three days after being drugged.The frustrating thing is that were moments that showed a sense of style and composition but they were fleeting and ruined whenever Hammer opened his mouth.The good news is that this was not the start of a Mike Hammer series - I think any studio executive that suggested a sequel was reassigned mopping the executive washroom and making coffee for the office. Wait, I wouldn't trust such a person to make coffee - it might be beyond their mental abilities.I give it 2 stars for the rare times the noir style started to show through. Unless you want to see how a good idea can be made into a bad movie, I would steer clear of this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this cinematic abomination, I felt embarrassed for anyone remotely associated with it, down to the Script Girl, Scene Dresser and the Caterer. One of the worst examples of noir as it's a watered-down version of the Genuine Article that makes clumsy, gratuitous use of early Cold War paranoia in a most cartoonish manner.Because of its weak script and maladroit direction, the performances of several usually competent actors (Ralph Meeker, Albert Dekker, Paul Stewart, Jack Elam, Cloris Leachman) are either sub par or wasted. Meeker tries to make a go of the Mike Hammer character, but he's too pudgy and soft-looking to be convincing in the role of red-blooded, iron-fisted tough guy. Since the script is so lame, ill-focused and full of extraneous padding, the motivations and actions of his character seem vacant or tentative. His brooding doesn't convey a sense of inner struggle, rather, he comes off as blank-looking and a tad dim. Also, as Hammer has his gun license suspended in the early going of the film, the character without the gat is like Jason Giambi off steroids.The film does not have enough plot or character development to justify its 100+ minute running time: as perhaps 20 minutes of the picture should have been left on the cutting room floor, the pacing of the movie is sluggish and its narrative management is meandering. There are dozens of very long takes in the film where not much is happening narratively: it seems that the characters are just Doing Things and Killing Time, merely fulfilling the duration requirements of a feature film.Too many of the film's undercurrents and plot twists are left unexplained. Perhaps this was meant to enhance the intrigue of the piece, maybe this was a tip of the hat to design features of the noir genre, i.e., evanescent and nebulous plot lines, contradictory narrative elements, etc., that add to the mystery of the story and suggest the nature of human reality (that matters don't always tie up at the end into a neat bundle). But I think not: this is just a case of a sloppy, wheezy and ill-managed script not delivering on the responsibility of bringing the audience sufficiently into the loop.What I found particularly annoying was the insistence on including in the cast ethnic types with bogus foreign accents, jabbering away in an over-the-top fashion. This happens in three instances. Equally annoying was Meeker's/Hammer's habit of drinking out of other people's glasses, taking cigarettes out of other people's pockets, etc.The handling of the "whatsit" (some sort of vague nuclear material) was pretty hokey, too. Naive and magical treatment of the film's central narrative motivation that was laughable in its implausibility. It was never explained how the Cloris Leachman character got tied up with this atomic intrigue, nor was the justification of crime figures' interest in the black market material. We can make assumptions on the second issue, but the first truly exercises the audience's suspension of disbelief.Extremely lame ending, too. Hammer, with a slug in him, and Velda waltzing about in the surf while maverick nuclear material merely burns down the beach house. Right. No thought of the ensuing contamination, obviously, by the writers, director and producer of this piece of crap. Also what was truly rich in this regard was the scene at the health club when Hammer opens the box for the first time and is left with a burn on his wrist. No radiation sickness ensues. Right. And just what is that magic box made of that it can contain such virulent material? And the film just kinda ends, somewhat arbitrarily, immediately after the big Hollywood special effects finish. No narrative rundown, no suggestion of what would likely to come next. The incomplete feel to the ending makes one think that maybe they just ran out of film stock at that point.Also, the women in this flick, excepting Ms. Leachman, are pretty beat up looking. If you're going to have starlets in eye candy, window dressing roles, at least get some babes who look like something. That sweaty actress who played Velda was built like Marcel Marceau and looked like she needed a good bath.The only positive attributes of this film were technical issues and style points. Some of the scenes were very well composed and shot, there was some good camera movement and the lighting was indeed top notch. The art direction did capture that cheezy mid-1950s feel and the flick was indeed atmospheric, but these are ancillary concerns in relation to the primary purpose of film-making, i.e., storytelling. Loved that 1955 (1954?) Corvette Hammer drove, though...I saw this film last evening at a theater in downtown Manhattan: most of the audience was laughing out loud at how dreadful this picture is, and there was a palpable sense of relief in the auditorium when it ended.But all these negatives aren't particularly surprising when you consider who directed this fiasco. Robert Aldrich made a career of writing, directing and producing really lame, stupid, unbelievable and unconvincing films, and this tepid attempt is typical of his third rate oeuvre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Hammer (played flawlessly by Meeker) gets shoved off a cliff, wrecked, set on fire, slugged (several times), blackjacked, attacked with a switchblade, tied up, drugged, burned by radiation and shot in the stomach. On the other hand he savagely bitch slaps a bunch of folks, blows off frequent come-ons from several women, mostly very attractive (well, it appears that he blows them off), and is still breathing (barely) at the end. This is an ultimate "B" movie that's fortunately just been featured by TCM - low budget, great characters, nice street scenes, semi-cheesy dialogue, everybody's a little shady even the stars. The plot never lets up leading to a truly bizarre and memorable climax. For what this movie tries to do it is right on target, which is all you can ever really ask. That's Wesley Addy, overworked and destined to give the wrong anesthetic to the poor victim in "The Verdict" nearly thirty years later, playing the obnoxious police detective in this one.</fullReview>

I would disagree with a previous comment that Robert Aldrich was an unknown Director. This was his first movie as a Director, but he was was on the fast track to becoming one of the best. Ralph Meeker who plays the lead, was never in the first tier of leading men, but personally one of my favorite "wise guys" who could compete with Bogart's Sam Spade. Meeker was physically more intimidating than Bogar tor any of the other tough guys of the film noire era with the exception of Robert Mitchum. Meeker was not one dimensional. In Paths of Glory, Kirk Douglas defends an innocent enlisted man picked to die as an "example" to maintain discipline. It was Meeker's role in this great film that convinced me that he deserved greater critical acclaim.Meeker is a perfect Micky Spillane. He's tough, irreverent, and a convincingly shady character out for number one, who uses his girlfriend/secretary in his private eye business like a pimp uses a prostitute. Alas movie fans, the heart of the private eye business is the divorce industry. Tawdry, boring and predictable, its a wonder so many films have glamourized the business. The exceptional facet of this film is the use of nuclear device as the object of everyone's affection. I believe its a first. Today's viewers may be a little jaded on that subject, but when this movie was first shown, it was a novelty. Today's viewer will have to excuse Spillanes's ignorance. Money, drugs jewels and possibly blackmail material could be hidden in a box, but after the Atom Bomb, detectives had to add nuclear material to their inventory. Ralph Dekker who plays Spillane's ultimate enemy plays a small part unless you count his blue suede shoes. ( I wonder if that was the incentive for Elvis's first hits?) Dekker was in a lot of films, usually as a bad guy with a lot of first line actors like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster. Gloris Leachman plays the opening of the movie and her career. Their are several other notable character actors with familiar faces but forgetful names who add color to this colorful movie in black and white shot in 6 weeks.If you enjoy action-adventure without political messages, watch this movie. If you want to see what men in the 50's wanted to drive, watch this movie. And just to show us that Spillane has a heart, you can watch him save his girl after being shot by a .38. What a tough guy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It works as an artifact of its time, but fails as a compelling movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everything in this whodunit, aside from a glowing McGuffin and a few bits of meta-commentary on its pursuit, was clumsily done. The lead, Mike Hammer, was a lumbering dullard whom we were lead to believe possessed a roguish appeal to everyone he encountered. It was insultingly implausible. He made Arnie's Terminator look soulful and charming. While his love interest may have been the movie's most stirring character, she didn't have much competition, and she also suffered from bad makeup that made her face look distractingly oily in most scenes. The worst was that his friends and acquaintances consisted mainly of insulting caricatures of foreigners who mysteriously found Hammer's mere block-headed presence an irresistible opportunity to produce a joyful gibberish of mangled English and eye-gougingly bad catchphrases. One was so bad I laughed when he died.There were some dizzying first-person perspective shots from the front seat of a convertible that were passably cool, and a genuinely scary one featuring a pair of naked legs. Another laudable, though still clumsy, aspect was its mid-1950s attempt to show a white man living at ease in a racially-integrated milieu.If there's anything now, though, to justify sitting through the movie's full 110 minutes, it's that the movie presents a list of evidence for the audience to weigh the merits of the Space Age's fantasies along with its attendant nightmares. Hammer's gadget-stocked bachelor pad and his sporty cars evidently stood in as heaven, reason enough for putting one foot in front of the other through the insensate, alcohol-fueled haze he lived in, while damnation was an ever-present risk of finding oneself burnt or burning in the flames created by an incomprehensible and alienating technology as it produced the set pieces of the aforementioned heaven.Given that today's fears consist not only of those deadly kisses offered by science but also the deadly copulation between an unresponsive and intrusive government and runaway corporate greed, the movie only partly works as a clue in our on-going whodunit as to how we got here. There's no shortage of hotter trails to follow, however, none of which include this unappealing cast of characters or the dull, spam-like visage of Mike Hammer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic noir that was light years ahead of its time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film opens out with a bang and never lets up for once. Neglected on its initial release, its this kind of film that influenced both Jean Luc Goddard and Quentin Tarantino, whose "Breathless" and "Pulp Fiction" respectively changed the way films were made for the decade. Its obvious audiences and critics of the time weren't ready for this kind of film. While I'm not sure if its the most well-made film noir, its certainly my favorite to watch. And like any truly great film, it becomes better and better with each viewing.One aspect that was so ahead of its time was the protagonist. Mike Hammer, as played by Ralph Meeker, is one of the most unsavory "heros" ever in a film up to that time, yet was still a multi-dimensional and interesting character. The aforementioned "Breathless" was obviously influenced by this, which lead to the creation of the modern anti-hero (along with "Yojimbo"). The combination of the expressionist direction of Robert Aldrich and misanthropic screenplay by A.I. Bezzerides perfectly show why Film Noir is such an unique American creation. Robert Aldrich later went on to direct the very popular "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" and "The Dirty Dozen", but this remains his best film.However, past all the importance and influence, its great and quickly paced entertainment. If you have any interest in film noir, you owe it to yourself to check this out, one of the last masterpieces of the genre. This is one of those rare films that becomes better and better with each viewing. Plus, if the briefcase seems a bit familiar, try to recall a certain Tarantino flick from 1994. (10/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding 1955 Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always enjoy any film dealing with the Mike Hammer character and for some reason missed viewing this film and was completely taken by surprise at how violent and cruel this film was for the Year 1955. Ralph Meeker, (Mike Hammer), "Winter Kills" gives an outstanding performance who stops for a woman running straight down a dark road with only a trench coat and nothing on underneath. This gal, was Cloris Leachman who managed to get Mike Hammer deeply involved with a very interesting story. Albert Dekker, (Dr. G.E. Soberin), "Suddenly, Last Summer", plays a very sinister role along with Paul Stewart, (Carl Evello),"SOB",'91, and both of them manage to use all kinds of tortures to accomplish their goals, a pair of pliers on a sweet young gal. There is a secret that is revealed at the ending of this picture which will blow your Mind Away. Enjoy this really great film from 1955 which was really way a head of its times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>edgy, violent '50s noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, I have always found Ralph Meeker sexy, and he is hot as all get-out as Mike Hammer in "Kiss Me Deadly." He's very Brandoesque, and in fact, followed Brando as Stanley Kowalski in Streetcar on Broadway. He makes a tough Mike Hammer in a tough movie that doesn't let up on the violence or the sexual innuendo. I was never sold on Spillane himself as Hammer and I actively hated Stacy Keach in the TV series, which seemed a little too macho and chauvinistic for the times. In the black and white '50s, it feels just right, if a little more brass knuckles than other films in the genre.Hammer spends the movie trying to find out the secret that a hitchhiker (Cloris Leachman) was killed for, and all she's left him is a clue, "Remember Me." As people die to the left and right of him, Hammer can only hope he's left standing by the end of the movie.The ending was very tense and exciting, although I don't believe it was very realistic. At that point, it almost takes on the ambiance of a horror film.Robert Aldrich gives the film a very fast-paced direction and wonderful atmosphere. Leachman is "introduced" in this film, and she's recognizable immediately. Gaby Rodgers as Lily gives what can only be described as a bizarre performance. Leachman is really the only likable, sympathetic character in the film. Of note is the early version of an answering machine, which I either saw in one other film, or I saw this movie before - but it's great, an old reel to reel tape recorder mounted on a wall.One thing I wondered about - when Hammer is being followed at night, the clock says 2:15, so one assumes it's 2:15 a.m. But it seems like everyone is awake - when he gets to the apartment house, the landlord is cleaning the room out and an old man is bringing in a trunk. The clock is in several shots - it says 2:20 also, I believe - so it's not a mistake. Hmmm. Perhaps I missed something, so distracted was I by steamy Ralph Meeker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie last week after, literally, waiting two years (though I must admit those years seemed short). Anyway, I was hugely disappointed. My interest was stirred when I saw a magazine that talked about the 50 greatest TV shows of all time and, under the original Dragnet entry, it stated that the director of this movie learned a few things from the Dragnet show in filming this so-called "film noir." But that is an insult to Webb. This movie is simply horrible. It is very tediously directed, as is exemplified by the relentless and irritating breathing of the unrecognizable Cloris Leachman during the opening credits. Also, Mike Hammer in this movie is flat and boring--just plain tired. The idea that this movie is a film noir is outrageously absurd. Film noir's are supposed to be hard-boiled, dark, realistic, and starkly filmed. But the look of this movie is extremely bright, there is too much tenderness (particularly between Hammer and his annoying car-mechanic friend), and it becomes a sci-fi flick in the last few minutes. Also, the oh-my-God turn of events at the end of the film (with a lady that Mike Hammer first believes is innocent), is a total insult to the intelligence of the viewers. Finally, the way Mike Hammer escapes from the hotel after being drugged is a complete joke. Avoid this movie at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Hammer is driving down a dark highway when a half naked blonde forces him to stop, this event sends Hammer spiralling on a journey that may have a cataclysmic consequence for all involved.Kiss Me Deadly is a harsh movie, it contains an array of characters that are dislikable in the extreme, nobody can be trusted, and everyone on the surface appears to be selfish in their respective motivations. Taking in torture, murder, violence on tap, and a wonderful mystery plot, it's not hard to see why the film has gained a massive reputation as the years have rolled by, where although it's brutish in substance, the film is a damn riveting piece of work.Ralp Meeker is excellent as Hammer, a character who refuses to lay down, he gets knocked down constantly, but he gets back up tougher than before, he becomes the kind of hard boiled guy who hits first and then asks questions later. The direction from Robert Aldrich is perfect, off- kilter camera work drags the viewer into this skew-whiff world that Hammer has entered, and we often only see shots of the bad guys torsos so as to make them faceless thugs. It's down right aggressive film making that hits the requisite thriller mark.Kiss Me Deadly has influenced many others since its release, be it Repo Man or Pulp Fiction, its impact is still being felt today. Containing a much talked about ending (both the restored and alternate endings work on differing levels to many), it's a film that leaves things up for discussion and debate, but what we do know for sure is that it's explosive and crowns what is now firmly established as a crime classic from the film noir splinter of film making styles. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing I can say about this tedious film is that the lighting and set design were really enjoyable. I loved the dark streets and those endless staircases throwing shadows of the banister rails on the walls. The cars were out of this world and made me almost weep with nostalgia. However, for this kind of film Mike Hammer's penthouse pad was a bit out of place.Now for the gripes: some of the actors were so grating and over the top that I can only assume they were graduates of the Strasberg school of bad acting, or that they had been told they were in a comedy. Most irritating was the noisy mechanic, so much so that I was relieved when someone dropped the car on him and put us out of our misery. Next to him was Gaby, who seemed to be giving her impersonation of Shelly Winters in 'A Place in the Sun.' I could not concentrate on anything but Velda's lacquered hairdo and wondering why she was sweating so much, and were the 50's women so stiff and awkward when kissing a man? Add to them a host of TV actors, the whole film looked like a cross between the Outer Limits and 50's TV Detective show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly is an exceptionally gripping adaptation of Mickey Spillane's famous novel of the same name. It's brutal, surreal, gritty and intelligent. In fact, it's everything that you'd expect, and get, from Spillane's hard-edged, graphically violent novel.Kiss Me Deadly stars actor Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer, a hard-boiled, one-dimensional, Private-Eye doing his investigating thing on the shady side of town, cruising along the streets of San Francisco.Meeker is superb as the rugged, callous, womanizer named Mike Hammer. I don't think I've ever seen any other actor portray shallowness and brutality so brilliantly as Meeker does in his character as Hammer. His performance is truly a splendid display of refined apathy and cynicism that goes far beyond the expected.Kiss Me Deadly's story unfolds one hot, summer night on the outskirts of town.While cruising along the open high-way, at break-neck speed, Mike Hammer suddenly steers his cherished convertible into a massive skid, nearly losing control. Hammer's wheels screech, like pure pain, along the dark pavement as he attempts to avoid hitting a young woman dressed only in an over-sized trench-coat, standing right in the middle of the road, frantically trying to wave someone down for help.Cutting a brutal path through the city's sleazy underside, Hammer soon uncovers a mysterious, black container whose extremely deadly contents triggers a horrifying, apocalyptic climax that is a real visual stunner in its execution. Pandora's Box has now been opened, unleashing a virtual "Hell-On-Earth" doomsday that Mankind can neither stop, nor control.Filmed in b&amp;w, Kiss Me Deadly was directed by Robert Aldrich whose other notable films included The Dirty Dozen and Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film. Full of Spillane's touches and excesses and featuring a brilliant performance by Ralph Meeker as the quintessential anti-hero Mike Hammer, a thug for every occasion. Trouble is that there is much anti-Spillanestuff going on too. Director Aldrich hated Spillane's book so much he played around with it and turned it into a kind of satire on cold war thrillers and Eisenhower era attitudes. The film portrays Hammer as a real sleaze bag with no redeeming features. OK, the Hammer of the books wasn't a nice guy but Spillane knew that, Aldrich misses the point somewhat by turning into a character to loathe whereas the literary Hammer always has a side of him you can identify with, even if you don't like to admit it. Aldrich redeems himself with some fantastic direction and some solid story telling. This a great latter day noir, though not as good as the first version of 'I, The Jury' made a few years earlier.</fullReview>

I had a hard time with this film. I did like the dark elements, low key lighting, how the tone of the movie was good. It had a dark feeling to it which corresponds with the films plot. The music was too over the top for me. So overly dramatic to the point that it came across as corny. There is something about the acting that just kept me unfocused. It was dull and boring. The conversation don't flow, overall it just looks fake and really takes away the verisimilitude of the film. I payed more attention to the setting of the scenes than to the films plot.

		<shortDescription>Noir Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly(1955) is symbolic of the maturing and final stages of a genre that was dying out. A 1940s style mystery with a 1950s sensibility. Kiss Me Deadly(1955) is one of the top films of the late noir period. Outstanding motion picture with the ability to amaze and shock any viewer.Mike Hammer is the ultimate anti-hero in both film and literature. In the film, Mike Hammer is a detective who specializes in divorce and blackmail cases. What I find fascinating about Mike Hammer after reading I THE JURY, MY GUN IS QUICK, &amp; VEGENANCE IS MINE is his main motivation for going into a case is revenge. Mike Hammer is thus a modern version of the Italian Western anti-hero(Mike Hammer is in my book a major influence for many of the famous characters of Italian Westerns during the 1960s to 1970s).The direction is taut and the story is spellbinding to follow. Robert Aldrich creates an atmosphere of greed and paranoia with some fantastic use of the camera. The acting and direction supplement each other to contribute in creating an excellent motion picture. Solid visual storytelling by the director to make things alluring.It is an unique feature because it deals with the fear of nuclear bombs and nuclear war. The Cold War plays a major factor in the film's mystery and plot. Best symbolizes the fear felt by many people of a nuclear disaster that could happen at any moment. Its Cold War theme would be used in Mulholland Falls(1996) without the same symbolic complexities.Of all the actors who have played Mike Hammer, Ralph Meeker is someone who descriptively, stylistic, and visually a faithful adaptation to the Mike Hammer of Mickey Spillane's novels. Ralph Meeker portrays Mike Hammer better than any other actor who has played this brutal and ruthless literary detective. Ralph Meeker gives a terrific performance as he portrays Mike Hammer with a brutish quality that is retained from the original source. There are not many actors who could portray Mike Hammer violently convincing as Ralph Meeker does here.Kiss Me Deadly(1955) as with The Big Heat(1953) was unusually violent for the period it was made. Most of the violence happens in an implicit fashion but still makes an impression on anyone who has watched the movie. The violence in Kiss Me Deadly(1955) errupts like a volcano and freezes like ice. Indication of the slow increase of violence in film that reached an accelerated pace during the late 1960s.The mystery of the black box is an important sub plot that doesn't enter the frame of the story until the final act. The black box almost becomes a MacGuffin where in small instances it takes away the focus of the main idea. This sub plot is another layer to the film's labyrinthine story. The mystery of the black box influenced Alex Cox for Repo Man(1982) and Quentin Tarantino for Pulp Fiction(1994).Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly(1955) concludes with a nerve tingling apocalyptic finale. The ending descends into Science Fiction territory akin to Hammer Science Fiction. Disturbing set piece that symbolized what everyone during the 1950s feared the most. The story's apocalyptic ending is full of bibical and Greek tragedy references.The relationship between Mike Hammer and his beautiful secretary, Velda has an ambiguous complexity that is the most interesting aspect of the Mike Hammer stories. Mike Hammer has sensual feelings for Velda but pulls back or is uncomfortable with having anything serious with Velda. Maybe due to the fact that every woman Mike Hammer in previous stories was involved with usually got killed. The first exchange of dialogue between Mike Hammer and Velda is a perfect example of their relationship in Kiss Me Deadly(1955) as well as in the rest of the Mike Hammer stories.This is the best adaptation of a Mickey Spillane novel. Depiction of corruption, greed, and power is given a strong treatment in the hands of a brilliant filmmaker. An all around great motion picture from the fabulous opening to the explosive closing. Kiss Me Deadly(1955) gets a solid performance from Albert Dekker(has little on screen time) as the main villain who sounds more like a philosphical poet than a vicious villain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Low rent private detective Mike Hammer picks up a hitch hiker on his way home late one night ? a desperate young woman who has just escaped from somewhere. They talk for a while but their car is ambushed and he wakes up days later in the hospital with only vague memories. Curious as to who she was he starts to dig, the more he finds the more he realises just how big the truth could be.This film always bugs me a little ? the ending is iconic and the film itself seems to have a very high reputation with film lovers and professional critics but I struggle to see it when I actually watch it. The plot is a solid noir with clever (unexplained) touches that make it stand out, but the actual detective story is pretty impenetrable and doesn't make a great deal of sense ? I didn't get caught up and get breathless with the investigation simply because a lot of it didn't make sense. This really takes away from the film.It does look fantastic though despite this. The cinematography is excellent and has plenty of really well framed shots. The use of black and white is good, with shadows used to typical noir effect but with unique and clever touches. The opening credits are excellent ? the breathless pants of a woman are mesmerising ? and the ending is different enough to stick in your mind (everyone knows it due to Pulp Fiction now anyway!). However the film's flaws are too great in the area of plotting and performance. I don't actually mind watching a slightly confusing noir with workmanlike acting when it is a B movie, but it's the lofty idea of itself that this film seems to have that really makes me less forgiving.Aldrich seems to bless his film with a sense of self importance that is not justified and doesn't sit well with the genre. The cast don't help ? none really stand out and, although there are no bad performances, there are few that could be described as anything other than workmanlike or average. Meeker is pretty solid but that's his character ? all he has to do is be a big lug because that's what his character is ? in fact it's a big point that he is not a nice guy in any sense. That said, it would have been nice if he could have been a little more complex a guy.The ending IS memorable and pretty out there for the period and the genre, but this does not excuse a film that fails to rive itself forward and keep you gripped. It looks great and has several really good touches but generally it is uninvolving and pretty average ? the fact that it takes itself to be serious and worthy just seems to damage it all the more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.There's nothing more invigorating like true noir, and there are very, very few of those. This is one that ranks with 'Touch of Evil' and 'The Long Goodbye.'Good noir is not a matter of tough talk and dark shadows. It is a matter of the writer apparently losing control to a capricious goddess who is cruel and inscrutable. The angles and light are only an indicator that the narration is no longer in control of humans.This has it, and dames too, though there's a misogynistic denial until the girl is in trouble. Lets see: Mike is beaten and set afire as his car is thrown over a cliff, he has a bomb put in his car, he is beaten again (and again), his best friend is killed, he gets probably fatal radiation poisoning. All because of something 'out there' which is a little sullied at the end because it becomes partially identified as that 'radiation' force which in 1955 stilled seemed magical, superlogical.In projects like this, the women are halfway between the reality of the story (that reality where people get beaten) and the off-world reality that the magical goddess behind the curtain inhabits.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there have been at least one he at film noir every year between 1944 and 1957, it was getting past the golden years when legendary director Robert Aldrich stepped in and created this sleeper masterpiece. It's a Mike Hammer caper, joining him with Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade as a name who would become legendary in that genre. An incredibly macho performance by Ralph Meeker as Hammer adds his name to the list of all the great brooding, strong but basically quiet anti-hero. And at the forefront of this melodrama? None other than the versatile Cloris Leachman, as far from Phyllis Lindstrom, Frau Brucher and Nurse Diesel as you can get!Highly complex, this starts with Hammer forced to stop for the fleeing Leachman in the first 5 minutes so he doesn't run her over. He would have been lucky had he done that because the journey he ends up on is as dangerous as any film noir caper that you could imagine. Voices are heard, faces are not seen, yet the plot thickens into a stew that would clog the drains of the man made Los Angeles river. Highly complex yet never convoluted, this is a thinking man's noir, a dark vision of society so ugly that it appears to be much more modern than it is. The masterminds of crime here are not playing around, and several truly brutal murders draw Meeker further in to the web of danger. An incredible array of character players join in to provide a chilling atmosphere that turns the streets of L.A. into a dark vision of hell where no tinsel can be lit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could fairly be deemed as fascist-noir. If often misogynistic, noir is rarely this brazenly phalocentric. Mike Hammer (yup, really the character's name) is a seducer of women and abuser of both genders. The audience is to applaud his every bullying gesture. The many women in the film exist to move the plot along and/ or to worship Hammer as a sex-God. He, like all good entrepreneurial Americans, is humbled only when he learns that some "alien" may be getting its hands on the destructive power that America alone is "supposed" to wield. Having said all that, I must guiltily confess my love for this film. Shot, it seems, almost entirely on location, it transports one to the lost LA of the early '50s. And, if Hammer, um, rams his way through all forms of otherness, he still encounters many forms of it on a dazzling tour through the underbelly of 1950s American urbanity. For all that is reactionary about the film, it contains strikingly unracist depictions of African-Americans compared to many other films of its era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Mickey Spillane in atomic shape this is a great thriller to watch. The story is build up around the search for the great "whatsit". The tempo is high in this dark and intriguing story. Ralph Meeker does a high class performance as Spillane's tough private eye, Mike Hammer. Add to that a wonderful lineup of great character-actors like: Albert Dekker, Strother Martin, Percy Helton, Jack Elam and Paul Stewart. There are also some amazing cars and beautiful women. Great entertainment, directed by one of the true masters of the trade: Robert Aldrich. As a bonus we can hear the man with the velvet voice, the unforgettable Nat Kong Cole sing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delicious Film Noir Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you hear the title Kiss Me Deadly and begin to enthusiastically sing the chorus of Lita Ford's super-de-duper 1980s hit of the same name, consider that the film Kiss Me Deadly is not soaked with hairspray, musical production echoes, or unironic leather. It's not a cringeworthy exercise in sweaty nostalgia; it's a fundamental work of film noir. I throw the term "film noir" around in reviews quite often, sometimes seriously and sometimes comparatively. But Kiss Me Deadly is not slight nor an imitation of the genre: along with The Big Sleep, Raw Deal, and The Third Man, it is one of the defining films of the era. Yet it subverts conformity like the plague. Sleazy private eyes and gun-toting broads are fun and all, but what if you suddenly want to embark on a wildcard journey into what resembles an abstract Lichtenstein painting? Don't listen to the crowd; just do it.The film opens in typical noir fashion. The setting is a kettle-black road in the middle of nowhere, cars zooming in-and-out with the frequency of a moviegoer seeking out Sylvester Stallone's newest movie. But cracking the deadly calm of the shot is a frantic blonde, barefoot, dressed only in a white trenchcoat. Desperate for someone to hitch her out of the nightmare she's living, she lunges in front of a speeding convertible. Inside this convertible is Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker), a detective. The woman, Christina (Cloris Leachman), has just escaped from a local mental institution; but being caught by her doctors seems to be the last of her worries. Someone, or something, is bothering her.But her worries become a reality when a group of thugs block the road, knocking out Hammer and brutally murdering his passenger. The next day, he awakens in a hospital bed; paramedics discovered him, his car, and Christina's body residing on a rocky cliff in the early hours of the morning. Despite almost being killed in the violent series of events, though, Hammer is intrigued. Christina, it seems, was part of something bigger, something more threatening. Without hesitation, he takes the case. But as it develops, it becomes quite clear that it isn't going to pass by with the sinfully simple workings of the divorce cases Hammer usually supervises.Kiss Me Deadly has all the usual noir touches, but there's something compellingly, and unusually, artificial about the atmosphere. Everything looks as though it's part of a set (most likely due to the film's microscopic budget), but its cheapness, purposeful or not, establishes the tone even more than the material. Unlike other film noirs of the time, Kiss Me Deadly doesn't take itself seriously (even if the characters hardly ever crack a smile). It exists in the same universe as a comic strip that stars a Man with X-Ray Eyes or a bloodthirsty Martian disguised as a sex goddess. The film is distinctly fantastical; while The Big Sleep slithers by with witty dialogue and lethal underbellies, Kiss Me Deadly seems to have more in common with Attack of the 50-Foot Woman. This shouldn't suggest that it's a shoddy film; it should suggest that it's in love with itself, fond of its penny dreadful exterior, and isn't afraid to push much of its mystery onto a strange box that kills every person who opens it.When I watched Kiss Me Deadly for the first time, I didn't understand its critical acclaim. Yes, it's good, but what does it have to offer that other run-of-the-mill film noirs couldn't? Years later, my appreciation has risen by several miles. It isn't so much that Kiss Me Deadly is of superior quality; it's that it is just so, so, so ... otherworldly. Not otherworldly like the mansion Jesus probably lives in up in Heaven or Margot Robbie's beauty, but otherworldly like the realm you might find yourself in if a mirror was a door. The film is of scrumptious pulp quality, unmatched by its peers. Every scene looks like a comic book frame, every character is stock (but not quite). The poster promises "blood-red kisses!" and "white-hot thrills!" And with its campy priorities in mind, it delivers those promises with a wink and a healthy serving of idiosyncrasy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ultimate noir that has got everything - and wasn't even intended to be anything special. There are no great stars in it, and yet the acting transcends most contemporary star movies. Yet the prize goes to Marion Carr as the girl Friday. She didn't make many pictures, but her performance here secured her a place in film history, a simple girl with the wrong connections who constantly gets more entangled in her own fate as a hopeless victim of circumstances and her own desperate efforts to get to the top of her troubles, which only maximizes them, in a complex character of some kind of mixture between Judy Holliday and Kim Novak in "Vertigo". A special tribute goes for the music with its many variations, from Nat King Cole to Schubert, Brahms and Chopin, and a splendid blues singer (Mady Comfort) on top of it. The script and dialogue is virtuoso all the way, the action serves you constant refreshing surprises, and every character is clearcut and convincing, especially the girls. The hard-boiled story is intermixed with poetry, Italian opera and tragedy, Nick Dennis stands for the tragic part in shockingly upsetting injustice, and it all mounts up to the great mystery of 'the great what's-it' in a grand finale, greater than any opera. In brief, this is a noir for all times and so surprisingly modern at the same time, that it has the strange ability of getting better with age and each time you see it, which reveals new fascinating details of it to remember. A full score of 10 was seldom more obvious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No need to recap the plot (even if I could) or echo some of the more obvious details.Notice how no one stops to help poor Christina as she runs down the street frantically at movie's opening. Instead cars whiz by, until Hammer almost wrecks his snazzy car trying to avoid her. In fact, there's not an overload of compassion anywhere in this brutal noir classic.As I recall, critics of the time reviled it for the unremitting violence and lack of heroics. At the same time, in years of movie watching, I've never heard screams of pain (e.g. Christina, Sugar Smallhouse) so convincing as here. They're almost too much to bear, which was likely Aldrich's intent. Add to the package a scummy, narcissist PI like Hammer, and you've got a melodrama unlike audiences of the time were prepared for. No wonder the movie bombed. (Two previous Hammer films had also disappointed Spillane fans-- I, The Jury {1953}, The Long Wait {1954})Except this movie was years ahead of its time in both style and content. Sure, the plot doesn't make much sense. There are threads, but they never seem to come together in coherent fashion. Instead, the money hungry Hammer keeps thrashing around in the dark like there's got to be a big payoff somewhere in the tangle he's got himself into. Self-assured to the hilt, he's not one for self-doubt or moments of contemplation. Instead, he bulls his way through every situation, heedless of what he's getting into. I expect folks looking for deeper meanings find plenty of grist with this. Then too, it's hard to say enough about actor Meeker's spot-on portrayal. His Hammer amounts to a guy you neither like nor dislike, but can't help watching anyway (his physical resemblance to Brando is almost astonishing).The visual style here is almost equally astonishing. Noir b&amp;w has never been photographed (Earnest Laszlo) more effectively than some of those night scenes (e.g. the brutal fist fight between Hammer and his attacker {Paul Richards}), plus the long, dark hallways and staircases that suggest an enclosed world without redemption. Then too, the exploding beach house is well done, though it goes through 4 or 5 increasingly violent blasts, making Aldrich's apocalyptic point, I guess.But it's not just Hammer and the thugs he's surrounded with. The women we see may be lovely or even beautiful (Carr), but none are to be trusted. Not even Hammer's Velda (Cooper), who, when you think about it, is his willing partner in the scummy infidelity scams that are his bread and butter. How many husbands, for example, has she seduced into grounds for divorce. It's not obvious, but there's a misogynistic undercurrent running through the narrative, which, I guess, is appropriate for the movie's generally nihilistic attitude. (Note how oblivious Hammer is to the grandeur of the classical music around him that keeps popping up in the screenplay. None of that sublime stuff for him.) No doubt about it, the movie may retain the raw violence and sex that made author Spillane's potboilers so popular in the 50's. But crucially there's no one to root for here, not even the Hammer of Spillane's Cold War novels who kills commies on sight. No, Aldrich's and screenwriter Bezzerides world is not divided into good and evil, in the way that Spillane's brutal Hammer is redeemed by fighting on the good, patriotic side. Instead, the Aldrich world comes across as a nihilistic one, without enduring values, one that can only be redeemed by apocalypse, nuclear style. No wonder the French glommed onto the film immediately. I'm sure those pessimistic themes fit perfectly with the existentialist topics then so popular among their artistic class.Anyhow, however you choose to take the 100-minutes?as a betrayal of the novels or as a somewhat profound gloss on the human condition-- the movie remains a memorable one-of- a-kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's in the box?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The old Schrodinger's Cat paradox - it has fueled many a MacGuffin from the Maltese Falcon to the mysterious suitcase in Ronin. But none are as breath-taking as the MacGuffin in Kiss Me Deadly.I'd never heard of this film before but I decided to give it a go because I love noir. It turns out that it's a highly-regarded classic of the genre and one of several featuring tough-guy private detective Mike Hammer.While driving around on a dark, lonely road Hammer gives a ride to a distraught woman wearing nothing but a trenchcoat. She has escaped from a nearby mental hospital but insists she was being held without reason. She teases Hammer with details of her fate before she is recaptured and tortured to death. Hammer is dumped down a cliff in his car with her dead body in the passenger seat.The cops are weary of his involvement in the murder but let him wade deeper. Hammer puts small pieces together and follows threads throughout the city, meeting a variety of seedy characters. It's here that the film lost me for a while. Despite the strong opening the middle section sags with far too many dialogue exchanges and not enough visual narrative. It feels slack and convoluted. But there is plenty of darkness, shadows, and gloom.In the final act the film changes into...something else. It gets very weird, and suddenly becomes very interesting again. By the closing moments your jaw will be dropping and mind boggling. It's seriously weird, but great. I think I might have to watch the last half hour to fully get my head around it. Film Noir is generally gloomy and depressing but Kiss Me Deadly has a pleasingly nihilistic and fatalistic split personality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reworking Spillane's Kiss Me Deadly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**** This review compares Mickey Spillane's book and the movie *****Kiss Me Deadly, the 1955 film version of Mickey Spillane's pulp classic, is one of those rare exceptions of a film adaption surpassing the original book. Mike Hammer, the protagonist, is a sleazy P.I. who specializes in divorce cases. This changes one night when he gives a ride to a hysterical woman with a deadly secret. Hammer and the woman are captured by some mysterious men, and, after getting tortured, they are put back in his car and rolled over a cliff. The woman dies in a ball of flame and Hammer miraculously survives. Similar to Spillane's other novels, this violent episode serves as the catalyst to a relentless story of revenge.The difference, though, between the movie and the book, lies in the secret that the woman holds. This important difference is the reason why Spillane's book is merely entertaining, while the film version of it is a trenchant critique on 1950s America. (Don't worry, Hammer's knuckle sandwiches and nymphomaniac girlfriends are still in practically every scene).Spillane's Mike Hammer stories are fueled by relentless pacing, over-the-top dialog, and raw, sadistic violence. Although they have a sordid appeal, it's hard to take them seriously because most of the time his written pyrotechnics seem like a ruse to get a rise out of the reader - and nothing much beyond that. Spillane's books are visceral and entertaining, but they lack profoundness. A writer like Dashiell Hammet, for example, was able to do both, in books like Red Harvest, which is about a private detective taking on an entire town of corrupt politicos and businessmen. He was a writer who could entertain you and make you think.Before I get into it, it would be helpful to mention a little film trivia which I gleaned off of IMDb and Wikipedia after watching the movie. For one, the movie was named by the Kefauver Commission, a federal unit investigating corrupting influences, as 1955's most corrupting influence on American youth. This came out at the height of cold war hysteria, when McCarthy was leading the nation on a witch hunt for commie pinkos collaborating with the evil Soviet empire. Also interesting, is that the movie was adapted for the screen by A. I. Bezzerides, a writer with purported leftist sympathies. Supposedly Spillane ran into Bezzerides in a restaurant around the time of the movie's release, and the two had an immediate dislike for each other - mainly because Spillane didn't like what was done with his book. It is also said that Bezzerides hated Spillane's book and rushed through the adaptation because he "had contempt for it". You'd think that two such clashing personalities would be a formula for disaster, but strangely Kiss Me Deadly the movie takes the best comic overtones of Spillane's work, and adds that "something" extra which makes it a film noir classic.The movie, directed by Robert Aldrich, left in the sadistic, womanizing Mike Hammer, and took out the clichéd mafia conspiracy at the heart of the book version of Kiss Me Deadly. In Spillane's book the investigation eventually centers on a missing narcotics shipment, but, in Bezzerides' screenplay, the narcotics shipment becomes contraband radionuclide - a glowing Pandora's box that when opened unleashes atomic hell fires.Bezzerides may not have been intentionally injecting "leftist" interpretations into the script, but he was a witness to the times, and anyone working in Hollywood surely was affected by McCarthyism and the threat of nuclear annihilation. What happens in Kiss Me Deadly is interesting because Bezzerides turned it from a cartoonish detective story into a topical story that captured the paranoid atmosphere of the times. Mike Hammer is still hilariously macho, but the essence of the story now centers on a mysterious box containing atomic destruction.What's more striking than that is the movie's climax. True to Spillane's "go out on a bang" formula, the movie ends with the atomic box being opened, an exploding house, and Hammer limping away with radiation burns and a bullet lodged in his gut. The movie ends on this climactic note, but it's obvious that this is one scrape Hammer won't survive. When reading about the making of this film, I couldn't help but think this was a subconscious change ideated by Bezzerides, to kill off Mike Hammer. Hammer is an egotistical bully whose modus operandi is blind rage, revenge, and the hope of a big "pay off". His fiery demise is his nemesis. Spillane for obvious reasons, would never have done that.If I have any gripe with this film noir classic, it would be that Hammer could have been more loyal to Spillane's vision. For one, Spillane's Mike Hammer is an unabashed "bedroom dick", a sleazy P.I. who makes a living doing divorce cases in which he gets his girlfriend to seduce wayward husbands. He's supposed to drive a "heap", not a hot rod like in the movie, and he certainly doesn't have all the latest modern accoutrements in his apartment - like the new-fangled answering machine which is highlighted a couple of times in the movie. The book also has Hammer in his native New York, but the movie takes place in Los Angeles. However, these are just a minor complaints, because, much more importantly, Hammer's insanely sadistic side is perfectly evoked, and the stark black and white of the movie make it suitably noir. Robert Aldrich's direction and Ernest Laszlo's great cinematography perfectly render the shadowy American underbelly of the 1950s.By taking Spillane's run-of-the-mill story and adding the element of atomic hysteria, Bezzerides and Aldrich turned this into a film with a deeper message. Mike Hammer is still a sleazy detective, he is still an entertaining anti-hero, but he can now be seen as a symbol for man's insatiable curiosity and greed, whose blind fury ultimately unleashes unknown powers on the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Noir--- Thumbs Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Kiss Me Deadly'' was ignored when first released but now seems to be a touchstone, a sacred object in the film world. 'Kiss Me Deadly' is the definitive, apocalyptic, nihilistic, science fiction film noir of all time at the close of the classic noir period. Being a huge fan of film noir I bet that this movie is a perfect example of this genre.People always talk about good endings in film and a lot of these films stick in the mind. By comparison, the beginning of a film is rarely talked about or remembered.The film opens with a striking pre-credits sequence. A pair of naked feet stumbles and runs down the middle of a lonely highway at night. A near-hysterical, panting, barely-clothed woman with closely-cropped hair who wears only a white trenchcoat, rasps and breathes heavily on the highly-amplified soundtrack as she helplessly tries to flag down passing cars that flash by her. Desperate to get one of the cars to stop she strategically positions herself in the middle of the road by standing and holding her arms out in a V as a two-seated Jaguar sports car/convertible approaches and blinds her in its high-beamed headlights. The driver swerves to avoid the apparition while applying his screeching brakes. His tires squeal as he pulls sharply off the road into a swirling cloud of dust and barely misses running her down. I consider it a perfect opening and the opening which is still talked about in the film circuits even today.Hard-hitting detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) takes on thugs and atomic secrets in Robert Aldrich's fast-paced thriller 'Kiss Me Deadly', an adaptation of the Mickey Spillane novel. The night goes awry for Hammer soon after he picks up a scantily clad hitchhiker (Cloris Leachman). The next thing he knows, he's assaulted by a couple of goons and the sultry drifter turns up dead. As Hammer tracks down the murderers, he realizes he is involved in an international conspiracy .'Kiss Me Deadly' boasts nightmarish imagery, a careening, sinuous plot and an unforgettable shock ending.Filmed in a scant three weeks, 'Kiss Me Deadly' was a late entry into the film noir genre, but it turned out to be one of the most memorable.It's pretty doubtful that anyone at the time realized how important Kiss Me Deadly would loom in coming years. It was lionized by French critics, hailed by French New Wave directors and went on to influence everyone from Martin Scorsese to Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh to countless up-and-coming directors. I recommend it to anybody who wants to understand just what the whole noir craze is about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is something of a museum piece looking back at it now--over 45 years after its release. The settings are fine and there's genuine mystery in the story. Unfortunately, it's weighed down by a penchant for death and violence that mars what could have been an excellent film noir effort.Ralph Meeker looks great as Mike Hammer and he plays it mean. This guy just doesn't care. But the writers have cut out his heart--and his brain. Heroes don't have to be nice guys--and Hammer is certainly not that--but when he stumbles out of a bar drunk to rescue his girlfriend, it's just not believable. OK, he's upset they've killed his friend, the ebullient Nick the mechanic--but up against a gang that's already erased half the cast--no way!There's a real 50's ending which we won't reveal here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ralph Meeker is Mike Hammer, Mickey Spillane's hard-as-nails private eye. He picks up a young woman on a deserted highway. At a pit stop, both are knocked out and shoved in Meeker's car over a cliff. Meeker survives, but the attempt to kill him has made him truculent.He spends the rest of the movie tracking down the evil doers. The following of leads gets him into trouble with Wesley Addy and the Los Angeles Police Department. It also takes him into contact with all sorts of bad guys, treacherous women, and odd balls. He is beaten once or twice. His car-mechanic friend, Nick the Greek, is killed. He slaps others around, beats some into insensibility.The wind up has something to do with a black box in the possession of Albert Dekker. A soft-eyed, winsome blond, Marian Carr, shoots Dekker and then wounds Meeker in order to take the box for herself, though she knows not what is in it.Meeker escapes as Carr opens the box and a tremendous scene follows in which whatever is inside the box hisses like a sea monster, emits a blinding light, turns Carr into a pillar of flame, and blows up the beach house.I understand the movie got all kinds of plaudits from the French critics of the period, and many others have found it pregnant with profundities. They got past my apperceptive apparatus. To me, the production was exactly what it was to its director, Robert Aldrich. "It's just a movie," he said.Ralph Meeker isn't a bad actor, although not very expressive. But the part doesn't call for sensitivity or subtlety, just a kind of muscular determination. The motive behind Meeker's pursuit? I don't know. Of course, someone killed a woman he'd picked up but so what? Mike Hammer don't hold no truck with sentimental attachments to strange broads. The other actors are seasoned. None turns in a poor performance. But the skill is wasted on a genre movie in which a PI walks and drives around Los Angeles contacting one threatening or frightened stranger after another. It's all been done before, and better. I'll mention "Murder My Sweet" and "The Big Sleep" in passing. Some scenes are ludicrous. It's a sunny morning. Nick the mechanic discovers a new Sportsmobile in front of Meeker's house. He adores it and begins talking loudly to himself, showering it with praises, gesticulating wildly all the while, musing at the top of his voice, "Should I tekk it for ah drive around da block?" Of course, this being a residential area of Los Angeles, the sidewalks are not only empty but sterile, so there's no one around to hear or see him behaving like a lunatic. The dialog lacks sparkle. There's not a memorable line in it.In Spillane's novel, the box was filled with drugs, not radioactive abracadabra. If it had stayed drugs, I'm not sure this movie would have gotten the attention it did in 1955.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While driving in a road nearby Los Angeles during the night, the divorce private eye Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) is forced to give a ride to a frightened woman that jumps in front of his car. The hitchhiker Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman) asks Mike to forget her, if they reach a bus stop; or remember her if they do not make it. Suddenly another car forces him to stop, Christina is tortured and murdered, and they are put back in Mike's car and dropped in a cliff. Mike survives, and when he leaves the hospital weeks later with his secretary Velda (Maxine Cooper), the police and some dangerous bad guys press Mike to tell what Christina had told him. Mike believes that Christina hide some treasure and decides to investigate what Christina had hidden."Kiss me Deadly" is a weird movie about greed and ambition. The lead character, Mike Hammer, is pulled into a whirlpool of lies and tragedies just because he believes that he may find a pot of gold in the end of a rainbow. However, he had the option to forget everything, but he prefers to find the Pandora Box. The content of the mysterious box seems to be uranium, but it is never clear. I do not know how lethal would be the exposition to its radiation, and whether a general contamination is spread when Gabrielle opens the box, but I believe the intention of the author is really to have an open end. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Morte Num Beijo" ("The Death in a Kiss")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that inspired "Chinatown"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: This review contains significant SPOILERS. As I was watching for "Kiss Me Deadly" today for the first time, I thought, this is the movie that inspired the look and feel of "Chinatown" more than any other. I even felt that Meeker's matter-of-fact performance as Mike Hammer may have inspired the creation of Jake Gittes, and influenced Nicholson's performance. How about that scene with a very young Strother Martin? I had to go back and watch the film a couple of more times before I realized that's who was playing the truck driver who accidentally ran down one of the victims. The film came out 60 years ago, but it does feel very modern. Some absurdities such as the fact that Christina was able to conceal the key while she was in the mental hospital, since she probably would have been unable to carry it in her stomach for that long without her body getting rid of it in the usual manner. Also, when Mike Hammer went to the morgue to look at Christina's body, it had theoretically been weeks since her death (per Lt. Murphy, in the hospital room scene at the film's beginning) yet Christina's face still looked pretty much as it had when she was alive. Not that it matters, but, did we ever find out how Christina got involved in the plot (the plot within the film, not the film's plot) to begin with? And, of course, what was the nature of what was "in the box" which was so unstable that it caused a nuclear explosion when opened, but could be hauled around in just a metal container and outer case which appeared to be leather, not lead?Ralph Meeker looked like Pat Boone, a bit, but he sure didn't act like him. He was quite a compelling anti-hero, but he met his match in Maxine Cooper, as Velda. I couldn't take my eyes off her during her scenes, and loved her dialogue, especially her references to "the great Whatsit."Cloris Leachman, 60 years ago, was feisty and charming in her brief role. Gaby Rogers, as Lily Carver, came across as a strange and campy presence in the film, but it was that very unreality that made her memorable. We didn't need to see Albert Dekker's face at all, because he did most of his acting with his detached and not-quite-human voice, like the great radio announcer in the sky. An altogether weird, offbeat, and striking film noir, an obvious inspiration to other directors and to many other films, and a film that every noir buff should see. Regarding the film's meaning, I'll leave that for another time. These are just first impressions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Film Noir, Among the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A doomed female hitchhiker (Cloris Leachman) pulls Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) into a deadly whirlpool of intrigue, revolving around a mysterious "great whatsit." The film withstood scrutiny from the Kefauver Commission (who investigated the mafia), which called it a film designed to ruin young viewers, leading director Aldrich to protest the Commission's conclusions. Today, the film is preserved by the Library of Congress. We can see who won in the long run."Kiss Me Deadly" remains one of the great time capsules of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills; the Bunker Hill locations were all destroyed when the downtown neighborhood was razed in the late 1960s.Homage is paid to the glowing suitcase MacGuffin in the 1984 cult film "Repo Man", the film "Ronin", and in Tarantino's film "Pulp Fiction". The "shiny blue suitcase" is referenced with other famous MacGuffins in "Guardians of the Galaxy". In the film "Southland Tales", Richard Kelly pays homage to the film, showing the main characters watching the beginning on their television and later the opening of the case is shown on screens on board the mega-Zeppelin.This is, indeed, the greatest of all private eye stories and film noir. With all due respect to such greats as "Asphalt Jungle", this is the real deal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>film out of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hard to get my head around this one. I can only guess how it played in 1955; today, it seems remarkably ahead of its time. While superficially nasty and vulgar (and quite violent for its time), a closer viewing reveals a film contemptuous of its own 'hero'. And rightly so. While Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe et al all have their moments of selfish, thoughtless amorality, Mike Hammer is little more than a crude, obtuse thug who goes through the movie never realizing what he is on to, endangering others while casually asking his bafflingly loyal assistant Velda to prostitute herself. All with a completely unearned sense of grievance. Director Robert Aldrich has too good a track record not to have known exactly what he was doing, though I'd wager few others realized it at the time. Here is a movie where the P.I. really should have stepped aside and let the cops do their job, as they actually had a clue what they were dealing with. But Hammer blunders ahead, and the result isn't pretty. Fantastic, completely over-the-top ending, both ridiculous and terrifying.Not quite top shelf noir, but still a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly is often regarded as a total classic; one of the ultimates in great film-noir. The word "influential" is one that you are going to read in every positive review of this movie you see, and I'm not going to dispute that specific claim about the film. What I will say is... I just don't find this film, standing on its own, to be very impressive.To be fair, I'll start with the things about this film that are good. The cinematography, for example, is interesting throughout and several shots were done very well. The cinematography easily stands out as the best part of this film. There are some shots here and there that I do not care for, but these are negligible compared to the amount of good ones.There are also some aspects of the story that I feel were interesting. The beginning of the film sets things up to have a lot of potential, opening very strongly. Sadly, it goes downhill from there. The writing, especially in regards to exposition, is just plain awful at some points.The worst example of this comes just after the excellent opening finishes, in which the main character is set up for an interrogation. What this turns out to be is three cops directly telling the viewer his life story, without having him answer a single question. When he finally asks if there is an actual reason for him being there, even the cops have no response and just let him go. This is one of the worst ways I've ever seen first act exposition done. It's cheap and silly.A close second for worst moment of exposition comes towards the end of the film, when the contents of the box are to be revealed. Now, never showing exactly what something is in order to let the viewer use their own imagination is a completely valid technique in film, but it only works when the viewer gets interesting hints and clues with which to base their explanation on. What the writer in this film gives us is a ludicrously silly word association game. Instead of cleverly weaving hints into the story, there is a moment where a character literally just lists a few spooky phrases like "Manhattan Project" and tells everyone to draw their own image up from the words. I can't believe more people aren't pointing scenes like this out when they are supposedly analyzing the intricacy of the story.Finally, I just found the entire second act of the story dull. You can have a great opening and a surprising finish like this movie does, but if the second act can't keep you interested, the whole story falls apart. The middle section mostly consists of the main character going to a place, talking to a person who refuses to cooperate, conveniently finding another bit of information anyway, and then going to the next person to repeat the cycle, of course being captured and escaping a few times along the way. It's a cookie cutter detective story at its most bland. I can't help but recall movies with a nearly identical structure, such as Fritz Lang's masterpiece "The Big Heat," in which the process is the same, but with so much more tension driving the story as it goes along. Big Heat admittedly doesn't even start out as strong as this film does, but its compelling second act makes the beginning and (already great) ending even better, which is just what Kiss Me Deadly fails to do.Overall, Kiss Me Deadly is not a bad film. It's entertaining to watch, and definitely very different from pretty much any noir you'll see with its unique third act. But there are just so many flaws with the story and storytelling that I can't see why this is held up by many as being one of the greatest of all time, even THE greatest to some.It's worth watching at least once, but if you're looking for a masterfully crafted work of art in the noir genre, I would personally say your time would be better spent on movies such as Orson Welles' "Touch of Evil," Billy Wilder's "Double Indemnity," and of course, the aforementioned "The Big Heat."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This might be the coolest movie that doesn't make any sense that I've seen in a long time. I really dig the noir genre, and this one had it going all the way until it U-turned into sci-fi territory with the first reveal during the gym locker scene, and then going all out at the finale. I would have gotten more out of the picture if the MGM DVD I watched offered English sub-titles, too many times the dialog was muffled enough that I probably missed some helpful narrative.I guess if you want to go the sadistic Mike Hammer route, Ralph Meeker did a decent enough job, but what I really think the screenplay needed was some of Bogart's repartee cracking wise with guys like the two Jacks - Elam and Lambert. There weren't any light spots in the story to render the players as having any dimension to their characters other than being good guys or bad guys. Except for va-va voom mechanic Nick (Nick Dennis), he was a trip. A little more nuance for someone like Lily Carver/Gabrielle (Gaby Rodgers) would have been welcome, so that by the time she went on her shooting spree at the end, we would have been more astonished by her actions.Still and all, I'm intrigued enough to watch this again while trying to block my memory of the nuclear stockpile in that little black box. What was that thing made out of anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Hammer, don't hurt 'em...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...a request that Ralph Meeker as Mickey Spillane's celebrated hard-boiled private-eye Mike Hammer patently turns down every time, it seems in this relentlessly tough, indeed brutal, but utterly brilliant movie, now seen by most film critics and commentators as the last hurrah for the film noir genre, I mean after this blood and guts-fest where else could it go?! Well, having paused only to pop my eyes into their sockets and my jaw back into place, I can only urge noir-lovers like myself, so long as they can stomach the violence overkill here to catch this film at the first opportunity as it's just such a bravura exponent of its type.With an unforgettable, get-your-attention-right- away start of the young Cloris Leachman, clad only in a knee-length overcoat, running barefoot down the freeway at night, resorting to extreme measures to flag down PI Hammer's car, continuing soon after with her gruesome murder (her bare legs dangling from who knows what until her bloodcurdling screams fade into black), our anti-hero is dragged into a maelstrom of death and violence in pursuit of the "Great Whatsit" as Hammer's secretary Velda understatedly puts it, which turns out in fact to be a highly unstable piece of radioactive ore with, it would seem a highly combustible component.From there, as Hammer follows the leads all the way up to the Mr Big who seemingly (but not quite, as it turns out) most wants the secret of the black-box, the bodies pile up with most of those not killed outright getting violently roughed up along the way.There are so many searing images and scenes from the movie, I could never get them all down, but the scene where Hammer jams the fingers of the unscrupulous pathologist who unwisely holds out on a vital piece of evidence from Hammer, to the elderly Sports Club attendant who demands cash for information about the locker which contains the box (everybody wants something for something in this film) and gets slapped about by Hammer and then laid out by the bad-guys for his trouble, to the incendiary conclusion with a wounded Hammer and his rescued secretary / girlfriend / prostitute (honest!) Velda knee-deep in the sea, looking back at the apocalyptic vision of Mr Mist's beach-house going up in flames.Aldrich doesn't stint in his portrayal of Hammer as a duplicitous, self-serving individual, taking advantage of any good-looking woman who comes onto him (although not the doomed Christine at the outset), having no qualms about pushing his faithful, doting Velda into all manner of honey-traps with cheating husbands to make his bread and butter living and able to deal out gratuitous violence with the worst of them - this is no lily-livered whiter-than-white latter-day shining knight. Good-looking and well dressed he may be, but as Christine says at the start, Mike's only in love with himself - he doesn't disagree.The dialogue is rich and multi-layered with apposite mythological ("Pandora's box"), biblical ("Lot's wife") and literary (Christina Rosetti's "Remember Me") references scattered around for flavour, together with the more traditional hard-bitten sound-bites you'd expect from a tough movie like this. The direction is superb, the camera mixing up all sorts of perspectives (long-shots, extreme close-ups (one of a gashed eye, through a door-pane being particularly memorable), off-centre viewpoints, about the only clichéd shots are a feet-only pursuit of Hammer by a would-be assailant, who gets dispatched head-first down a very long staircase, naturally.The acting is highly creditable too. I've never heard of Ralph Meeker but he's right up there with the best of the noir-detectives you'll ever find walking these mean streets. A pity for his sake that a sequel didn't follow, but then that would have detracted perhaps from the uniqueness of what we have here. The whole supporting cast, perhaps with the exception of a less-menacing-when-you-see-his-face Albert Dekker as head bad-guy Mr Mist, completely buys into the story lock stock, smoking barrels and all, leaving indelible impressions as they come and violently go.Incredible to think that director Aldrich got this on display at its time of release, although not, as I understand it, without the odd run-in with the censors and moral guardians of the day. How great that the original ending turned up in the vaults so that latter-day viewers can now drink in its restored glory this ultra-real, ultra-violent but ultimately ultra-brilliant movie that takes you by the scruff of the neck from the get-go and only lets you down battered and bruised, but hugely entertained some 100 or so minutes later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a really incredible opening. A speeding car rushes past a damsel-in-distress, she enters it and the title screen is projected through the car's wind-screen. Based on a Mickey Spilane classic, it chronicles Detective Mike Hammer's quest for a hidden suitcase with a deadly treasure. Some really strange characters appear (one of which is the Greek owner of a car repair shop and the ever appearing hero's paramour).The acting deserves a special praise. Ralph Meeker is excellent in the role of Hammer looking tough and cold. Nick Dennis, a veteran actor, adds up well to the film. Some of the smaller roles are also good especially the main villain who makes a brief entrance during the movie's finale.This movie is of course more than 50 years old, so it has to be said that certain of it's key concepts would be easily discarded today. Also it has to be noted that the pace slows down in the middle of the film and that the investigation takes way too long, gong from one character to another and confusing the viewer without any purpose or direction. But the strange and startling finale should make up for any plot inconsistencies.In all, anyone interested in pulp literature and films should watch this one. For all the others, suffice to say that weak points make their presence, sometimes loudly but can't erase the strange sensation this movie brings to the audience. Though a similar film made today might have been completely different (with less investigation and a longer and better defined finale) even time can't beat up Spillane's dark humor and Aldrich's atmospheric sequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful, passionate acting! Crackling dialogue most the time! Tension like an overhead high voltage wire! The then brand-new Chevy Corvette never looked better nor so modern! Superbly atmospheric black and white cinematography with cant angle shots a la "The Third Man". A soundtrack that is an exemplar for how to do sound- it pushes the film forward in a naturalistic manner.So why do I only rate "Kiss Me Deadly" seven out of ten? Because this film is a scriptwriting lesson in getting characterisation spot-on, getting dialogue spot on, and even getting the major plot points about okay, in a convoluted, film noir sort of way. But.. and it's a big but.. despite being at the height of the cold war, the plot is really just too far fetched, and worst of all, the ending just simply ends - right in the middle of the action. That's it. They couldn't wait to get the end-title up. I realise why they did it that way, but it defies all conventions of good plotting. Let the audience out of the picture; tie up the loose ends; get out gracefully. I guess there just was hardly anyone left alive to bother with loose ends - but this film, for all its strengths, marks a transition point in Hollywood between the classic "old" studio system pictures and the mess that the industry was to end up in, by the time the 1960s hit.Nevertheless, "Kiss Me Deadly" has some of the most wonderful, spell-binding performances you're ever likely to see on the silver screen. Here is a film that everyone really tried to do something with (starting with opening credits that have to be read bottom up!) and in large measure they succeeded. Terrific! Just that there was nothing left (literally) to think about when the theatre lights went up after the end credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiss Me Deadly- The Best Hammer Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those flicks I watch over and over again. Despite minor gripes (Hammer in L.A., no fedora, a bit too opportunistic for Hammer),there hasn't been a Spillaine movie this good since then. Ralph Meeker is the sleaziest actor I've ever seen. Everything he says seems to have some scumbag connotation and all sexed up.People talk about how sleazy Mickey Rourke is, well I can't help but call Ralph Meeker the forerunner to Rourke. How Meeker never became a big Robert Mitchum- style icon I'll never know.This is my all time favorite film noir,even more than The Big Heat! Meeker's version of Mike Hammer is a brutal thug with no compunction about torture and unspeakable violence (some of which is so repugnant they won't show).Another great thing is getting to see all-time manly movie great Jack Elam in an early role as part of a duo of thugs who beat and apparently torture Hammer.If you're a rabid crime flick fanatic, you have to get this movie.It's the best there is.It makes me giggle every time 'ol Ralph Meeker gets that sleazy sneer when he breaks the fingers of that coroner for jerkin' him around.I know it's immoral and wrong, but I love this sleazy crime masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening of Kiss Me Deadly was something that I saw years before I saw the full film of Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, courtesy of Scorsese's American Movies doc. Just from this I could tell this movie had something "else" to this. In an incredible but shocking and, in its way, logical process, it shows a series of shots of a woman running down a road, stopping thanks to a car (driven by our PI, Mike Hammer), and then after a few moments of being safe with this man and the mystery not revealed yet... the car is stopped, feet come forward - and a dissolve over a woman's scream to a woman's legs being tortured. Then the perspective of Hammer, off to the side totally out of it, hearing men's voices discussing vague things involving what to do.As any Screen writing 101 teacher will tell you, getting the opening and the ending of a movie right is so crucial. Here, this movie has both, and the ending involves that briefcase (yeah, that one, thanks Quentin for the reference). But what Aldrich and his collaborators do here is interesting: if you hear on the interview on the Criterion DVD, the movie isn't a close adaptation of the book - in fact it deviates a bit. The book doesn't have the whole aspect of the nuclear secrets. It was just another story of Hammer getting into violent s*** and kicking ass and taking names in the midst of his story.Luckily, Aldrich also has a fine lead in Ralph Meeker, who can play tough and take-no-s*** just fine (he never 'made it' as a leading man, but he shows up in a number of memorable movies over the years from Alrdich, Kubrick and Lang). In this story Hammer is out to find out what the hell happened to him that night, who that dame was (played by a young Cloris Leachman by the way), and why he was set up to die in a car crash. He gets help from a mechanic and his secretary, but of course Hammer also has to contend with the FBI. Why are they involved? Oh, you'll find out.The quality of the writing, however much it eschews Spillane's text or not, helps Aldrich to get to what he needs with this story. But it's such a rich film visually, too. He chooses his shots carefully, he doesn't cut to quickly when a key piece of info comes up (i.e. the first time any nuclear talk comes up between Hammer and an FBI guy), and how he follows people and then proceeds to beat them up. Or just talks to the woman by his side in the story (the one who... well, don't want to spoil it just yet).It's the kind of no-nonsense noir I wish I had seen on a big screen first. It's made for that, and I imagine if a film society or retro-house put it on a double bill with something like The Big Heat, also featuring Meeker in a much different role, it'd grow some hair on a man's chest! Seriously, this is strong stuff of the period, which also somehow manages to push the envelope of what you could show at the time by what it doesn't show (how is Christina tortured for example - we don't know, and that makes it worse). It's a director taking B-movie pulp and elevating it with art and craft and a vision. And grit. And blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeds of influence to David Lynch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this film really special is the direction and the characters. The plot itself is not that interesting per se. I have not read the novel but the story in the film is not very coherent and the involvement of the various characters in the plot is not clear at all. Curiously, though, the director does not seem to be interested in clarifying it. Instead, he builds on the ambiguity to create a universe that revolves around something that everyone thinks so important as to sacrifice their life or that of those around them for it, but no one understands what it is.In terms of the superb direction, I think it is worth pointing out that a few ideas and styles in this film seem to have been of great influence to the work of David Lynch. On the superficial side the opening credits immediately bring to my mind the Lost Highway. The mix of noir and such high levels of ambiguity, often with allusions to the supernatural, characterises the best of Lynch's work. I even found the amalgam of Cristina and Lily/Gabriel to be a prototype to Dorothy Vallens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From runaway hitchhikers to the Manhattan Project</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the pulp novel by Mickey Spillane, this utterly bizarre film noir features Ralph Meeker as private investigator Mike Hammer, who makes the grave mistake of picking up runaway psychiatric patient Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman) on a rural road late one night; shortly after, they are attacked, he witnesses her murder, and the two are tossed in his car and pushed over a cliff. Hammer survives, but finds himself in a web of mystery surrounding Christina's perplexing warnings that ultimately lead him to a mysterious box that is hot to the touch, filled with light, and emits ungodly sounds straight out of hell.Robert Aldrich, who later infamously directed the cult thriller "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?", directs this quirky and surreal film with a great deal of flair? while it at times appears as through-and-through noir, there are plenty of weird twists and turns in the labyrinthine plot as Hammer ventures from character to character, trying to piece together just what the ghostly Christina was caught up in. It's a talky film that relies on a lot of "he said, she said" in relaying crucial plot content (the matter of fact as well as the totally bizarre), but its pacing is even handed, its characters straight shooting, and its spooling of the peculiar details candid and effective.The black and white cinematography lends a significant darkness to the film that enhances its overall off-kilter tone; this is bolstered by the fact that the bulk of it takes place at night. The acting here not astoundingly great, but it's not exactly subpar either? the dialogue is admittedly hokey at times, but given the pulp novel source material, this is forgivable, especially since the film makes up for all of this in mood and presentation. Ralph Meeker is a solid leading man, oozing masculinity and an ego that borders on chauvinism while the female counterparts playfully dance around him? aside from Leachman's character, who wryly indexes him within the first five minutes? she's also the first to die. Feminist readings of the film aside, "Kiss Me Deadly" is probably the most bizarre film noir in cinematic history, and it's also one of the darkest. Its influence can be seen in contemporary film, explicitly referenced by Alex Cox in "Repo Man" and in Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," and more subtly in the works of David Lynch. The infamous final scene is jaw-dropping and unexpected, and potentially (depending on how you want to look at it) leaves the audience with more questions than answers. Given the Cold War context in which the film was made, the nuclear angle is the most plausible and discussed of course, but Aldrich's dramatic presentation of the iconoclastic "Pandora's box" is still more unnerving than radioactive fallout, the apocalypse, or Pinhead and his vassals. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must confess that, with this film I have seen a good noir film that is well nuanced and spine chilling.From the titles in the beginning to the final frozen frame, there is a sense of mystique that prevails. It helped me hang for the whole length of the film and I felt grateful at the end. The film poster itself has too many details that need some good time to decipher.To begin with, it's all in the writing of the script and placing them well in screenplay. Now, this film has done that part exceptionally well. Dialogues are good and they carry a certain intrigue that made me hold back to the whole length of the film.It has many undertones and many references too. It's disapproving of many conventional film making norms that were there in 1950's. But in the same structure, the body and the heart of the this film are radically different and we have been offered a very niche film. It's classically noir and it's classically left for viewers interpretation.The end climax is debatable and left me with questions. That's the kind of film that I like. The good films are good, but the great ones start asking questions about why anything happened. They start a debate internally within the mind and even with others, when you discuss about the film. Thus, this definitely is a great film.With sharp editing and superb cinematography, this film is a landmark technically in 1950's. The production design is wonderful too. All kudos to the technical team who have got the infrastructure of this film together.The acting, the nuances of emotions are done well by all the actors. Though, Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer stole the show.Great work by Robert Aldrich the director and great work by Criterion in giving us the film unedited, with even the alternative ending preserved. This is not a film for general viewers, it's strictly for aficionados.A 5/5 for a definitive, science fiction, noir film. http://braddugg.blogspot.in/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spillane, Hammer, and the Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd often wondered why the progressive intellectuals of the '50s had such disdain for the writings of Spillane. But after viewing this film and Ralph Meeker's performance as Mike Hammer (my first exposure to Spillane and his "good guy"), I've come to understand the reason why. This is a brutish detective whose first response to a challenge is violent excess; there's none of the subtlety of character that you find in the private dicks of Chandler and Hammett; it's shoot first and ask questions later, and you'd better follow that dictum or you'll be wiped out yourself. Mike Hammer is a character who fits in perfectly with the notion of the US as a gunslinger patrolling the world for bad guys. You'd better keep your finger on the trigger, be prepared to launch an all-out attack on short notice into whatever venue the enemy has crept, and forget the rule book they taught you in Sunday School 'cause it's a no-holds-barred war on the "bad guys", and THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up front, I'll admit that I was somewhat disappointed by this film. I cherish Robert Aldrich for several films, and while on a string of viewings which included Attack, Ten Seconds to Hell, The Big Knife and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, I ordered this one as well to take a look at. Of these films, Deadly is probably my least favorite. There's a promise of a wild experience, both rooted in the era and ripping the lid off of it, that never quite materializes. The inflated cultural context many writers heap on this film is understandable in terms of championing Aldrich auteur-ism, but otherwise absurd. Sorry. The lower you keep your expectations, the greater the odds you might fall for it's loopy appeal.The best part of the film, for this viewer, comes at the moment when Hammer finally gets the key and visits the terminal locker where the radioactive material is stored. As he loosens the straps on the big leather case a crack, a blinding glint of sunlight floods from the box and we hear a sound that sends a chill up our backbone: the hiss of a nuclear cobra as it were. Very good use of lighting and sound here. I wish more of the film had parlayed moments into something like this.The thing that bothered me -- resulting in the disappointment I spoke of -- was the flatness and flat out ineptitude of nearly all the performances. The struggling thespians, as much as the fifty cent budget does, get in the way of the director's grand design. -- We know it can't work that way. The people are too poorly integrated, and the best compliment I can probably pay this film is to say that it is the best-looking dirt-cheap film I have ever seen 98% of the time. The people though... there's the killer.The ending is a letdown too. How to say this delicately: Being able to tell that the blond in the burning bungalow is a mannequin completely ruins it by taking you out of the moment and then some. They should have ditched the scene altogether when they saw in the rushes what it looked like, or determined then and there that it was essential to re-shoot that one shot if they were going to release it at all. But they didn't, and this is one of those things that aficionados of this film will always, but always be asked to explain to anyone with whom they share it.My six stars is for the Aldrich context, and for a couple of choice pieces of time this film contains. (OK, then, for precisely ONE piece of time it contains: the aforesaid scene between Hammer and the leather case. But who's counting?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've read the plot description.Personally I thought this a brilliant film and a stand out 'film noir' (to give it a quite vague label) and one of my favourite films of all time.Mike Hammer has never been depicted so brilliantly or violently on film. Meeker is fantastic. Both cock-sure and vulnerable in his naivety that he can take on anything. Reprehensible in his morals but always delving against evil for the truth. Violently psychotic and vain..It stands alone with a particular viciousness and nihilism (It was a firm favourite of mine when I was a teenager along with Repo Man, which features an obviously influenced similar McGuffin and anti-hero). At the time I was also very interested in film censorship - and this was both extremely violent for it's time and heavily censored and criticised for violence and sexual suggestion.It's obviously not a perfect portrayal of a realistic detective or characters in the 1950's (are any?), it's a perfect stylised portrayal of the MYTH of 50's hardboiled detective novels - the most brilliant adaption of Mickey Spillane ever created.In this film Hammer is little removed from a violent, self-obsessed, literally sadistic psychopath - he revels in the pain he causes and is utterly personally flawed while thinking himself always right and doing the right thing.A bonus is the little things this film captures about he 1950s and attitudes. Don't forget the 'ridiculous' McGuffin was 10 years after 2 cities had been levelled by the new technology of nuclear weapons and of an utterly different time, even if only 60 years or so ago.The acting (Meeker was perfect), photography (brilliant B&amp;W, superb use of light and dark, shadows) and dialogue are absolutely exceptional. Anyone who doesn't appreciate this - well, boohoo. Get over it and find something you like instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely HATED the ending....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a well-made film noir by one of my favorite directors, Robert Aldrich, about Mickey Spillane's "Mike Hammer" character and, of course, murder. The film is full of suspense with top-notch acting and creepy effects surrounding the story. The ending, however, took the entire film to a whole new level and made absolutely no sense, reminding me of the old 1950s horror films where the hero and his lady love interest get far enough away from the destroyed monster so that they can watch with great delight. My response to the ending was, "Whaaaat???????!!!!!!" Pretty good up to the ending. I can't give any details about it without giving away the ending, so take a peek at it and be prepared for an ending that really sucked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An archetype setting noir film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tense, violent noir. Mike Hammer picks up woman wandering on desert road, gets caught in a complex plot plot that leads to a stolen nuclear bomb. Some great shots. A lot of 50s noir archetypes were set by this film. The ending is a bit silly and symbolically heavy handed at the same time, and some of the performances are over-the-top, but it's certainly an enjoyable film. Some critics consider it a flat out masterpiece. Personally I find that a stretch. But I did like it better on 2nd viewing, so I might return for another look sometime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film noir genre is not known for its kind treatment of women, and Kiss Me Deadly, the one that climaxes with Gaby Rodgers unleashing the "Pandora's Box" of a nuclear explosion, has been described as one of the most misogynistic. But it quickly becomes clear that the Deadly Dames of this picture are not like the Femme Fatales of your typical noir.It was especially those thrillers of the 1940s ? The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Out of the Past ? that tended to revolve around a gorgeous but heartless siren who would lure the hero to his doom. There is no such figure in Kiss Me Deadly. The women here play a significant role, but to an egalitarian misanthrope like Mike Hammer they deserve no special attention. To him, they are at worst a nuisance and at best a convenience, certainly not worth getting obsessed over. I'm not saying it's more progressive, but the attitude is at least merely dismissive rather than openly hostile.And there are quite a lot of women in Kiss Me Deadly, although their appearances are fleeting. You see, it's one of those elaborate, labyrinthine thrillers, in which we rarely visit the same location twice, characters are bumped off minutes after they are introduced, and to follow the plot you really need to pay attention to the dialogue, and not do anything silly like try to analyse it? Director Robert Aldrich is unfortunately not a specialist when it came to clarity and narrative enforcement. He is more a master of style and snappiness, making each eye-catching image dovetail into the next. It may not be the subtlest approach, but he does it rather well, creating shots that are less urban nightmare and more comic-book dynamism. Notable examples include shooting straight down the staircase where Hammer throws a hoodlum, stark lines converging on a distant vanishing point, or using a couple of foreground props and a pointed shadow to make Gaby Rodgers look like the incredible shrinking woman in her first scene. What is nice about all this, is that while it's all pretty elaborate and attention-grabbing, Aldrich doesn't do a Hitchcock and give the camera too much personality. Moves are kept to a functional minimum and, bar the odd Dutch angle, there are no fancy tricks.The casting of Ralph Meeker is a neat one. Meeker wasn't the deepest actor out there, but take one look at him and you'd believe he was sculpted for the role of Mike Hammer. It's the easygoing walk, the bullet head and above all that sardonic grin. When Humphrey Bogart plays Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe he does so with a cynical world-weariness, giving you the impression that some mistake in his past got him where he was. Not so Mr Meeker. His Mike Hammer clearly enjoys roughing it among the lowlifes, bullying his way through the investigation and taking the risks in his stride. Meeker may be a little one-dimensional but it's an engaging performance nonetheless.And in fact such a portrayal is key to Kiss Me Deadly. Hammer is not like other film noir protagonists, a sucker falling foul of a merciless blonde. And yet neither is he some bounty-hunting anti-hero. He does the right thing because he is in fact a good guy at heart. It's just that he mistreats and endangers those around him through sheer thoughtlessness. It is, in fact, the men in Kiss Me Deadly who get stereotyped and generally demonised. It may be a woman who finally opens the Pandora's Box, but as Hammer's girlfriend points out, it's the men who brought the evil in the first place, from a sense of bull-headed ignorance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I would kiss this movie back if it weren't for the Awful Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kiss Me Deadly" is a classic film noir and its cinematography is spot on with smart lighting that creates a liberal use of shadows. This plays into the mystery that is "Kiss Me Deadly". Director Robert Aldrich also cleverly works with tilted camera angles. Ralph Meeker gives a wonderful performance as the crooked detective who seems to break all the rules to solve the mystery to which he was personally involved in.The main weak point of "Kiss Me Deadly" is the lackluster script. The dialog lacks everything that a good script has. There is little chemistry and not one memorable line. However, by far the most disappointing part of this film is the ending. The audience is actively involved in the mystery only to be sorely disappointed. What a letdown.The violence is very graphic for its day. People seem to drop like flies and the bodies are piling up. This coupled with a classic film noir make all but the ending a good experience. However, this flawed ending is a big flaw and severely hurts the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-Slick, Anti-Glam, Nasty-Nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly (1955)Anti-Slick, Anti-Glam, Nasty-NastyThis is as raw and as brilliant as low budget thriller noir crime mysteries get. You know before the credits run that you're in for a ride--a woman in only a trenchcoat is running frantically down a highway at night, and she is desperate for good reasons, which we gradually learn. You also know that mise-en-scene accuracy isn't the point--the white stripe in the road jumps around from cut to cut. But once we are in the car, and the credits roll backwards, top to bottom, and we hear her panting (which would be orgasmic in some other situation) and panting and panting, you will either be enthralled or exhausted.By the time she and Mike Hammer, played with psychotic heartlessness by Ralph Meeker, go through a police roadblock, get assaulted by some thugs and tortured, and then get pushed off a cliff in his sports car, we are about eleven minutes into the movie. It's fast without polish, and yet it holds together, it's smart, it actually shows Hammer to be a thinking, reasonable detective, even if a mercenary one (it's all about money to him). There are bad bad guys and bad good guys, and a bad bad suitcase. Even the sweet tongued and ever helpful secretary/lover Velda, played by Maxine Cooper, uses sex for purely commercial reasons--to trap husbands and give their wives reason to hire Hammer, or so it seems.And who was director Robert Aldrich at the time? A man from privilege who was working his way up in Hollywood, and who might be the last you'd expect to dip into these steamy seamy depths. Or reach these heights, in fact. I'd hate to be laughed at but despite all its would-be flaws and obvious low budget devices, this is his best film overall, surely his best for sheer chutzpah and flair. And it brandishes the quirks that will resurface in some of his later films (notably Whatever Happened to Baby Jane), as well as his Hollywood smarts (the masterful The Dirty Dozen).So, yes, this movie clunks in many parts. But you forgive it, like you might (sometimes) forgive a Corman film its huge gaps and bad acting. The force of Meeker's portrayal is key. This was the movie role of his life, resorting largely to television for a career afterwards (Aldrich used him again in The Dirty Dozen, and leave it to Kubrick to see Meeker's ability for Paths of Glory). The cinematographer is the admired Ernest Laszlo, who makes a lot out of very little throughout. The twists Aldrich (and/or his screenwriter, A. I. Besserides) made to the plot from the original Mickey Spillane novel (which isn't exactly tame) give transcendent brilliance of Kiss Me Deadly--the radiant, blinding contents of the suitcase (it roars when opened, too!) make the plot a terrible fantasy, and make all the other improbable events fair game.And so the movie presents, intentionally or not, a comment of some confusing kind about nuclear power, atom bombs, the cold war, government secrecy, the lone dissident, and maybe, if we believe the ending, the futility of keeping nukes out of the hands of crooks. Let's hope this all stays a fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pandora's Box</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich takes the noir genre into science-fiction territory with this bizarre amalgam of violence and simple special-effects.Able, but lesser-known Ralph Meeker, plays Mike Hammer as the amoral, hardened gumshoe who finds himself in a situation that's way above his head. From the very outset, the movie takes you in. A young woman apparently fleeing along an empty road. She knows something she shouldn't, but doesn't live long enough to tell. Hammer follows disjointed clues and leaves a trail of corpses. He has trouble with police who warn him to stay out of it. From time to time there are passing references to 'Manhattan Project', which was the USA's nuclear bomb programme. It seems like a red-herring. But it isn't - not quite.There's a mysterious box, finally discovered in a dead suspect's locker. Hammer opens the top just a crack. Instantly, an eerie whistling and a blinding bright light is released; it's scorching hot too, and blisters his wrists before he can slam it shut. What the hell is it? The plot flags occasionally, but the viewer's attention is kept nailed to the story by the elusive mystery and cause of so many corpses. A master criminal lurks behind the scene, and he has the usual dumb, inquisitive moll. She engages in his betrayal, but with his dying breath he warns her never to look in the box. Whether it's a sincere warning to his crooked lover or a last-act revenge - knowing that insatiable curiosity will drive her to do the very opposite - remains an enigma. But like Pandora; she opens it.The final moments are inconclusive. Wounded, Hammer staggers along a beach at the waterline accompanied by the scorched moll, as the now shrieking contents of the box - released to do their worst - are seen in backdrop, the whole house aglow from within like an inferno whilst its structure becomes incandescent with heat.It's a strange and shocking science-fiction end that leaves lots of questions unanswered - just as it was supposed to do.Violent, gripping, and bizarre by turns; well worth watching for all of those reasons, if not for the delightful celebration of lighting and camera angles that are film noir at its best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Kiss me. The liar's kiss that says I love you, and means something else."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich's 'Kiss Me Deadly (1955)' opens with one of the most captivating sequences I've seen in a long while. Dispensing with the credits until a later date, when they scroll slanted and backwards across the screen, the film fades directly into a pair of naked feet fleeing along a roadway, the soundtrack dominated by her amplified breathing and panting, the flicker of passing automobile headlights briefly illuminating her anguished facial features. A passing motorist swerves to avoid the barely-clothed woman, skidding dangerously onto the gravel, and the disgruntled driver, private investigator Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker), reluctantly offers her a ride. The credits roll over images of the road ahead, filmed from the backseat of Hammer's convertible, to the soundtrack of Nat King Cole's "Rather Have the Blues" on the radio, the mysterious woman's sobbing and breathing still disconcertingly audible. I was immediately transfixed by Aldrich's directing style - gritty, mean, and yet still very professional - and, had the film maintained this tone for the entirety of its running time, I would have proclaimed 'Kiss Me Deadly' to be no less than a masterpiece.It doesn't take long, however, for the film to fall into the familiar trappings of a pulp detective novel, not unlike your typical Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett adaptation. This isn't necessarily a damaging characteristic, and the film very much retains its ability to thrill and entertain, but it loses the raw grittiness that, stylistically, made the prologue sequence so damn gripping. The remainder of the story, creatively adapted from a novel by Mickey Spillane, interestingly blends two distinct genres: on the one hand, it's a hard-boiled pulp detective story, complete with a hard-edged private investigator, seedy villains and a scheming femme fatale. On the other hand, it's a science-fiction off-shoot of the Cold War, with a destructive, possibly-nuclear Macguffin for which the film's characters are quite willing to kill. Ralph Meeker is ideally-cast as Mike Hammer, a wry, stubborn and selfish detective whose inability to cooperate with the unsympathetic authorities can only lead to apocalypse. The screenplay by A.I. Bezzerides, like many noirs, carries a streak of misogyny, with even the innocent girls (including Maxine Cooper and Cloris Leachman) being neglected and abused at every turn.'Kiss Me Deadly' is also interesting in that the filmmakers have obviously become very aware of typical film noir conventions, and the inclusion of the mysterious Pandora's Box - knowingly referred to as "the great whatsit" - is a deliberate satire of what Alfred Hitchcock had called the MacGuffin, a plot device that motivates the film's characters, but the details of which are of little or no importance. The influence of this device can be seen in numerous subsequent pictures, from the opening of the Ark of the Covenant in Steven Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)' to the mysterious glowing briefcase in Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction (1994).' The DVD release of 'Kiss Me Deadly' includes the film's restored original ending, in which Hammer and Velda escape into the crashing waves, their futures nonetheless still uncertain, as the apocalyptic nuclear device destroys the seaside cottage in a blinding mushroom cloud. I much preferred it to the abrupt, truncated ending that had previously been common in most prints, and Aldrich himself confirmed that he had no part in the somewhat-crude chopping of his film's conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deadly concoction of dames in distress...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over fifty years ago, I thought this was a great movie, long before I knew what the term film-noire was all about. After watching it again recently, it's still one of the best of the genre made ? despite the awful change to the contents of the box that everybody was after...I've not read the Spillane novel, but I understand that drugs or money were involved in the book. For this version, director Aldrich went overboard, in my opinion. However, at that time, the McCarthy circus was in full swing, the Cold war was hotting up and I guess Hollywood had to show that there were indeed patriots still in good ol' USA.Hence, the need to cast Albert Dekker as a guy (Dr Soberin) prepared to sell nuclear secrets and material to the bad guys ? in this case, the un-named Soviet Union. The only fly in his ointment is Ralph Meeker as tough PI Mike Hammer who always seems to bump into trouble wherever he goes.The plot is moody, convoluted, jerky, mysterious and dark ? literally and metaphorically. Meeker plays Hammer to a T: tough, cynical, sadistic, and merciless. The scene when Hammer crushes the fingers of Doc Kennedy (Percy Helton), to get what he wants, lingers on Hammer's face, the joy of watching the Doc suffer clearly evident; that scene stayed with me when I first saw this movie in my teens. It still has impact today.The other standout scene that shows Meeker's skill as Hammer is when he's mugged by some guy who tries to put knife into Mike's back. Not only does Mike beat the guy up, but he throws the mugger down a very long flight of concrete steps and watches with glee as the schmuck bounces all the way to the bottom. Is the mugger dead? He should be, after that long fall ? and Mike just grins his satisfaction. But, we never find out ? just another episode of life and death in the big city...Apart from Meeker, I particularly liked the performances of the three women: Maxine Cooper as long-suffering Velda, Cloris Leachman (in her film debut) as Christina Bailey and best of all, Gaby Rodgers as Gabrielle ? a true femme fatale. What a shame Gaby Rodgers left the movie business in the early sixties! Cinematography is superb ? the sleaze, the grey days, the dark nights, the slick streets ? beautifully capturing the mood of Spillane's novels, and probably the best Hammer movie I've seen. Certainly ranks with Out of the Past (1947), The Killers (1946) and some others, for authenticity within the genre.Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You are entitled to believe that I am not completely qualified to comment because I did not watch this picture through to the end. That's right, I turned it off. And pretty far in, too. You are also entitled to know that I am a huge noir fan, and agree with virtually everything the articulate reviewers here have had to say about other films. Given the level of rapture about this one, I am naturally forced to question my own assessment (and will no doubt view again at some point), but I also can't help but think I'm on some possibly narrow but pretty solid ground... The fact is, I found this picture both frustrating and strangely dull -- due, primarily, to one overriding factor: For the first 2/3rds of the story (the part that I saw before giving up) there is not one scintilla of additional information provided beyond what we know in the first ten or fifteen minutes. One after another character who may or may not know something gets murdered, and along the way we discover... not a thing. All that the fans of this picture admire is certainly there -- the hardboiled nonchalance, the offbeat characters, the remarkable editing and mis-en-scene, the incredibly modern underplayed performances -- but great noir mystery/thrillers, even if they are packed with blind alleys, red herrings, and dead-ends (think The Big Sleep), hold your attention by giving out just enough to keep you puzzling; one's mind is engaged with an emerging back-story, or a series of incidents, items, and facts that appear to be adding up to something... Kiss Me Deadly provides none of this, and the result is a growing realization that the entire exercise is just one big waiting game; you'll never get anywhere near enough information to try and conceive an explanation, a culprit, or a possible solution, so you might as well just disengage and wait for the end. So, I chose to disengage. Literally. Interestingly, I divine from the commentary here that the ending is a whopper. Well, it had better be, because it's a helluva long journey when the lid on the story is so tightly sealed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Packs A Punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its Cold War era setting, "Kiss Me Deadly" still packs a punch, with suspense and action that still grab hold of you as you watch. Many of the characters are remarkably unpleasant individuals, and yet somehow that only increases the level of intrigue and tension. The photography and Robert Aldrich's direction are very effective in putting the package together. The occasional references to Christina Rossetti and other classical works adds a nice touch as well.Ralph Meeker was an interesting choice to play the resourceful but unlikable Mike Hammer. He's hardly the kind of person you want to pull for, but he finds himself in such a tight spot that you can identify with him anyway. The rest of the cast members do a good job in maintaining the atmosphere of anxiety and distrust, with practically all of them giving their characters a menacing and/or a nearly-hysterical edge. Cloris Leachman, even in limited screen time, may be the most memorable of the characters.The story revolves around the kind of vague 'prize' that even most of the characters only dimly understand. While it must have been an effective plot device in its time, it hasn't lost much of its significance either. The grim nature of the story and the sordid variety of characters work better than you might expect, and surely Aldrich deserves much of the credit for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) comes upon a woman running down the road late one night with only a trenchcoat on (Cloris Leachman in her first role). He picks her up--but the car is stopped, he's knocked cold and she's tortured to death. He comes to and tries to find out who she was and why she was killed.Definitely ahead of its time--this is a quick, tough and very violent movie. Right away from the inventive opening credits you know you're seeing something different. Meeker's Hammer is a totally amoral man--he investigates the murder of the woman only because he figures there's something in it for him. That's pretty common today--but not in 1955. The violence in this film was also VERY strong for its day. There isn't a lot of it--but what's in there is pretty graphic.The picture is full of tough dialogue and director Robert Aldrich cleverly uses tilted camera angles and very inventive use of darkness and shadows in certain scenes. The film also has two endings--the one most commonly shown is the TV version--the original was a few seconds shorter--but changes things considerably.The acting is pretty good--Meeker is just great. A violent, strong movie. I'm only giving it a 9 because Gaby Rodgers gives a terrible performance in a crucial role. Her aside though this is great. Recommended.</fullReview>

Maybe just an adult pleasureland, a knowing man's thrill ride through depravity, perhaps. The dark side of a dream, as Bruce once said. They don't make 'em like this anymore.

		<shortDescription>This is a film noir gem worthy of a spot in IMDb's top twenty-five film-noir hands down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you already have your own solid idea of what constitutes a film noir, by all means skip to the last paragraph. If you're not sure, the first two bits may help.From what I've learned about the film world of Noir, there are two definitions of the genre. One is the traditionally loose definition based on the piece of history about the French. Freed from German oppression at the end of WWII the French soon after became enamoured with the new dark and shadowy look of America that film makers were putting out. This definition has resulted in a great number of films slipping into the genre that simply hint of noir or have dark plot lines, but most that slip in, whether noir or not, deserve to be watched and so I can't speak ill of the broad view.The other definition is more specific, almost like a checklist of requirements. You need your Chump, that is, your tough guy in a suit who wants answers but who looks for them with a cool indifference. You need your Femme Fatale, who more often than not uses her charms to work the chump to her advantage. You need a plot that's twisted like a mystery or a heist but doesn't steal your attention from how cool the chump looks riding around town at night with a cabby he knows by name, collecting clues to find out whose side the femme's on other than her own. Add artful night-shooting, the occasional scrap or murder, and twenty five or thirty cigarette-smoking scenes, and you have a great film noir.If you've seen "Kiss Me Deadly", then you know how I feel about it already. This film is classic noir; the story, the shooting, every staple character, it's all there. Ralph Meeker plays Mike Hammer, a detective who gets caught up in a case where mystery, deception, and beautiful women are everywhere. It's up to Hammer to resolve everything in a case where he himself is a primary witness. The film may sound riveting, but it's not; it's noir. Watch with cool satisfaction as Hammer visits countless characters for tips that barely string together and executes the occasional exhibition of violence to warrant why he walks and drives around town the way he does. I give "Kiss Me Deadly" a 9 and recommend it to anybody who wants to understand just what the whole noir craze is about. It's not by all standards a great film, but in the world of noir, it's absolutely classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beyond noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it starts out as a film noir thriller, Mickey Spillane's Kiss Me Deadly, based on his book, has, by the end, expanded into something beyond that. Only recently has this film become a classic, being largely overlooked upon its release, except for the excessive violence. In fact, it seems to be ahead of its time, having more in common with Chinatown than something like Double Indemnity or Out of the Past. Although, Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) is much tougher than Chinatown's Jake Gittes, he really has no idea what he's getting himself into. Because of his stubbornness to find out why the hitch-hiking woman he picked up told him he must "remember [her]", someone he knows is killed, someone else is kidnapped, and he is duped by someone he thought he could trust and help. The opening sequence alone proves that it will be a different film than other noirs. After picking up a hitch-hiker, Mike Hammer drives off with her crying over the song "Rather Have the Blues" sung by Nat King Cole over the radio, with the opening credits scrolling downward over the car, reading from the bottom up, like they would if they appeared written on the street. Without giving the ending away, keep in mind the film was made during the heart of the Cold War. Two versions of the film exist, the U.S. one having a quicker, more abrupt ending, but the real version, as was released worldwide, is actually extended a bit longer, which makes a big difference. Most copies available now should be the real version, not the oddly cut one. Although Robert Aldrich would later go on to direct many more classic films, like The Dirty Dozen, Kiss Me Deadly remains his first, a great film from a director before anyone knew he, himself, would become one of the greats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensational for three quarters. Slightly questionable final part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late night. A bare-foot woman desperately runs along a highway, in the crude intermittent light of the passing cars. Then she suddenly jumps in the middle of the road, forcing a driver to stop, at her own risk to be run over... I venture to say that this opening scene of "Kiss me deadly" together with the following ten minutes offer the best beginning of a film-noir I've ever seen.In fact, I think this movie is sensational for at least three quarters. The direction by Aldrich is superb. The black and white photography is magnificent, the gloomy atmosphere of a corrupted underworld is masterly represented. A no-stars cast makes an outstanding job. The story is exciting, violent, intricate, with many surprises. And how I like the title: "Kiss me deadly"... tough and splendidly evocative! Is it possible to do better? However, I think that the final part is a bit questionable. The stuff with the cryptic letter, the poem and the key is more in the style of Agatha Christie's clockwork machinery than of a violent, hard-boiled story. And what actually is the "Whats-it" is difficult to swallow. But, in fairness, the last scene is very powerful, hardly believable as it is.Now the main question: how could this movie manage to pass the censorship in 1955? It seems that the guys in charge were much more enlightened than we use to think today. The amount of violence was unheard of for the epoch: see for instance the first murder, or the scene of the drawer. Indeed, Aldrich uses many brilliant devices to hint to violence rather than openly show it, but the atmosphere is no less scaring for this. And what about sex? All women are sexually free and explicit in their desires. They sleep naked and, when up, they wear either dressing-gowns or bath-robes, and nothing else, or over-tight sexy dresses. And women are not less greedy, cynical and pitiless than men.But what is really stunning, even for the standards of current movies, is the character of Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker): let's give much credit to the writer Spillane. Compared with Hammer, "Dirty Harry" Callaghan seems a boy-scout. Let's see... Hammer is a greedy, violent bully, a loathsome thug of the same kind of the gangsters he fights. He's ready to kill ruthlessly. He brutally beats innocent people to get informations... That's not enough: as a private eye, he is specialized in divorces. The fact is that he deliberately cheats his own clients, messing up their cases, just to get more money (and indeed he's very well-off: luxury car, beautiful apartment...). His favorite technique consists in employing his beautiful secretary/girl-friend/lover Velda (Maxine Cooper) to allure, go-to-bed-with and finally blackmail either his clients or their opponents, according to economical convenience. And Velda agrees to act as a prostitute with easy mind, good-humor and professionalism! Very hot stuff even for the present (politically correct) 2000s, isn't it? Hammer is really the antithesis of the romantic, if tough, private eyes of the classic film-noirs."Kiss me deadly" is an excellent, strikingly original movie, despite its possible defects: highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly(1955) is one of the top films of the late Noir period. This is the best film adaptation of a Mickey Spillane novel. It is an unique feature because it deals with the fear of nuclear bombs and nuclear war. The film is an all around great movie from the opening scene to the explosive ending. Ralph Meeker gives a terrific performance as he portrays Mike Hammer with a brutish quality that is retained from the novel.Kiss Me Deadly(1955) along with The Big Heat(1953) were unusally violent for the period in which they were made. It would influence many later films including Chinatown(1974) and L.A. Confidential(1997) with its style and depiction of corruption. The violence in the film errupts like a volcano and freezes like the ice. This was the film debut for Academy Award winner Cloris Leachman. In the movie, Mike Hammer is a detective who specializes in devorce and blackmail cases.The direction in the movie is taut and the story is terrific. This is a great movie that should be seen more than once. Robert Aldrich shows why he was one of the best action directors of the 1950's and 1960's. The mystery of the black box would be the influence for the mystery of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction(1994). The ending decends into the genre of Science Fiction.</fullReview>

Look for the evil smile on his face as he smashes a hand in a desk drawer or roughs someone up for more information. The dialog is brilliant, challenging, and enjoyable to watch. The characters are the perfect mix of intelligent, dark, cold, and selfish that makes a film like this really work at multiple levels. My only quibble is I found the ending a bit disappointing.

		<shortDescription>High-velocity, sexually charged thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How did Robert Aldrich get this past the Production Code? A beautiful, naked woman running down the highway; Mike Hammer's lusty secretary, in that tight blouse; a plot that hints that maybe -- just maybe -- our government isn't telling us everything; gruesome tortures and murders, the list goes on."Kiss Me Deadly" is one terrific thriller and the best example of pure, undiluted film-noir from the 1950s, when that genre was at its peak.One reason for this is that it stands up so well to today's standards -- seen now, "Kiss Me Deadly" seems fresh, especially when compared to a lot of today's tragically lame neo-noir films. Everything's slightly overblown, Expressionist style, too, which makes the picture more fun at times, more frightening at others.As movie lore would have it, Aldrich edited two endings with the same footage, both of which appear on the newer video releases of the film. Which one you like better is more or less irrelevant, since you can't just remove one ending from your imagination and substitute another; the gimmick will probably appeal more to completists who are into lost footage and directors' cuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is bad director Robert Aldrich's best movie, which says more than it oughtta. He is often less than competent, and this isn't really a good movie, in any traditional sense: the story is contrived, the characters are absurd, the acting is all over the map...But it is innovative in odd ways, and some of these weird choices changed the whole noir genre forever. The box you can't look inside, the unseen gesture of violence, an utterly brutal, misogynist, and sociopathic protagonist: people fifty years later think that these are noir hallmarks (a sad number think they were invented by Quentin Tarantino), when in fact they're from a movie made ten years after the genre's high water mark. That doesn't make them good, and it doesn't make the movie better than MALTESE FALCON or MURDER MY SWEET or OUT OF THE PAST or DOUBLE INDEMNITY, or POSTMAN, or BORDER INCIDENT... hell, it's not in the same league with those. But the film's enduring popularity says something for it. What, I don't know. And I'm sick of people calling Ralph Meeker a bad actor. As opposed to what? I'd like to see Laurence Olivier play Mike Hammer this well. Perhaps Meeker's not a great actor, but he's great in PATHS OF GLORY, and he's great in this, because he captures the nihilism of Aldrich's world. His grin when he slams the doctor's hand in the drawer; the disgust in his voice when he belittles his women; his delight in slapping the old desk clerk: these make the movie. Again, it's not a good movie. But it is something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film noir but something is amiss...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RALPH MEEKER makes a credible Mike Hammer, even though there are times when I thought what a great role this would have been for either KIRK DOUGLAS or HUMPHREY BOGART. Meeker was a handsome actor who never quite made it in Hollywood after some stage work, notably as the drifter in PICNIC on Broadway in the role that went to William Holden in the film version.From the very start, this is a fascinating film noir, beginning with the pick-up of CLORIS LEACHMAN (introduced in her film debut) and from there veering into a highly tense detective yarn, some of which is hard to follow when you start asking too many questions. Some pertinent explanations are missing, but the artful B&amp;W photography around San Francisco, up winding alleys and high wooden staircases, keeps the eye fascinated while the story unwinds.The story itself involves a rather "Pandora's Box" kind of solution--what is the thing that so many have been killed for? And when the solution does come, it's a shocker.Summing up: Nice film noir, gritty performance by Ralph Meeker and some sharp direction by Robert Aldrich who once again uses Frank DeVol for the background score (as he did for "Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte").Trivia note: WESLEY ADDY has a key supporting role as a law officer, just as he would nine years later in Aldrich's HHSC. And the little man who played the creepy undertaker in that flick (PERCY HELTON), is a greedy morgue attendant here who gets his comeuppance from Hammer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though the acting by the lead is wooden, the main character is an unlikable ass, and and the plot is absurd, this is one of those films where a number of extraordinarily memorable scenes and great photography make up for the weakness of the whole, more or less.Obviously, the opening and closing scenes stick out, but the one that will forever stay with me is the torture/murder of the hitchhiker near the beginning. The violence in this scene is completely implied - you see only her bare feet dangling over the floor while she cries out in pain, then you see the thugs talking and one of them is holding a pair of pliers - yet it's extremely brutal.It's a standout genre picture with an interesting, albeit pitch black, theme, but those who expect a Sam Spade or Phillip Marlowe type detective noir will probably be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midway through the proceedings, at the Hollywood Athletic Club, Mike Hammer throws some bills on the counter to influence the clerk. When that effort is sneeringly rebuffed, he delivers a crackling slap to the guy's face instead. That's the world Hammer moves in: One or the other of these two is bound to deliver the goods.Pauline Kael described Ralph Meeker's Hammer as "Brando with a cheap glaze of playboy glamor," and it's amazing how like the young Brando he does indeed look. His Hammer is more than merely brutal: Check out the gleeful grin on his face while he slams someone's fingers in a drawer. In fact I'd wager there's more cheerful sadism and naked sexual yearning in this film than in any other title from 1955. Too bad Hammer, just like the goons in this film, always seem to be too busy to bother with "the dames." What, you might miss out on a hand of gin rummy?The performances may grate at times, but you have to accept that, like everything else in the movie, some are just intentionally off-kilter, or you'll never be able to enjoy the ride. I actually thought Gaby Rodgers was somewhat effective in her part: a little bit left-of-normal, and especially in her last scene there's something absolutely feline about her. And check out Jack Elam's reaction after Hammer has dispatched his partner: Like so much of the action, we couldn't quite make out what happened but you can tell whatever it was it scared this guy sh**less.Note how the brilliant Ernest Laszlo's camera angles often give the impression that someone is spying on the protagonists from somewhere hidden.It's not just the credits rolling down from the sky that makes the opening credits unusual, and establish this movies unsettling tone: The "theme song" (by Nat King Cole, no less) playing on the car radio is nearly drowned out by Cloris Leachman's uninterrupted sobbing.Overblown? Violent? Sexist? Senseless? Sure! Just remember there may be more going on than meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold War Mike Hammer film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) gets flagged down by a desperate woman running down the middle of a dark road (Cloris Leachman), and through this chance encounter gets in way over his head in a case involving the national security of the country. While the credits run from bottom to top as the car with its two occupants speeds through the night, we begin to realize that we're in for something different. When they get waylaid by the people who were chasing her in the first place, an unconscious Hammer lies in the next room while the men work over Leachman, and brutally kill her. Drawn into the case by the seemingly senseless murder, Hammer strives to get to the bottom of it all and discovers that at the core, like in all of us(?) lies the atom, in this case atomic fissile material. A snarling Ralph Meeker is more than convincing as the temperamental Hammmer, doing his share of slapping people around while getting to the truth, while also getting slapped around by tough guys Jack Lambert and Jack Elam. Scene for scene, it is a remarkable film, but in this case the whole isn't greater than the parts, leaving you slightly unimpressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The casting is offbeat and the acting superb. The camera-work is inventive and the movie looks great. The music is eclectic and the use of sound is innovative. And the movie can you scare you to death.Interestingly, what I remember from the first few viewing is the ending, in which Gaby Rogers opens the Pandora's box and the screen is filled with a blinding light. In the version I've just seen, that kind of happens but it ends with Mike Hammer and his Girl Friday Velda safe from the atomic explosion, watching in terror from the ocean.Whatever the ending, this is the "Citizen Kane" of noirs. In my opinion, it is far superior to Welles's quirky and imaginative "Touch of Evil." Everything in it is wild and new and crazy and scary.This role fits Ralph Meeker like the proverbial glove. He was a dashing screen presence, who made all too few movies. The other major figures are played by relative unknowns. But who can ever forget this sleek Velda or the duplicitous Pandora figure -- or Cloris Leachman, in the first role most people know her for -- the desperate hitchhiker at the movie's start who holds the key to destruction and is named after Christina Rosetti? This is a movie no one who's seen it could possibly forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kiss Me Deadly" starts off like a bad dream. Mike Hammer, Ralph Meeker,is driving up a highway with the credits of the movie rolling downside up on the screen to Nat King Cole music when he almost runs over Christina Baily, Carol Leachman. Who for some reason is on the highway in the middle of the night trying to escape from someone.Hammer offers her a lift and what little Christina tells him makes him think that she's somewhat unstable. After Hammer has a piece of tree that got stuck under his car, when he tried to avoid hitting Christina, removed at a gas station he drops Christina off at the nearest bus stop. As he sees her for the last time Christina tells Hammer to "remember me". Moments later Hammer is knocked out cold and Christina is being tortured to get her to talk about something by a group of unseen tugs with their boss talking as if he were a professor of religious studies at the local university instead of being a ruthless criminal. Thrown off a cliff Hammer survives but Christina doesn't and from then on in the movie Hammer's haunted by what Christina told him before she died: "Remember me". The movie "Kiss Me Deadly" just takes off and never lets up for the entire 1 hour and 45 minutes that it's on the screen with Mike Hammer trying to tie all the strings together and get to the bottom of what was so important about a runaway women. A nobody that the whole California underworld was so interested in. And even more what she knew about a hidden box and where it was that cost her her life. "Kiss Me Deadly" starts off like an average crime movie but as the plot starts to unfold the viewers start to realize that there's more to the movie then what they thought there is, much more. There's something so terrifying about what poor Christina knew that it transcended anything movie goers were used to seeing in a crime movie. "Kiss Me Deadly" has stood the test of time for almost 50 years because there's never been a crime movie ever made with a script that had anything close to it's storyline. Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer, even though he was the "good guy" in the movie, was as ruthless and as brutal as any of the "heavies" in the film. The only time he showed any shock or fear was when Lt.Murphy, Wesley Addy, told Hammer what he was really up against. Stunned all that Hammer could meekly say was "I didn't know" but by then it was too late.Like Dr. Sobrein, Albert Dakker, the top gangster in the movie said at the end of the film to his girlfriend Gabriel, lily Carver, about the mysterious suitcase. Your curiosity will opened a Pandora's box and by doing so it's going to kill all the cats it the world. What Christina told Hammer before she was murdered by Soberin's hoods "remember me" was a clue that led to something that if Hammer knew what it was even he would have stayed as far away from it as he possibly could. But then we wouldn't have had a masterpiece of Film-Noir as "Kiss Me Deadly. The only way the movie could have worked, and become as great as it is, is that the truth about what everyone in the film was looking for "the great what's it" as Hammer's secretary Valda, Maxine Cooper, called it was much bigger then anything that anyone in the movie could have imagined. The "great What's it" had to be kept secret almost to the very end of the movie or else the story would have not have made any sense and the viewing public would have not found the story believable. I'm glad to see that TCM has restored the last two minutes of "Kiss Me deadly" to what it was when it was originally released back in 1955. It made the ending, which was the only thing about the movie that was uneven and confusing, make sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mickey Spillane's view of the end of the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mickey Spillane's view of the end of the world comes to the screen as a brutal, violent and fatalistic one. It also comes off as one of the best detective dramas ever filmed. The screenplay by A.I. Bezzerides portrays Hammer as Spillane intended him to be. A caustic, callous, self centered man who is a good detective, perhaps too good for his own being. After Hammer picks up a woman hitchiker he is drawn into a case that involves everything up to and including the atomic bomb. The film is presented as a compelling mystery, and despite a cast of lesser stars and unknowns, the acting is uniformly great throughout.Meeker is the best Hammer I've ever seen on any medium(and I say this even though Biff Elliot, the first screen Hammer is a close personal friend). He has just the right blend of toughness, cockiness and cynicism to make you admire him yet pity him. He is supported by a strong supporting cast. Cloris Leachman(her screen debut), Maxine Cooper (as Velma)and Gaby Rodgers as Lily Carver make up a deadly trio of Femme Fatals. Albert Dekker is one of the great villans in screen lore. Paul Stewart plays his culturally bred lieutenant. Strother Martin, Fortunio Bonanova, Nick Dennis and Juano Hernandez are memorable characters involved with the case.The star of the show is the end. The video versions, both VHS and laser, feature the original ending as shot by Director Robert Aldrich following the conclusion of the filmPersonally I like the ending that is in the released version. It gives the picture more of a mystique(not that it needs it). In fact this film needs very little because it has so much.</fullReview>

The Hammer character is cold, uncaring, brutal, and amoral - with occasional glimpses of humanity breaking through. No sugar-coating here. The acting is incredible throughout. Another interesting aspect is the portrayal of African-Americans in this film - very matter-of-fact, with Hammer treating them the same as white people (better than he treats most people, as a matter of fact). Then there is that scene at the end of the movie when the Lily Carver character keeps ordering Hammer towards her - "Kiss me Mike" - while she holds a gun on him. I won't say anymore, but it is one of the most chilling scenes in cinema. This movie is a classic - right up there with "The Third Man".</fullReview>

Why does Cloris have to pant so annoyingly loud, and for so long? Who exactly was Cloris' roommate, and why?In his intro to the film on TCM, Robert Osbourne mentions that this film was considered nothing special at its release, just another drive-in level B-movie detective noir film.

		<fullReview>This movie is just plain dumb.From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadly Combination of Noir and Pulp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw "Kiss Me Deadly" at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica as part of the Film Noir Festival which happens every year there. First time viewing, and expectations were high. We were lucky enough to have the first assistant director from the film, and Maxine Cooper who played Velda waved at us from the back of the cinema. However, the pre-film discussion was lackluster and a missed opportunity. The film itself was a gripping, complex tale, where neither the characters nor the audience knew what was going on. This Mike Hammer-played unconvincingly by big muscled, Beach boy looking Ralph Meeker is an opportunist with a heart of gold, a cad with a conscience, a bully with a soft streak. His sidekick and secretary Velda, didn't have the femme fatale aura I would have expected. However, there are a host of other character actors who flit in and out of the film who are worth the price of admission: Nick Dennis as Nick, Hammer's idiosyncratic car mechanic (va va voom); Leigh Snowden as Hammer's fastest pick-up ever and Cloris Leachman in a small but pivotal role, in her first film. Where the film falls down is in its central intrigue: 'the "great whatsit' which Hammer and everyone else in the movie is chasing, has a dated, ho-hum quality once the cat is out of the bag. Apparently the film was controversial in its day and the studio may or may not have been behind the changing of the ending at the time "Kiss Me Deadly "was issued. According to our presenter the final 5 minutes were confusingly cut to satisfy the U.S. Government. We got to see the film as originally intended by the director, but there's nothing there now which warrants the fuss made 50 years ago. In fact, the supposed "incredible" ending I've read about in other reviews played cheesily to me, to use a classic film critique term. Still, "Kiss Me Deadly" is worth seeing, as much for its foibles as its accomplishments, as well as for its wonderful glimpses into downtown Los Angeles, and Bunker Hill before the skyscrapers replaced its Victorian tenements.</fullReview>

I was transfixed, the way people get when there's an accident on the highway. And the ending was quite wholly gruesome, suited the whole picture satisfactorily. I have to say I was truly impressed to see his version of a phone answering machine! Built into the wall! The recording even had the same phrases as current answering machines! I assumed the bachelor pad was tidy because he had a cleaning lady or his Velda (what a weird name) is his slave in more ways than one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the cops can say that when they're forced to share the same room with the sleazy Mike Hammer, then I can say that having shared the same room with this rancid film.Ralph Meeker plays the "bedroom dick" Mike Hammer with as much expression as one of the corpses which turn up constantly throughout. How many different ways are there to smirk?It all gets quite repetitive. Smirkin' 'n' slappin', slappin' 'n' smirkin', it's about as exciting as a soiled trenchcoat.A.I. Bezzerides adapted this script. Is he the one responsible for these "colourful" Greeks and Italians who are always popping up at odd moments? Half as many would have been plenty.If you've seen the old Perry Mason show, then you've seen these cheap sets before. At least with Perry, there was no malodorous score by Frank De Vol.Director Aldrich makes certain claims about this film. Deep political implications? Anti-McCarthy subtext? You're joking.This putrid film's plot seems to have resurfaced a few years back as "Mulholland Falls" with Nick Nolte. That one stank too.Factual error: Enrico Caruso's "Pagliacci" would qualify as one of the LEAST rare of old 78 recordings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tough private detective Mike Hammer (superbly played with unflinching ferocity and steely resolve by Ralph Meeker) stumbles onto a nefarious plot that puts his life in great danger when he decides to investigate the mysterious death of doomed hitchhiker Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman in her fine film debut).Director Robert Aldrich astutely nails the pervasive paranoia of the 50's Cold War era, offers a vivid depiction of a harsh world that's largely populated by deadly and hostile people (ironically, ostensible "hero" Hammer in particular comes across as one real nasty and selfish bastard), delivers several startling moments of savage violence, and maintains an unsparingly bleak, gritty, and amoral tone throughout. The hard-hitting script by A.J. Bezzerides provides plenty of spot-on stinging commentary on mankind's self-destructive nature. The sterling acting from a topflight cast keeps this movie humming: Albert Dekker as elusive scientist Dr. G.E. Soberin, Patrick Stewart as shifty bigwig Carl Evello, Maxine Cooper as Hammer's loyal secretary Velda, Nick Dennis as jolly mechanic Nick, Gaby Rodgers as ditsy dame Gabrielle, and Wesley Addy as the browbeating Lt. Pat Murphy. Moreover, there are memorable bits by Jack Lambert and Jack Elam as a pair of vicious goons, Juano Hernandez as streetwise boxing manager Eddie Yaeger, Strother Martin as antsy truck driver Harvey Wallace, Marion Carr as the flirtatious Friday, and Percy Helton as sniveling worm coroner Doc Kennedy. Gorgeously shot in moody black and white by Ernest Laszlo, with a brooding score by Fran De Vol, and a complete doozy of a nightmarish apocalyptic ending, this honey rates highly as one of the best film noirs from the 1950's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine film, but not quite the classic I was getting ready to go see. It's tough, gritty and fast paced. There's a whole bunch of colorful characters ('Va va voom krr POW!) with in between a couple of enchanting and / or sharp dames. There is our cool Meeker who thoroughly enjoys his rough stuff type of work. And then there's a story which, even if for a long while it all too easily moves from one clue (or character) to the next, ends in a refreshingly abundant apocalypse. I didn't see that particular suitcase (which I saw before in 1984 'Repo Man' and 'Pulp Fiction', and did Miike Takashi use this as well in 'Dead or Alive: Hanzaisha'?) coming of course, and for a minute there I was expecting the genre to switch flat out into science-fiction or fantasy mode...A big 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious Shifts In Tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It gets off to a good start. A scared woman runs down a dark highway desperate for a ride. Detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) happens along and grudgingly gives the lady a lift. And as they drive down the lonely highway, with the woman sobbing, the credits roll and Nat King Cole sings in the background a downbeat, jazzy tune.This intro sets a noir tone. But at the script's inciting incident moments later, the plot takes an abrupt turn and the tone shifts accordingly. The film's tone keeps shifting throughout. And I'm not sure what the writers wanted this film to be. Sometimes it seems like noir. At other times it seems thuggish and gangster driven. And more than a few times the story seems like some strange nightmare out of "The Twilight Zone".The overall plot hints at a big secret. Which made me curious and kept me watching. In most mystery films, the "mystery" usually relates to people; who did what to whom, when, where, and how. "Kiss Me Deadly" is different in that the mystery relates less to specific characters than to ideas. Clues are quite subtle, which is good. But some of the story's questions, both explicit and implicit, are never answered.Mike Hammer comes across as cold, cynical, and brooding. He's also reticent and emotionally aloof. Would like to have seen what Bogart could have done with this role. By comparison, and consistent with 1950s culture, women project weakness and fragility.The B&amp;W lighting is probably the film's best element. It evokes both mystery and suspense, particularly at night. There are lots of noir shadows and some interesting POV camera shots. And the music, by Frank Devol, adds depth to the story's mystery.This is a curious film. When one knows the ending, the story fits right in with 1950s American culture. Yet, until that ending is revealed, the film feels altogether different, almost alien. Maybe the tonal shifts are deliberate. But though I found the film not altogether satisfying, I also found it intriguing in its ability to withhold information from viewers, right up to that hokey but fascinating finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brutal, Influential, and Insidious Film-Noir. Detective Mike Hammer motivates through a completely Out of Balanced World, that is run by Fascists like Hammer, a Dr. Soberin, the Mafia and the Military Industrial Complex,with Mickey Spillane's Macho demeanor, detachment, and Swagger. It is a Sexually Charged saturation that is evident from the Beginning. A Naked Girl wearing only a coat is running down the highway panting and sounds like She is about to Orgasm and this heavy breathing continues through the opening Backward Titles.This is a loud and Vibrant Movie that has punctuation of Punches, head Slamming, Torture, Knifing, Shootings, Slapping, Drugging, Boozing, car Bombings, Beatings, Burnings, and more. There was Never Anything Subtle about Spillane's Writing and there sure isn't anything Subtle going on here.Made in the Eisenhower era when there was an Illusion of Safety and Security. This along with the same years "The Big Combo", are Grandiose in their presentation of Style Over Substance (ironically, a criticism of the 50"s culture) and in this Film that veneer is Penetrated and there is nothing but a "Great Whats-It?" underneath, unleashed to Purify the Corruption and the Decay of a Society that prides itself in Technology (cars, radio/TVs, answering machines, atomic energy).This is a Hammered home Assault on the Senses and is glaringly Over the Top in all respects and it emerges as Surreal Modern Art. This is an Exceptional Work that could be called a Moving Picture Picasso with its sharp Angled displays of the already Distorted. But not everyone appreciates Modern Art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this on the big screen. I had rented it many years ago, and the small screen does not do it justice. Here are some observations, maybe redundant, I haven't read all the other reviews: 1) remarkable for a 1950s film in that African-Americans are actually given substantive parts; 2) this movie is just about utterly cynical- there isn't a "good guy" in it, or even someone with a "gruff exterior/heart of gold"; every character seems to be rotten in one way or another; 3) I love the irony that the character who seems the weakest and the neediest is the one who ends up with the thing that everyone is chasing after (and pays the price for it). Every scene seems to contain a wealth of detail, the narrative zooms by, and the images are stunning. An awesome movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top-of-the-Tree Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only a top film on the film noir circuit, Kiss Me Deadly rates high with the auteur brigade as well. In fact, spear-headed by an over-the-top, adulatory review in Cahiers du Cinéma by Francois Truffaut, Kiss Me Deadly was regarded as the auteur's quintessential film noir until it was eclipsed by Aldrich's own Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? in 1962. Around that time, Aldrich himself had grown tired of the acclaim showered on Kiss Me Deadly. When "George Addison" interviewed him in 1962, Aldrich mentioned Kiss Me Deadly only in passing. He much preferred to talk about his problems with Ten Seconds to Hell, The Angry Hills and Sodom and Gomorrah.Nevertheless, Kiss Me Deadly stands up rather well ? especially if you ignore the confused and confusing plot and concentrate on the constant parade of really bizarre characters that enliven the screen instead. Ralph Meeker is ideally cast as Spillane's Mike Hammer ? who is modeled on Spillane himself. In fact Spillane actually played the role officially on screen in 1963's The Girl Hunters, although it could be said that the character he played in 1954's Ring of Fear was a Hammer clone if ever there was one.Expertly photographed in appropriately nourish lighting by Ernest Laszlo, Kiss Me Deadly keeps both a general and a cineaste audience enthralled from beginning to end. True, the plot is deliberately obscure and hard (though not impossible) to follow, due to the brevity of information in the dialogue and the often rapid delivery of the players. These factors successfully disguise the fact that what Spillane and Aldrich are serving up is not really a mystery story at all, but science fiction. True, this anomaly has fostered little criticism. The complaints I have heard all center around the facts that the plot is both too obscure as well as too fast-paced to comprehend ? and that so many characters flit by on-screen that it's impossible to keep track of them all.But I, for one, am not grousing. Not one bit! Usually the fault of most movies made on "B" budgets is that they present such a limited number of characters and changes of scene, their visuals soon become monotonous. That certainly doesn't happen with Kiss Me Deadly, which is always on the move ? and with a cast list of fascinating players as long as your arm!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Great Whatsit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This one showed up near the finish line of the classic Film Noir era, and has some features that make it stand out: unusual female characters, a quasi-parody feel, and a twisty ending unlike others from the genre. Based loosely on the Mickey Spillane pulp novel, the screenplay comes from AI Bezzerides, who is best known as the creator of the TV series "The Big Valley". The biggest impact comes from director Robert Aldrich.Aldrich is a bit under-appreciated in Hollywood history having also directed Whatever Happened to Baby Jane; Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte; The Dirty Dozen; and The Longest Yard (the good one). Here he turns up the intensity on the Private Investigator story by having Mike Hammer (a terrific Ralph Meeker) be quite a bit more forceful and aggressive than Marlowe and the previous film PI's.The film starts quite abruptly with one of the more fascinating beginnings in all of cinema. A panicky woman is running barefoot down a highway wearing nothing but a bathrobe. That woman is Cloris Leachman (her screen debut) and she nearly causes Hammer to wreck his pristine Jaguar. Their relationship doesn't last long, but it leads to a very unique torture scene that is almost entirely out the viewer's sight line. Still, we quickly realize Hammer is in some deep trouble and he's not the kind to let it be.Two other very interesting female characters are part of the story: Gaby Rodgers plays Lily Carver as a conniving trickster and Maxine Cooper is outstanding as Velda, Hammer's trusty assistant and maybe more. Ms. Rodgers and Ms. Cooper have other common ground. They soon disappeared from Hollywood films as both married powerful men in the business. Rodgers married the famous songwriter Jerry Lieber, who wrote many Elvis hits. and Cooper married an Oscar nominated writer.The cast features many prominent actors of the time including Albert Dekker, Paul Stewart, Wesley Addy, Nick Dennis, Jack Elam, and Jack Lambert. There is also a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid connection. Strother Martin has a brief scene as does Percy Helton (as the Medical Examiner). In Butch Cassidy movie, Martin is the Bolivian payroll supervisor who hires the boys, and Helton is "Sweetface" who gives away their hiding place. Another note on Helton: he had one of the longest acting careers in history 1915-1978 (which was 7 years after his death).If you love films from the 40's and 50's, then this is a must see. It certainly has a place in Film Noir lore, and also has numerous other points of interest. Keep in mind that it was filmed at the height of the Atomic Bomb era ... when scare tactics were the norm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't care for this a whole lot when I first watched it. In the meantime I've developed a tremendous appetite for noir, this is widely considered one of the greats, and the guys on the "Out of the Past" podcast gushed over it. So I took the plunge and bought the Blu-Ray. I think my earlier complaints are for the most part no longer an issue. Originally I praised the beginning and ending but found the bulk of the film repetitive and dull. Now I still would like more plot development to be going on, but realize that the devil is in the details... it's not so much what is happening, but how it's happening, this journey through a world of paranoia and violence. I made an aside about Hammer being a douchebag, but as I suspected, this is entirely intentional, with neither the director nor the screenwriter caring for the character. This is really a non-issue anyway, there's nothing wrong with an anti-hero. My other comment was about the acting, but now I find the performances quite memorable (especially being familiar with many of the character actors) if not entirely "good" in the modern sense. The film still doesn't really grab me, but I understand better the charm it holds for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>kiss me deadly review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a classic noir. Robert Aldrich's black and white picture stars Ralph Meeker as the lantern-jawed PI Mike Hammer - a man so tough you're never sure whether he's going to stub out his cigarette in the palm of his hand or in somebody else's eyeball. After picking up the scantily-clad girl he's just run down, Hammer finds himself in a semi-conscious state while his hitchhiker is slowly being tortured to death. The cops want Hammer to spill his guts, but instead the dick decides to carry out his own investigation - a labyrinthine feat that will introduce him to the baddest of the bad and see him come into contact with a container whose contents are so dangerous they make Pandora's Box look like a packet of Quality Street. The brutality of the film's characters and its scenario are appalling enough today, but in 1955, they were something else. While the movie portrays the tough guy look and personality, it also has a payoff drawn directly from the fears of the Cold War. Manhattan Project?Los Alamos?Trinity; these are the key words that signal the change in the film's setting from regular crime to nuclear danger. But on the way to its ending, director Robert Aldrich makes it a relentlessly hazardous experience, with a hero you wouldn't want to have as a friend, and a sense of dread so blatant that cinematographer Ernest Laszlo captures it on film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apocalyptic film noir is what one person used to describe this film. Seems the director (Robert Aldrich) was not crazy about the original story and made some changes that makes the story as real today as it was in the 50s.Ralph Meeker, who had a long career in films was a virtual unknown at the time he was picked to be the detective Mike Hammer. He was in Anthony Mann's The Naked Spur, but that was about it. He does a great Mike Hammer, even if you think of Stacey Keach first.Hammer picks up Christina (Cloris Leachman, in her film debut) on the side of the road and the adventure begins.Earlier this year, Maxine Cooper died at the age of 84. She made her film debut here, and then virtually disappeared. She made an outstanding Velda, Hammer's secretary, but chose marriage over acting.One of the more interesting characters was Greek actor Nick Dennis, who provided continual laughs when he was on screen as Hammer's mechanic.There was even a young Jack Elam as one of the tough guys. He wasn't so tough against Hammer. Well, he did better the second time.I don't know how accurate things were when Gabrielle (Gaby Rodgers) opened the box, and I am sure it wasn't even close, but it sure made for and exciting ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Otherworldly Noir Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiss Me Deadly manages to combine the best and worst from the world of film noir cinema. By worst I mean a labyrinthine, absurd plot with lots of mysterious characters whose motivations and behaviour are unexplainable. By best I mean witty, fast talk, non-stop action (so you won't have time to think about all the plot inanities), and truly despicable human beings, the type in '50s American cinema you could only find in trashy, low-budget noir movies like this one. But Kiss Me Deadly goes one step further: the cops are unlikeable, the villains are unlikeable, the dames are unlikeable, the hero is unlikeable. This movie is such a panegyric to human scum I wonder how it wasn't toned down or censored or banned fifty years ago.Ralph Meeker plays Mike Hammer (and you'll never find a better noir name than that!), a sleazy PI who specialises in divorces. One day he has the bad luck of giving a night lift to a woman who just escaped from a psychiatric asylum. They're shortly intercepted, the woman is killed and Mike just doesn't die because otherwise there wouldn't be a movie. With revenge and a thirst for the truth, Mike rages through L.A. looking for clues and meting out justice to whoever had anything to do with the mysterious woman's death.Whether the payoff to the big secret is worth the movie, I'm still trying to decide. For a 1955 movie it was certainly as big as it could get, but it's also so big it reminds one what a piece of fiction it all is. But then again the whole movie is so strange from start to finish, the otherworldly nature of the secret is just the final touch in this tapestry of mayhem, greed, stupidity, double-crossing and human frailty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal, Dark &amp; Cynical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A I Bezzerides' screen adaptation of Mickey Spillane's "Kiss Me Deadly" used an inspired combination of familiar and contemporary elements in order to create an exceptionally powerful and compelling thriller. A private detective engaged in a complicated investigation, hard boiled dialogue, a duplicitous woman and ruthless criminals are all typical film noir components but these are also augmented by some mid-1950s new technology such as the telephone answering machine and a "MacGuffin" which is symbolic of the major fear/threat which preoccupied people at the time when the movie was made. With its riveting opening sequence, a twisting plot and a sensational conclusion, it's easy to see how this low budget offering grew to be considered a film noir classic.Director Robert Aldrich and cinematographer Ernest Laszlo combine brilliantly to provide the many well composed scenes which complement the plot's dark cynicism so effectively. A variety of unusual and interesting camera angles, powerful close-ups and slanted perspectives all contribute to the unsettling atmosphere. The overall sense of disorientation which these techniques induce is also further enhanced by the opening credits which roll in the wrong direction.Private detective Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) is driving along the highway one night when a woman dressed only in a trench coat stops him and he grudgingly agrees to take her to the nearest bus stop. She tells him that she's just escaped from the local "laughing house" where she was being held as a prisoner. When they stop at a filling station, the woman named Christina (Cloris Leachman) gives the attendant a letter to mail and when she gets back in the car asks Mike to remember her if, for any reason, she doesn't make it safely to the bus stop. Shortly after, the couple are attacked, Mike is knocked unconscious and Christina is cruelly tortured and dies. Her body and the still unconscious Mike are then put into his car which the unknown attackers push off a cliff.Later, Mike wakes up in hospital and when he's fit to leave is questioned by federal agents. They quiz him about Christina but being instinctively uncooperative, he tells them nothing. After being released, Mike decides to investigate the matter himself.Christina had told Mike that she was named after the poet Christina Rossetti and during his investigation Mike visits Christina's home and sees a book of Rossetti's poems which he takes away with him. He discovers that the letter that Christina had sent from the filling station had been sent to him and simply said "Remember Me". After locating Christina's frightened roommate Lily Carver (Gaby Rodgers), he takes her back to his place and together they try to deduce the meaning of Christina's message. The clue they need is discovered in one of Rossetti's poems and this leads to the discovery of a key which in turn leads them to a metal box in a locker at the Hollywood Athletic Club. Mike opens it and is shocked to see that it contains a brightly glowing substance which burns his wrist. He immediately closes the box and returns it to the locker.Mike returns to his car to find that Lily has disappeared and after getting in touch with his police contact Lieutenant Pat Murphy (Wesley Addy) learns that the real Lily's dead body had been found some time ago. Pat sees the burn on Mike's wrist and utters the words "Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Trinity". Mike recognising that he's unable to cope with this type of investigation responds by passing the key to Pat.Lily's impostor (Gabrielle) steals the box from the HAC locker and takes it to her boss at a beach house. However, a disagreement between them leads to a sequence of events which culminate in the film's spectacularly violent ending."Kiss Me Deadly" contained an extraordinary amount of violence for the time in which it was made. As well as Christina being tortured with pliers and killed, one of Mike's friends is crushed to death by a car when the jack that was supporting it is released and a criminal who was already tied up is stabbed to death. Mike is beaten up, shot, knocked unconscious and tied up on more then one occasion and also dishes out a few beatings. Numerous other characters also suffer violent deaths. A couple of other incidents also highlight Mike's sadistic streak. On one occasion, he beats up a guy who'd been tailing him by repeatedly banging his head against a wall before propelling him down a very long series of stone steps. On another occasion, when a corrupt doctor tries to extort too much money from him, Mike traps the man's fingers in a drawer and repeatedly crushes them with extreme force. After both of these incidents, the expressions on Mike's face convey the level of pleasure that he derives from this type of brutality.Mike Hammer is depicted as a deplorable thug whose normal line of business involves blackmailing adulterous couples after they've been caught in compromising situations which he sets up. During his car journey with Christina, she accurately summed him up as a person who only thinks of himself and his possessions and who, in relationships, never gives, only takes. His motivation in pursuing the investigation was purely selfish because he thought that the involvement of so many people in the events surrounding Christina's death must mean that there had to be something very valuable that they were all chasing.Meeker is particularly good as the unlikable Hammer but the performances by the entire cast are also remarkably strong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can see where this movie got itself into trouble with the Arbiters Of Morality when it was released in 1955, because neither the screenplay nor the cinematography pulls any punches here. The violence is sickening and brutal, the characters are driven and unlikeable, the sexuality is barely contained, and the ending (I saw the one where Hammer and Velma make it out of the house and watch it vaporize from relative safety) is genuinely unsettling.I'd never seen Ralph Meeker in any role before, but he filled out the Mike Hammer character in ways that were at least as interesting as any actor in roles after him. It was weird seeing such a handsome guy act as twisted and bitter as any cheap hood or screen villain in every noir film before hand.I have to mention one scene - where Hammer pries open the Mystery Box for a split second and a horrifying actinic flash and a nerve scraping sound effect stun the view before Hammer slams the box closed again - just in time. That little scene was worth the price of the DVD.Wow. Just...wow.</fullReview>

I felt like although the storyline was quite unrealistic and a lot of characters had no background information, it was full of action, and fast moving enough to get my attention. Yeah the acting was pretty bad. . . . . but hey there were car crashes and torture scenes and of course murders. I enjoyed how there wasn't really anyone who was a "Good Guy" and how everybody was like tainted in some way. I felt the lighting on set was good, for instance the dark alleys and streets. Also the darkness used with the staircases was pretty cool. All in all i give, "Kiss me Deadly" 3 out of 6 chicken nuggets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Kiss Me Deadly (1955) one can understand that the overzealous Hollywood thrillers are here to say. Pre-1940s horror films had a different quality and a different feel to them, they weren't trying to be real. Kiss Me Deadly is a somewhat bland Hollywood production, the script is so-so and the acting isn't great. The thing that always puzzles me about these films is that movies made 35 years previous seem to have much more beautiful lighting and acting, even though it was a far more primitive time. Take for instance, a movie like I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang, made some 23 years previous, has a much more startling production. The feel and lighting has a much greater artistic feel. It seems as though with age films should get better, not worse (But there are many exceptions to this accusation). To me this film stands side by side to, say, something like Stephen King's Pet Semetary, a thriller made simply to thrill. No other ideas were taken into consideration when this film was made, and you can tell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Kiss me Deadly" is a minor noir notable for it's surreal imagery and sci-fi overtones.The plot is simple: Out driving one night, Detective Mike Hammer encounters a young woman on the road. She's recently escaped from a lunatic asylum and is being pursued by several violent thugs. These thugs attack Hammer and kill the woman, leaving Hammer bent on revenge. Hammer eventually learns that the thugs are after a mysterious glowing box which contains stollen radioactive material. Why do they want this box and where does it come from? No explanation is given, though this hasn't stopped audiences and critics attributing countless apocalyptic allegories to the film. Screenwriter Albert Bezzerides mocks these viewpoints, though, claiming that he detested writing such a hack screenplay and was only interested in making each moment as interesting as possible.Yes, "Kiss me Deadly" ends with an iconic sequence, but much of the film is merely routine, the dialogue pedestrian and the visuals unimpressive when stacked up to greater noirs. What's interesting is actor Ralph Meeker's take on Private Investigator Mike Hammer. He turns the Hammer of Spillane's books, a pacifist and man of conscience, into a sleazy detective who wallows in messy divorce cases, often manipulating their outcomes to his own advantage. 7/10 - Aside from a great opening sequence and bombastic finale, this little noir has lost much of its bite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take an "Atomic Age meets Pandora's Box" plot, a main character with no redeeming features,a face like an anvil and a brain to match,the empathy of a sociopath and the penchant for violence of the seriously disturbed,a mysterious woman on the run who quotes from the 19th Century English writer Christina Rosetti,corrupt cops,mobsters and an Armageddon ending,hand it to a 1950s Studio Hack and you would get a 75 minute second feature popcorn fodder of a movie.Give it to the right person - in this case Mr Robert Aldrich - and you have as near perfect an example of a Film Noir as you can get. Mr Spillane's spicy bodice rippers were hot stuff in those repressed times and Mike Hammer a wish - fulfilment figure for hormonal teenage boys who blushed furiously whilst surreptitiously gazing at their "come on" covers. Few would have bet on Hollywood successfully translating their superheated atmosphere on to the screen,but "Kiss me deadly" succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Insolent,priapic and West Coast hip,Mr Ralph Meeker bulldozed his way through the movie,the Sean Connery of Mike Hammers.Miss Cloris Leachman as Christina was the archetypal "damaged angel" beloved of the genre. Mr Aldrich whose subsequent work tended to get bigger and noisier rather than better,kept philosophising to the minimum and the movie ran straight as a die along its allotted path. Despite countless "hommages",pastiches and downright copies,"Kiss me deadly" has never been approached,let alone bettered.It is every bit as good as its reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine low-budget thriller with great noir visual style. If only professional critics would stop talking about nuclear metaphors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Nat Cole's smooth, melancholy delivery sends "Rather Have the Blues Than What I've Got" out of Mike Hammer's car radio late one night, we know nothing good is going to happen. Hammer has just picked up a desperate young woman named Christina who had been running down an isolated California two-lane rode. "The room is dark and gloomy, you don't know what you're doing to me. The way it has got me caught, I'd rather have the blues than what I've got." The lyrics might not be so good, but Cloris Leachman's frightened urgency as Christina sets the movie on the fast track. It's not long before Hammer's car is forced off the road, he's beaten senseless, and wakes up on a bed listening to shrieks of pain as Christina, hanging from her wrists, is tortured to death in a vain attempt by someone to learn a secret. In the short time we knew Christina we'd come to like her. She knew people were after her. She tells Hammer to let her out at a bus stop while he drives on. "That bus stop will be coming up pretty soon," Hammer says to her, "and I don't even know your name." "You forget. I'm a loony from the laughing house," she tells him "All loonies are dangerous. Ever read poetry? No, of course you wouldn't. Christina Rossetti wrote love sonnets. I was named after her." "Christina?" Hammer says. "Yes, Mike. Get me to that bus stop and forget you ever saw me. If we don't make that bus stop..." "We will," Hammer tells her confidently. "...if we don't," she continues, "remember me." Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) is a private eye who specializes in divorce work. He has a suggestive, live-in secretary named Velda. He and Velda often set up honey traps for the poor-sap husbands, and a little side action involving blackmail brings in extra cash. Hammer is a hard head, has no respect for the law but seems to love dishing out vigilante justice. Beating thugs to within an inch of their lives gives him satisfaction. From the time he decides to do justice to the memory of Christina to the conclusion of the movie, Mike Hammer meets one person after another who he beats, slaps, crushes their hands and breaks their phonograph records as he tracks down the mysterious Mr. Big, a man determined to posses a leather box which stays warm...a box that you open only if you want to die. Kiss Me Deadly is a good movie for two reasons. It has great noir style and is one of the best photographed noirs, by Ernest Laszlo, I've ever seen. It also is directed by William Aldrich with supremely confident craftsmanship. Aldrich gives us efficient story-telling with no dawdling. He keeps the plot moving with a deft combination of tension, violence, menace and some fine, off-center characterizations from the secondary actors. The movie has narrative rhythm. It also has the curse laid on it of tedious analysis by popular culture enthusiasts and film critics who should know better. Says one critic, "Kiss Me Deadly is the definitive, apocalyptic, nihilistic, science-fiction film noir of all time." Oh, come on. Kiss Me Deadly is a very well- crafted low budget pulp mystery thriller. Because that warm thing in a box happens to be nuclear, and because the movie ends with a bang, too many people, in my view, have read all sorts of pretentious allegories into the film. These people lay on the analysis of Kiss Me Deadly as heavily as makeup on a street walker. In 1999, for goodness sake, Kiss Me Deadly was even deemed "culturally significant" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. I prefer the amusing viewpoint of A. I. Bezzerides, who wrote the screenplay. Bezzerides denied any intent to make the movie a metaphor for the potential horrors of the Cold War. "I was having fun with it," he has said. "I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting." That he did, including a clever clue using a phrase from Christina Rossetti's fine poem, "Remember." In fact, said Bezzerides of the script, "I wrote it fast because I had contempt for it. I tell you Spillane didn't like what I did with his book. I ran into him at a restaurant and, boy, he didn't like me". Although the movie starts with some poor song lyrics, let's end with some good lyrics from Rossetti's Remember, written to her husband before she died. There're the key to Mike Hammer's puzzle...and the key was found in a beautiful corpse's stomach: Remember me when I am gone away, Gone far away into the silent land; When you can no more hold me by the hand, Nor I half turn to go, yet turning stay.Remember me when no more day by day You tell me of our future that you plann'd:Only remember me; you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray. Yet if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieve: For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had, Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish Aldrich thriller pounds away on the viewer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to surmise whether Robert Aldrich meant "Kiss Me Deadly" to be so wildly overwrought; perhaps this was the way the filmmaker saw the changing times being reflected in the cinema. Ralph Meeker is exceptional and well-cast as super-tough private eye Mike Hammer, slapping the bad guys around while solving a murder case. Cloris Leachman plays a jittery pick-up on the run from scummy underworld types; she involves Hammer in her plight, leading to bizarre climax. Sub-plot involving a supernatural box gives the film an odd horror movie undercurrent, and is curiously never explained (providing subtext for many modern filmmakers like Tarantino). Extremely stylish film-noir, it has gained its largest following in France and is now considered a cult classic. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so unusual it seems to leave a variety of impressions for the viewer to pick from.In the first few minutes the film grabs everyones attention with the torture of the girl picked up on the highway.While her screams blare away the lower half of her body is shown suspended in mid-air,the viewer is left to squirm and try to figure out how this is being done. Something seemed missing from that scene.What didn't seem right was the showing of the legs and the screaming but no movement from the legs.Thinking about it fast I came to the conclusion no leg movement was better,having the legs jerk about might of made the scene almost unbearable to watch.Throughout the movie I chose to overlook small flaws and ended up being entertained.This past week I viewed the complete movie for the first time.A few years ago I'd seen like the last 15 minutes of this film.Even though knowing the ending when watching it this time around it still kept me in suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brutal PI In Way Over His Head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a lonely stretch of road Mickey Spillane's famous private detective Mike Hammer picks up a dazed and confused Cloris Leachman in her big screen debut, trying to thumb a ride. He picks her up, but shortly afterward they're both attacked and he's left unconscious and she's dead. Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer wants to find out why of course, a reaction similar to the one Dick Powell as Philip Marlowe had in Murder My Sweet when something exactly like this occurred. But Powell didn't have not only the local police, but the FBI snooping around in this apparent street crime.Meeker's motives are not noble, he smells a big pay day. And while he's honest, he's not squeamish in the slightest about how he gets information. He runs into a variety of movie bad guys like Paul Richards, Strother Martin, Jack Lambert, Paul Stewart, and Albert Dekker. Some are helpful, some are not. The bodies start to pile up and what this is all about is a McGuffin to end all McGuffins. Let's just say the police in the person of Wesley Addy and the FBI had very good reason to tell Meeker to butt out. In fact his very entrance into the case causes a lot of fatalities.This turned out to be Ralph Meeker's career role. Perhaps had Meeker come along earlier or had gotten better breaks he could have had a great career in noir type films. As it was he became a respected character actor. Another performance you'll like is that of Nick Dennis who's a garage mechanic and part time leg man for Hammer.Juano Hernandez has an interesting part as well. He's a fight manager and not above taking a dishonest dollar if he can turn one. He's a reliable tipster, but the well runs dry about this case when Meeker questions him. But the performance really to watch is that of Gaby Rodgers who is a femme fatale to beat all. She makes Mary Astor in The Maltese Falcon and Claire Trevor in Murder My Sweet look like Girl Scouts. Watch the ending, it's so incredibly surreal it will stay with you forever.Can't tell you what the McGuffin is, it will give it all away. But it will be worth your while to see Kiss Me Deadly to find out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional up until the very disappointing ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the "Noir-est" Film Noir films I have ever seen. This is because the level of violence and graphic nature of the film was excessive even for this dark genre. In so many ways, the film looks far different from the typical Noir flick. Again and again and again, the anti-hero, Mike Hammer, beats the snot out of his foes. He also is not above beating the stuffing out of semi-innocent people to get the answers he needs. Some particularly violent acts he commits--knocking a bloody and beaten guy down a flight of at least 50 steps, slamming a doctor's hand in a door and pushing VERY hard until he talked, cold-cocking bad guys and smashing guys' heads into the wall! In addition, he uttered such classy lines as "tell her to shut up"! This private detective was certainly no gentleman and was as low-down and vile as the people he was investigating! I actually liked this, because too often, Noir Films pulled their punches--this one never did. In addition to a very violent leading man, the film also has blood, stabbings and even a loud and disturbing torture scene!!! When this is combined with a relatively unknown cast (though some later went on to fame), the results are a very vivid and believable film.However, despite all the greatness of the characterizations, the film badly fumbles in the last few minutes--so badly, the film almost merits a score of 7. I don't really want to explain why because it may spoil the film for you, but scientifically the film just was way, way overdone and impossible at the end. Just see it for yourself and you'll probably see what I mean! I am lucky that my wife is a chemical/nuclear engineer, as she confirmed that I was right about the ridiculousness of the conclusion. While cool to see, it just wasn't at all logical.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe this is Mickey Spillane's problem, but the movie was boring. It took too long to unfold, the fights were mostly poorly executed, following somebody down the street was amateurish. The noirish characteristics, the lighting, the criminal-thuggish-threatening parts of the film were OK. The ending with the Doctor and the opening of the box, the problem with this is that these were characters, in the case of the doctor, nonexistent until the final scene, and in the case of the girl, well, she was at least there for a while. It was hard to follow, figuring out what everything meant. The end of the house was pretty spectacular, though. And I believe it's right to criticize a film and not give it a break just because it's from another time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went there to see a classic film noir. I'm not disappointed. Admiring the result neither. The directing, the writing are good. That's for what's interesting. The remaining makes Kiss me deadly a film noir cliché more than a classic to me. From the narrative thread (call it a string or a tight rope if you like) to the casting and acting many things are too much. Mike Hammer -played by a never-too-good Ralph Meeker- is a 'stinking' private investigator but he never seems to be really in trouble even if he is always at a loss. The police are out there, the villains are up here and big Mike goes his way. Eventually too much is the Pandora's box. Interesting but a B movie because of the acting. The difference is easy if you compare with that true classic film noir starring Robert Mitchum: Out of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw it and I have to say it's really like no film I've ever seen before. Style-wise, it still seems as fresh today as it did 50 years ago. Not only is it a great example of film noir, but I believe the movie transcends that genre. While it's set up like a noir film, I believe its trying to say something greater concerning the Cold War and the A-Bomb. While i love the film noir genre, which has created some of this country's greatest art, usually our detective "hero" uncovers a plot involving murder, blackmail or deception with the catalyst being simple human emotions like greed and lust.While the character motivations are similar, primarily Hammer's own greed, the end result is something far more darker than just an insurance fraud (Double Indemnity) or climbing the social ladder(Farewell, My Lovely). At the bottom of Hammer's detective work lies nuclear annihilation.The violence in this movie is pretty graphic for its time, such as when Hammer knocks a thug's head repeatedly against a wall or slams a desk drawer on someone's hand. The movie also oozes sex. Its interesting to note that Hammer repeatedly turns down women's advances. His primary motivation is greed.I could go on and on about this movie, but I really believe this is a truly great, original movie. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Beginning to a film.....EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People always talk about good endings in film, and a lot of these films stick in the mind (My personal favourites - The Third Man and Dark Star). By comparison, the beginning of a film is rarely talked about or remembered. The intro from Kiss Me Deadly, however, will forever be etched in my memory. From the opening shot with the solitary sound of footsteps, through to the pre-Star Wars title sequence, to the immortal lines "Remember me..." uttered by Cloris Leachman (who manages to almost steal the film with so little screen time), all this should act as a reminder of just how effective an intro sequence can really be if in the hands of a master. Then to the rest of the film, with a rollercoster ride of beatings, betrayals, double crosses, and all assortments of truly immoral characters, put together by one of the most pessimistic minds in cinema. In fact, there is hardly a character in the whole film with any redeeming features, as Aldrich paints a world full of self-serving inconsiderate rascals out all thirsting after the riches contained within Pandora's Box. At the time, I imagine that this film was seen as a post-modern homage to the film noir genre, in the same way that Scream was to 80's horror. Micky Spillane is essentially Sam Spade taken to the nth degree, with more wisecracks and more beatings piled in for good measure. It all adds up to a thoroughly enjoyable romp which should not be taken too seriously, whilst all the time admiring the technical genius at the helm. Wonderful stuff!</fullReview>

Of course it was Spillaine but even Spillaine wrote better stuff. In fact it was on the brink of parody with the obligatory bar room singer singing a forgettable song and the down beat Hammer looking fed up drooping into his glass and most of the other stereotyped ethnics doing their bit to look streetwise. You could make a good send up of the genre taking essentials from this movie. The acting was abysmal and most of the script was flat. The only lively dialogue was with the interview with the Feds but it never kept it up. I'll forgive the silly radiation effects as the fifties public had little understanding of the hazards like when Dr No fell into an open reactor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This grade B Mike Hammer flick has its fans. But I found its amateurish acting and bad script very offputting. It drags a lot And I felt it played like a bad copy of a copy of a copy of someone else's work. It doesn't seem to understand that drawing things out is just one tactic in the storytelling arsenal; one that mixes beautifully with occasional developments. This movie trowels on intrigue until about the final ten minutes, long after you're ready for a few hints at what's going on. It just never really grabbed me.There are only two types of characters in this movie, obnoxious ones and annoying ones. Hammer is obnoxious: he backhands about thirty-seven people over the course of things. Christine's roommate and Nick (the ass at the garage) are on the irritating team.I like the beautiful noir camera work and one shot of a box of light being opened is pretty memorable. It has stilted language, like the crappiest low-rent wrter's idea of how classy people talk. One bad actor late in things actually makes the two-part snoring noise (snort-scheeeeew) to enact being asleep. And Zelda is a tease imitating better teases.This is the earliest movie where the malevolent force receives personification It would be nice though if every time someone opened the box it didn't sound likes someone whispering "aaaaay-ay-aaaay."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stylishly photographed (DP Laszlo managed to make a lot of films look better than they were in his long career), almost nonsensichal Mike Hammer detective film. May seem better to those who have not seen a lot of detective films, but in reality it's a fairly unexceptional piece of work. Stark realism and absurdity (a glowing box that kills people who open it, much like the sunglasses in "Not of this Earth") are juxtaposed sometimes for comedy, but unfortunately all too often this film's tongue in cheek sensibility gives way to its straightforward demeanor. Memorable beginning sequence with the hitchhiker and ambush. However, the acting is VERY clunky throughout, and the film's visual stylisms get the better of its real substance, which is pretty thin to begin with. This film has often been imitated by people who make better films than the original (i.e. Goddard's "Alphaville" or "Repo Man"). I'm not sure why so many people seem to like this movie so much, but all I can say is that the first time I saw it I was blown away, so I took my friend to see it soon afterwards and we were both unimpressed. I ended up seeing it again about a year later, and this film (like Tarantino's derivative "Pulp Fiction") just seems to get worse every time I see it. I can't fully explain it, but the biggest part is that it's just so unconvincing and the acting is so bad, I try to laugh at it and enjoy it as a crazy B-movie, but then it seems to take itself so seriously (probably director Aldrich's fault, because a lot of his movies are more serious than they deserve to be) that I can't laugh at it, I just get more and more annoyed. If anyone can explain how I can once again enjoy this movie as I did when it was fresh, I'm all ears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Maltese Falcon and Kiss Me Deadly are similar in that both movies open with a young, attractive, and mysterious young woman randomly entering the life of the main protagonist which triggers a series of events revolving around a McGuffin. But whereas The Maltese Falcon can be taken seriously, the same cannot be said for Kiss Me Deadly. Kiss Me Deadly is pure camp. In this movie, the caricature of the aggressive, pushy, anti-law, anti-hero, no-nonsense, amoral tough guy is perfected. Mike Hammer is "one of those self-indulgent males who thinks about nothing but his clothes, his car, himself." Ralph Meeker's performance as Hammer must be rated as one of the greatest performances in the history of film noir. Meeker sets the standard for this type of role. The film's screenwriter, A. I. Bezzerides, wrote the script for fun. Bezzerides said, "People ask me about the hidden meanings in the script, about the A-bomb, about McCarthyism, what does the poetry mean, and so on. And I can only say that I didn't think about it when I wrote it . . . I was having fun with it." The idea of a medical doctor lugging around a box containing a mysterious and dangerous thing that is "hot", or of a harried, disheveled gumshoe repeatedly screwing up, or of the same gumshoe barging into a health club and demanding to look inside some guy's locker, or of the gumshoe possessing what may be the single largest and gaudiest personal telephone answering machine in history, or of the gumshoe having a girlfriend that's part-secretary, part-confidante, part-lover and completely a whore, or of the gumshoe's best friend being an auto mechanic who looks, sounds, and acts like Jerry Colonna, or of the gumshoe driving around in expensive sports cars had to be written for laughs. It is virtually impossible to take such scenes or props seriously. If this movie has any message, it is to sit back, relax, watch it and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the dark of the night, Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) finds a suffering Christina Bailey (Cloris Leachman) running on the road in a trench coat. He picks her up, but are then kidnapped by thugs. They are tortured. Then they are put back into the car and pushed off a cliff. Hammer survives and investigates the death of the mysterious Christina.This is from the hard boiled vicious Mickey Spillane novel. The movie is pushing the envelope of good taste for the time. I like the edge and most of the noir style. However, I just can't take Ralph Meeker's acting. It doesn't have enough life or power. Certainly it's not big enough for this iconic character. For me, there is no better Mike Hammer than Stacy Keach. Ralph Meeker is merely pretending. It's very hard for me to give this a 5, but the movie doesn't deserve more. I do love the artwork for the movie. The artwork deserves a 10. It's also notable for Cloris Leachman's first theatrical movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film to consider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a chance to record this noir tale on TCM and looked forward to enjoying it. I watched it with interest, but I didn't really enjoy it. When the corny backward titles began to roll I realized the film was in trouble. Cloris Leachman was good in a short but memorable role. Boy can she cry1 To me, Mr. Meeker never quite came across as Mike Hammer. He appeared much too passive and when he did get tough it was mainly on defenseless stooges. Evidently he beat up a couple of baddies too, but they didn't show that. Some scenes simply didn't make sense at all, as when Hammer almost appears hypnotized while the girl repeats, "Someone tried to get in." The relationship between Hammer and the cop was unclear. On the one hand they appeared almost to be buddies, while on the other hand the cop almost seemed to regard Hammer as a menace and would like to pull his license permanently. The poor garage mechanic with his VaVaVoom! showed more emotion than anyone else save for Ms Leachman. We all know that when you never see the bad guy's face until the end, he has to be someone we know, a real surprise for us. Alas, Mr. Dekker shows up at the end and until then we never saw his face, so why was it hidden? Maybe so we wouldn't have too much chance to notice his hairpiece. As one reviewer pointed out, we did get to see some nice wheels, and I loved the answering machine in Hammer's apartment. It was fun seeing Cloris Leachman, Strother Martin and Jack Elam in early roles. For me, the ending was disappointing as well. To get a little radiation from the contents of the box was one thing, but to blow up the house and its contents sort of took me aback. I guess the doctor was going to sell it to the Soviets or something. I still don't know exactly what his intentions were except that they weren't good. And for an important tough mobster, Paul Stewart got short shrift. Still, it's a film worth seeing once. And I have to remember that it was shot so fast it hit the theaters with the film still wet from the developer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my husband's favourite films and we managed to see a very good print of it at the NFT in London some years ago. I have also given conference and student seminars on it because, as a senior lecturer in Classical Studies at the Open University (UK), I have become intrigued by the resonances of the Prometheus and Pandora myth in the film's visual texture and in its narrative strands.(I have read the Spillane novel closely to see how much (if any)of the myth is lurking beneath the surface of the book.) I would so like to get in touch with Al Bezzerides before I complete and submit my article on the film and find out how much of this was consciously constructed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wild genre classic from a true renegade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This expressionistic film noir masterpiece was loathed in America (where liberals despised Spillane's novels as symptoms of a culture in decline), subjected to censorship everywhere (nearly ten minutes were cut in Britain), and made Robert Aldrich one of the cult heroes of the "Cahiers du Cinema" critics who nicknamed him "Le Gros Bob". The jagged style, narrative short-cuts, and refusal to explain inspired them four years later when they became filmmakers and created the Nouvelle Vague. Aldrich was a master of genre cinema - a great exponent of the Western, the thriller, the war movie - but this remains his wildest, least compromising picture. In "Kiss Me Deadly", he chose to expose Spillane's right-wing, fascistic private eye Mike Hammer , by showing him going about his work beating up people, exploiting the weak. Apart from the mildly sympathetic cop, Pat Chambers, the film's only sympathetic characters are the poetry-loving Christina and the cheerful mechanic Nick, both of whom are killed.The movie's violence is relentless, though most of it implied. The dialogue by A. I. Bezzerides, a former truck driver, is stylized rather than plain demotic, and full of classical and literary allusions. In one poolside shot, three of the leading heavies in post-war Hollywood cinema are framed together - Jack Lambert, Jack Elam, and Paul Stewart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An object lesson, and still entirely contemporary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILER) From the very start there's an astonishing muscularity to the images - even during a brief sequence like Hammer's foiled escape outside the beach house, I was wrapped up in the cool intelligence of Aldrich's artistry. As summed up by the opening device of having the credit roll go down instead of up, he pushes the traditional film noir posturing and hard-bitten attitudes to the point of absurdity, but then makes the moments of humanity far more literate and compelling than the norm and otherwise subverts expectation at every turn. Sometimes an incident is wholly delivered through extreme close-up; sometimes it's in extreme long-shot; some characters are over-the-top parodies and others wrenchingly human; the notion of the omnipotent villain is wittily sent up; when Rodgers is finally revealed as a true femme fatale, she's the toughest ever seen. In the end Hammer pulls off the traditional hero thing of finding the kidnapped Velda, but then the house blows up - which seems like the final statement on the forced tidiness of conventional resolutions. Never did a film pull off the textbook macho stuff so well while simultaneously revealing its relationship to ineffectual groping (the ideal cold war statement) - the movie still looks like an object lesson, and feels entirely contemporary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would like to know how David Lynch rates this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On my most recent viewing the director I was most reminded of was David Lynch, and the films Mullholland Drive and Wild at Heart. I mean, at the most obvious, compare the beginning of Mullholland Drive; and the look chosen for Isabella Rossellini in Wild at Heart compared with Gaby Rodgers as Lily. There is also something of the same messing with the mechanics of film making (sound, camera angle, cuts) to profoundly disturbing effect. A twisting of narrative, too; above all a sublime floating of narrative events above a hidden but cast-iron solid underpinning of logic. The performances share some of the same qualities: Meeker inhabits Hammer sleekly, as if the role were skin-tight; yet others, especially Rodgers and Wesley Addey, have a looser feel, as though the characterisations were uncertain for initially unknown reasons. This too draws me back (or forward) to Lynch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crackly noir in which no-one is all good, no-one quite straight; everyone has some scam going on, most of all Mike Hammer, who seems like a thoroughly disreputable character, equipped with a full set of brusque push-offs and poker faces to use on the many potentially fatal females who make a habit of throwing themselves at him. He also has a mean line in detective work, picking up a loose thread from a hitch-hiking half-naked woman in the opening scenes and following it doggedly through a maze of twists and turns, dead-ends and dead friends to solve whatever crime may have happened and catch those responsible. Though the final revelations may be a little improbable and disappointing to a technologically-literate modern viewer, this is all about that glorious chase around the mean streets, watching those hulking cars swinging about the broad avenues of fifties LA to bring the supercool and the supermean together for another reckoning. Boiled to a rock-like hardness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Early on in his writing career, Mickey Spillane wrote comic books. It shows in KISS ME DEADLY: despite director Robert Aldrich at the helm, this one comes off like one of the pre-Comics Code horror comics (and it goes "all the way," too, with an ending straight out of all-too-many of the sci-fi comics of the period). (Updated observation: The ending was courtesy of Aldrich, himself, apparently. But Mickey Spillane DID write comic books...) Ralph Meeker, I've always thought, was an under-utilized actor who rated better than he got- but not this time around; KISS ME DEADLY as a whole simply isn't as good as the sum of its parts. If you're one of those die-hard Noir fans who feels compelled to put this one high up on your list of must-see movies, do yourself a favor and go and hunt down some of the current reprints of pre-Comics Code horror comics; you'll LOVE 'em.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bunch of louses running after some radioactive Pandora's Box and getting burned...or not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me warn you that there's no one single likable character here. These people are all despicable, contemptible; you'll even have a hard time deciding who's the worst. Take for ex. the lead Mike Hammer who, under the credentials of a P.I. what truly does for a living is to extort married men, after putting them in a rough spot, shaking them down with the help of his girlfriend Velda?their regular seducer. But you could be confused at the beginning, as he performs what may be considered a good deed when, driving late at night, he picks up a woman in distress running on the road. She has just fled from a nearby institution, as his car's radio promptly informs him. Her name is Christine &amp; she proves to be herself quite a piece of work. Anyway, their car trip ends when the car is stopped by strangers; Mike is knocked out and Christine is tortured to death--probably by non-anaesthetic dental surgery, suggested by the sight of her torturer with a pliers in his hand--as she seems to know some important secret she won't give up. Mike will spend the rest of the flick trying to unveil that secret and trying also to avenge her death, sometimes using violence and greatly enjoying it. Doing further research he meets some other despicable folks, including a woman, Lily Carver, who seems to have been Christine's roommate and who has also run into hiding, fearing for her life. But then she is revealed not to be that girl after all when the body of the real Lily is dragged out of the river. Finally this fake Lily gets her comeuppance, as all the other baddies, while Mike &amp; Velda barely escape a miniature atomic explosion?or don't, depending the ending you rather see. The cast features also assorted goons, unscrupulous boxing managers, heavy weight mobsters and some law enforcers who have no respect for Mike or Velda. Amazingly enough, all these characters put together don't make for a single decent person, the only supposedly sympathetic ones being a couple of Greek mechanics; but the acting there is so bad and the characters so badly written--Nick being nothing but a walking stereotype--that we are never able to see these two as real men, just as clichés.Despite the unsavory characters, his is a quite entertaining film noir and one remarkable at that, for several reasons. First, the brooding, suspenseful, mood is kept from beginning to end, something that many others of the same genre failed to achieve--Scarlet St. and The Killing come to mind--and for once the disasters that befall the leads are not the makings of a woman. The plot is good enough to be interesting and the plot development tags along nicely, which conveniently allows us to forget that we don't give a hoot about these louses. The other remarkable thing about KDM is that, despite its brooding mood, it isn't by any means a dark, depressing flick; quite the contrary, this is one pretty exciting to watch. The acting is good also--except for the mentioned duo--especially from Rodgers. Her "Lily Carver" is so real she doesn't even seem to be playing a role, but showing her own self.But remarkable as KMD is, it also has serious flaws. The writing is mostly appropriate but also uninspired. There are no memorable lines, dialogs, here; no spoken words that keep ringing in our ears. Also the denouement is something of a let down, considering the scope of the case?theft of Uranium or something alike--which has even the Govt. involved. That ending should have had more participants I say, and a lot more hoopla. On the other hand the score goes a long way in creating the appropriate mood during some tense sequences. The cinematography is standard film noir. Most crucial scenes happen during the night--in fact most scenes--and there's good use of unusual camera angles and shadows, especially in scenes in staircases, corridors, exteriors in general. The torture scene is very effective, quite shocking, as we see nothing while hearing it all.Also I think this is the first time we see a formula successfully used many times later: hero arrives in his sports car to the property of the villain, meets vamp acquaintance of villain which he promptly seduces; he even has time for a fight with villain's minions before meeting the man himself, then setting both their cards on the table amidst darkly humorous banter. A three-part sequence you'll see many times later in Bond flicks.Entertaining flick, but also one that displays a very cynical perspective on life. But it won't hurt to watch it from time to time anyway. 7.0/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp Turned into Greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Kiss Me Deadly" (1955), directed by Robert Aldrich, is based on the tough pulp fiction novel with the same name, written by cult author Mickey Spillane. It stars Ralph Meeker, Albert Dekker, Maxine Cooper and Paul Stewart (famous for playing the butler, Raymond, in Orson Welles's seminal 1941 film "Citizen Kane"). A rock hard film noir, a movie that influenced the French New Wave and Quentin Tarantino, this is one of those diamonds in the rough that deserve its critical adulteration.The plot is thus: Mike Hammer (Meeker), a Los Angeles Privat Detective who is often as mean as the criminals he deals with (the infectiousness of evil, a major theme in both Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola's films), picks up Christina (Cloris Leachman) on a lonely country road, who is an escapee from a mental institution. Thugs waylay the pair and torture Christina to death (horrifying, as it is all left to the imagination) while Hammer ends up in hospital. Pursuing the case, he becomes involved with "The great whatsit" and a mysterious evil doctor.The violence for the time is as shocking as the dark, pessimistic ending and director Aldrich makes pulp material into one of the great pieces of American cinema from the nineteen-fifties. The acting, particularly by Meeker is as excellent as the photography by Ernest Laszlo, who invests a brooding paranoia throughout the motion picture. Simply one of the all time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie on TCM a few years ago and it instantly became one of my favourite movies. I've never been able to find it on DVD but I've caught it on the tube a few more times since the first and I love it more with every viewing. I'm a sucker for film noir pulp fiction.Set in the sleazy Los Angeles heat, you can feel the sweat dripping off the characters' even when they're stooped in shadow. This movie has more grit than Rooster Cogburn. Mike Hammer's a PI with a rep for blackmailed divorce cases with the help of his sexy assistant, Velda. When he's driving one night though he encounters Christina, a young woman, running down the road, naked under a trench coat and frantically trying to wave down a car for help in one of the best openings you could ask for in a film. After nearly running her down Hammer stops and picks her up, which snowballs into an intricate mystery that involves everything but the kitchen sink.The action moves fast and has directly or indirectly influenced everything from 'Speed' to 'Pulp Fiction.' Mike Hammer is truly one of the original bad asses and Ralph Meeker plays him to the hilt. He doesn't take crap from anybody and isn't afraid of anything. His only weakness is his obsession with the case and the danger of losing himself in his ambition.To give anything away from the plot would be criminal but if you want a fun, gritty and pulpy mystery with a dose of action you can't get much better than the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, despite not always making sense-sequence wise, is a compellingly filmic take on Mickey Spillane's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the film's beginning, Cloris Leachman makes a great impression in her film debut as we see her running down the road. When Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) reluctantly picks her up, that's when things start to get going as things soon take a turn for the worse. I'll stop there and just say this was such an involving adaptation of Mickey Spillane's novel and character by director Robert Aldrich that got me riveted from beginning to end despite not a whole lot of sequences making complete sense. And what characters that inhabit Hammer's world from that mechanic (Nick Dennis) that loves Mike perhaps because of his devil-may-care attitude to his loyal secretary Velda who sees through Mike's faults and just doesn't seem to give a damn judging from the way she keeps kissing or looking toward him. As played by Maxine Cooper-like me, a Chicago native-Velda is the steamiest of the ladies here. While there's much that's dark, there's also some funny bits like whenever that mechanic talks. And that ending-and I'm talking about the one Aldrich intended-is pure excitement when it comes though it does make you wonder if things become more satisfying to the leads after that's over. Anyway, with all that said, I'm highly recommending Kiss Me Deadly. P.S. I was pleasantly surprised that Frank DeVol-who I usually associate with his iconic themes for the family sitcoms My Three Sons and The Brady Bunch-was the one who did the score here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is there not to like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off like your basically typical film-noir from that time period. It uses all of the right required ingredients and handles them very well. It's definitely one fine made and effective film-noir but then it has something extra to it as well. The movie really makes an unexpected and surprising twist, which I won't spoil but it is far from anything you would expect to see in an 1955 film-noir, let me tell you that much. I loved it because it was so unusual and surprising but some people don't seem to like it because it seems out of place and has basically nothing to do with the film-noir genre.This is a movie that didn't got made by any of the big studios and it got shot in only a couple of weeks, with not really the most prolific or best actors involved with it. It makes it all the more impressive that this movie is basically just as good as your other average film-noir with some big name stars attached to it.The main character of the movie comes from the detective novels by Mickey Spillane and this movie got also based on one of his books. It's a pretty good tough character that obviously really fits the genre. Not a big surprise that quite a few movie and television projects got based around the Mike Hammer character. As is custom for the genre, the story gets quite hard to follow at times and once you start thinking about it, some of the jumps in the story just really don't make much sense. The one moment he hears a name and the next he is already at the location were that character is holding up, as if he has no problems finding anyone. Also it doesn't make too much sense that some characters get killed and how the overall movie progresses, with it's many different characters with different agendas. But this is only when you start thinking too much into the story. While watching it, it hardly ever becomes a complaint since you're basically too drawn into the movie and the events happening in it.This movie is truly a recommendable one, if alone already for the big unexpected surprise twist it has to offer.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. Although, the plot just left me wondering what the ending would be or could be the whole time, it was still incredible to just let the movie take its course, which allowed me to notice wonderful elements. Mike Hammer is like no other character, he's is determined although at moments I thought he was stupid, eventually the bad guys always go after people you care about. Despite all that I enjoyed watching him because any human being wonders what is it like to put their interests first without fear or regret. Also the story itself is so clever and unexpected right from the beginning. While watching the car scene when Mike and Christina are driving downward, I just assumed their paths would cross again I had no idea that she'd be dead for good. At the end, I thought Mike would have died but, the end explosion as he and Velda walk off is so much better. The explosion represents such great things such as that part of his life being put aside and his new beginning awaiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Aldrich had a very unique slightly sadistic style that pushed the boundaries of American film making in the 1950s and 60s when the Hays Code was still in effect . In fact Aldrich is one of the American film makers who in effect abolished the Hays code . You can sneer slightly and say that his films are relatively tame nowadays but you have to remember the context of when they were made . Mickey Spillane was a phenomenally popular and populist writer probably due to his mix of sex and violence pulp novels so in theory Aldrich and Spillane should complement one another greatly Truth be told KISS ME DEADLY perhaps isn't the masterpiece some people tout it as but again you have to get things in to context . Film noir had been done to death and what KISS ME DEALY does isn't so much bringing a lot new to the table but hiding the formula very well . The fault with the film is much of the story doesn't make much sense . The what's it in the box is exactly that - a what is it ? because if it's what I think it is then surely the laws of physics itself have been bent if not totally ignored for the sake of artistic licence but I've seen a lot of films that have used artistic licence far more outrageously .For what it's worth it's film that treads the well worn path of a private investigator bumping in to a mysterious woman and finding himself trying to get to the bottom of a dangerous mystery very well even if there's not a lot about it that is outstanding</fullReview>

Things go down hill from there as Hammer is lured into the biggest caper of his sordid career.In the 50's, if you're going to show in a Drive-in movie or a local one-horse town, you give the folks something steamy to think about later, but really the cheese is under a hoop skirt where it belongs. Give the boys a peek and it's whoopee time for Mr. and Mrs. America. Ah, the 1950's, no wonder they had a baby boom.Oh, and the big secret that the mob boys are knocking bodies over for, it's a variation on The Maltese Falcon with a little A-Bomb exposure.</fullReview>

This much overlooked thriller is said to have been accepted better in France than the U.S. when released in the mid 50's.Moody shades of glorious black and white, this film progressively holds your undivided attention. That cool, hard hitting private dick Mike Hammer(Ralph Meeker)picks up a wailing woman(Cloris Leachman)wearing nothing but a trench-coat in the middle of the highway. This leads to Hammer taking on several thugs and secrets associated with the Atomic Bomb. Femme fatales and mystery amok help make up the core of this very volatile crime flick. Meeker is stoic and self confident as Hammer. There is also an impressive group of actors rounding out the cast: Paul Stewart, Maxine Cooper, Albert Dekker, Jack Elam and Gabby Rodgers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D-Pow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this one a few times over the years, it's time to write about it now after finally seeing it on the silver screen. Kiss Me Deadly as a movie feels like a bomb that goes off in your face, the 3D-POW of which Nicky speaks. When left to analyse it you can't really pin it down as a moral story, or a political parable, or any sort of a message film, it's shipwreck, earthquake, atomic plume, it beats you into insensibility. Everything's wrong, even the credits scroll the wrong way. You've got a pimp/private detective who's named after a blunt instrument, and his "secretary" Velda who coos about how he would not smell as sweet by any other name (after mentioning his name in Greek, Michaelis Sfyri). Pretty car, fashionable modern apartment (Hammer has an answering phone in the 50s), expressionist paintings, tasteful furniture - all paid for by blackmail and marriage wrecking. We're largely left to wonder about the nature of their relationship, doubtlessly perverse.The movie plays with our sympathies, Hammer is alternately shown as kind and sadistic, one time he's a Samaritan helping an old man out, another he's the playground bully breaking his friend's toy to see if he'll cry. He's persecuted by the Man, but he's also happy to persecute himself, delighting in the screams of his prey. We have Percy Helton as the pudgy mortician, yelping pitifully like people do in real life, Kiss Me Deadly doesn't give us the practised monotone squeal of a scream queen to signify, "It's only a movie". You get to noticing things about the movie after a while, you can pick out the incipient nasal whine in character actor Strother Martin's voice (here he has a one scene role as a truck driver) that was to become full rasp by the time of Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch where he plays Coffer, rifle-kissing massacre artist, redneck double act with "TC". Then there's Albert Dekker playing the eminence grise; here his Dr Soberin echoes Otto Kruger's Dr Amthor of 1944's Murder, My Sweet, the smooth-spoken classically educated smarter-than-thou sociopathic quack, nemesis of the private detective!I could never be quite certain what Hammer's motive was, is it front and centre as displayed by the "what's in it for me?" exterior and the search for the "great whatsit"? Or is he looking to avenge poor Christina with her chicken-legs run and hysterical gape? It's not clear straightaway but to have seen Soberin's shoes, he most certainly had to be awake, and ergo saw what they did to Christina, which, when you have a little think about, was worse than the slaps you might assume on watch one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiss Me Deadly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film listed in the book as one of the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and the critics gave it all five out of five stars, this was obviously the kind of film I wanted to watch, from director Robert Aldrich (What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, The Flight of the Phoenix, The Dirty Dozen). Basically tough Los Angeles private eye Mike Hammer (Ralph Meeker) has a brutal and corrupt side, like crooks he chases, and usually he and Velda Wickman (introducing Maxine Cooper), his assistant, secretary and lover usually work on divorce vases. One night on a lonely road he picks up attractive hitchhiker Christina Bailey (introducing Cloris Leachman) who was wearing nothing but a trench coat, she had escaped from a mental institution, and next he gets knocked out and wakes with thugs, hears her being tortured to death, and knocked unconscious he and the body are put in his car and pushed down a cliff. Hammer wakes in hospital with Velda by his side, following these events he is determined to follow the case both for vengeance and to find out if Christina was involved with something big, and the first spot he is lead to is the apartment of sexy waif-like blonde Lily Carver (Gaby Rodgers). She pretends she is Christina's roommate and wants Hammer's protection while she is in hiding, but in fact she is looking for a mysterious box that is worth a fortune because of its content, it is a small luggage type box which is hot to touch with a dangerous glowing substance inside. Having gone through the numerous sources and followed clues, Hammer finds a key to a locker in a hotel, and this is where the box is, and meanwhile "Lily" is actually imposter Gabrielle who with her evil boss Dr. G.E. Soberin (Albert Dekker) has taken Velda hostage and taken to a beach house until they get the box. Gabrielle shoots Soberin to keep the box contents for herself, and Hammer walking into the room gets shot and wounded, and when she fully opens the box, containing stolen radionuclide material, she screams in pain as the heat causes critical heat, she and the room catch fire, and Hammer escapes with Velda and they watch the house burn down and hear the horrifying sounds. Also starring Paul Stewart as Carl Evello, Wesley Addy as Lt. Pat Murphy, Juano Hernandez as Eddie Yeager, Nick Dennis as Nick, Marian Carr as Friday, Jack Elam as Charlie Max and Jack Lambert as Sugar Smallhouse. This has all the elements of a great film in its genre, clear black and white picture, catchy music by Frank De Vol, good acting, and a terrific story all based around a mysterious item which creates crime and death to many involved, the detective element is good to follow, and the final sequence is complete madness, in a good way, it is definitely a must see classic film noir. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Pairing of Noir and Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before the end, which is quite shocking (Especially if you see the director's cut), the film enters the realm of science fiction. We have Mike Hammer having an answering machine, over a decade before they appear on the market (True, it's quite primitive, being an eight-track tape machine set in the wall, but remember the year this movie came out). The opening of the film reminded me of Jean Rollin's film NIGHT OF THE HUNTED, making me think that Rollin had been influenced by Aldrich. Obviously it also influenced Jean Luc Goddard in making ALPHAVILLE, in combining the two genres. Lemme Caution was very much modelled off of Ralph Meeker's version of Mike Hammer. And the ending reminded me of Joseph Losey's THESE ARE THE DAMNED.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story line when the film was made (1955) is credible, particularly at the time of the Cold War and strained international relations. This is good stuff and is James Bond without all the gizmos and gadgets. If you are a film noir fan this is a must see. If you aren't, then steer clear.I found this at the bargain table at a local video store for sale and had to own it. You will too. If you like Sunset Boulevard, LA Confidential, and the like, enjoy this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what are you afraid of?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Kiss Me Deadly on video yesterday, many years after seeing it at a revival house. It is truly a visionary film. Girls come on to Ralph Meeker, he doesn't come on to them (impotence?)--I think that is the cause of his perpetual anger. His brutal treatment of those weaker than himself puts him at a far remove from Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade.Aldrich has never been one of my favorite directors, but here he treats the subject masterfully. Getting Los Angeles to look occasionally like De Sica's Naples was wonderful. Gaby Rodgers gives an inept performance that makes Marilyn Monroe look like Meryl Streep by comparison, yet Aldrich can still make her look dangerous, fatal.In the Eighties, we feared AIDS, the silent killer from love's embrace. In the Nineties, it was being made insignificant by technology. Mickey Spillane's Fifties paranoia has to do with loss of male power to women(their greater understanding of human needs).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie several times, and it is one of the finest to come out of the 50s. Ralph Meeker is the perfect Mike Hammer - amoral and brutal - and the camera work and cinematography take the breath away. The women are awful, typical boop a doop 50s squeaky actresses, and it is a relief when the "light relief" Va Va Vroom gets killed off early in the movie. It is high time this film was remastered and released on DVD. It is a very "modern" film (no coincidence that one person commented on the link up with "Pulp Fiction" and the mysterious box) with its complex plot. Ralph Meeker is handsome and has a very "modern" look. Undoubtedly, if he were a young man now, he would be a big star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spillane When You're Not Having Spillane - Love It or Hate It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my Grandfather took me to see this as a kid, neither of us were ready for what came along. It remained in my memory for many of the wrong reasons...namely, cheap shocks, and horror. The ending burnt itself into my nightmares for some years. Looking back with a trained eye and mature mind, it comes across the way many critics of its day quite rightly described it...as tawdry. Some critics have lately given it more attention than it deserves. It appears perhaps many folk who grew up with 50s-70s TV, may not have such a high expectation in the writing or production quality stakes, as they seem to be more easily pleased. The opening, while an immediate attention grabber, somehow has the look of a reasonable home movie. This look continues with a scene in Hammer's trendy apartment, where the full shape of the camera can be seen in shadow on his body, it then tracks with him and becomes even more painfully obvious as it ends up filling the floor space after he moves out of frame. This is an instant mood killer for the serious film lover. Any director worth his salt would have picked it up and re-shot it. But this is a quickie, wrapped up in around three weeks, and it shows. Hungarian born Director of Photography: Ernest Laszlo (Naked Jungle '56 ~ Stalag 17 '53) who went on to be nominated for better work, must have cringed when he saw the rushes! And while I quite liked director Robert Aldrich's "The Big Knife" in the same year, I think it was carried by Clifford Odet's penetrating story. Aldrich seemed more interested in being controversial than creative. Writer: Micky Spillane, when he saw the completed film, described it as one of the worst films he'd seen. He actually walked out the first time, then tried again, with no improvement. He cited A.I. Bezzerides screen play as little more than junk, turning his Mike Hammer character into no more than a sadistic thug. Bezzerides had achieved better when working with Jules Dassin on "Thieves Highway" in '49.I don't think Ralph Meeker's career was helped along by this film. Aldrich's soul-less direction left his Mike Hammer character quite bland, lifeless. Apart from one or two interesting roles, Meeker unfortunately languished in the background. An unusual early film (just about forgotten now) from MGM "Glory Alley" '52 showed some mild promise, and in the superb "Paths of Glory" in '57, he was even better - but these were not well followed up. Paul Stewart is good, so is Juano Hernandez in a small part. But Nick Dennis as Nick Va Va Voom (believe it or not!) is simply annoying to the extreme. Albert Dekker who's given somewhat prominent billing, is nothing more than a guest star, with only a few minutes screen time --an Aldrich audience con-- The girls are all reduced to cheap throw away sex objects, and none, save Cloris Leachman (with only a few minutes on screen) are very convincing.Frank Devol's music score is basically hammy, with embarrassing jabs and stings to herald any supposed drama. Devol excelled at jovial or melodic scores for TV sit com's, but regardless, Aldrich often used him for drama. Along with the somewhat slimy Wesley Addy as Lt Murphy, and Albert Dekker, I think many roles were simply 'jobs for the boys'.For those who like cheap 'B' grade 'wannabe' noirs, or sadism masquerading as entertainment...(the scene where Hammer jams Percy Helton's fingers in a drawer, while snickering with delight at his screams of agony, is sadistically obvious, and unintentionally funny at the same time)...then this movie won't disappoint you. Others might need to beware. As for "that ending" while it filled me with fear as a kid - with its curious container, filled with ultra radiant molten nuclear death, locked only by a simple key, that when opened...(complete with the sound of howling demons) explodes like a nuclear bomb! This type of blast would more likely have taken out an entire section of the coastline, not just the holiday beach house! It's little wonder then, that some intelligent editor removed from the original cinema release prints, those somewhat foolish shots of an already radiated Hammer and his muse - hiding from this massive blast in ankle deep water. This apparently unknown editor, did this by cutting directly from the blast, to the end title. BUT then...along comes some enthusiastic DVD researcher, finds the cuts, and puts them back in. Just the ticket for a modern audience...Goodbye Mr.Hammer!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well cast and acted, but plot is too thin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The vivid violent images, probably pushing the limits of the era, and the over-sized macho version of Mike Hammer, as interpreted by Ralph Meeker, fail to enliven "Kiss Me Deadly" enough to outweigh the poorly paced story.Meeker has attitude galore, and pushes the hard-nosed tough-guy persona beyond what Humphrey Bogart showed us in similar films from a decade earlier. But plot remains an essential element to murder mysteries, and "Kiss Me Deadly" spools out its thread, string and rope -- to use an image from the film -- in a fashion so slow as to bore a kitten. These films work best when the viewer has to struggle to sort out who's done what, and what the implications are for each new development. All we get are questions, leading to more questions, with nothing tossed our way to chew on and experience an "A-ha!" moment or two along the way.The "dames" are gorgeous, and remind me of the seemingly sex-starved Bond girls that would appear in films 10 years later. But we're not given enough character to decide for whom we should be rooting, so when one is not who she appears to be, it's hard to care.The strong casting and acting are ultimately wasted on what is probably a poorly adapted screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was absolutely blown away by the time I finished watching this movie. I purchased the DVD which has both endings, and have since read up quite a bit on this...Kiss Me Deadly influenced an entire generation of avant garde European film directors, despite being largely ignored as a flashy "drive-in" movie here in the conservative United States of the time. This movie has made it into my all-time Top Ten list. A definite must-see, you will be shocked if you see it without reading any of the critical reviews. Essentially, what starts out as a typical Mike Hammer film noir turns into something very, very different by the end...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humdinger of a thriller/film noir with a bang-on, note-perfect performance by Ralph Meeker as hard-ass detective Spillane. Love the opening credits, in fact, the whole opening sequence. And even with today's megamillion budgets and special effects, it would be tough to surpass the incredible ending. So what's in the black box? Who cares. Just sit back and watch Meeker kick ass for 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important noir / action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not my favorite noir film, but after reading some of the reviews here, I hafta comment. First, Hammer is not supposed to be sympathetic. Hammer is a representation of American mentality (both then and now). He is brutal, bullying (this is about the time of Cuba and United Fruit), mindless and anti-intellectual. He feels there's nothing he can't solve by the application of force. He toys with a (very real) power which is is totally unprepared to deal with or understand. He is, in fact, just what his name implies: a hammer, blunt but dangerous. Second, the editing is very important. This was a key influence on the French New Wave. "Important" directors like Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Goddard payed tribute to the "machine-gun" editing (a cliche, but it fits) and almost randomly occurring fight scenes: Truffaut in "Shoot the Piano Player" (Highly recommended, Truffaut's best), Goddard in Breathless. I think the villain could have been drawn better, but still, a very good film, emphasizing film-noir's complex morality and the ability of noir to expose the most seedy aspects of our culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard rave reviews of this movie so i watched it on early morning TV recently. Great photography, perhaps the most unlikeable "hero" ever, a complicated plot and the torture scene with the girl was so appalling that i think it would have trouble getting past the censors now, BUT---[SPOILER] the scene where Mike Hammer discovers "The Box" and what it contains ruined the film for me. I know it was 50 years ago and that Joe Public knew nothing about the "contents of the box" but Hammer would have been burnt to a cinder long before he opened it , and that part of America would be uninhabitable for thousands of years! Think i don"t know what i"m talking about? Read the book "Trinity" which describes real life events and you will see what i mean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing film. But aren't sexy women who come on to the hero a staple of thegenre? None of the girls here are beautiful in a stereotypical way, tho, thank heavens. Lily Carver in particular, who reveals a stunning figure to go with her verging-on plain face, has a totally wacky charm. Dialogue is excellent,Chandleresque, in a class beyond the pseudopoetica of the ghastly Clash byNight which they keep screening over here. And KMD's acting is stylised, not'wooden'. Listen to the sneering interviewer who advises Mike to return to his life's work. The only thing (apart from the incomprehensible plot) I don't like about this film is the many patronising 'ethnic' characters with bad 'I lika da girla' accents. xxx</fullReview>
