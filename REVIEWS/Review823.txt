		<shortDescription>Gripping, moving and totally amazing. An amazing story that never fails to grip and is only made stronger by the dramatic recreations fuelled by Simon &amp; Joe's recollections.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the mid-80's two young climbers attempted to reach the summit of Siula Grande in Peru - a feat that had previously been attempted but never achieved. With an extra man looking after base camp, Simon and Joe set off to scale the mount in one long push over several days. The peak is reached, however on the descent Joe falls and breaks his leg. Despite what it means, the two continue with Simon letting Joe out on a rope for 300 feet, then descending to join him and so on. However when Joe goes out over an overhang with no way of climbing back up, Simon makes the decision to cut the rope. Joe falls into a crevice and Simon, assuming him dead, continues back down. Joe however survives the fall and was lucky to hit a ledge in the crevice. This is the story of how he got back down.Yet another reason to lament the closing of Film Four's doors, this film is the cinematic equivalent of sitting listening to someone tell you an amazing story in their own words. The film is acted out in dramatised scenes but it is Joe's and Simon's words over the top that really will keep you hanging on. The dramatised scenes though, are still wonderful, it is very easy to forget that this was not somehow filmed at the time, not only do they look very, very real but they also look spectacular; when Joe talks about the imposing crevice he was in, the pictures on screen did much better at translating that into visuals than my non-mountaineering imagination could have done.The two actors in the roles of Joe and Simon do a great job; like I said, it is very easy to forget they are actors or that this is a replay for the camera. However the real people are more interesting and it is they that drive the film. To hear Joe talk about what he did and felt puts so much more bone on the story that any Hollywood version could have managed. He is a great guy and I can only imagine what he went through. Simon on the other hand is more guarded. He never really goes below the facts, whereas I know he has issues underneath as he apparently was not as calm as he is on camera during the making of the film. The film ends with some captions - one of which being that Simon came under great criticism for cutting the rope from other climbers. However the talking heads bit never even touches the surface of what Simon had to go through after they all got home - in a way that would have been just as interesting a part of the film as what Joe went through.As the story unfolds it is impossible not to sit shaking your head in amazement. At the start I was like everyone else 'why would you do this stuff for fun' etc, and I still think that, but the story is so gripping that it is impossible to think of anything else. The running time is generous and allows Simon to tell his story properly, it is amazing and the sense of impossible odds and the sheer pain involved is brought to the audience very well - even with a handful of people in the audience gasps and 'ah's' were very audible. Overall this film is more dramatic than any Hollywood drama I have seen in a long time. It is not without flaw but it is difficult to sit and just watch it - I was enthralled by it, a true dramatic human story that never let me get bored or distracted. By the end, Simon has put forward his many emotions so well that I was very moved. The only think that would have made this film better would have been a bit more of searching inside himself by Joe in the final 15 minutes, in my heart I doubt if I could ever forgive myself and I wonder how he did or if he did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusually Affecting, Hybrid Film of Mountaineering Peril</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A recent article on "Touching the Void" focused on the reactions of mountaineers to films about their often deadly avocation. Many commented that virtually no movie dealing with mountain climbing felt real to them. I suspect that Kevin MacDonald's gripping part re-enactment, part-documentary may be the rare exception that will capture the interest of amateur and professional mountaineers. (I haven't climbed since 1966 when I and two fellow Army officers set the record for summiting Seoul, Korea's Namsan from its almost inaccessible east face.)Simon, a very experienced climber, and Joe, a younger devotee, sought to be the first to reach the top of Peru's Siula Grande through a forbidding and unconquered approach. Before heading to a remote location to establish a base camp they picked up Richard, a traveler with no experience or interest in climbing but a hale-fellow-well-met willing to babysit the camp while the two adventurers climbed.Getting to the top of the summit via an often near-sheer face was daunting enough and the duo made it. The trip back was the disaster. As one commented, eighty percent of injuries and deaths occur on the way down. Joe took a fall sustaining a very serious leg injury causing limited mobility, intractable pain and major damage. Simon figured out a way for the two to continue their descent but Joe later went crashing over the side and hung helplessly swinging in the air, his dead weight immobilizing Simon. Arguably both would have perished if this condition continued.In what remains a roiling full-fledged controversy amongst the mountaineering fraternity, Simon believed he could only save his life by cutting the rope from which Joe, with whom he could not communicate, dangled. The rope cut, Simon made his way back to base camp sure that his companion was dead. Simon's descent was perilous but compared to the still living Joe's evolving ordeal it was a walk in the park.Over almost a week, Joe survived on no food, virtually no water and sheer guts and determination to live. His trip down the mountain to within range of the tent where his weak voice was heard by the about to decamp climber and assistant is a truly unique and compelling survivor story, one of the most dramatic ever brought to film.Both the real climbers and Richard are narrators whose story unfolds between re-enactments by non-speaking but truly athletic actors. The make-up crew did wonders here to capture the brutal battering each sustained, especially Joe, during the climb and descent. The photography is magnificent.Joe has always maintained that he too would have cut the rope had his position and Simon's been reversed but his open and repeated acceptance of Simon's desperate act has been rejected by many mountaineers. I was particularly fascinated by this issue since as a law professor I begin my Criminal Law course, as do very many colleagues, with the very issue of necessity as a justification for one person to save his life by sacrificing the lives of others (no mountains but two celebrated cases involving the sea, one English, the other American, provide very similar moral and legal dilemmas to Simon and Joe's excruciating situation). While no legal action ensued from the Peru near tragedy, the same issues are there and remain for viewers to think about and discuss.Both Joe and Simon continue to climb, Joe after six operations to his shattered leg. Their accomplishment in scaling Siula Grande has not to date been duplicated. That must give each extraordinary satisfaction.This film is almost in a class of its own and I suspect it will become a talking point for climbers. For today's audience, attention was rapt and sighs and gasps escaped involuntarily as the climbers, and Joe especially, encountered one near fatal obstacle after the other.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing: everyone must see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film describes the true story of a climbing accident in South America in 1985, using dramatisation with voice-overs and interview excerpts from the three British men who were actually involved. It may sound boring, but I cannot stress this enough: this film is much more tense, and nail-bitingly gripping, than any Hollywood action movie - because you know that everything you're seeing and hearing really did happen to these guys.The story itself is incredible. It will redefine for you the capabilities of the human mind and body. There is action, sadness, hope, and even brilliant humour in places.Please go and see this film; you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing story - has to be seen to be believed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touching the Void tells the story of Simon and Joe; two mountain climbers whose trip to Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes ended in tragedy. I had never heard of either one of these men or their story before watching this film, but in the mountaineering world, they are the stuff of legend. I don't doubt that I'm not the only one to never have heard of them, so all in all, I think that this is a story that needs to be told. The story itself has all the ingredients of a successful human drama - it's gripping, exciting, realistic, continually intriguing, and overall it makes for a nice film. Carrying on with the recent trend that was kicked off with Bowling for Columbine, Touching the Void is filmed in a documentary style. This is definitely to the film's credit; the documentary style allows the auteur to tell a story and not have to worry about dramatics and so fourth. The documentary style is also detached in nature, so it allows the audience to make up their own mind about the events that they see on screen, and with a story as provocative as this one; that's what you want. The film is told from the men's points of view as well as seeing actors portray what happened on screen, and this allows the story to be effectively shown with an insight into their thoughts as well, which works a treat in my opinion.The story is one of intense courage and decision making in a situation where every decision is a bad one. The major provocative point comes from the decision that Simon makes when he chooses to cut his partner (Joe) off, causing him to fall down a ravine. In my opinion, Simon did the right thing. The only other choice was to not cut him off, and get pulled down himself; so it's Simon and Joe, or just Joe. I don't even think there's a debate. What did get me about Simon's character, however, was his attitude towards his partner's injury. He's just seen him fall down and break his leg, and his first thought is that if he falls off the cliff, he'll be able to go down alone, which would be much easier than hoisting Joe down with him. I don't know about you, but that's not the sort of partner I would want on a high-risk mountaineering trip. Not only that; but he didn't even check on the well being of his friend in the morning after the fall; I realize that his chances of survival are unlikely, but I would expect him to still check because you never know. And then, just to top it off, on his way down the mountain; he's debating with himself whether or not to tell what really happened or just make something up! And just for a final shock; he didn't make a better story up! I found his lack of caring to be rather shocking.The main story of the film, however, is not Simon's but Joe's; which is an absolutely amazing story of human courage. This man was not only extremely frightened as he was in the middle of nowhere on his own with no way to get help, but he also had to toil with a broken leg and extreme dehydration. The agony he must have been in is unimaginable, and yet he somehow managed to drag himself all the way down the mountain to safety. The man deserves a medal. The film allows the audience to stay with him throughout his ordeal; we really feel his pain and it makes the images on screen undoubtedly powerful. Had the film have been filmed in dramatics, without the documentary, it wouldn't have managed the same effect; and that is testament to the good decision to film it as a documentary. Despite the nature of the story, it also manages to be amusing at times, with Joe telling the audiences the thoughts of a doomed man, and a very surreal sequence involving Boney M. This story shows human courage like no other film I've ever seen, and what's more; it's all true and it all feels very real as well - it's almost like you're watching the actual events.Overall, Touching the Void is an incredible cinematic experience. There isn't another film quite like this one and it really does have to be seen to be believed. Highly recommended viewing for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping from Start to Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are exceptions, but mountaineering movies fall roughly into two classes; overblown, unrealistic cliffhanging (in more than one sense) dramas ('Eiger Sanction', 'K2', 'Cliffhanger', 'Vertical Limit') and rather trite descriptive documentaries often seen as padding for the 'National Geographic' channel schedules, although Jon Krakaur's 'Into Thin Air' managed to combine the worst of both worlds. Both classes have in common (usually) Gortex gear, superb mountain scenery and splendid cinematography. What distinguishes this survival story is that it has (sorry about this) high drama, an understated style and absolute authenticity. The actual principals, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, and Richard Hawkins the non-climber base camp minder, narrate their story as it is re-enacted, partly at the original site in Peru (though some filming was done in the European Alps), while actors (with very few lines to say) re-enact the saga of the Siula West Face climb. It all hangs together beautifully; and I was rapt from go to whoa. My disbelief was entirely suspended.Even documentaries are stories rather than fact (whatever that is) and this story is superbly told, for which director Kevin Macdonald can take full credit, though perhaps one should also thank Simon Yates and Joe Simpson for telling us their stories. One critic has taken the director to task in not dwelling on the moral issues involved ? the cutting the rope bit. No mountaineering drama is without one of these but here it actually happened. That critic has missed the point ? the approach here is 'be your own judge'.This film manages to appeal both to mountaineers (a small but highly critical audience) and non-mountaineers. As a (semi-retired) and undistinguished member of the former group, I found few nits to pick, though a more extended explanation of the difference between Alpine-style and Expedition climbing would help to show non-mountaineers that it wasn't a suicide attempt (though speaking for myself I wouldn't have tried it with less than four in the party). And as the film was about a climb that went wrong, the joy of climbing, which is not easy to explain to non-mountaineers was rather overshadowed by Joe's suffering as he dragged himself, leg broken, down the mountain. But never have I seen a more graphic illustration of the adage 'never give up'. Lie down to die and you will die. Joe and the Texan doctor on Everest (see 'Into Thin Air') both should have died, yet they survived. In the doctor's case it seems to have been some primeval instinct (he was not a mountaineer). In Joe's case he seems to have treated survival as a challenge and focused his thoughts accordingly ('I thought, in twenty minutes I'll be at the next rock'). I winced every time his broken leg hit something.To sum up this is a great film, which will live long in your memory, climber or non-climber. P.S. Simon was only 20 or so at the time, Joe a more mature 25. Both have kept climbing, though significantly not together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable courage and determination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the best-selling book of the same name, Kevin Macdonald's docu-drama Touching the Void recreates the 1985 experience of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, two British mountaineers attempting to climb the Siula Grande Mountains of Peru, a mountain range no one had ever succeeded in scaling before. The film tells the story of how Simpson, alone at 21,000 feet -- with a broken leg, dehydrated, and a step away from death, pushed his broken body beyond the limits of what he knew to be possible in order to survive. Oscar-winning director of One Day in September, Macdonald uses actors Brendan Mackay (Simpson) and Nicholas Aaron (Yates) to recreate the adventure while the real climbers provide a running commentary.After ascending the west face of the mountain in 3 1/2 days using the "purest" style of climbing (sleeping in ice caves rather than setting up base camps along the way), the descent is treacherous as Simpson misses a step and his lower leg is driven into his kneecap. Tied together by a rope, Yates begins lowering his partner downward in the darkness, 300 feet at a time while Simpson is in excruciating pain. Progress is halted when Simpson is lowered into a crevasse and left dangling in mid-air, unable to signal his companion. Yates believes him to be dead and makes a crucial and controversial decision to cut the rope, leaving his partner alone and without support. Simpson has never blamed Yates for his decision and has gone to great lengths in his book and in interviews to defend Simon whose character has been continually under attack since that fateful day.The film was shot in authentic locations in the Andes and the Alps, and the result is a sense of being there, experiencing the pitiless forces of nature. Though the outcome is preordained, how the two friends managed to survive their ordeal provides more than enough heart-pounding suspense. The film shows Simpson trying to knot a rope with frozen fingers and guzzling the first muddy water he finds to counter the effects of severe dehydration. One of the most intriguing sequences shows the climber in a semi-delirious state listening in his mind to the sound of Boney M's Brown Girl in the Ring. While there is little in the way of spiritual epiphany (Simpson candidly discusses his atheism), there is an unmistakable feeling that both men have been strengthened by their shared ordeal. Simpson touches the void within him, an emptiness that compels him to keep going only because he "wanted to be with someone when I died". Reaching base camp in the middle of the night, he calls out but no one answers, `When no one answered the call", he says, "I lost something. I lost me.' Then, when Simon and Richard rescue him, the thing he remembers most is the feeling of being held. Though he did not experience a higher power guiding him, he does sense a freedom from the world's clutter that makes him feel more alive. Touching the Void is a tale of remarkable courage and determination that touches the place within ourselves that tells us that miracles can occur in our life if we are able to go beyond what we thought was possible and act as if our life depends on the result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>amazing docudrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You'll be lucky if you have any cuticles left by the time you've finished watching `Touching the Void,' a nail-biting documentary that chronicles a true-life tale of miraculous survival. In 1985, two experienced mountain climbers, Simon Yates and Joe Simpson, set out to scale a peak in the Peruvian Andes. Although they successfully reached the summit, disaster struck as they were making their way back down. In the midst of a blinding blizzard, Joe slipped and broke his leg. The film, based on the book by Joe Simpson himself, recounts the grueling ordeal both men underwent in their efforts to make it back to their base camp alive.To fully dramatize the experience, director Kevin MacDonald filmed one-on-one interviews with the two survivors (as well as a third companion who didn't go up the mountain with them) commenting and reflecting on the event, then employed actors to reenact the event as it originally happened. MacDonald has done an astonishing job capturing the edge-of-the-seat suspense inherent in the material, this despite the fact that we already know how it will all turn out. By plunging us directly into the heart of the action, we feel we are enduring every death-defying, heartbreaking moment right along with Joe and Simon. `Touching the Void' is, if nothing else, a tour-de-force of breathtaking cinematography and stunt work, one that makes us identify with the characters every step of the way.Yet, for all its technical expertise, `Touching the Void' is, first and foremost, a human document, a testament to the endurance and survivability of both the human body and the human spirit. The amazing determination and perseverance demonstrated by the two men - especially by the then 25-year-old Joe as he struggles manfully, despite unendurable pain, to reach a place of safety - is inspiring even to those of us who do most of our adventuring from the comfort and safety of our living room armchair, a cold beer in hand. The film also reveals, through their actions and their words twenty some years later, the character of the two men. Simon has to live with the fact that, at a crucial moment in the crisis, he cut Joe loose from his line, consigning his partner to probable death so that he himself could survive ? an action for which many fellow mountaineers later criticized Simon. Yet, never once ? either then or now ? does Joe join in that criticism. On the psychological level, we learn of the cavalcade of emotions and feelings Joe underwent in those moments of greatest desperation when he looked impending death square in the face. This film is as much an adventure of the mind as it is of the body. Paradoxically, at the same time as the film is showing us the indomitableness of the human spirit, it is reminding us how much we humans ? even the most daring among us ? are, ultimately, at the mercy of a far greater, impersonal and indifferent force known as Nature.Thanks to the compelling, stranger-than-fiction quality of the tale and the technical brilliance used to re-create it, `Touching the Void' will have you chewing your fingernails down to a nub.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking Andean photography ... and a will to survive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awe-inspiring work by director Kevin Macdonald takes us with a minimum of fuss to a corner of the Andes in Peru for this epic tale of endurance against the elements. After what appears to be a relatively rapid, routine conquering of a 22,000 foot peak, we are left contemplating what might be in store to fill out the rest of the film. Suffice to say we are told that eighty per cent of climbing accidents occur on the descent. Harrowing times in the extreme soon present themselves, with amazing camera work accompanied by stark human emotions as life-affecting decisions have to be made in the harshest of conditions. There are only three actors in this reconstruction of an actual climb made in the 1980s. The original climbers themselves personally add to the screenplay at appropriate moments, to what I believe is just the right extent for maximum effect. We are made to wonder what drives a couple of fit 25-year-olds to climb to such heights, in such conditions, with an insufficient gas supply, no oxygen, and no backup team. But that is sometimes the reckless nature of young people that age. The viewer is left in no uncertain mind about the might of nature versus the insignificance of human effort. This is reinforced in most spectacular fashion by the use of zoom photography, underlining the sheer size of the Andes mountains. What does make the difference, though, is the strength of the human will, particularly when it comes to a matter of very survival. In this case we are given to believe this is largely driven by the fear of dying alone, but I found myself trying to identify what other motives might have been present in such dire circumstances. Considering the semi-documentary nature of the film, and the conditions under which it was made, I cannot rate Touching the Void less than 9 out of 10. It had me on the edge of my seat until the final credits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even for those who cannot understand why anyone would attempt to risk their life to climb a peak that most will never even know about, this film is a true eye-opener. It will show you the part of climbing that many amateurs such as I will only read about..and now, through dramatic reenactments as described by the survivors, see in this film. The beauty of the mountain is juxtaposed in tense dramatic fashion by the two climbers struggle to survive. In pitting human against nature, it will force the viewer to confront themselves with the fundamental principle of American culture--the morality of self-interested, rational behavior. As the law prof reviewer suggested, you may come away from this film with a different outlook on "acceptable" behavior in an ethical sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of what happens when two British climbers try to reach the top of a previous unclimbed mountain is one of the most spellbinding films in years. A hybrid of talking heads and re-enactments this movie is one of the best films (on mountain climbing) ever made. You'll forgive me but its hard not to speak in terms like, best, greatest, ect when you talk about this film. I think its all best summed up by the term, "WOW!!!"I can only imagine what this would be like on a big screen, where the sense of scale would be overwhelming. Not having been able to see this on a big screen I've had to make due with the DVD, which contains an extra called "What happened next..." which is what you'll want to know once the credits start to roll.My only complaint, and its a small one, is that the pace of the second half could be a bit tighter, other wise this is simply a great great movie.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touching The Void is part Documentary, and part dramatic re-enactment. Real interviews of Joe and Simon are inter-cut with dramatic re-enactments of their disastrous climb. If this had been a straight-up documentary, told by only interviews, it would have been a moving story, but would have lacked something. If it had been a straight-up dramatic movie, with actors and special effects, it would have been thrilling, but still missing some realism. Combining Joe and Simon's first hand story with realistic recreations on location is what this story needed to be told in the most realistic and scary way. The re-enactment was done on location at Siula Grande, with stunt climbers and actors. Watching the story unfold just by seeing the events on film is exciting, but when you're hearing Joe and Simon narrating their thoughts on the actual events at the same time, you can't help but feel genuine terror and concern for them. Take the scene where Joe is hanging over the cliff, ready to die. You know that he did survive, because you're seeing and hearing him talk about it in the movie, but it's his words that ground you in the moment. I've never heard a person talk about what it's like waiting to die, let alone have a visual image to go along with their words. I can honestly say that I was terrified for him, even knowing the outcome. And there are a dozen other scenes that produce the same effect. The majority of this film is made up of hopeless moments. Hearing Joe and Simon tell their story makes you believe it's hopeless, because that's how they actually felt at the time. This movie is very heavy, and almost as draining as an actual mountain descent would be. Touching The Void is as unique, powerful, and terrifying as any film I've seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egotism Meets Nature's Wrath</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful scenery and excellent cinematography highlight this true-life story of two young adventurers who, in 1985, attempt to be the first climbers to reach the top of imposing Siula Grande, in Peru. The two actual climbers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, narrate the story, while two stand-in actors re-enact the climbing.A big part of the film is Joe's quest merely to survive, once he becomes separated from Simon. Toward this objective, he calls forth inner strength in the form of two mental processes: first, make a decision and then act on it; second, set small goals or targets. During his ordeal a part of him keeps pushing: "You have to do this, this, and this, if you're going to get there; come on, keep moving, keep moving; right, get up, and do it again".In a docudrama like this, acting ability is not that important. What is important is the cinematography. The mountain scenery is spectacular. The camera also captures visual perspective, by backing away from the two climbers, or Joe alone in the second half, to reveal how small and insignificant they are against the towering mountain face, or lost within the vast expanse of a huge glacier, peppered with a maze of dangerous crevasses.The story is certainly harrowing. And I admire how Joe kept going, in the face of such adversity. However, I must say that overall I was not impressed with Simpson or Yates, both of whom came across in the film and in the DVD special features as overly ambitious, opportunistic, and egotistical. Joe as much as admits it: "We didn't give a damn about anyone else or anything else, and we just wanted to climb the world ..." This kind of cavalier attitude is not uncommon among participants in extreme sports, many of whom participate less for the adventure than for the opportunity to set records and make money."Touching The Void" is a great story of survival set amid the majestic splendor of the mountains of Peru. The only thing that would have made the story even better is if the two actual climbers had not been so arrogant. Overconfidence, born of an inflated sense of self-importance, almost cost them their lives.</fullReview>

Sure, when everyone had 13-inch television sets and a mono-VCR, I could understand how the movie going experience would be more enhanced at the local multi-plex. But in today's world of large screen, letterboxed television sets with surround sound sub-woofered DVD players, could I not enjoy any of the Lord of the Rings trilogy at home just the same as forking over $13 sans popcorn and parking to sit beside a bunch of strangers in the dark that will undoubtedly chat non-stop behind me and ignore my discomforting shhh's? (whew, deep breath!)'To be seen on a big screen!!' You won't ever get me uttering those seven dirty words to any friend of family. But a funny thing happened on my way to review heaven, and that funny thing included the newly DVD released true story of two mountain climbers in peril in film Touching the Void.Based on the true story of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, Touching the Void takes us on an adventure of endurance and the struggle for survival of two young British climbers in the 1980's that attempt to reach the summit of the Siula Grande in Peru. Their hopeful two-day venture is met with catastrophe when Joe accidentally slips and gruesomely breaks his leg and decisions by both men are made that will ultimately seal their fate. Sound exciting? You have no idea. Directed in a documentary style using the real Joe Simpson and Simon Yates as narrators to actors recreating their ordeal, Touching the Void follows the journey of one man trying to save another from inevitable death only to eventually cut him loose when reality supplants hope. Now separated, Simon deals with his demons of leaving a friend to die while the very much alive in spirit, Joe, struggles for days on end with a broken leg to crawl and climb over treacherous terrain to reunite with hopefully still-in-tact base camp. As the film is narrated by two of the three participants in the story, is comes as no surprise that Joe survived his weeklong struggle. However, knowing the outcome in no way counters the impact of the ordeal. When Joe starts hallucinating due to the lack of water or has to take one hop at a time over a rocky landscape that leaves him with abrasions and pain that you would almost feel through the screen, you are still met with an edge of your seat tension, rooting for the will of a man to take each day in 20 minute segments of accomplishments in movement. What makes Touching the Void so unique and different from other documentaries is the truthfulness of the two leads. They hold back nothing in an attempt not to sugarcoat the horror. Simon talks about thinking about the stories and lies he might tell in order to cover up what was a burdening decision to leave a friend behind. And Joe talks about yelling at Simon in anger and being surprised at how Simon developed a plan to take the two of them down the mountain when an injury of this sort was almost certain death.But what really made this film stand out in my memory are the landscape shots of the mountain. Filmed both in Peru and Europe, the mountain's icy crevices and snow-banked cliffs were beautifully photographed and captured by director Kevin MacDonald. When Joe falls into a crevice that would be undeniable death for even a seasoned climber, we are left with a sense of claustrophobia and loneliness that is hard for even the most seasoned of directors to capture.The DVD comes with extras that include a short of Joe and Simon reuniting 17 years later to go back to the mountain to relive the experience for the film crew, that is just as honest as the feature presentation. Joe talks of having no feeling whatsoever towards the attempt and wonders why he has agreed to what will be a disappointing emotional response for the director. And when Simon talks about how he and Joe have not remained close after adventure, we are reminded that these are real people with real feelings that survived something that might even have had Job cry 'uncle'. So, in a year where documentaries have begun to outperform some mainstream Hollywood films, you can add Touching the Void to the list. Just make sure you see it on a big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly Good But Over Publicised By Channel 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish to put my cards on the table and say I am completely unable to understand why someone wants to climb up a twenty thousand foot mountain . I do confess to enjoying hill walking but only if the hills aren't very high , and only if it's a beautiful evening where I can see the golden Summer sunlight shine upon a breathtaking Scottish landscape . I have very little if any sympathy for people who decide it's a great idea to go trekking across the Scottish Highlands in the middle of January and have to use their mobile phone to call out the mountain rescue when they get lost in a blizzard . If it was up to me I'd just leave them there until Spring . This cruel attitude doesn't extend to the protagonists of TOUCHING THE VOID Joe Simpson and Simon Yates since they are very professional in their attitude but the over riding thought while watching this was - Why ? Why ? Why ?This is the problem I had with TOUCHING THE VOID , it was rather hyped up as a docu-drama that would appeal to a mainstream audience and not just to people who are interested in mountain climbing . The trailers on Channel 4 that had been running almost non stop for two weeks were the worst culprits . Yes you can enjoy the real life man against the elements adventure but it becomes rather irritating as there's often little explanation to details . For example did Joe or Simon explain why they enjoy yomping about the Andes ? One of them mentions that having a rope tied around climbers can lead to the death of not only someone who falls but also someone who is attached to them . You've seen this happen in movies like THE EIGER SANCTION and VERTICAL LIMIT where someone falls from the rock face taking their companion to their death which always leads me to ask " Why do climbers attach ropes to themselves if that's the case ? " but this is never answered which led me to conclude that the target audience would need a basic knowledge of mountain climbing in order to enjoy TOUCHING THE VOID completely . The trailers also pointed out that this incident totally divided the mountaineering community but again there's little explanation why and we wouldn't have known this at all if a caption hadn't appeared at the end pointing this out . Very disappointingly it never goes into detail about the present day relationship between Joe and Simon . Do they still go drinking together or climb mountains as a two part team ?Not to be too negative the docu-drama format is undoubtedly the best medium to tell this type of story , if it'd been filmed as a feature film we'd have had to put up with a couple of Hollywood hunks acting all tough and macho and spending large parts of the movie without any dialogue to explain what was going on . There is some astounding cinematography of the natural beauty of mountain landscapes ( I'm glad I have a widescreen TV ) and get ready for the most bizarre use of a Boney M pop track you will ever seeI gave TOUCHING THE VOID seven out of Ten . I might have awarded it slightly more but because Channel 4 had been shoving the trailers in our face as to how good it was I ended up being just a little disappointed by it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire cinema was totally captivated and silent right through this film.The story, published I the book of the same name has been a legend and must-read within the climbing community for years. Everyone should see this film and learn why, and how far human beings can push themselves.The format of documentary with talking heads alternating with re-created action scenes is unusual and works very well. It gives an opportunity for the real life characters to say how they felt in a way that would have been impossible to put over any other way. Both Simon and Joe talk in understated terms of what they went through and the tension builds as they describe some detail and your imagination fills in how you would feel if it had been you, not them.The fact the Joe and Simon are talking you through their experience acts as a spoiler. You know they will live. But perhaps without this you'd be bored - knowing they were going to die and just seeing how long it was going to take, just like so many 4th rate straight-to video releases.The cinema was more silent than any I've been to in a long time, all the faces were locked to the screen. The film making is amazing, the story is amazing, go and see it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to understand why anyone would want to do this kind of climbing. The views must be exhilarating but the climbers say so little about them.The chilling statistic that 80% of climbing accidents occur on the descent is acted out on this snowy Peruvian peak as the chilly Joe Simpson and far friendlier Simon Yates are forced to make their way down separately.The documentary is strongest in showing in grueling detail what the gravely injured Simpson must do to survive. It could have done a lot better examining the psychological repercussions of Yates' having cut a dangling Simpson from his rope, leaving him to tumble into a crevasse.Despite its failings this is an amazing story of fortitude and survival. I looked the main characters up on Wikipedia and was not surprised to learn that Yates became notorious as "the man who cut the rope" and Simpson not only went on to climb other peaks but also found work as a motivational speaker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I said history, with an "H", cause it's not a fictional story. But don't expect some Hollywood phony "based-on-real-events" cliché like "Erin Brockovich", which I hated, by the way. "Touching the Void" could easily air on the Discovery Channel, cause it's more like a re-enactment of the real events than the ordinary movie, with the made up characters to dramatize.Said that, don't be fooled: this history doesn't need any script writers to make it interesting. It stands alone.Follow the two English climbers to the Andes and you will get a life lesson and an entertaining movie for the price of one, when Simon has to cut off the rope of his still very much alive fellow climber to a hopeless fall, only to find he survived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Distrustful as I am of all filmmakers' attempts to visualize a full-length book (and Simon's account of Mr. Macdonald didn't help!), I had to give this movie a square ten. Not only does it remain as truthful as possible to the original story (a feat in itself, considering the settings and the plot), it also features some of the most breathtaking scenes I've ever seen on a wide screen. It has been debated whether the appearance of Joe and Simon as narrators ruins the suspense somewhat, but my personal opinion is that it only adds to the whole experience - their remarks are witty on some occasions, bloodcurdling on others, and what better way of binding the public to the characters than having them recount a part of the story in person?Filmed in the authentic settings, with excellent camera work and a quite innovative approach to documentary movie-making, "Touching the Void" will have you transfixed for the entire 106 minutes of its length, climbers and non-climbers alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 'dramatized documentary' is nothing new (at least in the UK) for TV productions. Indeed the traditional doc is a rare beast these days. Nevertheless, this format is quite novel on film, so it was quite a surprise to observe how successful this work has been.As a visual piece, this film really is quite stunning, and I wish I had seen this on the big screen rather than DVD ? it is definitely a candidate for transfer to IMAX. It's also a tale of a real superman ? forget 'Spiderman' and his CGI ilk. The central character pushed himself to, and way beyond, what should be physically possible. But, of course what makes this story so gripping is the matter-of-fact way the two protagonists narrate their adventures. I notice a lot of comments initially think they are actors; such is the lack of enthusiasm from the two mountaineers. But they're British ? goddamit! It is the height of bad manners for us to behave in an ungentlemanly way, no matter how bad the situation is.As a typical example (some spoilers here); one of the climbers, after badly breaking his leg, falls down a bottomless crevasse, somehow survives, thinks his partner is probably dead and realizes that the only way to survive is to somehow get out of the crevasse and crawl down the mountain unaided with no food and water. He bangs his arm against the icy walls, crying and swearing in frustration. 'I was being very childish', he admonishes himself in the narration. Of course you were?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The facts surrounding the events in this film are readily known, so its a surprise that this film commands the emotional power and profundity that it clearly does, particularly since it employs a much overused docudrama format. Harrowing and emotionally compelling, this film is a testament to the film maker's choice to be as simple and unflashy as possible with what can only be described as an epic tale of endurance. Not a film about climbing, the film carefully avoids exploration of the reasons why these men climb. The story is about different questions: about what men do, need to do and what they can endure in order to survive. The choices which are made defy the imagination's attempt to put oneself in a similar place. One can only marvel at the the emotional and physical peaks which Joe Simpson had to scale in order to crawl down from an enormous, freezing Peruvian mountain with a broken leg for four days without food or water. The reenactments are superb; beautifully shot and dynamically performed.The film also places a question in the mind of the viewer regarding Simon Yates' decision to cut the rope attached to Simpson to avoid being dragged over down the mountain himself. (In fact, the question is answered, not just by Simpson, who claims he would do the same thing, but by the film itself, which seems to agree). It's a film about survival, which is an end in itself. At the conclusion of the film, Simpson's ordeal eclipses Yates', but Yates' agony continues a slow burn long after the film is over. It was the right thing to do (I believe), but how does he live with it? Not easily, apparently. I was deeply enriched by this film. A powerful, emotionally exhausting and ultimately a positive statement about the capacity for an individual to withstand unfathomable pain and despair, yet still function. The film places this drama quietly within a complex and ambivalent moral question and allows the viewer to find their own way down. The highest recommendation.</fullReview>

True mountaineers will appreciate the story and how well it was told (as compared to the last two big Hollywood mountaineering movies). From the detail of the amount of gear they carried to the frightening loneliness of a crevasse this movie was meticulous in it's representation of one of the most inspiring mountaineering stories and epic ordeals of survival.

		<fullReview>I work at a cinema in norwich (UCI) i was checking our listing and saw this film on them, thought what the hell is that!? i asked a friend and he said it was about some climbers, i remember catching a breif review on some tv show ages ago. Being a climber myself i decided to go see it asap. A few guests asked me whether to see Out of Time or this and i said i'd go with this coz it sounds much better. They went into see it, I had a few minutes to kill at work so i went and watched the first 10mins, i really struggled to pull myself away. I was standing at the exit to the screen when the film finished, and i noticed a strange things happen, nobody left till the end of the credits!!! I went and saw it the next day with a few friends. As the trailers rolled i started munching on my bag of chocolates and sipping at my pepsi, then as the film started i just couldn't take my eyes off the screen, the cinematography is amazing (i studied film) the shots are just fantastic, tremendous scenery.The film builds up the tension and sheer drama of what they are attempting well. After a while u forget you are watching a documentary and just start watching it like any other film. as the excitement built up i realised i like Joe was frozen still, unable to move i felt his pain and the moment when he has the song in his head just gets right in your head as well and you start to feel sick as well.I've never been as moved by a film as i have with touching the void with the exception of Schindler's List. When the film moved i realised i still had most of my chocolate and pepsi left, and everyone around me were just sitting there, me and my mates just slowely got up and walked out of the cinema not saying a word, we were all just so gobsmacked by what we had just witnessed.If you get a chance, see ths film, it's one of the best movies i've ever seen. 10/10David Wortley</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely scared and moved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a hill-walker and scrambler for a few years and recently got into indoor rock-climbing. After seeing this, I think I may stick to climbing indoors. I've never done any true mountaineering, but I suppose that knowing about the kit and techniques the protagonists were using added to my (already considerable) involvement in the film (for instance I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how on earth I would tie knots with my bare hands in minus 80 degree wind-chill conditions). Also, though I have never come within a fraction of the danger that the two men in this film experienced, the (very, very minor compared to this) sticky-situations I have faced up mountains in bad weather helped me to connect a little more than I maybe would have otherwise.** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT **I guess it's not a spoiler to say that the end of the film is always known. It's based on the best-selling book by one of the climbers and we start the film with him talking, so it's pretty evident that he is going to survive. I knew the story in advance as well, though I haven't read the book (must do that now). Anyway, knowing that both men survive in advance in no way dampens the suspense of the film. I found myself truly scared at points and staggered at what the two were attempting, even before things started to go wrong.I doubt that I'll ever stand on the top of an Andean peak, but I got some sense of both the grinding effort involved and the immensity of the achievement of being the first people to climb a mountain. Both men were heroes before anything went wrong - what happened next propelled them into the super-hero category. However one of the more touching things is that neither man seems to see himself that way.I won't go too much into the twists and turns of the plot, rather I'll say that it was beautifully filmed, giving a real sense of the forces of nature and the immensity of the mountain compared to the two climbers. The level of realism in the re-enactments was impressive - I would think that non-climbers (and I'm only really a pseudo-climber) would be able to appreciate the mental and physical toughness involved. The way that interviews were inter-cut with the action was extremely well done, nothing felt forced or contrived about this, it just flowed. The level of emotion was incredible, as much as anything because the climbers were so controlled and even calm in their recollections. This meant that Joe Simpson's eyes watering on a couple of occasions hit you like a hammer blow - it was gut wrenching to see that 18 years later he still has a part of himself out on the slopes of Siula Grande.It would have been very easy for the filmmaker to teeter over into either sensationalism or over sentimentality (and knowing that Tom Cruise has the rights to make a [non-documentary] film of this fills me with some dread), but the film never did this. The restraint of the director left room for the emotions and achievements of the people involved to fill both the screen and the hearts and minds of the audience.I suppose I have talked a lot about emotions and it is a very emotional film. However, I should repeat that it is also very scary. I was literally on the edge of my seat for much of it (stressing once again that I knew the story in advance). I can't ever recall so many gasps in a film. There were some hard-core climbers sitting behind me and at times they seemed to be carried away by what they were watching, being reduced to whispering heartfelt expletives at various points, no doubt extrapolating from their own experiences.I suppose much of what I have said above suggests that this is a film just for outdoor enthusiasts. While I think that having some experience of the areas involved will add greatly to the experience (and from what I saw, half of the audience were wearing North Face fleeces!), much of the film would move anyone who has never left the safety of their own armchair. A lot of it deals with the vastness, beauty, power and cruelty of nature and how, even in the face of this, certain special individuals can exhibit the indomitable qualities that are needed to overcome the longest of odds. It's a very humbling film.Go see this if you are a climber, but also if you are interested in the human condition. You won't be disappointed in either case.A fabulous film - 10 / 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For once a high rating on this site is justified. I never thought I'd see the day... Ironically, it takes a semi-documentary to pull off this unbelievable feat, i.e. not a real motion picture. Even the prolifics love it, and they usually prefer products of inferior quality.I can't recall the last time a movie had me this transfixed onto the screen as this documentary. Following the story of two masochistic lunatics very nearly lose their lives was simply riveting. I've always considered mountain-climbers to be somewhat insane - and TTV did nothing to dispel that notion. I've seen my fair share of amazing survival stories, like the Italian marathon runner who survived a week in the African desert, but this Joe Simpson dragging his damn broken leg several kilometers down a rocky, snowy mountain in the middle of nowhere may just have topped them all.The acting is very good, the scenery terrific, the facial make-up far better/more realistic than in most horror films, and the use of music just right; the soundtrack was applied when necessary, and totally shut off for maximum effect when that was more appropriate. The only annoyance is the ever-grinning face of Richard Hawkins, as he gleefully explains how he stood and did nothing when he heard the first cries for help from Joe. What a useless man! There are people who saw this and complained that it was dull, that there wasn't enough action(!), that one can see this sort of thing every day on the "Discovery Channel, "National Geographic", la-di-da... People who fail to understand these sorts of stories are already mentally dead. Ironically, it is they who urgently need to get this type of struggle-for-survival experience under their pathetic belts, so as to wake up from their cozy slumber, induced by years of physical apathy, which inevitably leads to mental stupor.Some believers might not particularly enjoy that scene in which Joe realizes that praying to a non-existing God confirmed his suspicions that he was, indeed, a full-fledged atheist, and that no damn angels are making any plans to help him. I am sick and tired of the old cliché regarding the atheist who becomes a believer when his life is in danger. Hogwash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Touching the Void' has chosen the right approach to tell the true story of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates. Two mountaineers who had a lot of bad luck while climbing a certain mountain in the Andes. That they both survive is clear from the beginning since they are telling their own story, looking straight into the camera, the way people explain things in a documentary. Since two actors play Simpson and Yates in a reconstruction of their story this is not a documentary completely. The tension that is created due this approach is great. If it was a movie-remake of their story things would seem implausible and unbelievable. It would become a movie like 'Vertical Limit'. If it was all documentary with explaining and maybe showing the mountain from the time to time it would be a great story but boring to watch.Honestly, the movie had more suspense than most horror movies today. The real Simpson and Yates explain what happens and with perfect visuals the actors Brendan Mackey (Simpson) and Nicholas Aaron (Yates) show us how it must have looked like. There is third character named Richard Hawking who stayed at base camp while Simpson and Yates did their climbing. He is played by Ollie Ryall and of course it is necessary that he is in the reconstruction, but he himself also speaks like the real Simpson and Yates in between. For me he did not add anything to the story and therefore I did not really get his presence.About the story I will not spoil anything for you, although you must know some things already, but I can say that the events you will see are close to unbelievable. If you are already a little scared of things like climbing, you will definitely not change your mind after seeing this. If you want to see a nice documentary, or a thriller, action, horror, disaster-movie, see 'Touching the Void'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on the book of the same name by mountaineer Joe Simpson, the film both recounts and recreates the harrowing true story of Simpson and climbing partner Simon Yates' 1985 ascent of the sheer face of an Andean mountain. During the descent, Simpson falls and badly shatters his leg. After attempting to lower his friend to safety and losing him over an ice cliff, Yates makes the controversial decision to cut the rope that binds them together, letting Simpson fall more than 100 feet into a crevasse.Amazingly, both men survive. And even more amazingly, Simpson staunchly defends his friend's action upon their return home. Told in a docudrama style, the film captures both the majesty and terror of the mountains along with the real emotional and physical experiences of the climbers themselves. Utterly unique and deserves to gain a huge audience.Joe Simpson continues to climb today, and received a standing ovation after the screening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually mountain climbing motion pictures are left up to either IMAX short movies (Everest) or crappy movies (Vertical Limit), but not usually documentaries. It's even rarer to see it done in a fashion like in Touching the Void. Void is not a straight documentary, nor is it told in a normal way. It's almost completely acted out, but is basically narrated by the two main characters (in real life). Occasionally the film cuts back to the real people, documentary style, but for the most part, it's acted out.Two young climbers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, decide to climb Siula Grande, a previously unclimbed peak in the Peruvian Andes. However, many things befall them on their decent (as they always do-never on their ascent), including near-fatal injuries and crucial decisions.Void is one of the most thrilling movies I've seen in theaters for a long time. I'm amazed on how exciting this movie was, for not only was it obvious that both men survived (they narrated it!), but documentaries aren't always the most exciting genre. However, it was made perfectly. Not knowing much about mountain climbing, I would have been lost had it not been for the "illustrations". And without the narration/documentation, it would have been bland, hard to distinguish the action, and, quite simply, dull after a while. It was filmed perfectly: exciting, easy to follow, and fun to watch.However, one thing just REALLY bothered me, and that was how fake the mountains looks when it was just a pan across. It wasn't even CGI. I swear, it was just whipped cream! Going through all of the endeavors that those two went on through a bunch of whipped cream? It's shocking. Also, sometimes the shots looked extremely fake. They looked exactly like a Hollywood soundstage. Other than that, though, Touching the Void is a tense, new style of movie that will probably be utilized more in the future. That's a good thing, as long as it's done correctly, like this movie does.My rating: 8/10Not Rated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Touching the Void sets new standards in Docu-drama. It tells the story of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates' miraculous (near-fatal) accent of Siula Grande. This is a fantastic story to work with and has been made into film brilliantly. Once the drama unfolds it is utterly involving and you feel like you are with them every step of the way. The contributions from Simpson and Yates form a crucial part of the film, along with the dramatisation. It was an overwhelming experience for both of them and the viewer gets a great impression of it. There are amazing insights into how the mind works in these stressful, seemingly hopeless situations. The dramatisation excellently depicts the fantastic scenery, being shot on location in the the Andes and in the Alps. Simpson's incredible fight for survival is sometimes painful to watch but his eventual triumph is very uplifting. Despite knowing the outcome from the start, the progression of the plot still amazes.Touching the Void doesn't have the same impact when viewed over and over although it remains very watchable. Rarely do films provide an experience as emotional and involving as this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Touching the Void is a mountaineering thriller as much as it is a documentary about a now legendary climb up the western face of Siula Grande in 1985 by two young British mountaineers. Both Joe Simpson and Simon Yates came out alive and the documentary is based on the book by the same name by Joe.Joe comes across as an amazing man fighting a battle between life and death and calling up every reserve of energy that he could muster. The format of this movie shows actors re-enacting the scenes (very well done and quite thrillingly filmed in the Alps) intermixed with interviews of Joe and Simon plus the caretaker at base camp.I'm not a mountaineering fan and watching this didn't make me want to ever attempt mountaineering! but it is very interesting even for someone who doesn't know or care about the subject much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding movie - brings the book to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book several years ago and was impressed. I think the movie does an even better job of immersing you in the drama and driving home the conditions and ordeal Joe and Simon faced.I found myself reflecting on the movie several times after seeing it. You really experience the dilemmas they faced, and get a sense of the strength of character of these men. In the narratives from Joe, in particular, you realize the amount of self-appraisal he's had to undergo in facing and subsequently coping with the trauma he experienced.A great adventure movie - better than any fiction climbing movie I've seen. The cinematography and acting are spot on. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is simply fascinating. The story is engrossing; the reconstruction is exceptional; the camera work and photography is top class; the style of direction is brilliant. After just the first five minutes i knew that this was going to be one of those rare films that just leaves you thinking 'wow'. I was already aware that the film's budget was not particularly handsome and had a somewhat negative approach to watching it as i was convinced the small budget would have a detrimental effect on the quality (the case with so many other small budget films). However, the fact that it had won an award encouraged me to find out why. How glad i am that i found out. It would be a discredit to the film to simply not bother watching it (certainly for anyone who has taken the time to read its reviews) as this is the only real way to realise its magnificence. This is an inspiration to any budding film creator.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a vicarious experience. Essentially we are able to relive Simpson and Yates awe-inspiring ascent and harrowing descent of the 21,000ft Siula Grande peak in the Peruvian Andes. There is never a dull film moment. Audience members will be subjected to 3 major themes: mortality, loyalty and perseverance. And as all great films elicit, discussion after the conclusion will be inevitable. Director Kevin Macdonald does a superb job of capturing this experience using actors along with Simpson and Yates linearly interjecting commentary throughout. In the last 2 days, I have recommended this film to family, friends, acquaintances, work staff ...etc. Even for those reluctant to partake in the documentary genre, this film will undoubtedly enthrall, excite and horrify.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rowed across the Atlantic Ocean in a crossing with several problems and where me and my teammate were close to dying several times. I have never been able to retell my story in a way that other people will actually understand what I have been going through. That is where Touching the Void comes in. It is a movie where the original adventure tells his story, where the film only adds to the story, a story so great that most people will never understand. But this film helps people to get closer to the story than ever before.This is not a film for the person that thinks that Far Away, Robinson Crouse or Indiana Jones is an adventure movie. This is an adventure where the film is only a communications platform for the true story. Climbers will love to see this movie, and will learn a lot of worthwhile knowledge.Sum: This is the first movie I have seen that retells an adventures story in a way that makes the story justice.Niclas M?rdfelt, Oceanrower</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true story about two young British men who climb a remote Peruvian mountain. A gripping tail of survival and human nature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This outstanding film manages to be more than a tail of survival; it touches your very sole. The feeling of isolation and helplessness is beautifully portrayed through the daring camera work, the haunting music and the tense narration by Joe Simpson, Simon Yates and Richard What's-his-face. The mountains seem to have a godly presence verging on evil. As Simpson describes his first night alone in the mountain you realise that his struggle is not just for his life but also his sanity. He and Simon Yates make very honest and thought provoking comments about what happened to them up there. A simple look into each others eyes is described with dread and horror as they begin to accept their situation. Their predicament forces you into questioning yourself. Simpsons epic efforts to get off the mountain and to be with someone is awe inspiring and to hear it told from the horses mouth is fascinating.I enjoyed the film so much that I have since read 4 of Joe Simpsons books. I have no intention of climbing any mountain but Touching the Void puts you right on the west face of Siula Grande. I.M.D.B have recommended watching K2, if you like this one. Well Simpson walked out of the cinema shortly into it. It's not that kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even when one watches this film on television, it would be almost impossible not to become involved in the exploits and dangers encountered by the two young men. No fictional narrative could be any more gripping than that of watching the man left behind find his way down off the mountain. I have only one qualification about the film. Perhaps I missed it in the titles, but I was not aware that we were seeing a re-enactment using stand-ins for the leads, and being filmed at a later time. Call me naive, but throughout the film I was wondering about how a camera was able to document the action as it occurred. I'm not sure whether I would have enjoyed the film more or less if that had been made clear from the start. In light of the process actually employed, does this qualify as a true documentary, when it uses actors and follows a script? Do we know whether anything was added to the actual exploits in order to make the action even more exciting?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Touching the Void is a magnificent, awesome movie about heroism, preseverance, and luck in real life and death circumstances. The apparent recreation of this compelling and breathtaking rock-climbing adventure delivers an emotional impact of a rockslide in both sound, visual effects, and acting. This is one of the most riveting and well performed and photographed feature film that brought to life one of the most difficult and defining moments in rock-climbing history and a fight for survival. The recreated scenes of rock-climbing and the action, the narration, the music are so well done, seamlessly edited and smooth. It is sometimes impossible to really believe that this recreation wasn't real, except for the impossibility that somebody had to be shooting the entire scene. It's an amazing achievement of an amazing achievement in actuality. Nine out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Touching the Void" tells the harrowing ordeal of a pair of British Alpine mountaineers who climbed the 21,000 ft Peruvian Andean peak of Siula Grande in 1985. The question of survival in this gripping docudrama is a forgone conclusion as the film is narrated by the two climbers. However, that fact does not assuage this gripping tale as the two men supplement an excellent reenactment with compelling insights and honest appraisals of their moment to moment struggle with survival in the face of almost certain death. With excellent marks from the critics and public alike, "Touching the Void" should make for an interesting if not nail biting watch for anyone into adventure films. (B+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually go in for this kind of thing, and there was something else on I wanted to watch. But I was riveted to my TV for the WHOLE movie. I TRIED to turn the channel to my other show, but couldn't!By cutting the rope, Simon saves both their lives. If he had not, they both would have died. Of course, that is simply how it came out...Simon wouldn't know he'd save BOTH of them by (to him) dooming Joe.As a Canadian student, I studied a poem by Earle Birney called "David". Most schools teach this poem at one grade or another. Usually high school, as it's pretty strong stuff for elementary school.The short story of the poem is that while the speaker and his friend David are mountain climbing, David has an accident. He falls down a cliff onto a narrow ledge and breaks his neck. He is totally paralyzed. The story teller must then decide what to do. He knows that the days it will take him to climb out and then days more to climb back with help...David will certainly die a horrible, slow death. David begs his friend to push him over the edge...to end it quickly. I was both horrified and fascinated by the situation and the dilemma. I seem to recall it was up to the reader to decide what the speaker had finally done. Did he kill David, or was he going for help?I was equally enthralled by this movie documentary. On the edge of my chair through the whole thing. Even though I knew he would be rescued (obviously) the suspense damn near killed me. I've rarely been so taken up by a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the movie last night and it blew me away. Thank god I knew from the beginning that they both survived, or I don't think I would have been able to get through the whole thing. But I do have a question which I hope a climber out there can clarify for me. Why couldn't Simon have anchored himself to the mountain side as he was lowering Joe, so that he wasn't in danger of sliding down after him? At first I thought it was because there was too much powder and nothing for him to sink an anchor into, but then it occurred to me that he must have done this when he went down after cutting Joe's rope, otherwise, what was his rope attached to? And if he had been able to anchor Joe's rope, wasn't there some possibility that he could have pulled Joe back up? I know there's probably some kind of simple thing I'm missing here, but if someone out there would clarify for me, that would be great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film! And more than just a mountaineering film. "Touching The Void" is an incredible story of survival. Like Shackleton's odyssey, you would not believe Joe Simpson's saga if it was not true. For a documentary, this movie does everything right. The mountain footage is fantastic. The climbing shots are gripping. The narration follows the story line by line and scene by scene. Every aspect of this harrowing epic is brought to life and fully explained. It is like reading a book on screen, full of detail and imagination. The acting is fine and continually complements the narrative. This true story blows away Hollywood tripe like "Cliffhanger" and "Vertical Limit". Forget for once the sappy plot lines and ridiculous far-fetched feats attributed to most adventure films. This amazing story is true! My only contention would be that "Touching The Void" is after all, a documentary, and therefore might come across as methodically slow at times. All the same, go see it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think that I've ever seen a production before where I have held my hand over my mouth in disbelief. All the way through this documentary I was in wonder at how Joe Simpson would manage to survive his incredible ordeal and come to recall his story so vividly. Having since read the book, I thought the documentary was a brilliant adaptation, not lingering on certain parts for too long, as I have heard criticised in the book. Reproducing the story with actors was an excellent way to break up the interviews with a visual image of the two climbers ordeal, and the idea of not letting it all be the actors on the mountain helped keep the reality of the situation.I would advise anyone to watch this documentary, whether they were interested in climbing or not. It is a true example of a person's will and strength of mindAs for Simon Yates major criticism, I agree that he did the best thing possible in his position, and would place no blame on him.Haz</fullReview>

Sometimes there is only one person in the world who can do something, and by some twist of fate they are there at the perfect time in history and that events unfold in such a way that what is deep inside of them is put to its true test. And against all odds they show that nothing in the universe can compete with what they have.See it and vote for it. It needs more votes to reach the top 250 list.</fullReview>

The frank interviews with the climbers and the incredible cinematography make a climber like me just in awwe at both the story and the technical challenges of accurately portraying and filming the experience. It was either that they used a great deal of special CGI animation or that they really did take the on mountain shots, either was its extraordinary, but if they shot them in real settings, that's just unbelievable. I was especially impressed by how upfront the climbers were in admitting their true feelings and telling it like it was, not trying to glorify the experience, as if it needed any of that.

		<shortDescription>A very suspenseful documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film, the story of two mountain climbers, to be a powerful tale about the strength of the human spirit and one man's will to survive. It is remarkably suspenseful for a documentary, more so than most narrative films. The story is told and narrated by the two men that lived through it so there is never anydoubt about the outcome, which makes the fact it is so suspenseful all the more amazing. What makes it so gripping is how these two guys, (especially Joe),are able to overcome one seemingly impossible obstacle after another. My only criticism, and it's a very small one, is that the film peaks about two thirds through, those with a short attention span may find the final third getting a little repetitive. The photography is amazing and you can't help but to wonder how on earththey got some of these shots, surely under conditions nearly as difficult as those faced by the two leads. The story is illustrated through reenactments, the two climbers that play Simon and Joe are never called upon to do any real actingbut do a very serviceable job of keeping the viewer engaged. Overall a verypowerful documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going to the cinema is rarely painful. Much of the mainstream fodder is served up in easily palatable servings which rarely confront or surprise. It's a comfort zone. Some people like it. Some don't. I have a pretty strong will when it comes to films and I love being confronted, but some of Touching The Void was difficult to watch, though I never averted my gaze completely. However, such was the power of this film.The documentary form has been changing. As a local critic mentioned, documentary used to mean actuality. Check out any historical doco on the TV today and 90% of it dramatised or (that word I hate), 're-enactment'. Drama and actuality has morphed into the modern-day documentary form. For the film-maker, skill in dramatisation is now usually required, and the credibility of the documentary will depend largely on the re-creations. Here, Touching the Void excels, for the entire film is a re-creation, but it only ever SUPPORTS the verbal accounts from the two actual survivors, not the other way round. The visuals could easily have stepped into the sensational, but thankfully they remain wonderfully genuine.Nearly twenty years ago, two English climbers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates scaled the hitherto unconquered west face of the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. The climb was difficult but they made it to the top without incident. Joe says 80% of climbing accidents occur on descent, and they were about to increase the average.What follows is an extraordinary story of physical pain and mental torture. Joe is placed in predicament after predicament, compounded by ever-present excruciating pain. Eventually, when you feel Joe is meant to die, the film becomes existential as he starts to question his own reality. His doubts, fears, anger, indeed any emotion, washes in and out of his head. His cares come and go as he struggles with self-awareness. It is a profoundly moving, compelling and thoroughly fascinating description of the human psyche during a time most of us will experience only once - just before we die. That he made it through to tell the tale makes me feel extremely priveliged to have heard it.Of course, Simon had his own problems, which I won't give away, but in the grand scheme of life are still highly significant. How the two got through this ordeal is quite remarkable.Director Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September) realised that being twenty years after the event, Joe and Simon may have trouble retelling it in the detail that was required for the film. Consequently, he conducted the interviews with them before filming anything else, to make sure it would work - he interviewed them for around 18-20 hours each! And it's this which forms the real backbone to the film.This is an incredibly compelling, moving and well made film, and important if only as a revealing description of a mental experience most of us aren't privvy to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Touching the Void may be old news in a lot of countries but in Australia it's just been released in cinemas. The upcoming release of Fahrenheit 911 got me interested in seeing documentaries in the cinema, I started off with Super Size Me, now Touching the void and at the end of the month Fahrenheit 911. The cinema is a surprisingly good place to watch documentaries, I thought a film had to have a certain level of entertainment to be worthwhile on the screen but a well made documentary like the ones above definately keep your interest. Touching the Void would have to be the best mountaineering documentary I've seen, the documentaries that were shown last year on the 50th anniversary of the Everest summit climb were good but don't hold a candle to this in terms of recreating a story, plus against-all-odds stories of survival are always the most interesting. When I heard about Touching the Void using re-enactments I was a bit unsure whether it was worth going to the cinema for as re-enactments are usually cheesy looking and poorly done. The re-enactment was more along the lines of a re-creation in that they actually did the re-enactments on location, and used actors that looked similar to a young Joe and Simon. This is the sort of 're-enactment' that's on par with Cliffhanger or Vertical Limit.If Touching the Void is still playing in theaters in your country see it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having read the book, I immediately thought it would make a brilliant movie, especially because it's a true story.Then I had second thoughts. It would not have been the first time that a movie completely altered and destroyed a true story and it would, most definitely, not be the first time that a movie about climbing and mountaineering came out completely unrealistic, if not absurd (Cliff Hanger and Vertical Limit do come to mind).I am happy to say that this is not the case. Firstly because the true protagonists of the real story are the ones telling it and secondly because I don't think that Joe Simpson would allow, let alone participate, in a movie that would not be true to the facts or tried to overdo any emotional aspects of the story.It is a brilliantly filmed movie, almost like a documentary but not quite. It is a movie to be viewed and enjoyed by all, those who already love and therefore respect the mountains, and those who should.If you are looking for a movie that gives you more than mere entertainment, go watch this.</fullReview>

I can see another version of this being highly successful at the box office...there are so many potentially dark nuances and micro plots that could have been played with. Jo to this day defends Simon's action in cutting the rope which held him dangling over a crevasse. That is the traditionally noble thing to do. I wonder what his genuine feelings are about the whole thing. The ones no-one but he will probably ever know about. Personally I'm glad to have heard the true account and to have seen the individuals who actually went through this ordeal.

		<shortDescription>best climbing film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cliffhanger. K2. Vertical Limit. Such have been the lame offerings from the mainstream film industry. As members of the climbing community, my friends and I would sit through these films and laugh out loud in the theater at the most inappropriate times as the heroes said or did utterly preposterous things that made all climbers cringe or burst out laughing. Sure, these movies are fiction and made with maximum entertainment value in mind. But so was The Eiger Sanction, which had been the most realistic climbing film to hit the big screen. But at least they tried to make it some realism.Then there is Touching the Void. A documentary about one of the most intense survival stories ever told. As another reviewer noted, the strength of the human spirit and will to live demonstrated in this story is akin to Shackleton's epic Endurance. After visualizing the extent of suffering a human can endure and still fight to survive, one feels humbled and not worthy of complaining about the trivial discomfort most of us whine about in our daily lives!The remarkable thing about this film is how the director managed to maintain suspense throughout, even though the outcome was known from the beginning. I read the book many years ago and knew the story well (it is sort of a legend in climbing circles and often told), but I found myself emotionally drained when Simpson finally arrived at the camp and yelled out to his partner, only to hear silence. He "lost a piece of himself" at that moment, and finally accepted that he was going to die. Of course the viewer knows he is not going to die, but we are made to feel his utter defeat and surrender. It was at this point, that Simpson accepts his plight: he touches the void.Excellent narration and acting. The makers of this film went through great efforts to make the climbing equipment and techniques as real as possible. They did a great job explaining some of the technical aspects of climbing so that the lay person could easily relate to what is happening.The physical conditions under which this was filmed are undoubtedly the most difficult in the history of cinema. There is a documentary about the making of Touching the Void that is worth seeing as well.10/10. Don't wait for the DVD. See this film on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, realistic and absolutely fantastic story!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story is so fantastically authentic, beautiful and amazing. During the movie i somehow didn't know how to react to what happened on screen, the two "stand in" actors does an amazing job, giving the story even more realism, and it also makes it easier for us viewers to relate to it, but the real strength of the story is the passionate way Simon and Joe guides us through the story, it is absolutely fantastic listening to the voice-overs, sorta commenting and explaning over the pictures, which are being held together by a lot of creative moves and stunning cinematography.Somehow i don't know how to explain what i felt and thought during this movie, it feels a bit undescribable, but the movie really portrayed raw pain so raw as it could have been in my opinion, i remember at first thinking the movie was moving way to fast considering the runtime of it, but as it got on i started to realize that the main thing the movie wanted to focus on was how Joe survived his struggle through the mountains, alone, with a broken leg. And that is indeed amazing.Another thing that is a great strength of this movie, is the great directing, the directing is top notch, that can't be denied, the usage of pictures and sounds are so well done and thought through you are forced to love it, especially there is a sequence with a Boney M song, i'm sure everybody that has seen this movie/docu will remember that scene for a long time, Joe explains how annoying he found it to have this song stuck to his mind, and the song is just playing extremely loud while we watch Joe lie in the rocks in pure pain, the picture is fuzzy and blurry and gives a good feeling of realism and the song here fits so perfectly, the usage of the song reaelly makes us feel like we are Joe, alone in the rocks, with this unbelivable stupid song on our heads, a very powerful scene that, even though it was annoying as hell to listen to this crap song, it's just an amazing scene that gives a good view also on how picture and sound can be combined to reach inside your mind.The acting there isn't much to say about, the stand in actors does an amazing silent work, while they anger and suffering is brought to life by the well placed voice-overs from Joe and Simon.I am full of good words for this movie and i warmly recommend it if you want something non-commercial, beautifully raw and authentic.. This is then the movie you want to see, the movie is not flawless, but it sure as hell is well done.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was sat on the plane bored and about 4 hours into my journey when I discovered this little gem being played on the onboard entertainment. If you think you've ever experienced an exhausting, dangerous or incredibly perilous experience in your life, then prepare to be humbled, because what these guys went through is just about the most incredible tale of survival I've ever heard. Whether it is the story itself that makes the movie, or the way the movie was made that makes it such an enthralling story, one thing is for sure you'll never forget their tale. The film itself is made up of footage with the survivors retelling their story whilst being interjected with staged re-enactments of the key phases in their ordeal. The re-enactments are well filmed and don't have any feeling of them being so far from the real experience as to make them redundant or detract from the gritty real edge of the film experience. I'm not sure how it will hold up on repeated viewing as once you know how the whole story pans out it really isn't going to make you want to watch it again and again. But do yourself a favour and check it out at least once just to see how the human spirit can endure the most extreme of experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and terrifying (***1/2)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the comedy stinkpit of "Welcome To Mooseport", it was great to see a movie now that was good, that made me feel something intensely."Touching The Void" is the most intense, scariest, and most exciting movie about mountain climbing I've ever seen. And based on a true story, it makes movies like "Cliffhanger" and "Vertical Limit" look like the cheesy Hollywood fluff that they are. Based on Joe Simpson's book about his own hellish experience climbing the treacherous, uncharted west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes, this story would make either a fantastic documentary OR a gripping dramatization. So which is it? It's both. The film is filled with interviews of and narration by Simpson, his climbing partner Simon Yates and their (sometimes frustratingly dim) traveling companion, Richard Hawking. But most of what we SEE is an amazingly well done dramatization, with some truly jaw-dropping cinematography and very good actors playing the roles of the 3 men. The climb up the mountain went smoothly, but on the way down, Simpson broke his leg badly. Yates figures out a way to lower him down gradually, but when this plan goes awry, the rope is cut and the men are separated. In a scene of absolutely breathtaking suspense, Simpson (played extraordinarily by Brendan Mackey) dangles over an ice cliff, unable to do anything because of a broken leg and frozen hands, and then when the rope is cut, falls over 100 feet into a deep crevasse. The fact that you know from the beginning that both men survived the ordeal takes nothing away from the film. On his painstaking and death-defying 4 day journey back to the base camp, Simpson endures one unbelievably terrifying or painful situation after another, and you are right there with him every step of the way, on the edge of your seat. All I will say is that if you're even slightly claustrophobic or acrophobic (afraid of heights), you can expect some nightmares after seeing this film, and the fact that it's based on a true story just makes it that much more amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I go to at least 50 movies this year and this is certainly the best movie of the year. First, if you can, watch it in a movie theater. There are beautiful mountain scenes that you do not want to give up by watching on DVD. Second, watch it with a friend who knows about mountain climbing. You will be really wondering about answers to some questions at the end of the movie.This is a documentary about two climbers who climb to a difficult mountain. This is a real story. And it is very exciting. Will they survive or die in the end? O.K. from the beginning we know that they will survive, but still...You will be asking: if I were one of these climbers, how would I deal with the difficulties? Then, you will find parallels to the difficulties in your own life...The directing is perfect. The acting is perfect. The story is perfect. I cannot understand how someone can trash this movie? The New York Times critiques tried to. I stopped reading them...My Grade is: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read the book a couple of years ago, not seeing this movie was not even an option.The movie does a great job of expanding the images in the book, but, for me, the book was so well written that some of the darkness and despair that Joe described was perhaps lost.In particular the last part of his journey through the moraines seemed more harsh, and more desolate as described in the book.For me the particular treat was seeing Joe and Simon talking about the incident in their own words. The price of the movie was worth it for this alone.All in all a great documentary. Definitely recommended for those that have read the book, but not a replacement for doing so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mountaineering and climbing movies normally follow a rule; they are always awful, particularly if you are a climber, but this film is THE exception. A (true) story which is one of the modern epics of survival with stunning climbing sequences and a real sense of being there. THe film is a mixture of documentary and live action (it has to be said the doubles don't look much like the real thing) but filming in Peru gives tremendous sense of reality and Joe's amazing fight for survival is vividly brought to life. The audience I saw it with all seemed to enjoy it even though many did not seem to know the story in advance and I am sure everyone came away with a sense of awe at the strength and determination of Joe as well as sympathy for Simon's terrible choice.

He was an exceptionally strong guy both mentally and physically and even though I knew that he survived I had no idea how he was going to do it.You do not need to be a mountaineer to enjoy this because ultimately it is about human experience rather than mountaineering.Definitely try to see this in a cinema, the large screen is the only way to do the scenery justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A splendid, faithful reconstruction of Joe Simpson's book, 'Touching the Void' tells the tale of a mountaineering expedition that went terribly wrong. Fans of the printed version will especially enjoy seeing the mountains of the mind so carefully described in prose in their gorgeous flesh, and like the original, the film concentrates on the nakedly remarkable detail of the story, avoiding superfluous melodrama. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is what happens before the rope is cut: the audacity and ambition of the climbers in setting themselves against such a peak, and the strange psychology by which two men are bound to one another through absolute functional dependence without any hint of sentimentality. What happens after is fairytale by comparison, epic but simpler. A must-see for anyone who has ever wondered what it would be like to live on the edge.</fullReview>

If it is no longer playing anywhere when you read this, contact the distributor and arrange to buy a print for yourself because you must see it on the big screen and with a good sound system. You will not mind the expense because you will remember later that you have had to sit through scores of humdrum claptrap looking for this one amazing gift. I do not want to give you details because they will all be spoilers -- you simply must experience it for yourself. *Touching the Void* is simply the best survival film I have ever seen and because it sets new standards for the genre that means it is one of the best films I have ever seen. This is why we love film. This is what keeps us returning. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought the title of the film was very accurate. In many films the title is explained to the audience through a sentence spoken by one of the cast, and still leaves the audience perplexed, questioning the title name. I thought a lesser man, or an older man would not have had the determination as Joe did. Tremendously gripping, and truly an incredible ordeal to come out of. I was stunned at how well their ordeal was depicted. The photography was riveting, as was the story itself. You'll forget where you are, with all the tension, excitement and horror rolled into one. The last film I saw which was very good indeed was the climbing of Mount Everest in Imax photography. But, Touching the Void beats the 3D experience of that film, for its sheer vivid conveyance of the incredulous danger, tackled and endured by these climbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has its own spoiler. You know that both Joe and Simon survive because much of the film is their talking heads and Joe wrote the book this film is based on. Despite that you are on the edge of your seat throughout, wondering how they could possibly have got off the mountain alive.I have never felt physical pain in the cinema as I did when Joe fell time after time on to the hard rocks as he tried to limp down.Leaving all the talking to the real Joe and Simon was inspired, leaving the actors free to display emotion (mainly fear and despair) through movement and expression, which they do to enormous effect.The other key feature is the stunning cinematography, you will never have been as physically drawn into a harsh and inhuman environment than Kevin Macdonald and Mike Eley manage here. The cold and disorientation of the high Andes is palpable.A must see film - and must see on the big screen, it will be a pale imitation of itself when it is released on TV.Finally it reminds us again what a creative disaster the winding up of Film Four Productions has been and how lottery funding for films sometimes enables real gold to be produced (and this time distributed).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Possible spoilers*I went to a preview screening last night of this. I have always been meaning to read the book, but never got around to it, I do al lot of walking so the subject interests me. This is very well made and a lesson in how to make a good film of this type. I am now interested in seeing 'one day in September' another film made by the same people. If this was fiction it would be a good film, but the as its based on a true story it makes it very moving and involving. The film raises a number of questions about climbing and the risks people are prepared to take to climb what are basically big lumps of rock. The two men involved in this were both committed and ambitious climbers who took many risks in order to climb the mountain in the film, knowing full well that a mistake could cost them their lives. A simple mistake almost did. More often than not what happened would have meant that one of them died if not both. The story of both men is inspiring and what Joe Simpson did is a staggering human achievement. It is a lesson to us all in what we are capable of. I won't say anymore about what happens other than you come away (I did) moved by it all and I left feeling that I admire people even more so that are prepared to take those risks and achieve what in many ways only benefits themselves yet is able to inspire many others to do other great things.Excellent and a somewhat unique film to be shown on the big screen. Go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because this film has no star names and is partly a documentary featuring two mountaineers, it may be ignored by some despite the fact that it should get excellent reviews from the critics.

As such it has the widest appeal and I cannot imagine anyone who goes not being absorbed in this cinematic experience. Don't hesitate, go.</fullReview>

The film is actually a docu-drama, allowing the climbers to give firsthand recounts of what happened and blending that with actors who reenact the events.

I can't imagine how the viewer can be enthralled to the horror of what Joe Simpson is going through if it's not done in part dramatization and part interview/narration.It's a rescue and survival movie without help of any helicopter or rescue team.

		<shortDescription>A staggering saga of survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touching the Void is a film that finds its storytelling frame so accurately and precisely that its no wonder the film is so absorbing. It literally grabs you from the very first frame, carries you through the middle, and only lets go when the end credits roll.TTV is another one of those stories that if it weren't true it would be unbelievable. Faithfully recreating the events of 1985, two mountain climbers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, attempt to cross an impossible mountain, the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes.Director Kevin Macdonald quite ingeniously has two narrators telling different versions of the same story. The narrators being Simpson and Yates. Because they're present, and very much alive, we know that they must have survived the mountain. And they did. But the source of interest is how they managed it. We see the events recreated with stunt and body doubles. But the actual events are sharply placed into focus by the thoughts of the people who were really there.Simpson and Yates were only in their mid 20s when they tried this. And you have to wonder what prompts a person to attempt something like scaling a mountain. It takes someone of extraordinary courage and determination to undertake such an ordeal. But the irony is the real challenge for these two men came not by climbing up the mountain. But down it.They reach the peak in three days time. Immensely proud of themselves, they begin the journey down. And that's when their troubles begin. Simpson breaks his leg when he misses a step, driving his calf bone into his knee joint. Simpson's actual description of the event makes it sound more painful than I have. When mountain climbing, a broken leg (or any limb for that matter) is a death sentence. But Yates decided to stick with his friend.Yates starts lowering Simpson down by rope every 300 feet. It's slow going but they progress. But unfortunately the weather's not on their side. A storm obscures their vision, and Yates unwittingly lowers Simpson over a cliff. Simpson can't signal him, and Yates is left with one inescapable conclusion. He's going to have to cut the rope, or both men will die. And that's what he does.Now alone, Yates performs the rest of the descent, and heads back to base camp. But miraculously, Simpson didn't die. He fell into a dark crevasse, and landed on a ledge. But he was alive. This is where the story focuses on him more, and his staggering journey through the crevasse and down the mountainside.This is the part where TTV really struck a chord with me. Up until now, it had been an absorbing story of teamwork, but its at this point that it becomes an epic journey of one man's determination to survive.Simpson's account of the events is mesmerising, and provides an effective counterpoint to when we see what it must have been like. Macdonald doesn't scrimp on the details either. Providing closeups of frostbite, beard growth, the harsh ravages of one man's fight against Nature.Simpson even provides other details of what was going through his mind at the time. Am I strong enough? What did I do to deserve this? There are some extremely powerful moments like when he starts cursing God himself. But Simpson has no choice but to continue his journey through the dark crevasse. Even though he has no idea what may be lurking in the depths. The musical score is worth mentioning because its so jarring.The moment when Simpson finally breaks through the mountainside into daylight is a wondrous moment. His joy is subdued because he's in such physical agony. But you know deep down that he's rejoicing. I also love the part when he sees Yates footprints in the snow. His virtual path back to base-camp and his lifeline. Its almost as if there is still a bond between them ensuring their survival even though they're no longer together.Its a great moment when the snow gives way to rocks and boulders. But its not an end to the danger. Or the hardships. Simpson has to literally scrape and claw his way across the hard rocks. Every time he stumbled was a moment when I winced along with him. The scene when he can't get a song by Bony M out of his head is an unusual but effective way of showing that even mental hardships won't stop him. And when he does make it. And reunites with Yates. That is a moment that stays with you long after the film is over.Touching the Void is a marvellous film. One of the finest docu-dramas ever made. The contributions from Simpson and Yates really put things into perspective. The camera-work is claustrophobic yet expansive, and the narrative is so simple to follow, but with unexpected depth too. Touching the Void is a profound experience, a film to cherish, and one that reaffirms your belief that there really are heroes in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing an article on this movie for a movie-magazine. I have seen this movie hundreds of times and believes it to be the second-best movie ever made. The best one, in my opinion, being 2001: a space oddesey by stanley kubrick. That one is the most visually stunning. Touching the Void is the second-most visually stunning movie in the history of cinema. I've read all the reviews here on IMDb and there are only about 4 negative reviews out of 126. That is fully justified. This is really an awesome movie with an awesome plot as well. I also like Joe Simpson's other books such as "This Game of Ghosts". The criticism by "the unemployed critic" about "unresolved" questions is just stupid I think. Life is unresolved. What will happen to Joe? He is still alive. What will happen to him. "the unemployed critic" could have gotten the information he wanted had he done research outside of the movie. Read the book, and so on. Anything less than 10/10 is just ridiculous for this movie. It inspired me so much to move boundaries in my own life and seek out danger. Joe Simpson is extremely honest and so is Simon Yates. Richard Hawking's role is also very interesting. This is a unique and outstanding movie. The second-most visually stunning movie after Space Oddessey 2001. Watch it! Revel in it! Wallow around in it!</fullReview>

Approach and death trap trying to grab lives is also felt. You feel the enormous force that carries the desire to live.In addition, over the enormous excitement that involves the history we see, even no time to ponder the meaning of life, the afterlife and the need to make crucial decisions that may seem cruel, but that eventually reveal that they are saving. Therefore, it is a great shooting pictures, actual events and transcendental approaches.Performing Kevin Mcdonald's brilliant, getting us one more in this rugged expedition by moving their suffering, which rises to higher levels than Everest in regard to Simon with a broken leg, a colossal epic scenes such as when this one.... holding Simon on a cliff without knowing and when they can no longer cut the rope, brutal, or as Simon got into the crack, touching with his fingertips death , or when it surfaces through the snow, like a birth out, or when you drag through the snow leaving a trail like a snail was, or falls on the rocks, or that of his delirium ...

The three young men appear both as themselves, in interview form, and as characters, played by three actors who do all the actual action in the film.It's non-fiction, or "based on fact," even though it's all re-enactment. The truth is in the story, the scenes of climbing and falling and freezing and barely surviving are all made to illustrate that story. And the experience is uncanny, disturbing, exhilarating, and mind-blowing. The experience, that is, of vicariously reliving their experience. This, in essence is the film.You wouldn't think it would hold up, two hours of this. The two main climbers even tell you right at the start, by their presence in front of the camera, that they survived. So there is no wondering who died. But that's all good. What we see is not only what did actually happen so that they did not die, but also how it affected them, and how they have come to tell the story, which is not at all ordinary. Their candor, their almost chipper recounting of very horrible facts, is exciting to watch.This won't be everyone's cup of tea. I watched it the same night as "North Face," a more recent and well done story of climbers in 1936, based on facts. That movie was fictionalized, and dramatized, in a normal sense. It had no documentary edge, really. It was more beautiful and more engrossing, perhaps, but it wasn't nearly as chilling. This, "Touching the Void," finds a way to get into your bones and make you questions some very important stuff about morality, death, endurance. Both movies make clear how horrible it is to have things to wrong on a high alpine peak. The cold, the physical stress, and eventually the realization that you aren't likely to make it are in both movies. Very intense all around. And "Touching the Void" does find a special place in how the story is told, with the voiceovers of the survivors as they are apparently falling or freezing to death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blurring the boundaries of reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a docudrama with many levels to it. For one, it endeavours to illustrate what human nature can endure, and how the survival instinct kicks in when placed against the odds. In a world of modern conveniences we are far removed from the reality of direct danger.But the reality of direct danger and risk here are blurred in this film by its docudrama account of events. Like many documentaries, it is made less as a means to be informative, but more for commercial interest and purposes. This means that our grasp of 'reality' is one that becomes confused, and distorted by the need to make events a profitable venture. It is this blurring of reality for commercial purposes which is central to the morality debate of this docudrama style film.If by going on the account of events conveyed and portrayed in this film, conclusions can be made that these are two brave men, particularly that of Joe who is highly inspirational. It is due to such risk taking that the world advances on.In all, this is a gripping account of events from a director who has managed to make Touching the Void commercially viable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book back in the 90's when I used to climb and it was de riguer in the community - like having Freedom of the Hills and the Painted Spider video. But wow - this film somehow had an even greater impact than the book. Nothing like really knowing that you are going to die - alone... no hope... and then... It really conveyed those feelings. I'm only echoing others when I say I was absolutely glued to the screen, felt physically ill at times, was in total suspense although the final outcome was obvious. Unlike some, though, I think Simpson's deadpan ("I don't even like Boney M"), dry and mostly unemotional tone was totally appropriate (hey, that's what we expect from the Brits) and actually added to the emotional impact. Weirdly enough, although I am not religious, I was mildly disturbed when Joe said he thought he might revert to God in extremis but then found he did not. He's obviously a tougher man than I. Broken leg - OK, but once in the crevasse, I think I'd be wailing for God, Mommy and whoever else. I also really wanted to see an x-ray of Joe's knee. He said plateau fracture (tibia) but also described what sounded like a SC femur fx. Excuse me - just professional curiosity. He seemed to be walking well in the "making of" video 17 yrs later... Back when Cliffhanger came out, I saw it with a bunch of gym rats and we all mocked the "bolt gun" Stallone was using mercilessly. In that spirit, I offer up two nits to pick - one, they seemed to always be rappelling (uh - abseiling) on single ropes rather than doubles - were they just going to abandon their rope? and a single 8.8? Also, when Joe is stumbling down the talus field, where's his other ice axe? He had two before - two would have given him 3 points to walk on and fewer painful tumbles. Finally, other (I thought stupid) comments were made about why didn't they have whistles, walkie talkies, more fuel etc. Uh, you heard Simon talk about alpine style - we're talking that means FAST and LIGHT. Fuel is weight - they planned to be off by day 3 or 4. Also recall this was back in the 80's - remember that time before cell phones? Anyway, even though I'm not much of a mountaineer - beautiful sunny rockfaces only, please - I've never heard of using walkie talkies. I guess big expedition/Everest basecamp type climbs use radios but??? Even the whistle sounds very backpacker-ish. You usually communicate by tugs when yells cannot be heard. OK, that's enough talk - just go see it. Best for stoic loners who don;t go for regular box office hits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed the film when it was in theaters but caught it on PBS. I was on the edge of my couch the whole time, particularly when Joe Simpson described the injury to his knee and leg. The thought just made my stomach twist. I felt for Simon Yates as he described how hard his decision was to cut Joe loose. I can't imagine myself in either situation. It's an incredible story of survival and if someone simply wrote a script, you would think it all implausible. Knowing it really happened makes it all the more incredible. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what it really takes to survive. As a matter of fact, my dentist is a recreational climber and I'd love to know what he thought. I'll have to check with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than a mountain climbing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the film expecting something similar to the recent Imax film of Everest with plenty of mountain vistas, sun, snow, etc. I was not disappointed, but also really surprised at the human interest element of the story (actually, "superhuman" is more appropriate to this tale). The story of Joe's survival is miraculous in itself, but I found myself in agony for Simon after his decision to cut the rope and leaving his partner for dead in the crevasse. This is psychodrama at its very best, all the better for the understated Northern English tone of the story tellers and film maker. Compelling, exhausting, a triumph of the human spirit, it was all of that and thank goodness the lights of the theatre stayed dim for a while afterwards to give the viewing audience time to compose themselves!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen such an interesting film! I saw it in the morning and could not forget the movie until the night, because it was so impressive. The pictures of these two dehydrated, exhausted and suffering men will stay in my mind. I really felt for the mountaineers during the movie. The comments of the action added by the survivors give the film more depth, because you realize, that it is not an invented story.For people who like climbing, mountaineering, the mountains or impressive, true stories in general, its a brilliant film. That is why I would recommend this film to everyone even if you are not a climber. To sum up, an excellent, well-made and compelling film.</fullReview>

Everyone should see this movie if only get an idea of what not giving up means. The comardie shown by these two men is something to be seen. Neither blames the other for their prediciment, but only praises the courage eeach shows, for surely both show a unique courage. One shows the courage of decision, a decision that had to be heart rendering. The other shows the courage of determination, and survival. I think this movie deserves more notice than it it getting, because it would be well worth watching by all our young people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a movie - but a great documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>** Minor Spoilers **Some reviews of this 'film' have mentioned that it sits in the grey area between documentary &amp; movie. It doesn't - it's a documentary....Period.When I hired the film I was actually looking for movie as opposed to a documentary, but despite that mild disappointment (my own fault, should have read the back more closely) I was totally transfixed for the duration.There isn't much to write home about in terms of wonderful camera work and superb acting, but hey - when did you last watch the National Geographic channel for oscar winning performances? This presentation explains the very real story of an ill-fated climbing trip - it doesn't need special effects or a love interest to make the story gripping.The endurance of these two - especially Simpson - is testimony to the grit, determination and endurance that humans (not all, granted) are capable of when faced with almost insurmountable odds.The tension really goes into overdrive after the 'rope cutting' incident which has caused so much controversy and criticism in the climbing communities; however, it is a pretty well established (unwritten) rule of Alpine climbing that above a certain hight ("The Dead Zone") if you injure yourself and place a burden on other climbers it's just tough luck mate - you're on your own. It is high praise indeed to Yates that he even attempted to help get Simpson down in the first place.This is a tense and well presented film created with typical British understatement and modesty. No yelling of "Yeehah" and no flag waving. Still - I'm sure there will be a Hollywood version soon in which the climbers will suddenly be American (and the mountain will be bigger, the weather will be colder, Simpson will break both his legs and his neck and still manage a sprint finish to be reunited with his ex-wife and kid that he has never seen before. You know - the usual cliches..:-)A solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The passion of Joe Simpson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Right from the very beginning we see the two mountaineers narrating in person so we know that they both came out of this alive. Spoilers here will be on some of the details that viewers may not even want to know beforehand.My original idea of the summary line, before I even watched the film but just based on what I've heard about it, was `Making Vertical Limits look like kid stuff'. After watching it, however, I realised that the two are so different that comparison makes no sense. Vertical Limits is melodrama adventure using mountaineering as background. Other choices such as deep sea diving can serve equally well. Touching the Void is a documentary, period.The fact that this film is British is a big plus. The typical British understatement allows the audience to watch it with an intelligent, detached frame of mind. Someone complained about the hallucination of Joe Simpson, but that was almost towards the end and far from being over done. Balancing it is that typical understatement in the next (rescue) scene with Simon Yates, unable to contain his emotions in seeing Joe still alive, burst out repeatedly with the f-word and Simpson (the real person, narrator), voice-over, commenting rather casually: `Simon swears a lot'. Chuckles from the audience, after a rather tense 90 odd minutes.The story is clearly and interestingly told, literally, by the two mountaineers. Eight years after it happened, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates appear alternatively in front of the camera to tell the tale during those seven fateful days in Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. With their voices serving continuously as background narration, the camera moves to the re-creation of the events on site, with the two of them portrayed competently by Brendan Mackey and Nicholas Aaron. There is a third character, a chap by the name of Richard Hawking, who manned the base-camp while the two were negotiating the hitherto unconquered face of Siula Grande. While the real Hawking himself appears with reasonable frequency to tell the story from his perspective, i.e. waiting at the base-camp by himself and the time after Yates has returned thinking that Simpson is dead, the actor who portrayed him appears only briefly. This is an absolutely first class re-creation of a gripping tale, particularly Simpson's survival which is nothing short of being miraculous. I believe that it has stayed true to the actual events. Yates' action of cutting the rope and thereby letting Simpson fall to an almost certain death is of course the most controversial element of the story. In the film, Yates explains why he did what he did, but does not make a big fuss. Seem to be an instinct for self-preservation. Simpson actually ended up defending him against all the accusations from the mountaineering community.No apologies for the summary line, which is not intended as sacrilege to offend, but just for dramatic emphasis of Simpson's ordeal.</fullReview>

There's no dumb grafted-on plot a la "vertical limit", just a true-to-life tale of endurance and survival. Several scenes gave me the jaw-dropping reaction of "how the heck did they do that??" This film is the best outdoors/adventure film I've seen since David Breashears' 1998 IMAX production "Everest."It occurs to me that the theme of this movie is life ... the exhilaration of life (mountaineering "makes you feel more alive," says one of the climbers) and the preciousness of survival. In that, the movie is a perfect antidote to another film I saw recently, "City of God." In that, young lives are snuffed out again and again for no good reason. In "Touching the Void" we understand how important it is to just keep going, no matter how difficult the obstacles, no matter how bad the pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie and thought it was amazing. The courage of Joe Simpson is astounding. The lengthy comment I read about this movie is ridiculous. The whole point of alpine climbing is to go light and fast, hence one must leave certain things behind: you purposely place yourself in harms way to eventually overcome the hardships, and occasionally the situation, like in this movie, may go horribly wrong. Obviously the person who wrote the comment does not have the slightest clue about climbing, and should get his facts straight before he judges and tares apart a person who is twice the man he is.

		<fullReview>Documentary tells the incredible story of a mountaineering accident and how Joe Simpson managed to save himself from almost certain death. Movie is irritatingly shot: we see the participants in straightforward head shots telling the story, then actors portraying the events. The device is actually distancing, since one is constantly having to adjust between Simpson, say, telling you what happened and then seeing the actor doing the same things. Still, this is one of the great adventure stories of modern times, and the sheer inherent drama of it is enough to carry through the poor directorial choices. Both Simpson and Yates are eloquent in their recounting of the tale -- they're both deadpan, understating sorts of guys, which emphasizes the drama of what happened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Simpson's will to survive, kept everyone in my theater until the last credits. And it was a big theater with a true screen.It was as if everyone was looking for something in the credits that would make a normal guy out of Joe Simpson. But the credits ended, and you're left empty handed. Except for the note where it says he's still climbing. At that point, he's like a Steve Young, who after his 100th concussion, still goes back on the field. He's not normal, and you don't ever have to think he is.Joe Simpson hits the apex of the human spirit. And it's nice to know it's as high as the death picking mountains around him. And when the point comes in the film where he concedes the situation got so bad that finally he really lost something inside, for the rest of us, you have to believe if it were you, that point would have happened days earlier. In fact, it never would have happened, because when you leave the theater, you carry credit cards, not carabineers. And a big climb for you at best is El Capitan.This movie is worth at a bare minimum the time it takes to watch it. The ticket price is nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Touching the Void' is satisfyingly serious stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Touching the Void' is what successful docudrama should be: thoroughly accurate and terrifyingly dramatic. The accuracy comes from the narration by original climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates; the drama comes from British filmmaker Kevin Macdonald (One Day in September--the terrorist attack on the 1972 Israeli Olympic team in Munich). In 1985 the two adventurers successfully ascended Siula Grande, a 21,000 peak in the Peruvian Andes, as they said, "The last big mountain face in [the] range of mountains that hadn't been climbed." It was the descent that caused the problems: Yates had to cut the lifeline that sent the wounded Simpson into the void of a crevasse. What ensues is the most convincing case for the survival instinct of all living things. Regardless of his broken leg and seemingly insurmountable odds, Joe painfully descends to the base camp, ostensibly because he couldn't abide not moving. I find his instinct to survive is as strong as anyone else's.The brilliance of the film is to keep suspense although we know the outcome, `Citizen Kane' on a mountain. The cinematography, with swirling vistas both hypnotic and menacing, and the editing, from narrators to actors and back, create movement and danger when the former is almost impossible and the latter a given. Their using the `one push' climbing method (carrying entire gear rather than staching along the way) adds immensely to the do-or-die flavor. The only other similar film I can think of is `The Endurance,' a retelling of Sir Ernest Shackelton 's doomed expedition to Antarctica in 1914-1916. It used relatives and archival footage to create a totally believable documentation of the failure. Said Lafcadio Hearn, `You do not laugh when you look at the mountains . . ..' `Touching the Void' is satisfyingly serious stuff, ultimately harrowing because of the intense personal, private pain of the climbers.</fullReview>

Huge amounts of money and acting "talent" wasted on a totally unbelievable piece of schlock (carrying bottles of unstable nitroglycerin up K2 to blow open a crevasse!!) in the case of "Vertical Limit". A limited budget and unknown actors along with the actual principals in a harrowing tale of courage and stubborn perseverance in the case of "Touching the Void." For the scenery alone, "Touching the Void" is worth the price of seeing it on a big screen, but the story will really have you unable to look away. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

I also love the moment where he lies against the rock and looks up at the stars wheeling in their course above and he thinks that he has been in that place for an eternity.I could go on ... if you haven't seen it, do.

		<shortDescription>A deft documentary that marries an incongruous tale to its fact in a remarkably shot surrealism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see this film as a story about mountaineering, about the moral problem of utilitarianism, about either the non-existence or, in fact, the existence of God... My impression was, and is, that it is a culturally sympathetic account of the isolated nature of the (now) 21st century human, Godless and self-aware/absorbed. The story is riveting, not least because the film is made in such a way as to render it so, but is less important than the metaphor it represents.I'd also recommend this film to anyone with an interest in trying to get to get to the bottom of what it is to be English. Hawking and the ever-spooked Yates are representative in their cheerful but never flippant memory of the event. Simpson's is a similar mien. However the almost incomprehensible, mystic heart of the tale is his and he tells it (no doubt for the nth time)... as if reading a shopping list. Memories of his emotions are reported in the same matter-of-fact stenographic as the name of ice formations at the foot of the mountain. All the emotion from this film is in the imagination of the viewer, which, ably manipulated by the films cunning construction cannot fail to be considerable, notwithstanding the anaemic recording of Alice Neary's cello-playing (I'm reliably informed that this was a production issue rather than that of the artist, so apologies to Alice for an earlier edition of this comment) 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its Not About the Mountain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film but the fact that it was about mountain climbing is irrelevant. The most interesting pieces were the decision by Simon to cut the rope on Joe and then the decision by Joe to climb down into the crevasse. Anyone who has been in a life and death situation with another person, where one can die and one can live, will immediately respond to Simon's dilemma. I say 'all hail' Joe for forgiving Simon and saying that he would have done the same thing. (In the absence of a prior understanding there's nary a human who wouldn't...but the movie was not a documentary so we really don't know what Simon's true situation was....was he too impatient ?(as the movie suggests)...did he really have no other alternatives? Only Simon knows...certainly not the critics who say the one should never cut the rope. Maybe if it's you wife or child you might say that but people who engage in such high risk behaviors had better be willing to suffer the consequences of their stupidity or bad luck and let their partners live.) As for Joe's 'descent' all I can say is bloody marvelous. Its a true illustration of Joe's own point that in a situation like that the most important thing is to "keep making decisions no matter what." It is also a great illustration of counter-intuitive thinking. Management gurus have been trying to teach that concept for decades...but it takes a real man to show them how its done. This film should be required viewing for University Ethics classes and management training. (Not to mention at Mountain climbing schools.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not something you do everyday, or possibly ever - thanks to filmmaker Kevin MacDonald, we get to be "Touching the Void"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's an audacious attempt making "Touching the Void." Based on Joe Simpson's book, the tenaciously daring documentary filmmaker, Kevin MacDonald (who gave us "One Day in September" 2000, about the 1972 Munich Olympics hostage crisis) has overcome the impossible odds and recreated what the perilous adventure was like for mountain climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, practically 18 years ago (June 1985), atop the 21,000 foot Siula Grande peak in the Peruvian Andes. No one has dared before and none ever since Joe and Simon did - until this recapturing of their fearless climb up to the top, and those grueling days thereafter of Joe having fallen into a glacial void with a painful broken leg, without water supply, and how miraculously he extricated himself back up to the glacial surface and crawling/rolling/stumbling back down to near base camp, where Simon thought he has lost Joe forever.Through faithful reenactment of the events by two mountaineering actors (Nicholas Aaron as Simon and Brendan Mackey as Joe), with stunning cinematography (by Mike Eley and Keith Partridge) and amazingly real sound effects (sound design led by Joakim Sundström and crew) - perhaps those sounds were truly real: snow scratching, ice dripping, ambient sound of the natural void, MacDonald and film crew re-captured on the spot during inclement wind, hail and snow along those treacherous mountain faces, inside the glacier and down the deep crevasses the chilling and suspenseful sequences. Certain aspects we probably can't truly feel: the real fear of impending danger at such heights/depth, and the very coldness of it all - from an account by director MacDonald himself, it seems like indescribably freezing to the nth degree. While there are other aspects that the mountaineers in such predicament are unable to appreciate while we viewing the film could relish (as Joe was a-lying, shivering and suffering): the absolute glistening beauty of those hanging stalactites inside the cavernous glacier, and the masterful silence of it all - alone and away from everyone else in the world - could have been such a peacefully in awe experience. So MacDonald did deliver to us. Aren't we fortunate! An effective in-between narrative with talking heads approach was used besides the visual re-telling of the events. We get to see the actual mountaineering buddies, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, also Richard Hawking (who helped them watch and wait at the base camp during those fateful days), and hear their re-accounts and personal comments. So many years after, the experiences were as fresh and emotional as ever. The music score is by Alex Heffes (which at times reminded me of the haunting tempo that Arvo Pärt gave Gus Van Sant's meditative film "Gerry") and the film editing by Justine Wright, both previously collaborated with director MacDonald on "One Day in September."This film reminds me of the suspenseful patience-trying yet life-affirming documentary by filmmaker George Butler, "The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition" 2000. Somehow both films have the theme of hope incarnate - never give up trying - hope is an ever present light a-glimmering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making the incredible come to life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even before I read Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, mountain climbing was very high on my things-I-never-want-to-do-in-my-entire-life list. However, because of that book, I was certainly fascinated by the endeavor. Although the contemporary IMAX documentary Everest was fine, it didn't satisfy me. I wanted to confirm that the images Krakauer conjured in my mind were correct.That is cured by this excellent film. The other comments here do a swell job of encapsulating the story. I think the director here found the best way to tell this story. I think what really makes this work is that it takes you right to the mountain. Yes, the decision to 'recreate' may not please everyone. But you need to see the steep drops, the seemingly bottomless crevasses, and the picks and boots attempting to gain hold on the icy surfaces to fully appreciate the magnitude of what happened. The contrast of the visceral thrill packed recreations and the measured matter-of-fact stories of Joe and Simon provides balance and manages to heighten the drama without becoming histrionic.A frightfully great movie. Literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacky from Washington clearly knows nothing about climbing nor the amazing story of survival told by Joe Simpson. As an avid enthusiast about the book but a prior sceptic about the film I can confirm that the film is just amazing. It adds a totally new dimension to the incredible story for which the director should be commended. See it / buy it - don't be influenced by the ignorant rambings of the uninitiated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely incredible...beautiful - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh. My. God. This film is breathtaking. The documentary format didn't appeal to me at first, but after my parents raved about it I decided to give it a go. It was screened in a ridiculously tiny cinema (about four rows of seats, reflecting it's limited appeal) which I left absolutely stunned. Every person in that infinitesimal cinema was riveted, completely riveted by Joe Simpson's tale, told in the most straightforward, honest, beautiful way I've ever seen a story told. The fact that you know the ending is immaterial - it's the whys and wherefores that keep you hooked, wondering how the hell this bloodyminded maniac is going to get out of this particular dilemma, and the next, and the next. The actions and reactions of Joe and his colleagues are so inherently human that every five minutes I felt the urge to nod with recognition - they admit to what others would be ashamed to - Simon's admission that he kept trying to think of a cover story to make him "look better" after cutting the rope on Joe is a perfect example, as is Joe's disclosure that at the point of death he had Boney M's ridiculously cheesy Brown Girl In The Ring playing endlessly in his head. Some moments are amazingly poignant - Joe lying on his back watching the stars and feeling that he had been lying there for centuries - his description of the realisation that his friends had gone. But I'll say no more. Just please, please go and see this film. The problem with it is that it doesn't sound appealing to a mainstream audience - however, if bums can be gotten on seats I truly believe that word of mouth should give this stunning film the status it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would not consider myself a climber but I have climbed mountains before. To anyone familiar with that feeling of trying to reach a peak that continues to seem further away this film really hits home. For those who haven't climbed, this would have to be the best way to experience the intensity and decision making that goes into a perilous adventure far from the safety and ease of modern life.The depth of detail that is offered in the story is riveting and it is what makes the difference. If they had just glossed over the events and didn't delve into the painful decision making that took place, the viewer may have experienced an average film, But that wasn't the case.Careful attention was paid to recreating the scenes and often captured the breathtaking beauty of the Peruvian Andes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Touching the Void" is the recreation film based on the book about a mountain climbing expedition by two men (who were involved in the making of this film, and agree it was as accurate as something like this could be). It is AMAZING. It is amazing not only for the photography, recreations, and acting ? that's minor compared to the REALITY of what these men went through trying to go up and come down a very foreboding mountain in Peru. I was left gasping, shaking my head, and feeling SO sheltered as I watched this. It is an emotionally complex story, which will leave you drained. Almost empty. It takes so deep into the emotional side of survival, you're not sure what to "do" about it. I suggest also watching the extras "What Happened Next", followed by "Return to Siula Grande". It is no less fascinating ? because you continue to delve into the physical, emotional, and psychic scars of these men 17 years after the events that seem to have changed their lives. Or did they? Just who ARE these guys? See this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most fascinating thing about 'Touching The Void' is how much suspense the film creates. We already know that the two climbers survive their harrowing ordeal ? from the beginning, we see their older selves seated against a plain, studio background narrating the story ? and yet, as each event unfolds, we find ourselves transfixed to the screen, simply unable to tear our eyes away. For this tale, the tantalising question is not "do they survive?" but "how did they survive?!"In 1985, two British mountaineers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, attempted to be the first to journey up the west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. As they departed, Richard Hawking, a traveller they'd met recently, offered to remain at the base camp and await their return. The journey up the west face is frighteningly perilous, but Simpson and Yates emerge unscathed, eventually reaching the summit without any major troubles. But most disastrous accidents, they recall, occur on the descent.From the beginning of the climb down, the trouble begins. Stranded in a white-out, the two climbers unwittingly wander along a perilously narrow ridge, before one of them plummets through an unstable overhang of snow. Fortunately, he is saved from certain death by the finger-thickness rope that connects the two climbers. What Simpson and Yates could never have anticipated is that their troubles had only just started. Whilst trying to descend a vertical cliff face, Simpson's ice axe jerks loose, and he breaks his leg upon impact with the solid ice below, his tibia violently (and very painfully) thrust through his kneecap. Experienced mountaineers, the two men immediately realise that such an injury is basically a death sentence, and Simpson later remarks that he almost expected his partner to abandon him. But Yates, never with any other alternative in his mind, attaches a 300-foot rope to Simpson, and gradually lowers his down the precipitous mountain face.At this point in the film, we are already expecting this to be the worst of their troubles, but worse it gets. Much worse. Blinded and deafened by a violent snowstorm, Yates unknowingly lowers Simpson over a cliff edge, where he dangles in mid-air, a solid 60-feet above the ground, and perched directly over a gaping, seemingly-bottomless crevasse. The length of rope runs out, and Simpson is simply unable to remove his weight from the line. After 90 minutes of arduous struggle, Yates, oblivious of his partner's deadly predicament and beginning to lose his hold on the mountainside, makes the most difficult decision imaginable ? he cuts his partner's rope.To reveal any more plot details would be doing this film a disservice, since the scenes that follow are some of the most gripping I've ever witnessed, especially when you are fully aware that it is based on one hell of a true story. Whilst the three men involved in the operation (Simpson, Yates and Hawking) narrate the story, we watch most of their riveting tale unfold through stunningly enacted re-creations. Brendan Mackey (playing Simpson) and Nicholas Aaron (playing Yates) spend most of the film with their faces obscured by climbing masks and an icy crust of snow, but they are strikingly believable. We can only watch in awe as a battered Simpson lies defeated on the ledge of a cavernous crevasse, and helplessly curses his own stupidity and carelessness, screaming obscenities that echo off the frozen walls. The film also wonderfully captures Simpson's steady (but quite understandable) descent into madness, when his only motivation for survival is his fear of dying with the tune of the Boney M song, 'Brown Girl in the Ring,' running through his head.'Touching The Void' is a stunning documentary, and an awe-inspiring testament to the human will to survive. This is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man vs. nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally, I find the idea of climbing a mountain about as appealing as repeatedly watching The Sound of Music for seven days. Both would leave me cold, dizzy and rather nauseous. But although I'm a lazy city-dweller that hates heights and who is far from physically robust, I can kind of understand the appeal. To be able to scale such heights must fill an individual with a certain amount of pride, a pride that can't be obtained by kissing your boss's arse and by completing a crossword in a newspaper. And like the climbers in the film say, in a world that is getting increasingly safe and coddled, scaling a mountain makes them feel alive; they like the risk. It really is man versus nature.The opening parts of Touching the Void show the fun of climbing. They show the excitement of getting to the top and of conquering the elements. But the film really kicks in when nature rains on the parade, when it shows that survival is really the only positive outcome that can come from such a challenge.The moment when Joe, one of the two mountaineers who climbed the Andean mountain Siula Grande, breaks his leg shows how vulnerable we are no matter how well equipped we might be or how much experience we might have. We can be snapped at any moment. But Joe's battle to survive the mountain also shows how strong we can be, how through determination and will we can sometimes get through the toughest situations.But the film's also a testament to Joe's climbing partner, Simon Yates. It really is quite heroic how he almost manages to complete a single-handed rescue. I mean, he's on a mountain with a man who has a broken leg, but instead of leaving him to die, he risks his life to get his partner to the safety of camp. His effort is remarkable. And the only reason his rescue 'fails' (it can't be deemed a complete failure because without Simon's efforts Joe wouldn't have survived) is because the two are cursed with bad luck (although Joe does have some good luck in not dying after he falls into the crevasse?if surviving a fall in a crevasse can actually be deemed as good luck when you don't know if you're going to get out).However, before the fall, there's the rope. Now the cutting of the rope was the film's main selling point. Was it wrong or was it right? Well, I don't think it should even be debated. Cutting the rope saved the lives of two people. And it's not like Simon didn't try. He held on to the rope for a long time, not knowing that his partner was hanging off the side of an ice cliff. But all the time Simon was being dragged off the mountain. To hang on would have killed two people. So while the cutting of the rope was an act to save one (which itself would have been a better result than two deaths), it ended up saving the pair of them.The real horrifying part of the film occurs after this moment, the part when Joe is stuck in the crevasse. Reading about such a predicament is one thing, but seeing it is another thing altogether (the film is superb in the way that it dramatises the events and lets the characters speak for themselves). The crevasse looks like a tomb. It looks like a place where no life can exist. And the moment when Joe screams and swears, and the bit when the real Joe says that he just cried and cried, hit point home. This is a place you're not supposed to get out of. Therefore it's inspiring that Joe finds the strength to escape. And it's doubly inspiring when Joe says that he doesn't believe in god and that at no time did he pray or give the almighty any thought. Perhaps the believer has the comforting daydreams of heaven and a life after death, but the atheist realises that we only get one shot at life and that we only have ourselves to rely on if we want to survive. Maybe that gives the atheist an added kick to not sit down and die.However, there are moments in the film when Joe says that he contemplated doing exactly that. And it's quite moving the candour in which Joe speaks. But for some reason he keeps going.A sequence that made me squirm was the one when Joe has to hop over the rocks. He keeps falling over and damaging his broken leg. I can't begin to imagine the pain. But the most powerful sequence is when Joe starts losing his mind. He even begins to think that Simon and Richard (their non-climbing companion) are following him as he crawls across the rocks, but he thinks they aren't helping him because they know that he'd be embarrassed about crying and wetting himself. Then he realises that they aren't there and that he's alone. It would take a man with a heart of stone not to be affected by that, and deep down I'm a complete softie.But there is a moment of humour in the final moments. Joe gets a Boney M song stuck in his head, leading to the immortal quote: "Bloody hell, I'm going to die to Boney M." A truly miserable end for anyone.The ending, though, while lacking in tension (because you know they survived), does come as an immense relief, especially as Joe thought he'd crawled all that way for nothing (the others might have left camp). So the final moments have an emotional wallop (although I felt like shouting at Richard: "I was holding back because I didn't really feel it was a human being out there." Just help the poor bloke!). But, idiot aside, it's a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rather unique documentary, the film is a prime example of blur between fiction and documentary that is starting to come about these days. The film is done as a series of interviewers with the climbers, however the interviews are woven in with re-enactment footage of their experience. This gives an intense and very involving quality to the production, because one is able to visualise just what exactly they are talking about. The cinematography of the re-enactment is superb, gritting at times, and other times picturesque, showing the vast size as well as the isolation from life of the mountain. All-round it is a fine film technically though, with some rather good sound mixing and editing too. The music for the film is effectively chosen, and it is only a few minor things that prevent the film from being a masterpiece. Firstly, the actors in the re-enactment look nothing like the real people, which makes it quite confusing at times. Secondly, the reasons for wanting to climb are never presented in full, which makes it feel at times that the whole thing was the fault of their own silliness. Thirdly, the past and present relationships of the characters are never looked into, and this would have made it a tad more interesting. Still, it manages to cover a lot of ground as it is, and it is a sensational experience like hardly any documentary that I've seen. Certainly, it is at least one of the best films of 2003. On a point of interest, it made the Academy short-list for Best Documentary Feature, but lost out on a nomination due to the controversy over just how much of it was really a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful emotional drama at its finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Note: Because of the film's nature, I don't think I reveal anything you won't know is coming while watching, but I do tell you a number of major plot points, so be forewarned.**About a decade ago, the best-seller "Touching the Void" tore through the climbing community, and also garnered significant mainstream attention, because of a controversial decision made by one climber when stuck in a highly perilous situation. The short version is that while climbing Siula Grande, an icy 21,000-foot peak in the Peruvian Andes, a man cut the rope connecting himself and his climbing partner, which left both of them damaged, one physically and one emotionally. Based on that 1988 non-fiction book, the film "Touching the Void" tells the story of those two climbers, Joe Simpson (who wrote the book) and Simon Yates, in a unique manner more often seen in retrospectives on The History Channel. Call it a docu-drama, as the movie blends recent interviews with an excellent reenactment of the nearly 20-year old event. In one sense, this method somewhat deprives the story of its dramatic effect, because you know that the two narrators obviously survive whatever disasters may befall them. But the story is not about if, but rather about how and why. As you gain a new respect for climbing, you will ask yourself what you would do in a similar situation, and that circumstance-less mental agony will be torturous enough. Because you know the ultimate outcome, the power of the tale is all the more amazing. Although the crucial decision is often the focus of the story, the reactions to the circumstances are the high point of the movie. Better than most any film, "Touching the Void" bares the souls of the key characters. At the top of a mountain, things are pretty simple: life and death. With decision stripped down to such a minimum, those choices are magnified to an almost painful extreme, taking viewers to places and extremes they will never experience. This mental transportation is where "Touching the Void" excels most. In exploring the powerful pain, both physical and emotional, of Simpson and Yates, "Touching the Void" could easily have lapsed into melodrama, but thanks in part to minimal music and an understated narrative, the film accurately explores raw human emotion at its strongest. In the process, the film may have produced the movie moment of the year: a reunion scene that, like the rest of the movie, is as wrought with pure emotion as any in recent memory. Bottom Line: Surprisingly, one of the better films of the year. 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling, emotionally tight, and dare I say an exciting film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard much of this documentary when it came out and even remember the talk of the actual events when the climbers returned to civilization. The "split in the mountaineering community" was actually something I remember, so a lot more than just talk for good sales on a documentary.The movie mixes traditional face on interviews of the three people involved in the story with beautifully filmed recreations of events. The result is a compelling, emotionally tight, and dare I say exciting film. At one point there is even some tragic comedy moments, although these are peppered lightly and the focus of the film is on the disastrous events and the choices the climbers made.I haven't been so moved or on edge from a movie in a long time, much less from a documentary, and it goes to show how well edited and directed this has been.However, one thing that did bother me is that the climbers faced huge criticism when they returned, and this was around the pivotal event shown in the documentary. The defence of this choice is that both climbers say it was the right thing to do, and each said this was the only thing to do.Yet the film doesn't bring any humanity to this showing the climbers talking individually to the camera with little to no emotion and the briefest of re-enactments showing a few words of swearing and a rub of an eye when the overwhelming emotion and relief should be coming. I could not help but think this left the climbers looking cold and, to a degree, inhuman.If only the documentary had pulled back from the factual portrayal and shown a bit of the human emotion at the end then I think the climber's case would have been better shown. This wouldn't have affected the bias of the movie, and might even have balanced it out a bit more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a documentary - great. As a movie - so so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is it? Is this film meant to be a film, a piece of art which tells a true story of determination? Or is this a documentary. A "visual and audio" companion to the best-selling book of the same name?As a film, it is not as good as it could be. It undercuts most of the drama thanks to the people themselves appearing on camera (and in good health) narrating the story. Also, the narration tells a great deal while showing us visuals which support the narration. As a documentary (which it seems to be), its very compelling and engagingly told. Still, since clearly the two climbers made it back alive, the story lacks a real sense of triumph or catharsis.I must say, I don't see why the two men at the base camp didn't head back up to the foot of the mountain to see what they could find. If they had done even a small amount of hiking back towards the mountain they almost certainly would have found the injured man. The other climber didn't know his partner was dead. All he knew was that he had fallen when the rope was cut. Why didn't he go back and check once he had recovered at base camp? Cutting the rope seems to be me the right decision, not going back to check for a body or something, seems wrong.</fullReview>

They make it to the top but on the way down, Simon is faced with a harrowing decision.This has a compelling real story. The injection of the real people in a movie of reenactment adds a certain realism. The only minor problem is that the real people proves that they survived the incident. However, it doesn't really get into my mind because the story is so engrossing. The climbing footage is great. Director Kevin Macdonald is a skilled documentarian. I don't really recognize the actors but they don't need expert acting skills. This is a harrowing thriller and a compelling documentary.</fullReview>

After watching it recently, it had a profound impact, being scary, daunting and beyond horrifying. The one thing I really love about this film is how more then one side of the story is told. It doesn't feel bias, and it doesn't feel cheesy and clichéd like more modern documentaries. Touching The Void is probably the best and most effective documentary ever made. Not only are the events recreated, the pacing is perfect; many documentaries fail at creating an evenly paced film without giving you too much too soon.

		<fullReview>This was excellent. I had read the book several years ago and honestly didn't have high hopes for this as a docudrama (expecting it to be cheaply done with cheesy re-enactments) but that couldn't be farther from the truth. I was on the edge of my seat throughout and left exhausted and kinda traumatized by the end. The climbing scenes are incredibly well done, with excellent action scenes, the shots of the snow, the crevices, the vertical-idity. The mix of them telling the events interview style and the impressive reenacted scenes also works well here.The story is excruciatingly tense throughout even though you know the outcome as both Simon Yates and Joe Simpson are telling the story. Yes you know they make it off the mountain, but wow. The journey. Just incredible.Joe Simpson and Simon Yates tell their story interview style with the movie flicking back and forth between them describing events and how they felt and a really well done recreation with actors. It traces their 1985 Andes expedition and the perilous journey they made up the west face of Siula Grande. Having successfully reached the summit, tragedy struck on their descent when Simpson fell and broke his leg.Yates attempts to lower his friend down the mountain, but bad weather and increasingly desperate circumstances eventually lead him to cut the rope holding his friend. After surviving a fall into a deep crevasse, Simpson was able to climb and crawl his way down to the base camp despite having a badly broken leg and not eating for several days.My fear of heights kicked in immediately here, the climbing scenes are super well done -these guys are crazy. My claustrophobia also kicked in during the crevice incident where this truly became a horror movie Yes this movie left me traumatized and emotionally exhausted. 7/7/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST docudrama about survival!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen quite a lot of films and generally like all genre. So I don't mind watching a documentary every now and then. And I never review any title before as most of the time, most existing reviews are more or less conforms to what I think of about a particular film. But after watching Touching the Void, I feel really compelled to say a word or two. It is by far the best docudrama I've ever seen.As a film, it is near-perfect. The way they shoot some scenes was very effective especially during the climbing and their descent before the broken leg tragedy. At times, I kind of forget that it was all re-enactment of the events narrated by the legendary mountaineers.Despite knowing that both of them survived at the end, some scenes were really heartbreaking. The film effectively shows the state of utter hopelessness in Joe's struggle for survival. One can only imagine what he'd been through after falling down into an ice crevice, with a broken leg, extremely dehydrated while already exhausted both physically and mentally - basically lost in a middle of nowhere with very low chance of survival. And as someone who has been through some kind of utter hopelessness situation myself, at least mentally, I can totally relate on a certain level.And despite the overwhelming odds, he never stopped struggling and kept going and hoping, knowing full well that he and only he himself will be able to get him out of there. And as the story goes on, you can't help but be dragged along through his painful struggle from the way he climbed out of the crevice, dragging himself slowly off the huge icy area and to the excruciatingly painful scenes of repeated falling downs in the rocky area.And finally to his rather humorous and yet quite creepy and sad state of mental breakdown with the Boney M song after yet again faced with hopeless situation that will be the end of him, so it seems. And it was expected of someone who has gone through such perilous ordeal. For me, he really did, in a sense, touched the void.And in the end, you can't help but cheer and be happy for him and at the same time relieved as he did finally found by his friends, and survived to tell this heroic survival story.This film is one of the very few out there that truly shows the amazing capability of human body and mind for survival. For many, it seems almost superhuman and considered impossible given the odds and circumstances.And I don't know how they do the effects, if any, but the state of the actors after been through such ordeal was very real, from the extremely dehydrated facial skins, their expressions and the blacked fingers due to frostbites.Overall, this docudrama is near-perfect in my opinion. In term of film that portrays the human struggle to survive, it is the BEST I've ever seen. I'm so glad to finally seen it after been able to get my hands on it very recently. Rated 9/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect narration of human strength</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who is into high altitude hiking i can definitely relate to the dangers and loneliness of the mountains.Stories like this prove once again that real life is the greatest drama. This is exactly why movies do not always need to be entirely scripted for it to have an interesting story.This movie is not just about mountaineering, it gives us a better look at the human mind. Most of us have been there, a crossroad where we must decide to either keep going forward, or wait it out until everything goes completely dark.This is not just about climbing mountains, it is about life and the importance of going forward, however dire the situation becomes.In a way, climbing is the struggle of life. For me, that is why i enjoy the mountains. It makes me understand life better. I highly recommend this movie, even if you just want to see human drama. One of the best i have seen so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could you do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In watching this amazing film with an increasingly unhinged jaw, I was pressed to wonder whether I could have done what Joe Simpson did. I wondered whether I would have the will to live, the determination, the sheer bloody-mindedness to do what he did. It's unfathomable how he descended the mountain on a broken leg. As to the appropriateness of his partner's decision to cut the rope, I think clearly Joe was going to drag him down the mountain. He was being dragged down the mountain, it had been a long time. The survivors and the man they had met who watched their camp tell an astonishing story. The story really must be heard to be believed. The director, Kevin MacDonald doesn't get in the way of the story and his use of music and re- creations only enhance the story. You don't have to be a fan of climbing to like it. The strength of the human spirit will astonish you in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most amazing stories you will ever watch. I can watch this movie 3 times in one day and still not get bored. Amazing story of survival. The extras on the DVD are also seriously worth taking the time to invest in - interesting to see Simon's reaction to everything that happened. I personally really identify with him but I can see that some people would find his reaction quite cold/callous. I cannot even begin to imagine how Joe felt when he realised he was stranded inside the crevasse and Simon had cut the rope. Only thing in this movie that bothers me is the Boney M song - quite disturbing at the point at which it is played! 100% must view movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This highly-praised documentary from Scottish director Kevin Macdonald (THE LAST KING OF Scotland 2006, 8/10, STATE OF PLAY 2009, 6/10), spunkily tackles the most inconceivable survival story in the mountaineering history, narrated by Joe Simpson and Simon Yates in propria persona of their perilous conquest to the west face of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes in 1985, while faithfully re-enacts what had happened during the lengthy 168 hours. It is such an incredible and telling story which could eclipses Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS (2010, 8/10), Joe's destiny is as much indebted to his heaven-sent luck as his professional surviving skills and the tenacious willpower of staying alive. The talking-ahead forthrightness from Joe and Simon delineates their adventure in detailed nuance, carefully selected words without any bells and whistles, instantly brings audiences to the locale, we are fairly certain it is a mission impossible to do the copy-cat climbing and abseiling since it is unimaginable to transport a team of crew to accomplish such a chimera, still team Macdonald exerts formidable effort to show us what kind of beast Siula Grande is, a reverential task has been adroitly done and salute to the cameramen, two actors (Mackey and Aaron) and stunts. The natural immenseness, the icy whiteness and the fearsome precipices are soul-engulfing, and the forlornness is overpowering even we all know they all outlive the unthinkable misadventure (I keep imagining in the end of the film, Macdonald would show us a frontal shot of Joe with one leg only or a prosthetic leg). Myself is never an extreme-sports advocate, putting one's own life in jeopardy to pursue some kind of spiritual catharsis or mental orgasm (maybe physically as well) has never been on my agenda, notwithstanding which, the film fortuitously excels its reassuring ode of human strength and reaches a soul-searching incisiveness for every viewer to reflect on our regards of nature and life. When curiosity being satisfied, the film still imprints its indelible mark on the ectoplasm level, great work indeed! The film's 106 minutes running time seems rather short to me, when Joe finally reunites with Simon, the film also soon ends with succinct captions indicating their later life, which inevitably makes me wonder what is their rumination of that accident after the heaven-or-hell experience, I wish the film would be a bit longer to tap into that aspect, it would render us some revelation on a more humanized surface, then it would be an impeccable documentary feature for me. But anyway the film is the new entry of my top 10 BEST PICTURE in 2003, bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally wrote this review in Swedish so I hope the translation holds out.Yesterday I saw one of the most amazing documentaries I have ever seen about two mountaineers who defeats a summit in the Andie's in the mid-80's which still stands undefeated by anyone else. And they almost die trying. Even if you are not as fascinated by mountaineering as I am the film still tells one of the most incredible survival scenarios I have heard of in my life. At the same time during the horror of immediate death some of the most amazing thoughts on all kinds of life questions are running through the climbers mind. Especially fascinating is Joe's take on religion while about to perish in of the most hellish situations I can think of.I strongly recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a cliffhanger Stallone!The movie opens slowly, and wisely builds the tension and explain the background for the uninitiated. The rope, the bond, the trust...etc. And as the story moves along you are not sure what exciting/horrify things will happen (unless you read previews - and thus the tragedy of review : it tells you too much but needs to hold your attention) but you do get an uneasy feeling. Then wam/bam, the decisive critical moment jumps on your just like a hurt animal. And it gets worse. That is a great thing about this kind of recollecting documentary, with particularly(A MUST) the first person's perspective. There is so much detail and emotions. And it helps with the 3rd guy breaking up the tension. The only bit that was a bit weird for me is the repeating music in the head near the end. Spoilers** Not sure if this was intentional, but I particularly like the way it started with closeups on Joe's face up until the decision making point - and the explain the broken leg. So I wasn't sure whether the injury was much more serious (i.e. removed or spinal..etc).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The simplest of words can sometimes convey far more than the most elaborate action scenes. This runs counter to the whole 'a picture is worth a thousand words', yet is nonetheless true.This film is a docudrama about two young British mountaineers, Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, who in 1985 decided to become the first men to ever scale a treacherous Andean peak in Peru called Siula Grande. They left for their task with a third climber who was to wait at their base camp- Richard Hawking.The film documents the weeklong adventure Joe and Simon had. The first three days were rather uneventful, and the duo reached the summit. It was on the way down that trouble hit. Freak storms were the first augur of bad things to come. Then Joe broke his leg and Simon was left to innovate a technique to lower his partner down the mountainside in 150 foot increments. Then, a second accident befell the duo. In a blizzard, Simon lowered Joe over an overhang that hung over a massive crevasse. When Joe could not signal what had occurred Simon was left in the precarious position of being unable to lift his partner back, and slowly being dragged down the face himself. After a few hours with no signal from Joe Simon made a fateful decision to cut the rope to Joe, assuming he had died and was a dead weight, lest he face sure death as well.Joe fell into the crevasse, where he dangled for hours. The next morning, a shaken Simon looked in vain, and assumed his partner had died. Simon made it back to the base camp, nearly dead from frostbite, and needed a few days to recover physically and emotionally with Richard. Joe, meanwhile, after much frustration, lowered himself into the crevasse and made his way out, then spent several days painfully eking his way down the mountain with an improvised splint, over glaciers and rock fields. The last night that Simon and Richard were at camp they heard Joe's cries and were shocked that he survived?. this is a terrific film as documentary and adventure. A viewer can understand why these adventurers do what they do, as well as recoil from it. Watching Joe Simpson narrate his tale you can see him do both at once, sometimes. It's in those fleeting moments that the viewer gets why this film was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any Hollywood scriptwriter who'd approached any producer with this story would have been laughed off the lot: it is just too unbelievable, and yet it did happen.Oh, there have been quite few mountain movies that have thrilled, of course, but nothing as gut-wrenching as this true story of a guy who was so bloody-minded about wanting his own way all the time ? his words, not mine ? that he just wouldn't give up.Of such stuff are heroes made...If you have read other reviews here, you probably know the story ? or maybe you knew it anyway. If you don't know the story, then I won't spoil it for you by discussing the fateful decision that Simon must make, except to say I would have done the same. Just see this movie and make up your own mind about what you would have done, if you'd been in the same situation.As a docudrama, it is riveting, amazing, mesmerizing, unforgettable, astonishing, horrific, and uplifting. When it finishes, you wonder to yourself: am I as bloody-minded as Joe, to push myself to the point of dying and still go on? I don't know, and I'm not sure I want to know...Great music, great photography, great story. See it before you die. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't be bothered to find a summary title. The film is pretty good though.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have an awfully peculiar habit when it comes to selecting films. I see a DVD enthusiastically sitting up in the video shop display hoping for an erring punter to pick it up, and I also see, printed on its cover, enthusing quotes by some impossibly obscure, and equally unimaginative critic, and I know, having previously read a bunch of reviews, that the film in question is, indeed and by all accounts, a modern masterpiece, a wondrous cinematic effort of which the Lumi?res brothers would be so exceptionally proud that they are still singing a cappella in their graves.After this plethora of positive hints that would induce any borderline rational halfwit to rent the film, what do I do? I solemnly approach the counter with either some awful monstrosity of the likes of The Stepford Wives, which my girlfriend, in a rather dictatorial manner, forces me to watch or, with a Memento or Fight Club or Requiem for a Dream that I have already seen a quadrizillion times but still prefer to a new film that might turn out to be an excruciating disappointment.As the wily foxes amongst you might have guessed, this was the case with Touching the Void. I "almost rented" it innumerable times, until I finally worked up the courage to remove the almost from the metaphorical sentence and actually did rent it ? to the applause of the audience in the store. And, well, the unimaginative critic was unoriginally spot on. The film does deserve two-thumbs up, mostly because it manages to render potentially lacklustre material - with a degree of grip and excitement worthy of a Discovery Channel documentary ? very gripping and, er, exciting indeed. To be frank, I'm not too sure how this astonishing feat was accomplished. In fact, the hybrid technique of fusing re-enactments with interviews is very common amongst those thriller-ride cable documentaries. Yet, the result in Touching the Void is infinitely more riveting and cinematic. This success should be partly attributed, and I may appear somewhat cuckoo here, to Simpson's voice. I genuinely believe that the tone of his voice manages to suit the mood of the story, and thus the film, like a tailor-made, er, suit. It goes without saying (or does it?) that credit is to be attributed to MacDonald for blending narration and re-enactments with such formidable dexterity so as to render a repetition of virtually identical shots infinitely more interesting than what it actually is: a repetition of virtually identical shots.There are two other things I would like to ramble on about. One contributes to the technical value of the film and, in all probability, constitutes yet another sign of my mental infirmity: the sound of the snow. Well, to be somewhat more precise (and hopefully appear less insane) the sound that boots make as they plunge into snow or, the thud of the pickaxe being hammered into the ice walls. They all seemed to reinforce my enjoyment of the film. The other, and final object of my blathering has, praise the Lord, nothing to do with such inane and nonsensical matters and, surprisingly enough, does have timidly more profound connotations. How, I wonder, does someone find the will to keep ploughing on the way that Simpson chap did? If it were me ? though it could never possibly be me since I can barely cough up the courage to take the car and go to the country for a pleasant rural stroll ? I would have stared down the crevice, cried for about 25 days and picked my frosty nose for another 25, until I would have ultimately come to the conclusion that repeatedly banging my head against the ice wall would be, by far, the most convenient solution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a remarkable story, that should serve as an inspiration to all. Never give up. Never do nothing. Never wait for the rescue. Unfortunately, this message will reach fewer people than it could have because it was presented as semi-documentary, semi-entertainment.If it wasn't for the extraordinary efforts of Mr. Simpson, and his victory over dooming odds, it was terribly presented. The cutting back and forth to the real life characters was almost always sharp and unexpected, the 'voice over' the acted scenes muted the excitement and the filming itself looked amateurish.It's too bad that PBS didn't get a hold of this first, where it could have been presented more professionally, reached a bigger audience, with the right format and for a better purpose and best of all would have reached viewers time and time again, instead of being forgotten on video store shelves.Professional climbing has given audiences some of the most exciting adventures in history, like "Into Thin Air" and "K2". "Touching the Void" is another such story, but better if read than watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of it, all we know is that both these guys survived. This is totally amazing, but their voiceover and interjected on-camera narration gives us no insight or retrospective as to what it was that Joe Simpson thinks kept him going, other than curiosity as to whether he could just go on a little longer. This is a pity, because the film was made with a 17 year cushion of time that might actually have provided some perspective. Did I miss something?Oh, well. Outdoor enthusiasts and mountaineers are not required to have large amounts of personal insight and self-knowledge. All too cynically, I have come to believe that one of the best reasons for surviving anything, especially something as harrowing as this, is so that you can write a book / make a movie about the experience someday. We the audience can only hope that the author is able to deliver a personal story, along with the one that any human being might tell, assuming he survives. Mountaineers climb mountains. It's what they do. Some of them die, many of them survive various physical challenges. This one survived in the extreme. But we still have no idea what it was that really gave him the strength to do so.Yes, it is an amazing story about a human being with an urge to survive that exceeds that of almost all people. And the shots of the Andes are breathtakingly beautiful. But the story told is not as much a personal one as it is merely idiosyncratic, unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surely things could have turned out much better if both had taken a whistle ? Even a novice mountaineer knows that shouting in the mountains is usually ineffective and exhausting - the guy stranded at the end of the rope could have blown his whistle to let the other know he was still alive; moreover, he may have been heard from the crevace by his friend if he used a whistle. These climbers were irresponsible and paid the price - if they had any brains they would have taken sensible precautions - Is this a story about heroism or gross stupidity ? Nevertheless it was engrossing and totally believable. I have never seen a better mix of drama and documentary - fabulous locations and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now that I have seen "Touching The Void" I have a new perspective on my life-time goal of mountain climbing...hahaha...just kidding, but anyways this movie is definitely a thriller. I can't believe the physical and mental state these guys put themselves through. WHO DOES THAT? the fact that he was only a hair away from dieing is a pretty scary thing. I have a personal connection, but not a life or death thing like this was. one time I ran out of gas on 104 east, and it was like 10:30 at night, now me being 17, I am not legally supposed to drive after nine, and my choices were to either get out of my car and walk to the nearest gas station and back, or to call my mom and have her meet me there....well after about an hour of contemplating, I decided to call my mom. she was mad but happy at the same time for the decision I had made.It was winter and I would've had to walk about 3 miles each way to the gas station, no fun!! This movie also connected to some other books we have read in class, such as: "A Lesson Before Dying," because in this book, the issue was teaching Jefferson to be a man before he died, and no one was going to give up until this was accomplished. In "Touching The Void" this guy fell through snow and was inside of the mountain with no way out, but he has his mind made up that he wasn't going to die that way and he got out. Then continued on with his journey alone, without his friend. He didn't give up and made it through. Like Grant in "A Lesson Before Dying", he did not give up until Jefferson knew that he was a man. (or at least they thought so.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TOUCHING THE VOID Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalThe true story of British mountain climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates, who in 1985 survived a catalog of disasters during their descent from Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes.Director Kevin Macdonald followed his acclaimed documentary feature "One Day in September" (1999) with this compelling docudrama, combining on-screen interviews with the film's major participants and vivid reconstructions of their dramatic ordeal. There's little or no back-story, and the 'characters' emerge solely from their experiences on the mountain, which they describe in graphic detail. After breaking his leg and being abandoned for dead by his friend, Simpson (played by Brendan Mackey in the reconstructions) endured a hellish journey back to base camp, suffering the worst effects of dehydration and exhaustion. And while his fate is obvious from the outset (he provides most of the film's running commentary), the narrative remains gripping throughout, as Simpson describes a series of potentially insurmountable obstacles which threatened to overwhelm him at every turn.Technically, the movie is a no-frills affair which recounts events without exaggeration or embellishment, and refuses to indulge an emotional or sentimental view of the material (Simpson comes across as an unlikeable character, stubborn to the point of arrogance, which may limit sympathy for his traumatic adventure, though it's these very qualities which kept him alive on Siula Grande against near-impossible odds). Non-climbers may wonder why Yates was subsequently criticized by the climbing community for abandoning his friend, even under extreme duress, but the movie asks profound questions of its audience: What would YOU have done in his place? Ultimately, TOUCHING THE VOID serves as a testament to human endurance, enacted against the backdrop of Nature's vast, godforsaken splendor. Try to see it in a theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shall We Climb?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touching the Void is a lot like Masayuki Suo's Shall We Dance. That's right, I said it.Where Shall We Dance is supposedly a romantic comedy about dancing, it proves itself to be a wonderful and layered comment on Japanese life (If you've been there - you get it) with obvious jabs at the office job and trappings of married life.Touching the Void equally on the surface, is a docu-drama about a mountain climbing disaster. Yeah, not really. Kevin McDonald's glacial disaster epic trumps Titanic and most BBC nature documentaries on what it means for a living thing to survive. It is expertly re-enacted and edited with excellent testimony from Joe Simpson, Simon Yates and Richard Hawking. This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Profound questions, metaphors and parallels from one's life flash by when viewing the gut wrenching choices each man in this story was forced to confront. For Simon, how does one cope with losing something you are attached to. How do you cut loose and move forward to survive? When do you pack up and move on?For Joe, when do you give up? How do you get up after a fall? What drives a living thing to survive at the most atomic level?Like life, the success of Touching the Void largely depends on how much you invest and bring to it. In the end, you really want to weep or cheer. Joe wins, but it feels as if we did too. I didn't need Celine Dion to tell me that - Bony M did just fine.</fullReview>

It's about Joe trying to get back to base camp after having a nasty fall resulting in a broken leg. He had to do this all on his own, seeing that his friends believed he was dead. The actors do such a incredible job, I thought all of this was really happening. The movie has a lot of suspense, which made me actually fear for Joe's life. It has a lot of great camera-work, especially when they show the exterior shoots of the mountains. There isn't really anything bad I can say about this movie.

The question looms for anybody working in the upper echelon of nonfiction filmmaking, where the Academy branch of documentarians are militating against any docus which include re-enactment, cinematic license, or crossover techniques- in other words, the new harvest of high-powered filmmaking styles that are now fifteen years old.If Touching The Void is not a documentary, it is most certainly the best kind of nonfiction filmmaking, and perhaps that is what we need to call the category henceforth. The vindication of Errol Morris at this year's Oscars, combined with the creative juggernaut of American Splendor, Michael Moore, and Touching The Void, gives me hope that the moribund genre of "Documentary" will soon be retired gracefully, in order to make way for muscular nonfiction filmmaking in pursuit of an audience -- and not a set of rules.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nail-biting thrill-ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're going to go mountain climbing, I would suggest you not watch this film first. This "documentary" from the award winning filmmaker of "One Day In September" reels you in and over the top of the mountain. This is what happens when it all goes wrong.Hiking up a steep rocky whitewash wall would definitely seem like an excellent adventure for some people. The fresh air, beautiful sights and serenity. However after this film, it might be awhile until I go hiking myself.The story of these two climbers is told refreshingly frank and in precise detail - so much you would think that it happened only yesterday for these two gentlemen. They narrate the story about 10 years after the incident, which I inferred from watching the film. They relate their story directly to the camera in what is a very candid and intimate interview. So much so that during their narration, you can sometimes catch that glint in their eye, the way the events flood back into their memory and how they contemplate their existence.As they narrate, the events of the story are unfolded to us via a re-enactment of the climb from the base-camp right until the final gripping moments. McDonald has directed the film surprisingly well for a documentary and captures that beauty, precariousness and fragility of the mountain well.During the film I experienced a range of emotions - those few moments early in the film was like the closest to heaven that one could reach. At times on their way back, it was like descending to hell.As a thriller it works superbly, just as well as any Hollywood story. The turns are unpredictable, sharp and painful. The question is how will they survive? The element of a true story further pushes the pressure onto the viewer.My gripes - and a few - is that of late, in an age of Michael Moore, many films are posing as documentaries. I don't question the climbers' truthfulness or integrity; however a documentary should present facts, arguments for discussion, and eye-opening truths about our world. This film exists very much in a closed space.Also I would have liked to hear more about the geography of the land which they were climbing on, or perhaps more evidence on how the glacier that they were walking posed considerable dangers to them. It was stated that no-one had climbed to the peak of the mountain on which they were hiking and I would have been interested to find out why. Otherwise an enjoyable and nail-biting thrill-ride that may be overdramatised but raw in it's storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great...it was a mix between a documentary and a film. It made that movie INTO THIN AIR look like an amature film. I was surprised how easy it was for these two hotshots to make it up the mountain. On the way back, they hit a storm and unbearable hurdles. I was shocked to see how bad Joe broke his leg! I would have cried also.There was mention of a Sasquatch in this particular region of Peru. I was surprised that Joe and Simon didn't see the Yetti while in that area. The Peruvian Yetti is supposed to live inside glacial crevassas.Anyway, see this movie if you want to be a ROCK CLIMBER or a MOUNTAINEER. It will change your MIND.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly made film of an astonishing story of survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Touching the Void' is the most extraordinary story of survival I have ever encountered. It is brought to life through the fantastically creative talents of the film maker and the honest, moving accounts of the protagonists.The story is so incredible that it is actually difficult to imagine how survival was possible - even though we are being told the story by those involved! The film is technically brilliant and does not succumb to overly dramatic devices - not least because it doesn't need them: if you are not absolutely transfixed by the simple facts then no amount of special effects and invasive music would move you.I thoroughly recommend this film / story as the very definition of determination in the face of impossible odds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching the Void is a really good documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this documentary, with recreations, of mountain climbers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates and their trials of their trek in Peru on Netflix Streaming on recommendation from one of my brothers-in-law who I watched with as well as my other one. Quite harrowing especially when Joe recounts his breaking one of his legs and his attempts to just keep going despite that. Meanwhile, Simon has his own crisis of faith along the way. That's all I'll mention except there were also some humorous moments like when Joe starts constantly thinking of a song, with the recording provided, by Boney M and he really hates them! So on that note, I really recommend Touching the Void.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pair of selfish narcissistic toffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a long drawn out boring documentary about 2 idiots. Its interesting if your a climber maybe.I'm sorry but these two idiots deserved everything. They asked for. I mean why would something not happen when you're climbing dangerous uncharted mountains. They were prepared to sacrifice their lives for stupid yuppie risks. They sound selfish and self absorbed and narcissistic spoilt rich brats.At the start one of the men says they didn't care about anyone or anything except there climbing. Have no sympathy for these 2 prats. Pair of selfish self absorbed toffs. Again IMDb high rating for terrible films shows peoples low level of intelligence and worship off narcissists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been a lot better by being shorter. Every aspect of the event was discussed / described in excruciating detail with narration by those involved. Typically that is a plus, except when the movie is almost two hours and you can describe what happens in a few sentences. I just got bored hearing about what everybody was thinking when little was happening. Maybe I've seen too many 'Discovery' and 'National Geographic' channel documentaries. They've got such story telling down to a captivating science whereas here it looks like an OK attempt.The DVD extras are interesting, but be forewarned: if you found the story inspiring, then the featurettes could cause a little letdown. There are some remarks that take away from the purity of the story. Nobody's perfect.If you saw and liked how the movie "World Trade Center" was presented, then you may really like this movie. If you've seen many survivalist documentaries, then this one may come across as slow and long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I approached "Touching the Void" with high expectations. I enjoyed the movie but had read and heard so much about it that I expected something a bit better. That said, it is very good and obviously quite realistic. It's a recreation with the occasional interviews.I'm not a very big fan of most documentaries in general so that probably explains why I found "Touching the Void" to be a bit dull in some areas.I enjoyed it but would not watch it again if it were to come on TV. I really don't think it's one of the best films of all time, nor worthy of its current 8.2/10 rating on IMDb, but that's just me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Documentary, but not really a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good documentary, with great views and reconstructions.The photography is very impressive, showing sights that I can only imagine... Most of us will never have the chance to see the views, thousands of feet above sea level. The film shows the beauty and complexity of mountains, and how life threatening they can be.To start with I was unsure whether Joe and Simon where actors or not in their interviews. I thought I would have enjoyed it more had the whole film been a reconstruction of what happened, perhaps that would have allowed for more drama....not knowing whether they survived or not. It was like watching a film that gives away it's own endingExcellent documentary, but could have been a better film I thought</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zero action and weird editing make this a difficult movie to sit through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read and loved the book. It is a gripping story of perseverance.I could not watch this whole movie. Seconds turn to minutes then before long a couple of hours are gone and you'll start thinking that you should have spent the time fixing the dishwasher or washing the dog. Each climbing scene takes a couple of minutes then it is off to another "personal account" interview with the actual people who the story is about. It switches back and forth very regularly and it eventually drove me crazy and I had to leave the room. My wife wouldn't let me fast forward through the boring parts. She liked the movie. I was hoping for some dancing girls or car chase scenes to liven things up.My score is raised a little more than the above description might lead you to think because the mountain scenes with the actors are filmed really well. I could easily imagine myself there with the climbers. It was very realistic. I guess it is hard to squeeze 15 minutes of content into a 2 hour movie so I shouldn't be so hard on them.If you know the story then the prolonged agony portrayed by the actors doesn't create any suspense like it might if you didn't know the outcome. The key word is "prolonged" which pretty much describes it.Read the book. Forget about the movie.Daddy Dave Fort Collins, CO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching the Void</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story, this incredible story of survival and friendship is a must see for documentary fans. Basically Joe Simpson, Simon Yates and Richard Hawking tell the story of their trip to the icy mountains of Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes in 1985. As they tell the story of struggle and drama, they have some lookalike actors showing us this story. Basically the key moment is where Joe cuts his hanging rope to save his own life, and his friend Simon thinks he's dead, and it was highly likely he was. But the truth, he was doing he could to survive, climb and crawl out and head for the camp where Simon and Richard were. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film. It was number 89 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was number 45 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 2 on The 50 Greatest Documentaries. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gives documentaries a bad name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, this is not a documentary in any meaningful sense. It is a film where the three principals on a mountain climbing expedition talk to the camera while actors portray what the principals claim happened. Aside from some scenery better captured on the Discovery Channel, this is a film without dramatic tension (everybody obviously survived or they wouldn't be talking to you) or any real insight into the experience of climbing. Abysmal camerawork in the "recreated" sections seems to be some mix of psychedlic l960's drive-in movies and outtakes from "21 Grams" (which is actually an excellent film). Frankly, the story is so unbelievable, that it seemed that the whole incident was phoney. After all, only three people know the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OR SISYPHUS REDUX?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a documentary, but a dramatic re-enactment, a staged pseudodocumentary, which should have been stated at the onset, because the film is otherwise quite misleading. To confuse matters worse, the two talking-heads who narrate the film, are not the actual mountaineers Joe Simpson and Simon Yates themselves, but actors, who are themselves replaced by doubles in the climbing scenes, some of which were filmed not in Peru, as originally done, but in the European Alps, all of which results in layer upon layer of misrepresentation which ultimately strips the film of verisimilitude and the impact of factual truth.Fact: Joe Simpson and Simon Yates climbed a 21,000-foot Peruvian Alp named Siula Grande in 3 days in 1985. They anticlimactically reach the top in the first 15 minutes of the film. The rest of the film concerns itself with an accident encountered on descent, as a result of which Mr. Simpson had to singly struggle for his life. That Mr Simpson is there to tell the tale make the results of that struggle a foregone conclusion and robs the movie of any dramatic suspense. Neither the writing nor the acting make up for this. The man is not deep. His brush with death does not yield much in the way of profound rumination on the meaning of life or the will to live. Mr Simpson is a simple man, too simple to sustain a film of this length.Neither is there much meat on the central moral dilemma of the film, a certain cutting of the rope. The Void, the almighty Abyss is barely glanced.It struck me, too, that the trek was poorly planned, mostly an amateur lark. Catastrophe, for example, could have simply been avoided had the two men carried some form of walkie-talkies. Neither did they seem to even bring enough cooking gas. It took a long time for Simpson to jettison the superfluous items in his backpack and take the most obvious simple precautionary measures for his injury. Myth of Sisyphus? Up the hill, down the hill. Two men, lots of talk, and ice, snow, and rocks, ice, snow, and rocks. Pretty barren.PS. If you're looking for a whopping good explorer's tale, by the way, I heartily recommend Joe Kane's book, "Running the Amazon," which is about an expedition which followed the Amazon River from its origins in the Peruvian Andes, through the jungles of Brazil, all the way to the ocean. Rife with cliff-hanging peril, interpersonal conflict, dramatic natural settings, and ethnic peoples, this book would have made ten times the movie of "Touching the Void."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not even a Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie during the Mar Del Plata's International Film Festival last March here in Argentina. This film was one of the selected movies for the Official Competition. The first thought that came to my mind after watching it was -"what the hell is doing a discovery-channel documentary type in the official competition of an International Film Festival?" I started feel boring after the first 20 minutes... The images never bring something new or relevant after the words of the characters telling us the story... I mean, it's like first we listen what happened and right after we watch it over and over again... I never feel moved by the story... there's no passion in the way that this characters tell us their adventure... I think that we should know more about the guy who stayed at the bottom of the mountain waiting for them... The director shows him a couple of times but it's not enough... mmm... what else? well I just didn't like it, and for me it looks more like a product made for the TV than a Movie that deserves a place in the Official Competition section of an "A class" Film Festival...Not recommendable...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is THE most overrated movie on IMDb.It should have been a one hour documentary.The first half was OK, mainly due to the scenery and the climbing scenes.However, the final half hour was one of the most tedious I've endured at the cinema and I whispered to my wife that I wished he would just die - she nodded enthusiastically.This may seem extreme, but the two climbers just weren't likable. They came over as totally selfish and I honestly believe their plight doesn't stand comparison with other similar tales - e.g. Shackleton. 2/10</fullReview>
