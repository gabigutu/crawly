		<fullReview>The Sandlot is one of the greatest kids movies ever. It is a refreshing break from the family movies of today that mostly concentrate on stories in that upperclass Reiner-esque suburbanite setting of husband and wife and two and a half obnoxious kids. Instead, The Sandlot falls into a line of memorable adventures like 'House Arrest' and 'The Wizard.'Flashback to the 1960s. Scotty Smalls, newcomer to the neighborhood, narrates (in a Wonder Years way) the hilarious adventure of how he got he and his baseball playing buddies into the biggest pickle ever. Smalls is the shy brainy kid who makes friends with a bunch of baseball fanatics. While learning the sport of baseball, he learns of an exaggerated legend of something called 'The Beast,' otherwise known as Old Mr. Myrtle's junkyard dog, which is chained up in the fence just behind the ballpark. The kids like to play baseball. And the Beast likes to eat them. Not to give too much away, but, "the pickle" that Scotty gets his friends into, involves a pretty valuable baseball, one slobbering beast, and kids who try to do anything they can to save their buddy from being grounded for an eternity. The mess they get into and the junk they try to get themselves out is simply hilarious. That, and the subplots of a clever move on a lifeguard and the determination to show up some very obnoxious rival baseball players.It's a funny, fantastic film that most kids will likely enjoy--the boys for baseball and the girls for those noteable teen stars like Mike Vitar, Tom Guiry, Chauncey Leopardi, and Will Horneff. It's loaded with laughs and good time adolescents, despite Tom Guiry hamming it up only slightly. Plus, it's got a good theme about friendship and drive and determination to do what you want to do. I highly recommend it, if for nothing else, then the part where Squints tells the story about the history of the beast.I can see from the message boards as well as other viewer's comments that it still has a rather memorable following, despite it's age. Definitely a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I didn't grow up in the time this film is set (I was born in 1978). But after seeing the film, I've got a pretty good idea of what it was like. My dad likes the film because of how much it reminds him of his own childhood. The story is simple: a new kid moves with his mother and step-father to a brand new neighborhood where he knows no one. So imagine his surprise when he winds up meeting a kid who invites him to play baseball with him and his best friends. Naturally, the other kids don't take to him too well: he's not very good at baseball, and he can't even throw right. But eventually, the kids grow to like him and teach him the ways of the game, and before long they're having a lot of fun during the summer. THE SANDLOT is a great kids film, very family-friendly, unlike the majority of so-called "family" films that are made nowadays. Sure, there's a scene where the kids are throwing up on a carnival ride thanks to some chewing tobacco, but the scene is done more for laughs than as a gross-out. (You can imagine that the scene would be done the opposite way if the film was made more recently). The characters and the young kids playing them are all appealing, and it's nice to see Denis Leary playing a kind sensitive role instead of the over-the-top characters he's used to playing. He's very good, even though the part's not a big one. The few scenes between him and star Tom Guiry are very nice. THE SANDLOT is a very good film. Kids will like the humor, and adults will remember how fun it was to be a kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main character's name was not Steve... if you have seen this movie more than once, or for more than 30 minutes, you'd realize the protagonist's name was Scotty Smalls. This movie is indeed a classic, a timeless piece accessible by all. If you love or have ever had a deep passion for baseball, this movie will move you like no other film has ever moved you before. I like to have a few too many beers and watch it through myself... the ending scene where the narrator (Scotty Smalls) tells the stories of how everyone eventually left the sandlot, and town for that matter, brings me to tears. One of the greatest movies of our era and a sure classic for not only us, but our kids as well.</fullReview>

Great one to watch with your friends to reminisce about the old days. Look for a great cameo by James Earl Jones.

		<fullReview>I thought The Sandlot captured the innocence and joy of being young and playing baseball in a small town neighborhood. The film isn't perfect but has great atmosphere. I enjoyed the sub-plot with the dog and James Earl Jones and I loved the scenes when the kids were just being kids and enjoying the summer. The film made me feel good and I sometimes think that's all a film is supposed to do. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up watching The Sandlot and what i realized about this movie is that this film doesn't have the players winning or losing, but this is about friendship and how a big dog can make your worst dreams come true. The Sandlot is about a gawky kid named Smalls(Tom Guiry) who just moves into the neighborhood and tries to blend in with the crowd, until he fails. Mike Vitar who plays the neighborhood baseball hero Benny, helps Smalls play baseball and fit him in with the crowd. The team accepts Smalls and what makes the film interesting like i written above is that this film isn't about winning or losing, but about living your days in the summer when you are ten to twelve and realize that there is more to life than winning.Overall a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful family film that will also entertain the parents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly amazing film. It's a very good family film that can be enjoyed by BOTH your kids and yourself! That's rare, as often "family films" have too much smutty language or sexual situations for kids OR are so saccharine sweet that sane adults would prefer suicide over watching the films (think Disney in the 1960s).The film isn't quite a comedy, though there are really funny moments in it (such as the evil dog that eats baseballs). And, it's not exactly a drama. It's more like an occasionally surreal slice of life film about the good old days of the late 50s-early 60s. It's about a group of kids that live to play baseball--and that's all they ever seem to want to do! Despite this very simple plot, somehow the excellent acting, direction and writing make you really care about the kids and it engages you from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE SANDLOT is quite possibly one of the best "family films" ever made. In it, a young, studious, unpopular boy named Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a suburb just before school lets out for the summer, and concurrently has a hard time making friends. He frequently sees kids playing baseball in a sandlot in his neighborhood, and wants to make friends with them. He figures the best way to do this is to join in on their baseball games--but alas, Scotty has almost no baseball skills, while the other kids are very experienced and good at the game. One day, the neighborhood hero Benny (Mike Vitar) approaches Scotty and asks if he'd like some pointers and to join in on their game. Scotty agrees, and slowly improves, while making friends with the other boys in the neighborhood.But one day, Scotty foolishly takes his stepfather's baseball autographed by Babe Ruth and knocks it into the adjacent backyard. This backyard, as Scotty is informed, is home to The Beast, a monstrous dog that, as legend has it, ate the only other boy who was daring enough to go after a baseball in that yard. The boys devise a plan to get the ball back, one way or another.I watched THE SANDLOT several times growing up, and remember always loving it. When I watched it again recently, I realized exactly why--it's a great movie. Just the right balance of childhood innocence and experience is captured, and this movie is bound to make any adult remember his childhood and all the different aspects of it. The summertime atmosphere and almost all of the scenes are terrifically nostalgic. Some of the scenes involving The Beast are hilarious, and everything has a nice familiar feel to it. It's a wonderful feel-good film.All of the actors put in at least average performances. Most of the child actors are just okay, with a few exceptions. Tom Guiry is good as the awkward and naive Scotty, as is Patrick Renna as the outspoken and witty Hamilton. I think the real standout of the actors, though, is Mike Vitar as Benny. He was excellent as the kindhearted, but still very cool hero of the neighborhood, the guy that everyone loved. He showed real promise, and it's a shame that he didn't continue with his acting career. The cameos from James Earl Jones and Denis Leary are also nice.I always loved watching THE SANDLOT growing up, and now I remember why. It's a great family film that is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure I'll watch it again years from now and remember just why I loved it. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sandlot was my favorite kid movie when I was a kid myself.I was about 8 when I saw it the first time on German TV, so a couple o' years after the movie's release and man, I loved this one. I saw it during summer and after watching it I felt the energy for new adventures! The best thing is, years after that I saw the movie again during another summer and it reminded me so hard on the good times one can have as a youngster outside... I went for adventures again.As many other reviewers have noticed, this movie reminds us of what it was like to be a kid, and when dogs were dangerous monsters, and playing outside was just a huge adventure. Everybody of us felt like an Indiana Jones. It felt damn good.This is one of the movies I will carefully hold on and keep it, lets say to watch it all couple of 6 years just to remind me how cool life can be. The movie captures all our youth so well and packs it in one huge summer so watch and love this one.An absolute 10/10 for being THE kid movie of my life and guess what? I am an adult but I love watching this one. Your turn now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable family film with plenty of amusing moments and the young cast are appealing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tommy Smalls (Tom Guiry) is the new kid, who moved with his mother (Karen Allen) and his stepfather (Denis Leary) is a suburbans area of Salt Lake City in the summertime. When Smalls becomes curious with a group of kids (Mike Vitar, Patrick Renna, Chauncey Leopardi, Marty York, Brandon Quintin Adams, Grant Gelt, Shane Obedzinski and Victor DiMattia), who plays Baseball all day long in a old baseball field. Smalls is hoping to play with them but he knows nothing about the game. When he tries to play, he's quite bad at all. He can't even throw a ball to the catchers. When he becomes friend with the leader of the game and Smalls starting to like the game. But when his stepfather goes away for business, Smalls take a baseball from his stepfather trophy room. Which without realizing that the ball, he took from the room is actually signed by the Baseball Legend "Babe Ruth". Smalls hits his first home run, the ball went over the fence of a old house. But that old house, it has an mean-spirited junkyard dog. Which the kids called him "The Beast". Now the kids have to help Smalls to get the ball back before his stepfather comes back from the business trip.Directed by David M. Evans (First Kid) made an likable family comedy that plenty of funny moments, a good cast and a lot of imagination. The narration of the film will certainly make you remember of the late Bob Clark film "A Christmas Story", although the narration of "The Sandlot" is sightly heavy-handed at times. This film has a surprise hit, when it was release in the spring of 1993. Fox had another fantasy film about Baseball, which it was "Rookie of the Year". James Earl Jones, Art LaFleur and a young Marley Shelton have memorable bit parts in this pleasant comedy as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer (Also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD also includes an featurette, trailer and TV spots. This film went on to be an modest classic over the year. All the kids have their moments, especially Renna and Leopardi have their comedic moments. The movie slows down a bit during the second act. But it's well made and this picture pleases everyone as well. It's one of the better family movies of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Co-Written by the director. Arliss Howard appears Unbilled. Followed by Two Direct to DVD's. Joe-Dunton-Camera Scope (J-D-C Scope). (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Baseball fans and fans of childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie every time I have come across it...it really is that good. If you, like me, grew up in that era you simply can't help being caught up in the nostalgia and this simple, but perfectly written movie.For me, everything about this movie rings true. No, it is not a great theatrical masterpiece or a stunning and thought-provoking commentary, so if you're looking for that, change the channel.What it is, is simply a glimpse of our country, and our world in the time before political correctness, reality TV and our fast food way of life. A time when all a kid needed for fun was a group of friends, a ball and a space to play in.Many of the changes of the past few decades have been wonderful, but I must admit I do miss certain aspects of the past; The Sandlot epitomizes all of them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. Alone or with your family, old enough to have lived it or younger you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nostalgia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rate my films in terms of context. This film never aspired to be an Oscar nominated movie of a lifetime. But it did aspire to be a good family film, and that it is. For me, I'll admit nostalgia has a lot to do with it. This is a movie from my childhood, and yes as a girl I had a huge crush on Mike Vitar. But at the same time this reminds me of my childhood because my brother played baseball with all the neighborhood kids in our side yard and we always spent our summers outside or at the neighborhood pool just as the kids in the movie did.Besides, the nostalgia I'd say this movie is right up there with "A Christmas Story" or "Ferris Buller's Day Off" as far as extremely recognizable quotes go. Nearly anyone will know what movie you're talking about when you say them."You're Killing me Smalls!" --- "FOR-EV-ER" --- "THE BEAST" --- "The great Bambino? Oh, I thought you said the great... Bambi." --- "You play ball like a GIRL" --- "Yeah-Yeah the kids a square" --- "Benny 'THE JET' Rodriguez" I could go on, but I won't. This is a great movie to watch with your kids and to reminisce of your own summers spent as a kid. ENJOY!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Best Sports Movies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sandlot is a fantastic movie because it is appealing to many different age groups and fans: kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, sports fans, and fans of comedy will all love this movie. "The Sandlot" is loaded with so much genuinely funny dialogue coming from the kids, making it appealing to anyone who likes comedies. Yet it is also full of intrigue and adventure, which comes in the form of a giant dog and the legend behind the "monster." It connects to baseball's hallowed past with the connection to Babe Ruth and the time period of the 1950s Yankees, making it interesting for younger viewers and relatable to older viewers who were around during that time. Because of its widespread appeal, this movie ranks among the best sports-related films. 3.5/4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fact that people are still writing about how wonderful the movie is tells you a lot. As I look at them I am struck that they all seem positive. My son has watched this movie several times, and asked for it for Christmas. Each time he watches it it sparks a new conversation, and questions about real life issues. As a Mom, I think this movie is wonderful. When I watch this with him, I wish he had a group of friends like they are. They all seem to really have respect for each other. It is a "Stand by me" kind of movie, and I would like to see more of them.I seems like the kind of movie that can encourage people to be better people. This is a great movie for young boys and families.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was in about 1995, and even though baseball is not so big in England, I dived into this movie like a starving man into a mountain of mashed potatoes. The best memory is when the story of 'The Beast' is made known. Indeed, when I went camping that summer, I told the story to my tent-mates, and they believed every word of it. (Of course, I changed it a little to make it seem as if 'The Beast' was situated next door to me.)Memorable Line: YOU PLAY BALL LIKE A GIRL!! *Gasp!!*....(Silence)...All I have to say is, bar Blade, this is the greatest movie I have EVER seen.

		<shortDescription>I love this movie and for one particular reason.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My husband watched it for the first time a few days ago (over the long Veterans Day weekend). He then watched it for a second time the day after. He did not have a happy childhood, in fact some childhood memories for him are downright painful. We have been married 11 years and I know very little about his childhood and what went on. However, after (and during the second viewing), he began a waterfall of childhood memories that I had never heard before. Of long summers of "sandlot" games with him and his cousins (they were known as "the cousins") they could play baseball and football and kicked the butt of most of the teams in town, during the movie his memories spewed forth as if they had been bottled up and just needed to be set free. His friend actually did the "lifeguard" thing, pretended to drown to kiss her, and like the movie they were all banned from the pool. They also had a "scary guy" in the old house that everyone was terrified of (in fact so did I as I recall). He assures me that this movie is as faithful a retelling of a childhood in the 60s as he has ever seen, and he revels in it. I think that is the greatest compliment that anyone can ever pay a movie and I am grateful to the director for uncorking the well of my husbands memories for me to share.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sandlot" has to be one of, if not the best kids movie ever made. Because this is one of the very few movies that is equally entertaining whether your a kid or an adult.This is beautiful proof that the quality of a movie doesn't depend on how many celebrities star in the movie, but how good the story really is. Because "The Sandlot" came out around the same time as the movie "Rookie of the Year". While "Rookie of the Year" got all of the media hype and had all of the big celebrities staring in it, but after you saw both of the movies, you realized that "Rookie of the Year" was nothing but the lame over-hyped move, and "The Sandlot" was the worthwhile movie.As far as I'm concerned, this movie will most likely remain in the #1 spot of kids movies for all eternity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The early to mid 90s was a great time for kids movies. Disney was churning out hit after hit and there was no shortage of movies about kids playing sports, especially ones about baseball. But with so many of those you'd think after a while they'd get stale and too repetitive. In 1993 David Mickey Evans made his directorial debut which happened to be a film about kids playing baseball, but instead of being merely the same old same old it turned out to be one of the best in the genre and has been a favorite for the time's generation of kids to the ones since.Pros: A great cast of boys and a good chemistry between them. The same goes for the adult actors as far a performance. An exceptional directing job by debut director Evans who also wrote the film. Many memorable scenes and lines. Good sense of humor. Made with an obvious love for the game. Nice job on the costumes and production design, both of which look accurate to the period. Brisk-pacing. A soundtrack made up of some classic tunes from the time the film is set. Has a really nice feel good ending.Cons: I'm not against foul language in general, but it's not necessary in this film. Some clichés here and there.Final thoughts: In a sea of so many sports related movies, 'The Sandlot' stands out as one of the most memorable and thoroughly enjoyable. It's one of those films you can watch again and again and pass down to your children for them to enjoy. Why? Because it deals with a tradition that is timeless.My rating: 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read all the comments that preceded this one. Some folks liked the movie and some folks panned it. However, only one or two posts touched on what I thought was the most adult theme of the movie. After many comedic attempts to outwit The Beast, Scotty Small dreams about a giant baseball pile-driving him into the ground. However, Benny has a dream featuring the "great Bambino." When Babe Ruth visited Benny in his dream, he imparted the advice that Benny had to decide if he were going to face his fear or not. Benny could hardly wait. He was up early, urging Scotty to get dressed and get to the "sandlot." When the gang gathered, all the boys were trying to dissuade Benny from going into the Beast's yard to retrieve the autographed ball, but Benny looked at Scotty and said "I have to," whereupon he attempted and succeeded.Don't' we all at some point in our lives have to make the decision to try or to give up? I thought the writers and directors made good use of conflict and resolution throughout the movie from Benny's rescue of Scotty Small's angst from being the nerdy "new kid" to the rescue of the Beast from beneath the fence.We all had friends in our youth who are represented in part by the movie's characters. That's why it is and will remain a "feel good" movie. It reminds all of us of our own youth and of the good memories we have of those times.</fullReview>

It's not only a kids movie, but a movie for anyone who is looking for a good comedy and backyard adventure. the actors did an exceptional job which really moved me. i know there will never be another movie like it. if you like the first movie, i suggest you don't watch the sequel. the acting was terrible, the lines, and many of the scenes were stolen from the original with a twist that ruined not only itself but the sandlot. for any girl looking for an attractive boy in action, this is the movie for you. mike vitar was irritatingly beautiful in this movie leaving his audience wanting more. tom guiry or scotty smalls did an excellent job of playing out his character. watching it over and over may get boring for others but wasn't for me. watching it once will leave you in shock. this one's a definite 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Scotty Smalls was new to the neighborhood. He, his mother and his mother's new husband Bill, had just moved in and Smalls had no friends. One afternoon, he tailed a group of kids to a sandlot where they play baseball. They never chose up sides or kept score, they just picked it up where they left off each day. The kids were: Hamilton "Ham" Porter, Michael "Squints" Palledorous, Bertram Weeks, Kenny DeNunez, Alan McClennan, and brothers Timmy and Tommy Timmons. When Smalls tried to catch a fowl ball and missed, all the kids left, except their leader: Benjamin "Benny" Franklin Rodriguez, the best ballplayer in the neighborhood; Smalls asked Bill to teach him how to play ball and that resulted in Smalls accidentally getting a black eye. Benny met up with Smalls and took him to the field to meet the gang, who didn't really care for him until he hit a homerun! Benny taught him not to think so much and just have fun.  Unfortunately the sandlot was right nextdoor to a home where a big, mean, monster dog lived. They had a campout at their treehouse that night and Squints told the tale of The Beast: a big, mean, monster dog. As vicious as a cougar, a panther, a lion, a tiger and a bear all put together! Oh my! The kids often heard it growling from behind its fence and were deeply afraid of it. They often hit fowl balls over the fence, rendering them gone forever. One afternoon, it was just too hot to play baseball so they went to the community pool where Squints fell madly in love with the lifeguard, Wendy Peffercorn. Squints was so desparate that he faked drowning and right as Wendy was administering mouth-to-mouth resolution, he came alive and kissed her! After that, they were banned for life, but Squints walked a little taller that day. One afternoon, the sandlot kids played a match against another neighborhood team and went to the carnival that night to celebrate, but they decided to REALLY celebrate so Bertrum whipped out some chewing tobacco. As soon as they took it, they got on the tilt-a-whirl and hurled all over the place! But the worst was yet to come: Benny hit a ball so hard, it completely busted to pieces. Now what? Smalls raced home to get a baseball Bill had in his trophy room. It wasn't just ANY ball. It was autographed by Babe Ruth himself, which led to bad news when Smalls hit it right over the Beast's fence! When Bill found out what happened, he would surely kill Smalls. Benny and the guys had to work fast: to buy time, they bought a baseball and put a corny signature of Babe on it, then tried to get the real one back from The Beast. Most attempts failed until The Babe came to Benny in a dream and gave him confidence boosters so Benny hopped the fence and got the ball. Unfortunately, The Beast chased him all over town. Benny and Smalls return the dog to his owner, Mr. Mertle, who actually knew Babe Ruth! All was okay with Smalls when Mr. Mertle gave Bill a ball signed by all the Yankees greats! The sandlot kids played baseball together for a while but then grew up and moved on. A pretty good movie. Alot of potential from these child actors! Watch for appearances by Denis Leary as well as James Earl Jones! That's pretty much all there is to say. I enjoyed The Sandlot and I recommend it to all! A fine family film for the Thanksgiving season or any time of the year!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a fun movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having gone through the little league stage with my son and his friends, I thought this was really a touching and wonderful movie about what boys love to do in the summer, organized or not. We could relate to it since we have the quiet athletic one in the family and the other characters we've all known in one fashion or another. The goofy loud one, the pint-sized one with the stand-out ears, and the serious one without much of a father around. Loved it - and loved the James Earl Jones part. What a joyful laugh he has!If you love kids, love baseball, love summer, and love a nice warm film, see it. It has ended up in our library of films we watch again and again. Makes me smile thinking of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>outside of the ORIGINAL The Bad News Bears, this is the best summer film EVER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is easily one of the BEST films of all time. This movie reminded me of when I was a girl playing baseball with the boys in our own sandlot growing up in Alaska. The writing is not only funny but captures what life is like for kids who grow up playing the best game ever, and the measures a kid will take to get out of a pickle.***WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS Every movie seems to have a chase scene, and this movie is no different. When Hercules (aka The Beast) chases Benny through town I nearly wet myself with laughter. I was crying and my sides were killing me. You get caught up in the moment with these guys and their overactive imaginations. The contraptions they make in their attempts to retrieve the ball are genius and goes to show that kids are a lot smarter than adults give them credit for. Their perspective of that dog's just killed me and I thought it was on the money cause when you're a kid, everything looks about 50 times bigger. Even the DOG gets his own P.O.V...i mean, come on. that's PURE GENIUS. I can even remember swapping urban legend stories about kids being eaten by dogs, exploding from eating pop rocks and drinking soda, etc.If you didn't find yourself getting caught up in the moment with these boys, then you have no soul. or never played ball as a kid...either way, it's pretty sad.I recommend a double feature of The Bad News Bears (with Walter Matthau) and The Sandlot. I guarantee that your sides and face will be sore from laughing, and you'll pee just a little.It's in my top 10 of the greatest films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 8 and really did love it although I'm from England and didn't really understand the rules of Baseball. I do now because since then (I'm now nearly 17) I've been to the U.S.A several times and even had the pleasure of attending a professional baseball game last summer which is a thoroughly enjoyable new experience for me. Anyway, even though when I saw this film I didn't understand Baseball, I still loved it because I loved the characters in it and the way they acted as I behaved in similar ways to them at that age. When I watch it now, I remember being like that when I was younger and being out playing Football (Soccer) and challenging rival teams and calling each other names etc. Thats what it was like and most people were like at that age and it really is an enjoyable feel-good film and I'm not surprised it has many fans although maybe not as many over here.I still watch it every now and then and its still very enjoyable and I can still see it being well-known in the future.A classic 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people ask me of a really bad movie that has terrible dialog and acting, I think of The Sandlot.I remember watching this in school and i just did not like it. At all. The acting is very unprofessional and the music makes my ears bleed. The script is really poorly written with tons of cheesiness to the lines. Yes I know the film has a PG rating but that's still no excuse for the bad script. Why oh why did the creators have to make TWO more sequels to this turd of a film? They had The Sandlot playing at my video store and hearing it on the television screen made me hate it even more. Ugh.The fact that James Earl Jones aka the voice of Darth Vader from Star Wars is in this makes it even worse! Run away from this film please! I give The Sandlot a 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh... I'm almost afraid to do a review like this because so many people like this movie. But on my integrity as a film reviewer, here I go. Please try to remember that the opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone. If you don't agree with them... so be it.I... do not like this movie. I do not like it at all. I would not have liked it as a kid and I certainly do not like it now. I get why some people like it. If you were a kid when this film came out, or you are just a sucker for cheesy coming-of-age movies, or you just really want a movie like this and you have not watched Stand By Me, I can understand it. I, on the other hand, are none of these things, and I hate this film.It is not cute or sweet or relatable or well-acted or well-paced or smart or funny or clever. Instead, it is clichéd and crude and energyless and boring and lifeless and limp and pandering. Pretty much everything about this film is pretty much everything I hate about movie. At times, it feels like it was designed to anger me and me alone.Some people have called this film a kid's version of Stand By Me, which is wrong for two reasons. First, it is impossible to have 'a kid's version' of Stand By Me; that movie works because the audience is reliving their childhoods along with the narrator. Making it for kids makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. But I could forgive that except for reason two; all of Stand By Me's energy and realness is nowhere to be found.That movie worked because the characters had real hopes and dreams and highs and lows and flaws. They seemed like real kids; not the corporate movie versions of kids. That movie reminded me how much I hated the kids around me when I was in elementary school. This movie reminds me how much I hated the kids in the movies they made us watch in elementary school. It is as manufactured as films get.The cinematography is terrible. I, someone who has never shot a movie in my whole life, would probably not be that much worse at it than the group who made this film. It is minor grip, yes, but it represents how little effort went into making this movie artistic. There are a few shots of California. That is all. Stand By Me is a gorgeous movie, with its sweeping shots and careful framing. It envelops you and takes you on a journey. This film just stays put.The characters don't go on much of a journey either. Stand By Me was a coming of age film, and an effective one at that. This film tries to do that, but it forgot to actually do the coming of age. Not much changes from the beginning of the film to the end. Don't let the ending monologue and its sweeping music fool you; not much of importance happened during the duration of the film. Even a film like Kiki's Delivery Service, where next to nothing happened plotwise, made the viewer feel like the characters had grown, like the hour and a half that they put into the film were actually worthwhile. This film? I'm terrible at baseball and my time would still be better spent on an actual sandlot.There are so many holes in the plot. What if Smalls didn't drop the ball when he was dropping down from above? You'd be out of the last twenty minutes of the story. Normally, plot holes do not bother me at all, certainly not on a first viewing. But when the world fails to draw you in, everything falls apart; the veil of artistry is lifted.I could go on ranting and raving for way too long. So I'll just issue one last complaint- the characterization is nonexistent. How hard is it to make the characters in a film interesting on at least a banal level; seriously? Make them stereotypes or overgeneralizations; just do something. How trite everything feels could be somewhat excused if you were actually seeing the film through the characters' eyes. But the characters are so two-dimensional that you can't.Overall, everything in the film falls apart. It is as if someone took Stand By Me and hired some random joe to make something like it; and the random joe had no clue why SBM was great in the first place. I will never understand why this movie is so beloved. Nothing stands out; it is bad and boring. Except for the music, which is exceptional.Again, I do not care if you like this movie. Everyone has their own opinion. But I have the right to voice mine. So there it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally love this movie, it is one great film for the whole family to enjoy, at least for those baseball lovers. I have watched this movie dozens of times and i don't get tired of it.The one part i like in "The Sandlot" is when they're roasting marshmallow's in the tree house.(i shouldn't spoil it for you people that haven't seen this movie yet, but it's so great and funny)There are some funny parts and gross parts like the boys chew tobacco and puke on a carnival ride, trying to get a baseball that wen't over a fence and try many different things, and also Wendy Capricorn. You will find out about her in the movie.This movie is based around 1962 and shows a lot of baseball and learning how to play.This is one of my most favorite movies of all time, plus "James Earl Jones" makes a perfect Mr. Mertle. (also if you like adventure movies i would recommend checking out "The Goonies")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My nine year old's opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My opinion is that it is a somewhat funny somewhat serious and somewhat weird movie. The most funny part is when I realized that all the comments about the beast and the blind guy were false. the most serious part was when smalls find out that the ball his dad has can not be replaced. the weirdest part is when Babe Ruth was in Benny's dream and could sit down in Benny's room. So that is my opinion.Mom's opinionThere is a bit of language that you may not want children to repeat but it is a cult favorite. I first saw the movie when I was subbing and it was being shown to a junior high math class. Many of the students (especially boys) were repeating lines.It is a good tween slapstick movie which does touch on the areas of responsibility and friendship. There is also a good anti-tobacco message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies of all time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sandot Kids as it was known to me,would have to be one of the all time great movies.For it's simple and happy way of telling the story of our youth(although i am Australian and don't really follow baseball)it has a special quality about it.I recently viewed the Sandlot 2 and was not really drawn to it like the original as i kept finding myself trying to compare the story to the first movie.Once my kids were old enough to watch it with me,all i hear is the memorable lines from the movie constantly shouted at me in the backyard.My two kids always repeat the scene in the tree house where the guys have a sleepover and tell the story about the beast and how to roast a marshmallow and place it on a biscuit with the chocolate.It totally cracks me up and will always cherish this film as i think in this day and age we all need to step back and rediscover the little things that were important to us all as we grew up and this film is all of that. In a nutshell,even an Aussie like me at age 36 still gets a kick out of this most wonderful movie.It should be put away for future generations to share and enjoy just as i have with my two kids.The Best.Regards, Darren Martens,Victoria,Australia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I caught this movie over the Christmas holidays and i can happily say that i thoroughly enjoyed it. Basically its a movie about a bunch of kids playing baseball over there school summer break. They play and hang out at there own field called 'The Sandlot'. Well, what i enjoyed the most was watching a good mix of young actors really just enjoying them selves, it was if there weren't any cameras filming to them in their eyes, they were kids being kids, the normal banter you see with boys their ages. It really hit home how much i missed being that age and that care free watching this movie, but it also gave me a great sense of happiness just to see these boys being the way i was with my friends back in the day. I would recommend this as a great family film for all to enjoy. A real feel good factor movie.</fullReview>

Smalls: "Yeah, I know. But I'm not good at anything, mom. Face it, I'm just an egghead."Want some more?Benny: "Anyone who wants to be a can't-hack-it pantywaist who wears their mama's bra, raise your hand."

		<fullReview>Does anybody know where this was filmed ???? This is the times that I grew up in as well. Every neighborhood had a sandlot. We were always digging for change to pitch in as a whole and buy for the better of the group. Baseball was Everything to us. Every neighborhood had that one monster of a dog, and bicycles had real seats to sit on. Yeah, this movie took me back to the old block. This is a must have for any collection. It doesn't matter if you are a action lover or a drama watcher or a horror flick buff, you will relate to this movie. Unless you never had a childhood at all. I purchased this movie at our local video store rental mecca for the stealing price of 2.99. So what if it had been viewed by others. I'm sure that every time this DVD was spun, it generated smiles and laughter. And it still does.</fullReview>

Parents will also like it.Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a new town where the kids play baseball all summer. Smalls has never learned to throw a ball so he asks his step dad (Denis Leary) who is a baseball nut to teach him so he can play with the other kids. The star of the pick-up team is Rodriquez and he's really the only kid who can play. The other kids idolize Rodriquez. The sandlot home run fence in left field is a no man's land and any ball that's hit over it disappears forever because "The Beast" lives there.The kids have a clubhouse in a tree. Their characters are all funny with nicknames: Repeat, Yeah-yeah, Squints and Ham. James Earl Jones and Karen Allen are also in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Baseball Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sandlot is a great baseball film, even though throughout the film the games take place at a Sandlot and not any major league stadiums *spoiler* until the end of the film with the adult Benny playing for the LA Dodgers.This is a great family film showing the love for America's past time game of Baseball. The film is about a new kid, Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new town where he knows nobody. He follows Benny to the Sandlot, looking to fit in, of course his hopes of fitting in are quickly shattered after an embarrassing attempt to throw the ball back to the infield.However despite the team's disliking of Scotty, Benny decides to convince Scotty to come back and be apart of the team since they are a player short of having a complete team. The result, Scotty becomes more liked by the team as Benny helps him learn how to play.The rest of the film is entertainment and fun from Squints infamous drowning act to the boys first experience with Chewing Tobacco to the final showdown with "The Beast".The side story of "the beast" is good, a very interesting way of showing why the boys cannot retrieve their baseballs after each is hit into Mr.Mertle's yard. Its something that most kids face, hitting their baseballs into someone else's yard, hearing bad stories about the person that lives in that house and fearing that person. But as Mr.Mertle says in the movie "Why didn't you just knock on the door? I'da gotten it for ya." Which shows that not all people won't be mean and release "the beast" on you, some could be a jolly fun spirited person like Mr.Mertle.Oh, and you gotta have that other team that thinks they are better than your team. A showdown of a real team and the Sandlot kids ensues at one point in the movie, just to prove that the Sandlot kids can kick butt even if they are not a real team.The movie was well done, very enjoyable for people of all ages. There should never have been a sequel however fans of this movie are let down. I'd recommend watching this one only and pretend the sequel does not exist cause the sequel is pretty much a remake of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, David M. Evans' The Sandlot is a very pleasing picture, and it includes humor. It will keep you laughing and entertained, and it comes with a great assortment of hilarious characters. A group of nine kids accidentally bat a Babe Ruth baseball into a yard with a demonic Saint Bernard and they try several attempts to get it back. This isn't an award winning movie, but it has a good storyline and it's a nice family get together thing. I want to be able to say something different than in my other comments, where I wrote, "It was a fantastic movie, go see it now."

		<fullReview>I certainly do! This is one of the first movies I saw when I was younger. My Dad was crazy about it and would always watch it with me. I remember when I was seven years old and fell down the stair and broke my arm. My Dad rented it for me everyday until eventually he made it a "keeper" (he purchased a copy for me). Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez was definitely my first crush. His handsome dark features are outstanding. Even when I watch the movie now I get a weird squishy feeling in my tummy when I see him! This movie is about a bunch of really good friends that have a passion for the sport baseball. Every summer they would go down to an old sandy baseball field that they the named "The Sandlot". One summer this new kid moves to the neighborhood and desperately tries to become friends with Benny and the gang. This kid's name is Scotty Smalls or just "Smalls". Benny is the only one who is willing to let the poor kid play baseball with them. Benny and Smalls become quite close. Benny teaches Smalls how to play baseball. One day Smalls is up to bat and he hits a baseball signed by Babe Ruth over the wall. The gang knows of "The Beast", an enormous and vicious dog. All of the boys are too afraid to just hop over the fence and retrieve the ball, so they begin to try and get the ball from the other side of the wall. The boys come up with some pretty whacky stuff. If you want to know what happens in the end, I sincerely urge you to go to your local Blockbuster and rent a copy of "The Sandlot"! Over all rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a complete classic. Tom Guiry is great as the part of Scott Smalls, and the movie smoothly moves from one great subplot to the next in this great adventure about a nerdy child who experiences the summer of his life through the summer baseball group he joins in the summer.It's absolutely portrayed in the style that it will never get old. Certain things were meant to die out, but this film will remain a kid flick forever. From Wendy Peffercorn puckering up to Squints to following your heart, you'll follow this movie right to the end (although it's follow-up wasn't that bad). The planning of the movie is perfect, and it's setting in 1962 sets up the fantasy in all of us. Beating snotty baseball rivals in a pickup baseball game, hitting your first Home Run, learning to throw, making smores, spooky "camp outs", the unknown neighbor Mr. Mrtyle "the meanest old man that ever lived" that was the perfect summer. Too bad those days are just about wiped out, because those were the days.The classic summer? More like the classic movie. If your into a lot of wacky adventure, slapstick comedy, and where mystery has never gone before, try this one, it's a guarantee plus.</fullReview>

Seriously folks...this may well be the best baseball movie ever. Thats right I said it.

		<fullReview>The movie emobidies all that is and was great about 1950's and early 1960's America.We have the straight "A" student who is befriended by the most poplular boy in the neighborhood.Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez is the boy that everyone wants to be friends with and who sticks up for the little guy.The movie could not be better written, directed or cast. An absolutely perfect movie that shows the best of America through the innocent eyes of our forgotten youth.The narration is done by the now grown-up nerdy kid that is adopted by the cool baseball playing neighborhood kids. He learns about the most important part of being a 12 year old kid, baseball and the pure joy that playing with your best friends brings.Through trial and error, they grow and mature, eventually moving on in their lives. Yet, Smalls and The Jet remain close, as Smalls, still the intellect, is a sports announcer and The Jet is the great Major League player.If you don't love this film, you have no heart and love for America and baseball.</fullReview>

It definitely started a trend in my neighborhood because after my friends and I watched it, we started our own little baseball playing club. I am nearly 19 and I still love this film. It's one of those films that everyone can enjoy from all age groups. It's funny how time flies and how a great movie like this still gets a lot of positive reviews. I still can't believe this movie is over ten years old...feels like yesterday that I learned about "the beast" and seen Denis Leary in a role other than a foul mouthed burglar...10/10. Loved it at 8 and still love it today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once in a while there is a movie that is considered a "children's movie" that comes out and is greatly appreciated by people of all ages. This strictly applies to live action children's movies. This movie falls perfectly into this category. When you see it as a young kid it mystifies you completely. As a child it almost has a supernatural feel. With "The Beast" taking the stage as the element of supernatural feel. The characters in the movie keep talking about the beast as though he is a mythological monster. It brings back memories of your childhood when you used to talk about those monsters and things that go bump in the night. The best thing about this movie is that it brings to mind exactly that childhood. You know these kids and you grew up with them. In the end that is why this movie is great and classic. The childhood you had is lived forever for all to see through this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the best movie ever. I've been watching it my whole life, and all my references are from it. New crush--that's a Wendy Peffercorn. Lost ball--careful, there might be a Beast there. It's funny, sweet, has a great cast, and the plot rocks. It even has morals. The best scene, in my opinion, would have to be the face-off between the Sandlot Kids and the preppy rich team (who even have uniforms, jackets, and helmets--not to mention attitude they can't back up on the field and a hatred for out beloved Ham). This movie is what gave me all my insults AND comebacks! What more could you want? Don't even bother renting it--got out and buy it, since the only people who don't like it are people WITH NO SOUL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had originally saw this movie in theaters when it it first came out. It was part of a double feature with Aladdin, and I had never even heard of it (I was there to see Aladdin). But when I left the theater, the only thing I could think about was how good the Sandlot was. It's a movie that every family should watch together. The story is a about a boy, Smalls, that moves to a new neighborhood and tries to fit in. It just so happens, that the best way to fit in is to play baseball. Despite knowing nothing about baseball, Smalls manages to be accepted. Although the plot is very good, it's the characters that make the movie. Squints, my favorite, is probably the best character in the movie. From his over-sized glasses, to his charming ability to put the moves on the local lifeguard, he keeps you laughing through the entire movie. Other characters include the witty and red-headed Ham, the clueless huge-hat-wearing Smalls and an enormous dog referred to as "The Beast". As far as sports movies go, I rank this at the top of my list, and as far as family movies go, it's in my top 10. So, if there is still some child inside you or you want a movie to watch with your family, you can't lose with The Sandlot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie again the other night on TV. Reminded me of one of the happiest evenings of my life. My son was 9 years old then. Mom was out of town. I was feeling blue. He and I got hamburgers and went to see this movie. We camped out in the Family Room afterwards and he thanked me so profusely and genuinely and affectionately for the wonderful evening. The movie made me think. The ONLY way to overcome a problem is to confront it straight on -- that's how they got the ball back in the movie. It got me out of my blueness that night. The movie was also hilarious. Great music. Great message. Great fun. Great evening. It's underrated in the TV Guide. I give it 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, baseball ruled. When the sun came up, we went outside and played baseball. When the sun went down, my mom had to drag me into the house. If we had two players, we had a game. If we had 12 players, we had a game. Problem was, we didn't have too many nice baseballs. Hit the ball into a gutter or lose it in a cornfield and the day was ruined.Today, I'm 35 with two boys. Baseball still rules. Sun-up to sundown. If you were an American boy, you'll love this movie. Every scene, every line happened in my life, and I'll bet, yours too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Growing Up Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with this movie when I was a kid. Around my school there's practically a cult following. There, if you go up to someone and say "you're killin' me Smalls!" or call someone an "L 7 WEENIE," and tell someone that it will take "FOR-E-VER," the person will more than likely start laughing and know exactly what you're talking about. It's one of the movies that I, and many other teenagers in my school, will never forget. Its one of the best parts of our childhood. However, I feel as though if you did not grow up with this movie, you will never truely appreciate it for it's greatness. Basically, they just dont make movies like this anyone.

		<shortDescription>Remember When</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when episodes in your life were more than merely what they were? When everything was live or die? When pure passion was all that you lived on?This is a movie about those times, and yet, it's something more. At the age of 10-12, every moment that we live seems like it will last forever, and there is no sense of repercussion for your actions. In this film, there are times when you want to bury your face in your hands because you can remember something from your own childhood that this film relates to.This film is about that simple time between childhood and adulthood. That time when you believed that shoes could actually make you run faster. Or that the dog just beyond that next fence was actually a huge monster just waiting to kill you. Those stories that your friends sat you down and told you about that, in retrospect, you should have known better, but believed anyway, just because you chose to.Scenes in this film bring back memories of a childhood that was once so real, so vivid, and yet, so distant. While children can relate to this film, because the main characters in the film could be kids that they know, parents can relate to this film as well, because there are situations that we all went through, in one way or another. The loss of innocence, the connection with our parents on a "real" level, the final realization of the vast difference between reality, and that which your friends have sworn is true.As you sit down to watch this film, be prepared to venture back into your own childhood, as that is what this film is really all about. This film is about each of our childhoods, told through the eyes of the narrator. About the friends that we held dear, and about how we grew together just by being a part of something, together.Oh, and baseball plays a pretty good roll in the film as well. 9 boys who are drawn together by one thing, baseball. It is through these nine boys that we all find identification.There are some great supporting roles by the likes of Dennis Leary (surprisingly restrained, actually acting even), Karen Allen, and James Earl Jones (who becomes the oracle of baseball, taking in the two kids who will eventually spend the rest of their lives around baseball).This film is one of the many movies that was mismarketed. This is a film for all ages. Adults shunned it because it was labeled a "kids movie", and kids shunned it because it wasn't a cartoon. Fact is, this is one of the few films that both parents and kids can sit down and watch together and derive completely different satisfaction from. This is one of those films that I can't wait to share with my children, when they get old enough to understand it, like maybe 7 or 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic- the "Now and Then" for guys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sandlot" is one of those rare family movies that seriously has something for everyone. Parents can find many similarities to their own childhood because the movie stays true to its 1962 setting. Kids love everything from the baseball practices to the big chase scene. Even teens have to laugh at the part when Squints lays one on Wendy. There are so many scenes that are simply classic; there us no other word for it. "The Sandlot" is a well cast, well portrayed, and overall well done and enjoyable movie. Viewers who may have been disappointed with "Now and Then"- a film about female childhood in the 1960's- may be quite pleased with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. First of all, it's perfect for the family who want to watch a great film without all of that Disney aftertaste. I saw it when it premered on cable back in '93. I loved it because of the simplicity of the premise. It captures the era perfectly of 60s California baseball fever (aside the from the fact it was filmed in Utah lol). The character of Benny was a suprise since he has that 'cool jock' look, but doesn't act like that at all. He doesn't make fun of Scotty (our main character and narrator) because of his lack of athletic ability. Instead, he gives Scotty some simple advice: Have fun. With that (and a pop up from Benny), he is accepted as part of the team. I can mention many moments I like from the film that range from the guys defeating the school team to Squints lusting after his dreamgirl to the final fates of the two main characters (which makes me smile). The small parts of Denis Leary, Karen Allen, and especially, James Earl Jones are nice too. Just a fun film, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate boys of summer movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember that time you followed the train tracks to find a dead body? How about the time you were part of a ragtag bunch of misfit baseballers who win their division titles despite everyone's expectations? Or how about hitchhiking cross-country to stop that movie about you and your hetero life mate from being made? Now those are all good concepts for great movies, but how about a movie you can actually relate to?The Sandlot is just that.It's one summer spent in the lives of 9 friends who play baseball in, well, a sandlot. They don't keep score. There's no ultimate prize. They just play for the absolute love of the game. Bored? Don't be.What's great about this movie is that it takes 'little' events that any one of us have experienced and turns them into the full-fledged awesome adventures they seemed to be when we were that age. A visit to the local public pool, a challenge from the local snobby kids, and the retrieval of a baseball are typical unexciting sounding events any of us have experienced. However, when you add to the story,"I remember this one time when me and my friends..." a flood of emotion and memories are sure to follow.Child actors take note: Whether its good direction, good writing or good acting, this wouldn't have worked if the kids weren't believable. The greatest honour they could ever give this great movie is never attempting a sequel."You're killing me, Smalls!"da_flipboy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE definitive childhood movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out in the theater... so I must have been in first grade... my most vivid memory was Benny... damn... he was fine. But I also remember my dad laughed during the movie... and my dad NEVER took me to kiddie movies... I was reared on "R" and "PG-13" flicks... but enough about me. This movie and Newsies are movies that any current high school students know and love. The Sandlot is a great movie about loyalty, friendship, honesty, big dogs, and baseball! The plot involves a new kid to the neighborhood who is befriended by a group of kids who play baseball everyday in the summer on a 2nd rate sandlot. The new kid lets his friends use one of his stepdad's baseballs one day, because they don't have any left. This ball also happens to be WAAAY over the fence after the new kid hits his 1st homerun. This ball also happens to be autographed by "some woman named Ruth... Baby Ruth?" Babe Ruth! The kids then have to devise a way to get the ball out of the yard of a kid-eating dog owned by an allegedly evil man... mwah! This movie offers a positive message about friendship and why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. 9/10!! *I also reccommend Newsies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must-have baseball movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a woman and love both baseball movies and retrospective movies because since I have a family now I long to be a kid once again. This movie fits both categories perfectly. "The Sandlot" starts out as a fish-out-of-water flick (painful to watch at first because we've all been awkward and ridiculed as kids), but turns into a great adventure as the team gels with the new kid on the block, Scotty ("you're killin' me!") Smalls. The Fourth of July night game, the trip to the fair, the pool, the Beast...you can practically smell the hot dogs and suntan lotion no matter when you view it. My kids are hooked on this movie, and know who the Great Bambino is now. They had to get mits and a baseball and bat--did I mention my daughter even uses the closed-captioning so she doesn't miss a line to memorize? If you've never seen this movie, I urge you to rent it--better yet, buy it. You'll be in a big pickle if you have to return it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Smalls, you're killin' me!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally when I write reviews, I really try to make an effort to stay away from cheesy lines that come off as little more than weak efforts to be witty, such as starting my review off with a memorable quote from a film, but in this case, I just couldn't resist. The quote above (which, on watching the movie again, seems not to be even in it, but rather the line `You're killin' me, Smalls!,' but over the years since I had least seen the movie, the first one seems to have stuck with me more) is such a classic line of preteen comedy that I simply could not leave it out of my review. Granted, starting my review out with it is only slightly less cheesy than starting out a review of Star Wars with the line, `May the force be with you,' but I think that The Sandlot is a much more overlooked film than Star Wars (all of which are ANYTHING but overlooked). It almost always seems true that, in films like this (and most light-hearted comedies, now that I think about it), everyone seems to love the fat kid. Consider Stand By Me, in which Vern Tessio is the clumsy but lovable fat kid. Completely devoid of any kind of grace, but we love him anyway. In The Goonies, Chunk was arguably the most charming and lovable kid in the entire film, permanently imprinting our memories with such things as the Truffle Shuffle, his hilarious love of even the most obscure flavors of ice cream, and his clumsiness involving such things as ceramic statues and glass water cooler bottles (`Hope it's not a deposit bottle!'). In The Sandlot, we get yet another lovable character who fits in perfectly even with the very memorable ones mentioned above, as Patrick Renna gives a hilarious first film performance as the charmingly named Ham Porter, a red-headed fat kid with conflicting loves of food and baseball. The thing that really makes The Sandlot such a good film is that these kids childhoods are so effectively captured. There are some digressions of reality presented throughout the story, such as the sheer magnitude of Hercules as well as the kids very ability to create and use some of the huge and complex devices that they used to try to get the signed ball back, but that's because this is childhood. We are seeing the world through the eyes of a bunch of 12-year-olds, and these heroic things are just the kinds of things that they see as necessary to get their ball back from the fearsome beast. There are several other scenes, as well, that reflect the idea that much of this film is not made up of things that happen in every young boy's life, but things that every young boy WISHES would happen in his life. Consider, for example, the scene where these kids kick the hell out of an older and presumably more skilled group of players, who enter the film just long enough to be taunted and then badly beaten by them, as well as the scene where Squints manages to make out with the much older blonde lifeguard, and then is then lucky enough to get a bemused wave out of her afterwards rather than an endless series of dirty looks (and, MUCH later, he also manages to get NINE kids out of her). (spoilers) However far the film goes into childhood fantasy, it can be forgiven at the end because the deceptive simplicity of reality comes crashing in at the end of the film, as Mr. Myrtle (James Earl Jones) asks them why they didn't just knock on his front door and ask for the ball, he would have gladly gone to get it for them. This not only causes them all to slap their foreheads, but also reminds the audience of one of the film's themes, that the world is not as scary as it seems when you're a kid. It remains at least slightly questionable about why baseballs disappeared in such sheer numbers into the beast's yard and not a single kid went to the door to ask for his ball back, but consider the fact that, even as adults, we expected to find an owner who hates kids and would scream at them if they even came close to his front door. He lives in scary looking house, has this monstrous dog in the backyard, and no one seems to have ever seen him. Where the films seems to go a little wrong is in the actual character of Mr. Myrtle, who is so polite and generous and happy and charming that it seems impossible that he has not become more involved in the social atmosphere of his neighborhood and town, regardless of whether or not he can see. It's just a little too convenient that he happens to have been a personal friend of Babe Ruth (not to mention actually PLAYED with him), and that he would so easily give these kids (who have just destroyed his back fence) a baseball signed by the entirety of the 1927 Yankees. However, even though the film seems to go too far in this respect, it is such a satisfying ending to see that these kids have made new friends (in Mr. Myrtle as well as in Hercules), met a baseball legend, solved their conflict, AND learned a lesson about life, that we are willing and able to forgive any exaggerations in Mr. Myrtle's character. The character that would seem to be even more bothersome in an exaggerated respect is the impossibly charismatic and talented Benny, whose desperate efforts to include everyone and to be helpful and positive when the clumsy and talentless Scotty Smalls attempts to join their game suggest that his character was written by an adult (or adults) who are either trying to push across a message about not making fun of the new kid, or who were made fun of as children themselves (and believe me, I know what that's like).Regardless, however, of any characters that may not fit in perfectly with what real life is like, these alterations in reality are to be expected in this film given the fact that the vast majority of it is seen through the eyes of young boys, and what we ultimately get is another exciting childhood adventure tale that delivers morals without us even really realizing it. It's so refreshing to see such an entertaining film deliver so many good messages without stopping to spell them out or to be too blunt about them. The Sandlot is a great story that fits in well with it's other classic counterparts, such as The Goonies and Stand By Me, mentioned above, and it carries the rare distinction of being one of the few films that will remain as fun and entertaining for generations to come as it was for it's first generation (mine) back in 1993.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies when it doesn't matter how old you are... you can enjoy it. It's told from the eyes of Scotty Smalls, AKA the new kid, who has seemed to have moved every summer after school let out. In his attempt to fit in, he goes to the local baseball field - The Sandlot. Although first impressions were killer, the team eventually accepts him in due to the encouragement of team leader Benny.As time goes on, the neighborhood legend,"The Beast" (a dog in the yard behind the lot) has taken their last ball, and they are short the money to buy a new one. Smalls takes matters into his own hands and brings his step-fathers baseball signed by the one and only Babe Ruth. Not being much of a sports fan, when the ball is lost, Smalls doesn't know of his importance. From there on the boys try everything and ANYTHING to get the ball back while Scotty's parents are away.It's about friendship, teamwork, childhood, triumph, love and responsibilty. Watch an unofficial baseball team transform into the greastest group of friends . . . ever. * * * *"quite Be quite! Do you wanna wake it up? It JUST went to bed!" "loud WHAT JUST WENT TO BED?"

		<shortDescription>A sweet, genuine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sandlot is and always will be one of my favorite movies. Every time I see it, I'm reminded anew why I love this movie so much.It's a great movie, for boys, or baseball players, or both. However, I didn't live in that time period, I don't play baseball, I'm not in the 5th grade anymore, and heck, I'm a girl. I still adore this movie.If you didn't play baseball, you know someone who did. And no matter how old you are, you have to remember the neighborhood Fourth of July barbecue (you know, the one down on the McGuire's front lawn), or swimming, or the neighbor's evil giant dog (oh, do I remember -watch out for Mack).One of the best things about this movie is that is so refreshingly different. Most movies about younger kids are about them rallying to beat out their competition. This is about kids being kids.This movie is actually loved by a lot of people. I can prove it- just walk into a room of high school students, and somewhere in your conversation, start saying, "Forever . . . forever . . ." and see how many chime in.All in all, this is not a movie to be missed. If you ever get the chance, see it; I can't imagine how you could be disappointed. So, if you ever want a sweet, nostalgic movie, look this one up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sandlot is a very good movie. It's more for the kids, but it's still good for us old folks. This movie is about a new kid in town, who meets the kids of the neighborhood, and they all have the summer of their lives. This movie sort of feels like you're watching "Wonder Years".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest baseball films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this isn't the conventional baseball film. In fact, baseball doesn't really have to be a part of it. This film is about growing up. It's about finding yourself alone in a new town and hoping to make friends. Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) is a young boy most of us can identify with. Even if we'll never picture ourselves as Smalls, we can at least say we've met a naive kid like him.Scotty moves to the Valley with his mother and stepdad (Karen Allen and Denis Leary, who are little seen in the film but who are the primary adults here) and plans to spend his summer alone in his room reading and toying with his erector set. When Mom pushes Scotty to go out and make friends, Scotty listens. Reluctantly. He stumbles upon the sandlot one day and finds eight young boys just like him. They never play a real game, just one long never ending practice. These will be his friends for the summer, and one will be there for the rest of his life.Of course, this film works better with baseball. It's America's pastime and one of our country's creations, something the US will forever be associated with. Even if you never grew up playing or even liking baseball, you'll love this movie. There are exceptional performances by our young players, from the portly Hamilton Porter (Patrick Renna) to the handsome Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar). These boys aren't ballplayers, they're kids just like we are or once were. We grew up with Squints (Chauncey Leopardi) and Smalls. Like its predecessor "The Bad News Bears," there isn't enough time to flesh out each youngster, but the focus here is on the two main characters, Scotty the narrator and Benny his older and wiser friend.Benny's a big brother to Scotty. He teaches Scotty how to throw and field, gives him a new mitt and cap, and even casually tells his new friend to toss Scotty's trademark puke-colored fish cap into the fireplace. This friendship is the one we all know will last throughout the film.Sure, this isn't "Field of Dreams" or "The Natural" or even "Major League," but it's an adequate portrayal of growing up in the sixties, having to tell little white lies to fit in, and sticking up for one another whenever possible. In all, there is only one game against an opposing team, a "real" ballclub complete with uniforms, stirrups, quality equipment (batting helmets, for one), and a field and scoreboard. This scene is great in that it shows that it doesn't take a lot of $$$ to make a quality ballteam.James Earl Jones makes a memorable cameo in an otherwise "kid flick." The narration is fine (reminiscent of TV's "The Wonder Years"), the performances by the young actors promising, and the story/plotline, from beginning to end, is adequate to keep your interest. Most of my friends who have seen this film have said that the most memorable scene is the poolside scene, with lovely actress Marley Shelton portraying Wendy Peppercorn, the object of Squints' affections and resident lifeguard. Though this scene is memorable (in all its possible ways), the true baseball game occurs on the only night game, the Fourth of July game, where the fireworks in the sky light up the sky so much that it's possible to play a game in the sandlot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My favorite baseball film is not about a major league team in a do or die situation, but this charm of a film about kids playing baseball in yard in the late 50s or early 60s. You don't have to be nostalgic about the time period to enjoy it. It is not only a great baseball film, but a great comedy as well. Deliberate exaggeration of "The Beast" was a great effect in making the story more fun and seen it more through the eyes of a kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As far as kid's sports movies go, this one's a keeper..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many times have we seen the story of a group of misfit kids who under the advisement of a coach, make it through thick and thin to beat the big bad bullies? Well, thanks to the Sandlot, one less than necessary."The Sandlot" is better than that. "The Sandlot" gives us a real story about real kids, and while kids will enjoy the movie, so too will anyone who's ever experienced a true love for the game of baseball. Because that is exactly what these kids have. Unlike most other movies, (i.e. "The Mighty Ducks") these kids actually care about the game they play. It is, in fact, their life. And while it is fun to "beat the crap" out of the big tough guys with the fancy uniforms, they just as soon would have played on their own, simply for the sake of playing. "The Sandlot" does a good job of portraying kids as they are: essentially selfish people who love to toot thier own horns, but for the sake of their interests, will tolerate others with similar interests. Only through this initial toleration do the true friendships begin to form."The Sandlot" is definitely a must see for anyone who has their old mitt lying somewhere in a closet or attic at home, and count on wanting to find it and take it outside to have a catch once you've seen this movie.</fullReview>

Not only is it well written and entertaining, it brings back memories of a time when all we needed to be entertained was a group of pals, and the long days of Summer vacation.Good choice to watch with your family or if you are longing a tad for your own childhood.</fullReview>

I just turned 20 and people my age will know what I'm talking about, when i say that its one of those movies you want to see over and over again. I first saw this movie when i was 10 years old and even to this day I watch it with awe. Its based around a bunch of kids in the 1960s during one summer, where they each learn a little more than just about baseball. I don't want to give too much away, but when u watch this movie, you ill know what I mean. I own this classic on DVD and I keep watching it over and over again-I just cant get bored watching it.My favourite characters have to be "Ham" and "Squints". There have been some memorale quotes in his movie for which you can repeat with your mates. I give this a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ersatz (Jean) Shepherd-esquire presentation of sandlot baseball life in early 60's Southern Cal. A "we didn't realize then what a great summer that was" sort of movie, I guess better than most of the genre. Little Scotty Smalls moves into new neighborhood, gets adopted by baseball fanatic Vitar and his band of quirky irregulars, teen adventures ensue. Vitar has presence as the local star, hard to believe he hasn't done a lot since then. Complaints include: the narration was often annoying, I didn't have to hear every 5 minutes about the "pickle" Scotty was going to get into (particularly when you could work out all the intimate details of the "pickle" not long into the movie); and the language is much too harsh for small children, who are otherwise the best audience for this. Tired "update" on minor characters at film's end is balanced by touching finale with the two leads. I know I'm getting old when Karen Allen is playing a middle-aged housewife, wasn't she just Boon's college girlfriend?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kid Movie For Adults Who Are Young At Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up as a nerd can be hard, especially when you're trying to make friends with the local kids at the sandlot (where day in and day out it's nothing but baseball). But you do what you can, which means learning the game. Things are going smoothly until the one day, when you find yourself in the world's biggest pickle -- sending your father's baseball (signed by Babe Ruth) into the neighbor's yard, which is guarded by a creature known simply as "The Beast".I watched this film on my birthday with my best friend Chelsea, not really knowing what to expect. I figured that not unlike her other preferred films lately ("Mighty Ducks", "Little Giants"), it would be a sports underdog film. Well, it's not. Sure, it features kids who come from less-than-wealthy upbringings, but it doesn't have anything to do with them facing off against another "superior" team. Just kids, a baseball and a beast.This film will appeal to kids and to adults who wan to be kids. It's a good, clean film with no nudity or violence and only a small amount of cursing. Good for the whole family. The father, who appears only briefly, is played by Denis Leary, but it's not the stand-up Leary or the Leary from "Judgment Night" -- it's the one from "Operation Dumbo Drop". So expect foul language and you'll be gravely disappointed.I really enjoyed the surreal quality of the beast, how it was played up to be a dinosaur or some other mythical creature. I also liked the Rube Goldberg methods to retrieve the ball. I was a little doubtful that anyone wouldn't know who Babe Ruth was, as the main character doesn't. Sure, you might spend all day reading Popular Science, but it's Babe Ruth. The name itself far surpasses what anyone knows of him.I loved this film. It helped that I watched it with one of my favorite people, but at the same time it was just enjoyable in general. It's nice to have a film that's not raunchy or too cerebral -- just a relaxing trip back to the days of our childhoods (like the protagonist, I also spend more time reading than anything physical). Share my enthusiasm!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Baseball Film Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film better encapsulates the fear and wonder of the unknown, summer fun, and most of all; the everlasting bond of friendship and the love for the great game of baseball. The Sandlot is simply a classic.Being that I spent a good amount of my youth playing sports and particularly baseball outside, The Sandlot holds a special place in my heart. There's something about the relation between the characters in the film and the people who I grew up playing sports with that resonates with me. Luckily, the film holds up extremely well since I first saw it in the 90's. Taking place in the 1960's, the film definitely takes advantage of the history of baseball. Not only is Babe Ruth the MacGuffin of the film, but he ends up making a small cameo (played by Art LaFleur). But it's also fun to hear all of the references to various events to the history of the MLB and other pop culture phenomena. As a baseball lifer, the film still gets quoted in our dugout to this day.Besides having some great cameos by LaFleur and the legendary James Earl Jones, what I love most about the film is the comradery between all of the main cast. They all have their nicknames and unique quirks, which gives the group a broad appeal. But I think we all relate to Smalls, who just wants to make some friends and ends up finding a love for baseball that lasts a lifetime. It's not like a film like The Sandlot deserves a ton of critique. It's a perfect film for what it sets out to be, and that's a fun baseball flick about the power of friendship and how a common interest of baseball can change the summer and life of 9 boys from the same neighborhood forever.+Great cameos+Powerful story of friendship+Perfect baseball flick9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satire and Nostalgia in One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Sandlot is a clever movie about a boy, Scottie, who moves to a new neighborhood and meets a bunch of new friends on a baseball sandlot. He is really bad at baseball, but Benny, the neighborhood baseball god, takes him under his wing and incorporates him into the group. The team has a bunch of misadventures at a swimming pool and city park, and then things get dicey when Scottie accidentally hits his stepfather's ball, signed by Babe Ruth, into a yard with "the beast" a really large dog. There is a bunch of hilarious slapstick as they try to get the ball back.The Sandlot is interesting because it seems to reside in a bunch of genres at once. On the one hand, it is a baseball movie for sure, although something of a satire of movies like Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. You almost get the sense that they have translated the minor league antics of Bull Durham into a kids' movie and the result is really funny. A scene involving chewing tobacco and a park ride is especially effective.On the other hand, The Sandlot is also plainly a kids movie, in the sense that it is a real attempt to see the world from a kid's point of view. In that sense, it owes its conception to movies like To Kill a Mockingbird, which try to see the world through a child's eye so as to illuminate it to grownups.Also, the movie is clearly a nostalgia movie, attempting to recreate in some measure the world of the early 1960s. It is a loving and effective tribute, taking us back to a suburban world of that era which contained a real capacity for joy.Finally, the movie is a physical comedy, and a good one. There are bunch of really funny slapstick scenes in this, mostly inspired by the fantasy aspect of the movie. The world is something of a Calvin and Hobbes sort of world of imagination, and in that world there are plenty of opportunities to laugh at what might be imagined.Thus, the Sandlot is a multi-faceted winner, a movie that appears shallow on the surface but actually works on a bunch of levels. Perhaps most importantly, it is hilarious and fun, and this is perhaps the best reason to see the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate baseball movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great comedy about baseball here. This film takes place in 1962 and Scott Smalls becomes part of a neighborhood team and is able to fit in with them. They also get in the biggest pickle of their lives. Scott has the gang play with a ball from his step dad that was signed by the Great Bambino also known as Babe Ruth. The greatest baseball player that ever lived. As they play with it, it goes into an old mans backyard who owned a mean vicious dog that was a beast of a dog. Of course I think the dog in this movie was a bassit hound. You also know that dogs can't really grow up to be the size of a monster, also they can't grow up to be as big as Clifford. lol. As the gang tries many ways of getting the ball back the beast always gets the best of them. Then Rodriguez had a dream about meeting Babe Ruth and Babe Ruth gives him great advice and that he must get the ball out of that backyard. The next morning Rodriguez goes over the fence and grabs the ball and the beast starts chasing him. When he gets chased back to the sandlot and over the fence again the fence falls onto the beast and is hurt. The kids decide to help the hurt dog and then the dog turns out to be nice. Then the kids knock on Mr. Mertle's door who of course was blind and a retired player of the Negro League. He is played by the great James Earl Jones another fine roll in his career. Scott tells him about the ball and that he was in deep trouble. Then Mr. Mertle gives him another autograph baseball signed by Babe Ruth and all the other 1927 Yankees. When Scott tells his step dad about the ball and shows him the one Mr. Mertle gave him, his step dad only grounds him for a week instead of the rest of his life. Since then he and his step dad became very close. Also the beast also known as Hercules becomes the Sandlot kids mascot and they played ball until they grew up and went on to have different careers. Scott Smalls becomes a baseball announcer and his friend Rodriguez becomes a baseball player for the Yankees. Great film here and still a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Baseball has always been one of my favorite sports, there was always something so thrilling about hitting that baseball and running as fast as you can to certain points all to lead back to where you started. But also just simply the beautiful outdoor enviorment and company you played with.This film is one of my favorite films of all time and another childhood gem of mine. It's also my favorite sports film of all time if you can believe that. This really is a truly unique sports film because it's not one that is centered around a team on a journey to a championship, a single underdog player rising, or any other cliché format your familiar with.The film was simply a slice of life movie just about a group of kids playing a game and having a good time which to me is what the essence of sports is. Watching this film now as an adult makes the film even better to me because it's sort of like looking at a passage in a journal, helping me remember the good times I played baseball as a kid.I really like the Sandlot kids they all have good chemistry and I really like the fact that they all look like ordinary kids, there not some people from the damn CW but the kind of people you pass by and see everyday which really gave the film a relatable feel to it. They look like the kind of friends I've had as a kid as each of them are unique, their not the kind of people that are popular in school nor are each of them (except for Bennie) likely destined to be Baseball stars in the future. But it didn't matter nor did they care they just care about having fun and being together which is the basis of every sport.Even the location of where it takes place adds to it, the worn out Baseball field they play in "The Sandlot" adds to the feel, because I remember playing in fields like this in the park or school playground.My favorite character has always been Ham. His character is just great, he has a lot of attitude but just some of the best lines my favorite line "Your killing me Smalls!" Another that I like is Squints whom is pretty much a nerd, but he's a character I can sort of relate to a bit as he's highly imaginative when he tells that story about the Beast which I find hilarious as it is clearly just an urban legend blown out of proportion; I have an active imagination too and like to make stories. But also how he harbors a crush on that unattainable girl Wendy, yeah I've been there too.The film is just made up of lots of scenes in the first and second half of the film which is pretty much just summer days and times.From that pool scene which always cracks me up as we see Squints engineer a scheme to get Wendy's lips to his, what makes this even funnier is what we hear about the two in the end. The game against some jerk baseball team and just hearing Ham just psyche each of the members batting. Or even the infamous amusement park scene which I found hilarious because it's true as we all might have done a really dumb thing or two as a kid and learned our lesson the hard way.Then of course there is the third half which is getting the lost Babe Ruth ball from the Beast. It's just funny and interesting seeing how the Sandlot kids are just finding all these inventive ways to retrieve the ball, surprised they haven't though of participating in the science fair. But it comes down to one of my favorite chase scenes ever which is awesome as it's a foot chase and it just goes on to different locations, it's practically like a Marathon.The film I also feel is somewhat of a tribute to both Babe Ruth and the sport Baseball. The Babe is constantly mentioned in this film and of course there is the ball itself. And the film is also a period piece as it takes place in the 60's which makes perfect sense since that was a time when the game was still young and growing. The fact these are just ordinary kids playing the game without affiliations to major teams really shows the roots of where Baseball originated before it became a major business it was simply just an ordinary game for people to enjoy anytime they want and it still is.The Sandlot is a home run.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sandlot; The American DreamThe Sandlot employs the conventions of the sports genre in order to connect its audience with a hilarious backdrop aside from the athletics of the film. Although not the best representation of sports in general this film excels in its genre for presenting the prefect American Dream. This film illustrates the reality of baseball in the day to day life of a mid 1960's neighborhood. A summary before you, describing how and why this American iconic film presents baseball in the best way possible. &#x200b;The Sandlot is based on a mid 1960's neighborhood. What started out as 8 troublesome boys living the American dream, playing baseball all summer long. Soon turns to 9 as Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to town. He isn't the most popular, or the most athletic. But dyer circumstances require the other 8 boys to allow him to play. There is however one boy on the team, Benny 'The Jet' Rodriguez (Mike Vitar) who believes that Smalls (Guiry) has potential to become one of the team greats. It wasn't an easy road for Smalls (Guiry). Coming to a new town, with his mother and recently married stepfather. He now has the task of finding new friends, not easy for a boy of his nature. He soon takes his plastic glove to the ballpark to see all the boys playing ball. He eases his way into right field for some practice. Only to find out he has no business on the field. Everyone ridicules him, or in the words of Squints (Chauncey Leopardi) "A square Benny, the kid's a square!" However, Benny (Vitar) sees the diamond in the rough. He gives Smalls (Guiry) some real gear, a real ball cap and a broken in glove. &#x200b; Just as Smalls (Guiry) begins to feel welcome and a part of the crew. He learns of the challenges that await all of them. Life, or death 'The Beast' a giant gorilla dog on the other side off the fence. If you hit the ball out, it is gone forever. Because nobody messes with 'The Beast' One boy tried it once before but never returned. Once a ball crosses that fence, you can kiss it goodbye. Until Smalls (Guiry) brings his stepfathers autographed Babe Ruth baseball to the field to play. Little did he know about the significance of that ball, until it was too late Once the ball had been surrendered to 'The Beast' the boys must figure out a way to retrieve this ball from 'The Beast' before Smalls' (Guiry) step father returns home from a business trip to kill him. Many failed attempts, from the simple minds of 9 young boys. All lead to the moment when Benny (Vitar) must "pickle The Beast"&#x200b;If you love baseball then this is the movie for you. If you want to be sitting in your chair, all business and never crack a smile then don't even bother pushing play. It very well could pass under the comedy genre more than it could pass as the sports genre. As this movie will have you hysterically rolling on the ground as you see these 9 adolescent children running around with no parent supervision, trying to defeat 'The Beast' And if all of that fails to keep your attention, just wait until Wendy Prefercorn (Marley Shelton) the local lifeguard comes along You won't be bored for long; you'll be very jealous of Squints (Leopardi) as he drowns to receive mouth to mouth from his dream woman.&#x200b;Though this film may not have top notch athletic action, it is an excellent example of the sports genre. It shows that baseball is so much more than just a game. "Baseball is life" the diamond is where lessons are learned and lifetime friends are made. Take the journey with Smalls (Guiry) as he tries to save his life and discovers the joy of life and friendship. Be prepared to laugh, and you might want to take notes. To remember all the quotes that you yourself will draw from in the future. Remember; don't play baseball with your stepfather's autographed ball. Or you too, might have to pickle the beast</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to like sports to like this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a big fan of sports but I like this movie a lot. This is a film with a lot of heart. It's about a kid named Scottie Smalls who moves into a new town and has a hard time fitting in. He bumps into a group of his peers playing baseball and decides to join them. Through this experience over the summer, he befriends the leader of this group named Benny who has sympathy for him from the start. Smalls also meets an overweight goof-ball (Ham), a dorky kid who has the hots for a lifeguard, and others. At first, they don't like him but as their friendship is put to the test, they all form a bond that has a great payoff.One day, they run out of baseballs and need a new one. Smalls decides to steal his stepfather's ball that was autographed by Babe Ruth. They use it and it goes over the fence where a supposed dangerous dog lives. So the gang decides to find ways to get it back. I won't spoil anything but it's really good.Growing up, a lot of us have had friends like the characters in this movie. It feels authentic and believable. The dialogue is also very quotable. Who can forget "You're killing me smalls"? The Sandlot is a classic movie that's great for the whole family!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boxing Helena was disturbing yet a pirates treasure no less. then Tombstone solidified his art. So it was with near shock to come face to face Bill Paxton walking through AQ Chicken House. Without explanation the family finished and retired to our abode. My buddy Jim and I relocated to our favorite haunt 'The Hilton' for the typical Vodka and pining session for Rachel the Wonder Women of Bar Tenders. However this night would be Historic. For the often quiet bar was filled with a gaggle of disorderly dramatis personae. It was the crux of the Crew that just finished filming The Sandlot. Landing in the Ozarks to film an HBO Jesse James feature. Sandlot hadn't been cut but the Buzz was growing louder each day. Over the next several months we witnessed acts of gratitude, $150 tips for Rach, Drinking games, ruffians, hoodlums and delinquency. It was memorable. 20 yrs later we still miss Walter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is good family fun. It is one of the few movies we still have on VHS and I'm sure the tape will just break at some point but when it does I hope I can find a copy on DVD somewhere. Kids like it, especially little boys because obviously they tend to like baseball more than most girls. All kids enjoy the movie on some level though. I liked it a lot because I liked the dog in it and it was just a fun movie. It's typical for a kid's movie, easy to follow with some cheesy jokes and a typical villain type, not too evil but certainly an antagonist. I mostly like how they are able to catch the mood of childhood friendships and just the feeling of hanging out with friends to play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1993 family film that quickly found its way to being a kids' classic. Perfect for those who love baseball, and equally enjoyable for those who don't or don't know much about it. All-in-all, a fun film about nine childhood friends in 1962, spending their summer days and nights at the sandlot playing baseball and having a variety of adventures related and unrelated to the sport. Nice parallels between baseball pickles and real life ones, plus other great lessons like the big and small differences between myth and actuality. Dennis Leary is perfect as the stern but awkwardly friendly stepfather, and James Earl Jones has an awesome bit role at the end.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice growing-up movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in a middle school class and it is fun entertainment for a bunch of kids in their early teens. Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) moves to a new neighborhood and wants to learn to play baseball. He befriends a local baseball group and is taken under the wing of Benny Rodriguez (Mike Vitar). The group goes through many adventures together, including dealing with their secluded neighbor's menacing, huge dog.Many kids grow up playing sports like baseball, and go through fun times, thick and thin, with each other. So, this is a nice movie for that younger age group to watch as it delves on the elements of friendship, sportsmanship, and local adventures. The baseball plot may be a little basic in the movie, but throw in a subplot about a mysterious neighbor and his scary dog, it adds some intrigue into the movie.Just about the entire movie has an adolescent atmosphere, so adults may grow out of this movie over time (I wouldn't watch it again even on a slow day). Therefore, this one is best left for the younger viewers.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smalls?You Are Killing Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I started carpooling with an old friend of mine and we conversed a lot to/from work. Occasionally, he would say: "You're killing me, Smalls." I let it pass even though I didn't know what he meant by it.I guess after the 3rd or 4th time he said it, I inadvertently repeated that phrase to another coworker in a similar situation as my carpool buddy put me in. They laughed and exclaimed that they loved that movie. I asked "What movie?""What do you mean, 'What movie?'" they shot back.I explained I didn't know where that movie line came from, but I somehow knew how it fit into conversation. They laughed and could NOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM believe I had never seen The Sandlot.Over the course of a few months, I would get the similar response of disdain that I had not seen this movie. In my defense, most of my coworkers are much younger than I and I explained to them that by the time this movie debuted, I was already too old for a young-kids-coming-of-age film. (Later it wouldn't be so bad, but at the age I was in 1993, I wanted to be older and not associate with younger kid movies.)Incidentally, this movie fell off my radar completely during the 1990s and 2000s, until that "You're killing me, Smalls" phrase erupted recently. So, I made it my mission to finally see it. (Believe me; I had a minimum of 22 people criticize me for not seeing it.)One recent Sunday night, I finally made time for it?and DAMN. I am SOOO sorry I didn't see it sooner and further, I regretted I wasn't born later, like a decade later. This would've been MY movie. No doubt, I would've seen it a minimum of six times in the theatre ? where I got the money for that many viewings from my poor family, would be the same challenge these boys had with the baseball replacements. But, I would've seen it many, many times. Not that I would've needed to: the famous quotes from it, much like the SMALLS line, would've been permanently engraved into my subconscious from the very first viewing and for the rest of my days.I would've surely identified with Scotty Smalls. Innocent, new, inexperienced and friendless. He moves into a new neighborhood in the early 1960s and takes a bit of time to become part of the gang. Once he does, he's there for life.I am the same way with each stage of my life. Especially with all the moving around my family made us do from the time I was seven until I was almost Junior High School. And then further, outside of school, when I moved from job to job, even when it was years at each employment.I digress. If not for so many movies, TV shows and other life-events in the way, I would probably watch this movie a multiple of times. I absolutely loved this movie, up and down, inside and out. I laughed out loud, cherished the "PG-Rating/family rating" which I don't watch too often, identified with the group of kids and reminisced of times, journeys and adventures I had outside and in the neighborhood as a kid.Sadly, I missed both the show: The Wonder Years and the movie: The Sandlot as a child. But, that doesn't mean I have to from here on out.* * * Final thoughts: I don't normally do this, but I want to personally thank my new coworkers and older friends for making me see this classic. I know a lot of other kids my age idolized movies such as The Breakfast Club, The Lost Boys and Stand By Me?I never got into those. I wish I had been born later? I would've surely idolized this one. So, thanks to you: Jessica Bojorquez, Andy Recinos, Nicole Meglen Davis and of course, Smalls, himself, Brandon Schildts. If I missed anyone, I apologize... Thank you too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a kids movie. It's a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scotty Smalls is the new kid in the idyllic small town with his mom and stepdad. He's an awkward kid who wants to play baseball with neighborhood kids. There were 8 of them, and he hoped to be the ninth. Their best player Benny Rodriquez takes Smalls under his wing. Over the summer, the group has great childhood adventures together. It all culminates to a story of a lost baseball signed by Babe Ruth and a feared dog named the Beast.This is more than just a kids movie. You can easily overdose on the innocence of it all. There is the group of kids. They are perfectly casted with amazing chemistry. Each one is an iconic child type. As a period piece, they picked an era just before the world goes into revulsion. In the sport of baseball, they have accentuated the childhood love of the game.This is a kids movie for the whole family. That's not a cliché. It has the feel of a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Sand lot" is a lot of fun. The new kid in the block who doesn't know squat about baseball learns a lot about the game during its 101 minute running time. This tale of initiation resembles an Arthurian myth about a knight slaying a dragon. Our pint-sized knights are playing baseball when the protagonist accidentally loses his stepfather vintage Babe Ruth autographed baseball. The child actors are a likable lot and director David M. Evans orchestrate the action with enough flair to make these suburban shenanigans memorable. The first half of "The Sandlot" acquaints us with the adolescent adventurers as they accept the outsider and mold themselves into a single unit. Once our hero swats his first four-bagger, he becomes friends with his compatriots. The moment that he achieves this zenith of sorts, he creates the chaos that truly solidifies their group. All along Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry of "Ride with the Devil") has said that he knows who 'the Great Bambino' is, but he doesn't. One day after his best friend, Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez (Mike Vitar of "Sunset Grill"), hits a home run, the guys are left without a baseball. Nobody has enough cents to buy one. Nevertheless, Scott wants to cement his friendship with the group and contribute something. He takes the prized baseball with Babe Ruth's John Hancock on the cowhide and offers it to the guys. Of course, they don't know that the ball Scotty has supplied is a trophy ball. Scotty attain his moment in the sun with his home run. Now, the kids have to figure out how to retrieve the baseball. Hatched a nerd, Scotty concocts several nerdy contraptions to enable them to recover the ball from the backyard where a monstrous watch dog with a reputation lives. Through the action, Evans appropriates every opportunity to build up the dog until it becomes the equivalent of a dragon. Eventually, Benny ventures over the fence in his brand new P.F. Flyer sneakers, retrieves the ball, but the Beast (an English Mastiff) pursues him relentlessly through backyards, a movie theater, a Founder Day Fair, and the swimming pool. The dog turns out to be more than a beast that ate a child. James Earl Jones plays the owner of Hercules. Like I said, "The Sandlot" is a whole lot of fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really glad I saw it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure if I ever saw this film before recently, and luckily, my friend invited me over to see it, and I was not disappointed. This film has a lot of things I like to see: Comedy, smart characters, unpredictable things happening, and a great story. I'll get to these aspects of it later though.The story is about some kids who love to hang out, and do many activities, but playing baseball together is their favorite thing to do. They eventually run out of baseballs to use when playing outside once, until one of the kids, played by Tom Guiry, borrows his dad's autographed ball (Babe Ruth signed it) and he ends up hitting it over his neighbor's fence, where they think a huge beast lives, but turns out that it's a dog with quite an appetite. So the kids need to find a way to get the ball back before the dad notices it's gone.What I love most about this film is how unpredictable it is. For example, when the kids are trying to get the ball back, they use a catapult. They try to fling the ball back, and the clip suddenly slows down. I thought the ball wouldn't get over the fence and would be just short. I was wrong. The dog actually jumps really high in the air, and he looks like he swallowed the ball. That was very unexpected and hilarious. I like to see things like that. There's also this one part where one of the kids is able to jump over the fence and get the ball, outrun the dog, and jump over. You think he outsmarted the dog, right? Wrong. The dog then jumps over the fence and starts chasing him. How one can predict this, I have no idea.The energy in this movie is outstanding. Not just from the good acting by the kids, but from the comedy as well. There's this scene when one of the kids pretends to drown so he can make out with the very attractive lifeguard. I knew that was going to happen, but I still laughed hard at it because the energy and timing of that joke.I'll knock the film slightly for two things, and one is that there isn't a lot to the story. Basically, the first half of it is just the kids playing baseball and hanging out, and the second half is them trying to get the ball back. That's all there is to it, but for what we got, I still enjoy it, and this is more of a nitpick. My second problem is that if the kids didn't have enough money to buy baseballs, where did they get all that equipment, like the vacuum or catapult, from? I do see that part of it is child made, like one of them seeing through a box of Wheaties, but it's still impressive technology, and I have no idea where they got it from.For what we got, I really enjoyed The Sandlot, and I am really glad I saw it. I consider it one of my favorite comedies now, and that is quite an accomplishment, since I can be quite picky with films like that. I'd say to go see it, but since it got a sequel, and I guess a third one, I'd assume you already did see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun for kids, but holds more significance for the adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just one of those movies that makes you feel good, no matter what age you are. If you're a kid, you'll love it for the fun characters and the humor. If you're an adult, it will bring back fond memories of childhood that will make you wistful to go back to those days again.I first saw this movie on HBO when I was a kid and found it to be a pretty entertaining/funny movie with some animated characters and an amusing sub-plot about a killer dog. It was fun for what it was. But I have to say, I think the adult audience has the bigger end of the stick here. Re-watching it as an adult brings a perspective to it that most kids are too young to grasp: experience and time. This film romanticizes childhood and does a pretty damn good job of it, too. You will be hard-pressed to not find yourself thinking about how you were at that age and remembering old friends that you probably haven't seen or heard from in many years. This film stirred up so many memories I had forgotten and even made me quite sad.This movie and "Stand By Me" are probably two of the greatest movies about adolescence you can watch. The feelings and emotions are timeless and representative of a time in our lives that is gone way too soon but never forgotten.If you're having a hard time or maybe even just a bad day, put this film on and go back to the days when everything was much simpler, the biggest problem in life was what to do on a Saturday afternoon, and your friends were the most important thing in the world. If only we could capture these memories in a bottle and relive them any time we wanted. But since we can't, this film will have to do.</fullReview>

What I find scary about this statement is not just that he didn't like the flick but that he knows other people with such crappy taste. It is a simple fact of nature that Sandlot kicks much ass. Sorry man I didn't write the rules.The truth is that even tho I was the age of the kids in the movie when I first saw it The Sandlot still holds up today, some 15 years later. For me The Sandlot falls in the Goonies, Princess Bride, Back to the Future, Time Bandits etc... category of PG rated movies I watched and loved as a kid that I still love just as much if not more today. The kids are all truly good actors but none of them have "made" it as adults. That sucks for them, but for us, the viewer it makes it easier to watch. It makes it a bit difficult to watch movies with cute innocent kids when all you can think about is there legendary tolerance to cat tranquilizers. So if you have kids it is nothing short of your duty to show them this flick. But even if you don't have kids, and didn't see it when you were a kid you will still dig it. Like I said it is an actual fact that The Sandlot kicks ass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may have caught on by now that i've been watching a lot of rentals. seeing as the theatres had nothing playing that i already didn't see, i grab a couple of DVD's from the local Blockbuster and watch some old flicks that sparked people's interests. The Sandlot was one of those films. It's about a group of kids kicking back during the summer. You know, go to the beach, socialize with friends, run away a lot from a vicious dog who likes to eat your baseballs. Yup, good ol' summer. The film itself is sometimes referred to as the groundbreaking kids film of the 90's. But they said the same about a number of films (Casper, Space Jam, The Lion King, Aladdin, etc) but i still think it settles for a timeless cassic title. But two very unoriginal sequels came out, the second being the same as the first except for the girls being in baseball and the thrd is just bad. So the first is way better.

		<fullReview>Every child dreams of having that classic 'storybook summer,' spending everyday out in the sun with best friends having unforgettable adventures. In the movie The Sandlot, Scotty Smalls is able to live this dream.Scotty Smalls narrates the story of his perfect summer. In 1962, Scotty moves with his mom and step-dad to a new town where he does not know anyone. One afternoon, he follows some of the neighborhood kids to 'the sandlot' where they play baseball. He finds himself in left center field, even though he does not know how to play. The ball comes his way and instead of catching the ball, Scotty is knocked to the ground after the ball bounces off his head. All of the kids except for one, start making fun of him. Benny Rodriguez, the best player of the bunch, stands up for him and teaches him the ways of baseball. Scotty becomes part of the group and they all share countless good times and misadventures. They continue to play baseball at the sandlot every day. Just beyond the walls of the sandlot lives 'The Beast', an old junkyard dog that, according to the legend, eats anything and anyone that enters that yard. When Benny hits a home-run over the wall, the boys are forced to end the game. Scotty saves the day when he goes home and gets a baseball, which happens to be signed by Babe Ruth, out of his step-dad's trophy room. Not knowing the importance of Babe Ruth's autograph, Scotty brings it to the sandlot. He goes up to bat and hits it over the wall. The boys try anything to get the ball back from The Beast. When they are about to give up hope, Benny has a dream in which he speaks to Babe Ruth. He tells Benny to use his speed to retrieve the ball and escape. The next morning, Benny puts on his PF Flyers, hops the fence, grabs the ball, and escapes. As he is running, The Beast's chain breaks and he chases Benny around town. When Benny and The Beast make it back to the sandlot, the fence falls onto The Beast. They tell the owner, Mr. Mertle, who they find out used to play ball with Babe Ruth, about everything and he invites them into his home where he replaces the Babe Ruth autographed ball with one signed by some of the best Yankees hitters in the late 1920s. The film ends with present day Scotty in the press box of an LA Dodgers game, where he is doing a radio commentary. One of the star players, Benny 'The Jet' Rodriguez steals home and flashes a thumbs-up to Scotty.'The Sandlot' is not all about baseball. It is not all about winning or losing, but the friendship and adventures behind the game. Movies are often about winning the big game, or defeating the rivals, but The Sandlot takes a different side of the story, showing that it is not always about how well the game is played.</fullReview>

Great directing. Great everything. The characters you can actually fall in love with. This movie when I was a kid made me want to play baseball. But I don't play baseball anymore. I love every second of this movie. It could never be out done. A remake should never ever be made. The sequels where horrible and should have never even of been made. I loved every single character in this movie. I loved it when they tried to get there ball back from the dog. The best baseball movie ever made. And one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of the hole entire race of human kind. No joke. No joke at all. I don't know why I haven't bought the DVD of this movie yet?!

		<fullReview>If you ask me, the Sandlot is one of the better sport films that concentrates not only on friendship, but also on teamwork, determination, and believing in yourself. I have seen this movie on many occasions, and it never fails to amaze me. The kids shown in this movie are just what they should be; not sugar-coated, obnoxious, whiny or arrogant. The movie is family-friendly, and not in a bad way either.The setting takes place in the early 1960s. A kid named Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood and soon gets involved with a group of baseball buddies in some hilarious, memorable moments. Throughout the movie, he narrates how he got into the biggest pickle, and how it was one of the biggest summers of his early life. Benny Rodriguez, the neighborhood hero, accepts him into the Sandlot, and he soon learns of the sport of baseball. Then, he hears the tale of 'The Beast', who the kids fear that he might eat them and take their beloved sport away. At first, Smalls doesn't believe the story, but soon realizes that he fears 'The Beast' just as much as they do. In a string of hilarious scenes, the boys will do anything to save their pals and the Sandlot.A turning point in the movie is when Smalls takes his stepfather's autographed Babe Ruth baseball to continue on with the game. After he whacks the ball into the yard of 'The Beast', he soon fears that the ball may be history. The boys devise a plan to bring the ball back, even if it means being inside the territory of 'The Beast'.Because I don't want to spoil too much, the movie in itself is one that you'll come back for again and again. It captures that childhood innocence almost perfectly, and it contains that feeling that is rarely felt in other childhood films. Anyone who grew up in Southern California during the 1950s and 1960s should feel right at home when they watch this film. Even though the film wasn't actually filmed there, it still depicts the era in which it was cast.The Sandlot also reminds us of the days when kids would play outside during the long summer days, before the world became indulged in video games, text messaging, and surfing the Web. The actors in here all give a solid performance, at the very least above average. They aren't really well known, but just as with everything else, not all famous actors are good and not all child actors are bad. To make a long story short, the Sandlot is a well made film that will entertain kids and adults alike.Despite seeing the movie several times, I still enjoy it for what it is. Although it's not perfect (what movie is?), I highly recommend this movie for those nostalgic of simpler times and those obsessed with baseball.8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best kids movie made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i was little i watched this movie all the time. it was one of my absolute favorites. Even now at 16 i love to watch it. Last night was the first time i had watched the movie in years. And i still laughed my head off. All the kids worked so well together, it was like a group of crazy boys from your own neighborhood. Its a great movie about friendship and baseball, and a group of kids you wont forgot. If your looking for a good clean fun movie to watch with you family, or by yourself, you should certainly watch "The Sandlot". Its a classic and has been a movie that people still love to watch even though it was made in 1993. A Great movie for kids, and adults too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was dragged to this movie b/c i had to take my little brother to the film. Just what a 15 year old wants to do, right? Well, I ended up loving it way more than my brother! For someone growing up in the 80's and 90's, i guess watching the sandlot gave me a taste of what it must have been like to grow up in different times (and to be a boy-- probably different for them).I think that it's great when a film inspires you and makes you continue to feel special about it after many years. 10 years ago, i watched the Sandlot, then went and saw it over 10 times during the summer-- dragging various high school friends with me to see this kids movie (but they all thanked me afterwards because this is a film that speaks to everyone-- it's funny, cute, exciting-- and sheer joy to watch). Sure I sound corny, but the Sandlot-- if you saw it, you understand my thoughts and feelings!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never'd watched it 'til today. It's kinda 'Stand By Me' but baseball-centered and w/out all that melancholy 'end of era' stuff that permeates that one from '86.Here you have: disparate, recognizably normal type kids playing baseball in the early sixties in southern California, doing normal kid things. You know- bonding, fighting, being scared of the Monster Dog next door, ogling the lifeguard, insulting each other, making things up about themselves that they've never done, trying tobacco, getting sick.The Monster dog turns out to be a rather large, aggressive mastiff, the owner is a blind James Earl Jones, the McGuffin of the Ruth signed baseball the device that brings all of this together.I liked the kids-Smalls, Benny, the Twins, Nunez, Squints, Hamilton esp. I thought their reactions to each other and the world around them to be refreshingly normal. We all did these sorts of things at that age and saw other kids doing them later on. The movie is nostalgic w/out drowning you inside it-the soundtrack does toss in 'Finger Popping Time', a couple of Drifters tunes and Wipeout, but it's all kinda well timed and doesn't feel forced.You get to see Karen Allen and Denis Leary as the parents twice in the movie ala Charlie Brown's adults--which makes sense, really, this is the kids' world, not that of the folks'. I thought both were okay if somewhat under-used.It all wraps up rather entertainingly though you do need to put your mind on hold a bit during the varied Rube Goldberg attempts at getting the ball back(thing pulleys, erector sets, long sticks, vaccuum cleaners, etc) and that marathon chase thru the cinema, fair and what not.Check it out, you will like it and so will your kids. *** outta ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sandlot" is a charming kids film that over the last 15 years has gained somewhat of a cult following, making this a nostalgic joy for 25 year old's who remember seeing this at age 10 and laughing their heads off. To me, this is not a perfect family film, but unlike many movies that claim to be family films, this actually is a "FAMILY FILM". Kids like it for the relate able situations and amusing dialogue between the kids, adults will find it's very easy to get wrapped up in this, even though it is just a silly kiddie movie and anyone in between will probably enjoy this too.Scotty has just moved to a new neighborhood, and isn't accepted by the other children. Eventually, he begins playing baseball with them at the local sandlot, and several adventures come from this. The main story is Scotty losing his step dad's (Dennis Leary) signed Babe Ruth baseball in the backyard with an evil dog the kids refer to as "The Beast".This movie has some genuinely amusing scenes, and some scenes so campy, they're hilarious. One scene involves a young boys plan to make out with the attractive older girl lifeguard at the public pool, and this scene is kind of a classic, which may be seen in movies after or even before this, but it was just done so great here. Any scene involving "The Beast" is hilarious. Depending on the scene, this dog changes shape and size, and can be anything from a large dog to some kind of mutated super monster. This dog puts the shark in Jaws to shame. It's good the kids each have their own distinct personalities, and aren't entirely run on stereotypes. One small problem is the lack of any emotional conflict, which may or may not be a problem depending on your point of view. I would have liked something to tug at the audiences' heart strings, but nothing does. It's still a good movie however.Overall, this is a fun movie for all...not great, but good enough to be enjoyed by the whole family.My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. PG for language, tobacco use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scotty Smalls moves to a new neighborhood with his mom and stepdad, and wants to learn to play baseball. The neighborhood baseball guru Rodriquez takes Smalls under his wing, and soon he's part of the local baseball buddies. They fall into adventures involving baseball, treehouse sleep-ins, the desirous lifeguard at the local pool, the snooty rival ball team, and the travelling fair. Beyond the fence at the back of the sandlot menaces a legendary ball-eating dog called The Beast, and the kids inevitably must deal with him.The film isn't quite a comedy, though there are really funny moments in it (such as the evil dog that eats baseballs). And, it's not exactly a drama. It's more like an occasionally surreal slice of life film about the good old days of the late 50s-early 60s. I saw this movie at my friend's sleepover party.Rated PG for Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sandlot" (1993) is a heartfelt family film for all ages. Expertly directed by David M. Evans whose love for baseball and his own childhood nostalgia shows here, this film is just a pleasure to watch, seeing what the world looks like through a child's eyes. Told in flashback for the whole film, you get to see how a new kid's future is changed by a summer baseball team who befriends him, playing on a field called "the sandlot". The children are for the most part believable in their roles, which is hard to do since children are more difficult to direct than actors. Though the story is simple and somewhat predictable, it's this predictability that makes it fun to watch - you want what happens in the film to happen. A sporty 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. I saw it with my son when he was about two at the theater. We went back to see it again two days later. In addition, we watch this movie at least once a year. Anyone who grew up playing baseball knows a kid who matches each character in this film. It is an excellent story, clean for kids, and enjoyable for adults. The main character is named Scotty Smalls, who moves to a new neighborhood, and is not very athletic. He quickly meets the guys and receives a less than warm welcome. However, Benny the Jet Rodriguez takes Smalls under his wing, teaches him about baseball and helps Scotty overcome some of his issues. Benny tackles some of his own fears, and the sandlot gang has several crazy adventures. I recommend you go rent it today, even if you have seen it before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie when I was in Junior High.It's one of those movie that I didn't know it existed before.The Sandlot is a story taken place in the 60s where a kid just moved into small town and hasn't have much luck in fitting in with the other kids. Baseball is a big fad with the other neighborhood kids.The new kid doesn't know how to play the sport right, but with luck the leader of the group of the neighborhood kids helped him out and pretty he fit right in with the other kids.But when the new kid accidentally borrowed his step dad's autograph ball of Babe Ruth and went over the fence that holds a boxer dog. The neighborhood kids now have to find a way in getting the ball back.This movie's not too bad to watch. It has it's moments here and there. I recommend it for Ages 8 and up. Has some language and mild humor.You might want to rent it first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding "flick" and recommended to ALL. Much of the location was shot here in Utah (Ogden). Tells the true meaning for the values of friendship, loyalty, and comraderie.I can truly relate to this film. I grew up in south Florida (during the '50s) and was among a group of neighborhood ball-players who ALSO played in a vacant lot (something you seldom see in today's era). Adjacent to the lot was an old house trailer (nestled among the Palmetto trees). Outside, they kept a chained up Pit Bull named "Pedro" (feared by all). Each time we sent a ball into "the trees" NO ONE would try to recover it for fear of being eaten alive by Pedro. Over a period of time we know Pedro had amassed quite a collection.As a film for the entire family I highly recommend its viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heartwarming and enjoyable family movie about a young boy(Tom Guidry)that moves into a new town and desperately wanting to fit in with the rest of the neighborhood boys. In the summer of 1962, a bat and a ball is like life's blood. The sandlot is like a home away from home; a place for a young boy to exercise his fantasy and spend the best hours of summer. A good smack will send the ball sailing over the fence to never be seen again for it lands in Mr. Mertle's(James Earl Jones)backyard, which is guarded by a humongous dog...a super slobbering dog that devours just about anything and everything. The high drama and dilemma of the summer is trying to retrieve a Babe Ruth autographed ball from the territory of the big ass junkyard dog, Goliath. Other cast members of note: Patrick Renna, Mike Vitar, Chauncey Leopardi, Denis Leary and Karen Allen. THE SANDLOT is nostalgic, sentimental and stuffed full of innocence and humor. Worth watching again...and again.</fullReview>

An absolutely perfect movie that shows the best of America through the innocent eyes of our forgotten youth.The narration is done by the now grown-up nerdy kid that is adopted by the cool baseball playing neighborhood kids. He learns about the most important part of being a 12 year old kid, baseball and the pure joy that playing with your best friends brings.Through trial and error, they grow and mature, eventually moving on in their lives. Yet, Smalls and The Jet remain close, as Smalls, still the intellect, is a sports announcer and The Jet is the great Major League player.If you don't love this film, you have no heart and love for America and baseball.</fullReview>

It's about a geeky kid named Steve who moves into a new neighborhood. He eventually joins the local sandlot baseball team of neighborhood kids, and they become the best friends he's ever had. This movie also teaches a good lesson in friendship, too. The best parts were then they played against the bullies in baseball uniforms, the amusement park scene, and when they retreive the ball that was hit over the fence and into the hands of the feared dog known as 'The Beast'. And the scene where the kids were all being chased by the dog was a real scene stealer! I'll admit it is a guilty pleasure movie for me, but it's still a good movie anyway. It's fun for people of all ages! Whether you're 7 or 77! :)</fullReview>

I REALLY wanted to show this at our elementary school's family movie night, but after watching it to make sure it was appropriate, I decided it wasn't. Just a heads up, these kids cuss quite a bit.

		<fullReview>***POSSIBLE SPOILERS!*** Somebody on this board wondered if there has been anything else said about it that hasn't been said before. To their surprise, I can. I've actually thought of this as a dog-loving movie, as well as a baseball movie or a movie that's nostalgic for baby-boomer childhoods. The only dog-loving move that tops this one is the remake of "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" from the same year, but then again, the presence of Sassy also makes this a cat-loving movie.Tom Guiry plays "Scotty" Smalls, a somewhat nerdy kid who just moved into a suburb of Los Angeles with his mother and stepfather(Karen Allen and Denis Leary, respectively). His mother isn't so pleased with the idea of Scotty spending so much of his summertime indoors, so she sends him out into the neighborhood hoping he'll make friends. Along the way, he sees these kids playing baseball in some cheap old sandlot. They need another kid, so the leader of this gang, Benjamin Franklin "The Jet" Rodriguez invites him over. Most of the kids reject him, but not Benny.The movie show the kid's antics throughout their neighborhood, and surprisingly very few of them are baseball related. Though they do defeat a junior-high team, it's not treated as the big deal most baseball-related movies tend to be. Other antics include Squints' lust for teenage lifeguard Wendy Peffercorn, a huge mishap with chewing tobacco and carnival rides, and most importantly a local junkyard dog on the other side of the fence hyped up as a monster. This dog has a habit of stealing any ball that comes near his yard. After running out of balls, Smalls borrows his step-father's autographed Babe Ruth baseball, and you guessed it; The Beast grabs that one too. From then on, it's an endless montage of failed attempts to get the ball back, until Benny has a dream where he's visited by the ghost of Babe Ruth(Art LaFleur), who encourages him to go take the ball back himself. And once he does, you can be sure that chaos is inevitable throughout the neighborhood.When "The Beast" is finally defeated. it's a bittersweet victory, like the sinking of the Bismarck, or the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Unlike those three events, there are no casualties, unless you count the death of a local urban legend, which is further solidified when the kids finally confront the dog's owner(James Earl Jones), and explain what they've been doing.Having said all that, it's not without flaws. The flashback scenes where Squints hypes up the legend of The Beast were supposed to take place 20 years earlier, but feature cars made as late as 1966. There's also the issue of how an African-American like Mr. Mertle would've been allowed to play baseball with the greats of 30 years earlier at a time when Major League Baseball was all-white. Nitpicks like this though shouldn't keep anybody from enjoying what can now be called a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>is baseball really the great American pastime, or is it preserving the great idea of America?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of boys experience a lifetime of lessons in one average American summer. In The Sandlot, Scotty Smalls (Tom Guiry) makes friends with the neighborhood boys and they embark on juvenile adventures of camping out overnight in their clubhouse sharing s'mores and urban legends. The youths enjoy the thrill of the amusement park and the bittersweet effects of chewing tobacco. The nine strapping young men take a right of passage when they face the over exaggerated myth of a mammoth dog dubbed 'the Beast' to retrieve a baseball signed by Babe Ruth. I interpret the intent of this film to promote Americanism. In 1993, patriotism was rampant. We loved our country and this film gives us a multitude of images to tug at our red white and blue heartstrings. The only thing more American than baseball in The Sandlot is the various ethnic groups represented by this politically correct version of The Little Rascals. Although their skin colors run the range of hues, they all live the same American life in their Converse sneakers and crew cuts. In the aftermath of our invasion of the smaller, weaker nation of Kuwait, these boys' foreign and domestic relations help us redeem our souls and reclaim our image of a kinder, gentler nation. We see subtle use of commercial icons representing middle class life in the 1960s. On the counter of Scott's mother's (Karen Allen) dream kitchen, we see the Pillsbury Doughboy cookie jar and Post Sugar Crisp cereal. A perfect metaphor for the sweet, sweet life the American family experienced post World War II and powerful propaganda to recreate it Post Gulf War. Picnics and celebrations boast our American pride with fireworks and red white and blue decorations hung from every available limb, front porch awning and lamppost. We witness the young boys conquer their fear of being devoured by the massive dog Hercules to retrieve the ball signed by Babe Ruth. Is this Director David Evans' way of suggesting that Americanism, represented here by the ball signed by the Great Bambino is worth the risk of life and limb?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great baseball movie or great kid's movie: you decide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film proved to be one of the few kid-based stories which I still watch today. Films about growing up always make me misty, simply because of the moments of innocence which most seek to display. One of the funniest moments in film history is the guys using chew for the first time, then proceeding to through up on themselves and everyone else. Sure, it was a bit crass, but that's what happens when one tries chew for the first time. I especially loved the attitudes of the players, all defining themselves in some shape or fashion, modeling themselves after the common baseball player. Great fun, and the cameo performance with James Earl Jones was awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Sandlot" may just look like it's about baseball, but moreover, it's about friendship, with some nostalgia thrown in. Set in 1962, Scotty Smalls moves into a new neighborhood. Uncertain of the area at first, he becomes friends with some boys in a baseball field known as the Sandlot. Over the summer, they try to get girls, battle a rival team, and do a few things that they shouldn't have. All the while, they have to remember about a dog known as "The Beast".As someone who has never been interested in sports, I seemingly wouldn't take any stock in this movie. But I did. I admit that Karen Allen, as Scotty's mom, and Denis Leary, as her boyfriend, are the only cast members whom I recognize, but it's a really interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your only spoiler warning...This movie is all about the hyperbole of youth. What year it is doesn't matter, like Stand By Me it involves pre-Vietnam America. What is the significance of that? The notion of "innocent times?"Nonetheless, it's the exaggeration of the childhood memories that makes this movie funny. It's nothing new or clever, but it is effective when done right. In this case we have the dog, the imagined history of Mertle's junkyard, the vomit, the 4th of July baseball game, and the concluding chase all have those elements.I won't delve into the acting since it's typical early-90s child acting. This isn't MTV-style, it's Nickelodeon. There are worse "family" films than this, most are more involved with sports--whereas here baseball is just a frame--but this is useful for kids in the meantime. These sorts of kids movies are similar to action movies, just adjusting the bar for the next film. Consider why no one watches 'Free Willy' anymore, the baton has been passed.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like "Stand By Me" - without the good writing or acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a godawful piece of tripe this is. It's the worst kind of derivative junk that tries to pass itself off as cinema. It take the narrative style from "Stand By Me" and inserts it into a lame Little Rascals-esque kiddie film. The acting is lousy with the depth of emotion ranging from kids screaming to, well, kids screaming. There's an awful lot of screaming in the film...I'm sure this was supposed to be funny, but it REALLY gets on the nerves after a while. And while I'm at it....What is blue blazes was an excellent actor like James Earl Jones doing in this movie? You're supposed to believe that this man was a baseball player who played with Babe Ruth. But of course, there's the problem of the fact that the league wasn't integrated at that point. Maybe they made Jones' character blind so he wouldn't have to look at nauseatingly trite dialogue...I know I was wishing for a fastball to come knock out my lights so I wouldn't have to sit through the rest of this. My 8 year old nephew was bored by this movie. "Stinks on ice" was his succinct review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice bit of feel-good nostalgia, until the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this, I really got caught up in the story and characters. I was laughing and cheering all the way up until a scene near the end, at which point, I wanted to scream at the screen. I really hate it when a director expects the audience to swallow something so blatantly inaccurate, just because they're riding a nice and warm emotional wave. I'm talking about the James Earl Jones character, and his story (and photo) of playing in the majors with Babe Ruth. Unless he had been an Hispanic player originally from a Latin American country (and even that would have been a big if), it would have been IMPOSSIBLE!! The fact that just one prior review even mentioned this shows just how easily manipulated the typical movie goer is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great, if you are the intended audience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will probably enjoy 'The Sandlot' if you are a young boy (or older boy) who has been interested in baseball at some point in his life. That does not mean that girls cannot enjoy this film, but it is a film that seems to be made for the male gender, particularly younger men and ones that still connect with their inner child.This film is about a group of boys who come together and play baseball. It is a comedy as much as it is a film about baseball, with conflict taking part in the mystery surrounding the house with the angry beast. The film is mainly told through the story of one of the new boys whose parents are divorced and who is having an awkward relationship with the stepfather.Baseball, girls, comedy, and mystery all endure in this tale. Great if you like this sort of film and are part of the intended audience, but it is not a great film if you're on the outside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But is it a good movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey, I played little league baseball too, and I played catch endlessly with my best friend. But memories of little league notwithstanding, this simply is not a good film. It's obvious, and cliche, and stretches belief beyond the breaking point. If you want to see a reminiscence-type film well done, rent Bronx Tale sometime. Even the television-based Wonder Years was better, on probably 1/10 the budget. Go play catch with your kids and leave this on the shelf, guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler!! I viewed this movie on the enthusiastic recommendations from friends.Based on that and the great comments on IMDB, I guess I don't get it. My wife and I both thought this was possibly one of the worst movies we have ever seen. The boys acting was wooden and terrible. The story was ridiculous. Maybe if you were 6 or 7 years old it might be believable, but any adult should find this movie barely watchable.The main character can't throw a baseball to save his life, until his new friend tells him to throw it like when he delivered newspapers, then he throws like a pro. COME ON! The ragtag group easily defeats an organized little league team? HUH? Babe Ruth appears in the friends dream, but looks like and talks like George Burns? Wasn't Joe Don Baker available? Then the white junkyard owner turns out to be James Earl Jones. And just happens to have a baseball signed by all the Yankees. What a pile of garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movies starts out great about a kid's memories of childhood centering around a pickup baseball team of which he was a part.Unfortunately, it descends into a rather stupid movie about boys trying to get a baseball from Cujo.The first movie is working great, I'm laughing, having a great time...and then they switch to the second movie.No more laughs, no more fond rememberences of childhood, just stupidity.I gave it a 7/10 however because the first half of the movie is wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember a while back when I was a kid and this movie came out and I have to say I would watch it once a week and I loved it. A couple weeks ago, I saw it on t.v. and thought it was incredibly boring. Parts were cute, like when the dorky kid pretended to drown so he could kiss the girl, but other than that I was disappointed. I guess some movies are just for kids.Rating when I was 5- 10/10 Rating now- 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is renowned amongst my group of movie going friends as the worst movie we have ever seen. It is regularly joked about, the mere mention of the title prevokes guffaws of laughter.It has become the standard against which all other incredibly bad movies are scored.The friend that selected this one has had, from the night we saw the movie, the reputation of being the worst selector of movies.Try as we may, we have yet to find a movie as bad as this one.Don't do it to yourself, unless you want to see a true 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How on earth is this a good family movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sandlot" is a movie about a new kid in town named Scotty who tries to fit in with a group of misfits by learning the game of baseball and playing it with them. At first he sticks out like a sore thumb, but as he begins to develop a knack for the game, he fits right in. Together the group and Scotty enjoy great games of baseball and wonderful misadventures in their small town. Sure, it sounds like a harmless family comedy, but there was nothing funny about it at all, and I sure wouldn't want to put my family through the torture of watching this painfully unfunny movie.There was very little to like in this movie. First of all, "The Sandlot" isn't quite the brightest idea in the first place. It's just a bunch of kids playing baseball and getting into trouble. How could that be funny? How could that even be a movie worth watching? I know that when the idea first comes to mind it sounds brilliant, but simply toying with it one realizes that it has no entertainment value at all. Second of all, the actors who portrayed the kids had no experience (and in some cases no talent) with acting whatsoever. I understand that maybe there were not a lot of great child actors back in 1993, but the characters and the actors who played them were trying too hard to portray themselves as dim-witted and silly but strangely likable, and as a result they come off as just plain dumb and unlikeable. James Earl Jones was the only person who did a good job in this movie, but he loses credibility for being in such a disastrous film in the first place. The third thing that makes this such a bad movie was the poorness of the script. All of the jokes fell so flat on their faces that thinking about them now makes me wonder if they were intended to be funny in the first place."The Sandlot" could have been somewhat likable if the script wasn't poorly written and filled with dumb jokes about vomiting on fair rides and rival baseball teams throwing worthless insults at each other, but yet for some strange reason the director and writer went against logic and made the movie as unwatchable as possible.Some of the baseball scenes weren't dreadful, but they were not exactly enjoyable either. It was almost like watching a little league game at times. But, it was a pointless, kind of annoying little league game, with irritating players who weren't as good as they could be. This movie is like taking such excellent family movies as "Field of Dreams" and "Finding Nemo" and combining them in a blender with such boring and unfunny films as "The Scout" and the movie adaptation of "The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy", and in the end it all adds up to one huge headache of a family movie. I highly recommend avoiding "The Sandlot", for it is a terrible family film and a bad movie altogether. If you feel the need to view this anyway, just be warned that not even the slightly watchable baseball games and the brief appearance by James Earl Jones can save this horrid film from being one of the worst family movies ever made. 2 stars out of 10 is all I can give this appalling film, and yet somehow I feel I'm being extremely generous.</fullReview>
