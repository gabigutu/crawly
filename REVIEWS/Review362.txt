		<shortDescription>Just don't take it seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, there are a lot of bad votes for this movie here. I thought it was great. It's a Will Smith / Barry Sonnenfeld movie. You can't take it seriously. The humor is perfectly subtle and dry at times, and over the top at others. The storyline is only there to give opportunities for the jokes.If you want a serious western, try The Magnificent Seven (or the original, 7 Samurai), Hombre, or some other classic. If you want a light-hearted evening, rent this. Probably don't buy it, but rent it.For some reason it says that my review has to be more than 10 lines, so I'm throwing this in to make it work. Really a review for a movie like this doesn't need to be this long, but I guess I'll just comply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame bloated blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Wild Wild West' joins an increasingly long list of big bloated blockbusters, movies made for no possible reason beyond grabbing a quick summer buck yet which, ironically, by their very cynical and slapdash nature, utterly fail to connect with even the least demanding of audiences. The result is a multi-multi-million dollar debacle that leaves studios searching for answers and audiences shell-shocked into seeking out their entertainment along the more audacious pathway of off-Hollywood, independent filmmaking ? the single positive outcome of these dull, empty enterprises.`Wild Wild West,' like so many films before it, looks to the relics of television's bygone era for inspiration ? as sad a comment as any on the dismal state of current movie creativity. As one not familiar with the original series, I cannot say what justice, or lack of justice, this homage does to its source. What is evident, judging from the results on screen, is that `Wild Wild West' is, as with most current blockbusters, top-heavy with special effects and as weak in the nether limbs as its legless villain. Straight Westerns being hopelessly out of fashion, especially for a special effects-driven summertime extravaganza, the filmmakers obviously felt that what was needed was a tongue-in-cheek approach to the material, resulting in a bizarre, but completely unfunny amalgam of fantasy and science-fiction gilded onto a Western format. The disparate styles simply fight against each other, leaving no one in the audience - neither Western nor science-fiction fans - satisfied.The alleged plot involves the attempts by James West (Will Smith) and Artemis Gordon (Kevin Kline) to foil an evil Confederate inventor's plan to kidnap all the world's most brilliant scientists and, ultimately, terrorize the Union and President Grant into submission. This he attempts to do by creating a giant mechanized spider which is, obviously, a last ditch, desperate attempt on the part of the filmmakers to fulfill the seemingly insatiable demands of the modern audience to be dazzled by impressive special effects, no matter how inappropriate they appear in context. Here, though, the miscalculation is fatal because even the audience is wise enough to know when it is being had. Kline and Smith never achieve a palpable rapport despite the usual abundance of lame wise cracks and sarcastic asides designed to make them `hip' and `trendy' ? two qualities incongruous to the setting, which again shows the lack of real commitment to the spirit of the project. There is exactly one clever moment in the film ? an astonishingly creative homage to the old RCA logo ? that hints at what might have been had the moviemakers been willing to really let loose their anarchic imaginations and aimed for something truly sophisticated rather than simply pasting together a series of confused, poorly written blackout sketches.Incidentally, even some of the expensive special effects come across as surprisingly crude, especially many of the shots utilizing rear-screen projection. Hence, this film strikes out even in the one ballpark in which it might have stood a chance of emerging victorious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just isn't good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's that time of year. The time when Hollywood trots out it's worst of the summer. You know the drill. There's a "Godzilla" every year, somebody has to be it. "Wild Wild West" clenches the title hands down this summer, and we still have eight weeks to go!The Will Smith phenomenon has now entered it's third phase: overwhelming ego project. Teaming with his "Men In Black" director Barry Sonnenfeld, Smith has finally teetered over the edge and released an outright mess. A film that will hang in the halls of all time bad event flicks. Should we blame Smith? I think so. "Men In Black" and "Independence Day" were gigantic hits, they even call the 4th of July "Big Willie Weekend" due to these successes. I submit that these films were hits due to the films themselves, the writing, acting, directing, and not just because of Smith. "West" is finally the film that rests on Smith's comedic shoulders alone. The truth shines through clearly. Not everything Will Smith does is funny.Based in the television show running from 1965-1970, the simple plot tells the tale of a Civil War era federal marshal James West (Smith), who must team up with a weapons expert (Kevin Kline, at his most painfully unfunny) to thwart the evil plans of the villain, and legless, Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Along for the ride is a giant mechanical tarantula, President Grant, and the stunning, gorgeous, lovely, and just plain old hot Salma Hayek. The plot is just a simple excuse to push the characters through endless scenes that give birth to no laughs at all. Scenes that make the audience gringe with fear, as if something wrong is with them. Fear not my good people, these are professionals up on screen, and they blew it.The screenplay, credited to FOUR writers, has the damnedest time to make any of the jokes funny. You would not believe just how far the cast goes to make this limp material work. It's embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing for the actors. There is not one funny moment in the film, not even a courtesy laugh for the attempt. Dead silence. I also disapprove of the attempt to squeeze racial jokes into the mix. Yes, Will Smith is African-American, but do we need to call attention to it every five minutes? The movie would've been better served had it left the race issue alone and just played up the potential fun of the concept.Will Smith is simply miscast as the hero. He's an amiable actor who's proven himself with stronger material. This film clearly shows just how paper thin the Smith charm can be. While Kevin Kline tries but fails as well, it's really Hayek's role that's a mystery. She's barely in the film, and when her character is explained, you come to realize that she's not apart of the story at all. Hayek has always been a fun performer with winning personality. All this movie asks of her is to be the butt (literally) of a few jokes and keep the cleavage coming. A shameful waste of talent.Director Sonnenfeld has also been at the helm of better pictures ("Get Shorty"), but for some reason I have yet to see a truly great film directed by him. There always seems to be a spark missing from the action, like a better, funnier film was in there somewhere but he can't find it. Relying in great amounts on special effects and the considerable use of easy-to-spot green screen shots, the typical Sonnenfeld camera work is either buried under all the mayhem or just not inventive when the attempt is actually made. This is a very top-heavy production with little chance to breathe. But Sonnenfeld made this choice, he must be held accountable for it.The movie has been through many edits, and this shows with wildly out of tune continuity and many unexplained plot twists. Also grating on the brain is Elmer Bernstein's annoying and featherweight musical score. While we have Warner Brothers shamefully trotting out it's "We pray it's as big as the 'Men In Black'" Will Smith rap tune, Bernstein provides a flat score that serves no purpose to enliven the film. The cinematography is also without color, and the catering probably sucked too."Wild Wild West" is the product of zero imagination. A lifeless summer film that seems to stick out even more in this unusually good movie season. I am always wary of comic westerns, and this film seals that envelope. If this is what 160 million buys you? I'll take the 3 million "South Park" any day.------------ 0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't the people making these movies LIKE the original shows?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't add more insults -- others here have done that well enough. This movie is godawful. But I will point out two areas that seem to be staples of bad movie remakes of beloved old TV shows. First, how about getting someone to write/direct that actually liked and understood the original? That person would understand that the West-Gordon relationship was the core. In a sense, West and Gordon complimented each other to make a slick, functional crime-fighting machine: West handled the action and romance, and Gordon took care of the thinking, deception, and humor (disguises). This was a well-used TV convention -- think the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad in Star Trek, or the great contrasty chemistry between Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in I Spy. Add a lovable villain to the mix (not an offensive atrocity like the film-Loveless) and you've got a crazy, tongue-in-cheek action classic. The filmmakers here seemingly did not know or care about the fundamentals of the original show. Not that this is necessarily a problem, but then why bother resurrecting the premise in the first place? Why not just make Will Smith a different wild west troubleshooter? The Mission Impossible franchise has the same problem.Second, why all the emphasis on showing the principals getting to know each other? I know -- because it eats up 30% of the script, and creates conflict. But the conflict should be between West and the villain. Jim and Artie should just BE. The TV show didn't bother explaining how West met and knew Gordon, any more than Barney Miller, Mission Impossible, or 24 found it necessary to have all the main characters meet and learn to work together. They were a team with a job to do. Audiences understand this concept; having a trumped-up plot about how the heroes meet and overcome their differences is a hackneyed device that only exposes the script weaknesses present. See the film version of Dragnet (a better film, though) for another example of this unfortunate trend.Finally, a comment on the "race" issue. Inserting content that justifies Smith-West's skin color is no more necessary than explaining Henry V's skin color when Laurence Fishburne or Andre Braugher play him on stage. Indeed, ignoring Smith's race in a movie like this one would help us all look past such issues. If a blond actor had portrayed West, nobody would have suggested a plot that explains his Norwegian background! He just would have been West, and that would be that. But color-blind casting requires courage, and could conceivably cut into the film's bottom line. So, not in this spineless script.I seldom get mad at movies I don't like. Even The Avengers didn't anger me, though it was possibly even worse than this one. This one ticked me off REAL good. Buy the original series on DVD instead, and see how it's done right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets take a cult classic and make as stupid idiotic movie as you could possibly make and cast it with actors COMPLETELY unsuited for the parts. Kevin Kline, Will Smith, and Kenneth Branaugh should all shoot their agents. Sure they probably picked up a nice paycheck for this crap but can you ever live down being associated with such a "Wanker" project? For a television series the Wild Wild West was well done for its time and had a lot of interesting plots and characters. What possessed the creators of this movie vomit to trash the Wild Wild West. Hopefully someone will come along and make a serious movie on the television series. Sad to see these SCUM come along and try to make a cheap buck on the creative efforts of others and destroying their original vision. I always wondered how Robert Conrad could go alone with this junk. Then I read that he didn't. He picked up the Razzie Awards as a protest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a sad waste...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 60s, The Wild, Wild West, staring Robert Conrad and Russ Martin was one of the best shows of it's time, a interesting mixture of Science Fiction, Fantasy, Gadget Spy films, and light hearted satire. A favorite of mine, I've long enjoyed the show. So naturally, I was looking forward to the big screen adaption, even though it did star Will Smith (Sorry, Will, but you're no Robert Conrad.)The movie had all the ingredients needed to make a good film: An excellent cast (Kevin Klein, Ken Branaugh, Selma Hayek, even Smith,) an excellent, proven director in Barry Sonnefeld, and a proven genre... Rather, it had all the ingredients that it needed except one... It had the worst script possible. I've always been wary of any project that was written by committee, and this film is one project that proves why. The excellent cast, crew, and effects of this film were wasted on one of the worst screenplays I've ever seen. The clever (if pulp inspired) stories of the original series are replaced by tepid attempts at comedy which even Smith, who normally is very funny, can't pull off. Kenneth Branaugh succeeds at nothing other than managing to eat the scenery, unable to do anything else, since his lines are so bad. Klein is saddled with the role of Smith's straight man, something that he's just too damn funny to be. As for the effects, like I said, they were spectacular, but the problem is that they seem to be the 'be all and end all' of the movie, instead of working for the story (such as there was in this case.) The simple fact is that they overpower the film.I guess, if you are a die hard Will Smith fan who has never seen the original series, you might like this one. But for fans of the old series, avoid it, and watch reruns, or else one of the two other shows in the genre, 'Legend' or 'The Adventures of Brisco County Junior.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Been Titled "Wild Wild WORST"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go to see a Will Smith movie, you expect it to be entertaining and fast-paced. A movie with Kevin Kline might have your expectations leaning more in the direction of cerebral, tight-knit &amp; solid entertainment. If Salma Hayek is in it, well ....at least you expect a flick with visual appeal ...1, 2, 3 STRIKES...Wild Wild West STRIKES OUT! TALK ABOUT DROPPING THE BALL! Will Smith, whose laid-back, street-wise- cracking veneer, usually hides a well-focused on screen intensity that is both impossible to miss or dislike...seemed to be sauntering through the film, feeling embarrassingly like a walking anachronism, considering the "Old West" backdrop! Kevin Kline, on the other hand, who usually brings a certain air of bravura to his oft-times eccentric characterizations, seemed to display a marked inability to take himself seriously when in drag, (Which, unfortunately, is during a good chunk of the film) lapsing into a pathetic sort self-parody, which, considering the script, may have been the only way he could stomach the role! Salma Hayek, for whom no one is exactly holding their breath for her to win an Oscar as Best Actress, seemed OBSESSED with getting her lines out with as little accent as possible...Despite the fact that she was clearly cast as Mexican in this film...(As opposed to her bit part in The FACULTY!) You could almost imagine "La Mejicanita" standing there, during shooting, with her Accent/Dialogue Coach, just out of camera range! Salma...concentrate MORE on your ACTING, next time, O.K.? As far as Barry Sonnenfled's Directing is concerned...well, here we could imagine him running around frantically, till the last minute, editing and re-editing, trying to decide exactly what it is he was trying to do with "WILD"....and of course, not even coming CLOSE to getting it right! The ONLY reason I rated the movie 3 Stars (as opposed to 0 Stars!) is because of the scope &amp; the novelty of the Special Effects. The idea of seeing all those well orchestrated, and at times visually stunning effects against an Old West backdrop was the only refreshing and original element in the film ...If you are not a die-hard Special Effects buff, I can think of absolutely no reason on earth why you would find anything at all worth seeing in this pathetic excuse for a Blockbuster film! 3*STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA????? Any comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa?ol, are most welcome!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buried in this god-awful disaster of a movie is a germ of an inkling of an iota of a great idea. It is not the idea of making a big blockbuster out of the great old 1960s TV show "The Wild Wild West," an idea which can, at best, be described as tiresomely uninspired. Nor is there brilliance in transforming the image of the lead character just so that they could build the role around star-of-the-moment Will Smith. But out of that horribly perverse example of Hollywood commercial packaging there is an intriguing premise, which naturally seems to have slipped past all involved without a second glance. What if the best, brightest and most intrepid government agent working in post-Civil War America was, indeed, a black man? Realistically, how would an African-American, functioning in a repressive, racist society, where even the most liberal thinker would see him as a second-class citizen, indeed, a second class human being, be able to not only outsmart the bad guys, but to impress even the skeptical good guys? It is an intriguing idea because, on the one hand, such an agent would not be suspected of being a threat and, on the other hand, he would have to overcome so many more barriers than a white man would ever face. He would be both invisible and yet stand out like the proverbial sore thumb just about anywhere he went. He'd be constantly fighting two battles. Such a film could be thrilling and funny, yet something rare: original."The Wild Wild West" TV show itself was all those things: it was highly derivative of both the traditional western and the then-fresh James Bond-style spy movie -- with more than a little bit of Batman-style comic book campiness kicked in -- yet it was ingenious in the way it melded those mythic genres into a one-of-a-kind series. There was never anything quite like "The Wild Wild West" and never anything since -- including this disastrous 1997 movie.Everything about WILD WILD WEST, the movie, is just plain bad: tacky special effects; clumsy direction; an embarrassing screenplay; plus a fine, bewildered cast wasted in totally unworkable roles. But as bad as everything else is, the base rot of WWW goes directly to its reworked premise. No matter how open minded one might be, or how much one prides oneself on being socially color blind, there is just no way to honestly accept replacing Robert Conrad, TV's James West, with Will Smith. The time and the place dictate that James West be a white male -- unless, the filmmakers acknowledge and embrace the incongruity and use it for a real purpose.Yet, the filmmakers want it both ways: the audience is expected to be able to ignore Smith's skin color, while at the same time the entire plot is based on his confrontation with a white racist trying to reestablish Confederate power and seize control of the U.S. government. How can you respect or believe in a film or filmmakers that get all preachy about the evils of racism while all along dealing with the issue with absolutely no respect for historical honesty? It is not clear if having Smith play James West as a cocky, street smart, John Shaft-style character was intended to be a joke, social commentary or just absurd politically correct pandering to black audiences, but it is clear that it does not work. The most outrageously unbelievable thing about WILD WILD WEST is not the wildly improbable sci-fi inventions but that the Smith character actually makes it to the end of the film without being lynched. It's not that the anachronism of a cocksure 20th century black man confronting 19th century bigotry isn't workable, because that very time-warp racial comedy had already been done with much greater success in the Mel Brooks classic, BLAZING SADDLES. Unlike WWW, Brooks and company realized the sheer idiocy of the premise, yet used that to mock both the black and the white stereotypes with equal glee.Where BLAZING SADDLES is an honest farce, WILD WILD WEST is dishonest and cowardly. All involved probably thought they were being pretty daring by flaunting convention and hiring Smith, but they did not hire Will Smith the African American, they hired Will Smith the action hero movie star. They built WILD WILD WEST around Smith's race, but only to exploit his contemporary Hollywood image, even to the point of letting him create and perform a totally inappropriate (and totally bad) rap song at the end. You can sense the film exploiting both Smith's star image and his race, while not wishing to risk challenging either. The film tries to reinvent "The Wild Wild West" TV show, but the changes are literally skin deep. To really explore and compare racism in America by blending the attitudes of two different American centuries would have been too wild wild of an idea for these timid timid filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood screws up another classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood ruined another great story by casting the horrible one-trick pony known as Will Smith to play James West. Smith is terrible in EVERYTHING he does but in WWW he was unusually terrible. The improbability starts with Smith (Black) in the 1860's as a suave (ugh), Hip (Gag) Secret Service Agent. Now this was so out of place as to be just plain STUPID!! Knenneth Branagh on the other hand was fabulous. Kevin Kline was O.K. and Selma Hayak should've done what she does best- taken off her clothes!! The special effects were kind of cool but the story line sucked and to top it all off the ever-shiteous Fresh Prince had to rap at the closing credits. There will never be a WWW II because it was so lousy. Remember in "Jersey Girl" when Ben Affleck's character torpedoed his career when he said Will Smith sucked and he would never be heard of again? OH how I wish that in this case art imitated life and Will Smith was a bad memory. Oh I forget; Will Smith is a bad memory every year in about 4 lousy, stinking' rotten movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1 out of 10Wow. I'd heard so many awful things about this movie. One ugly remark came rolling after another until the point that it'd pretty much taken its toll on me and I was sure I'd end up liking the movie just on the pure basis of the belief that it couldn't be that bad. It is that bad, and deserves every bit of the harsh criticism poured upon it. Wild Wild West is easily tied for the worst summer blockbuster I've seen in, well, possibly forever (the other one would be Tomb Raider). But at least it's still a smidgen better than Patch Adams.What's the story? Will Smith and Kevin Kline (who have zero comic chemistry)(actually more like somewhere in the negatives, since they actually suck the fun out of the action) are secret service agents in the 1870's, trying to protect Ulysses S. Grant from a madman named Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh, embarrassing himself to colossal extents). What we get is one of the most awfully unfunny movies in existence. As a matter of fact, what kept in my seat was wondering if the jokes could possibly get worse. And yes, they do. On a morbid level, there's some fascination to be had with what director Barry Sonnenfeld believes is good humor. The action's too sparse to ever be thrilling, the editing is incompetent (anybody else wonder how that one "indestructible" henchman suddenly met his demise at the end?), and the special effects MIGHT satisfy little kids. If you actually watch this movie in a crowd, it's the kind that induces blushes on whoever suggested watching this movie in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great FX, sets and costumes can't save this movie. It took six story and screenplay people to make this big a mess, and I hope that it creeps into the cinematic obscurity it deserves. A great cast is wasted - Wil Smith plays James West as a lucky bungler, Kevin Kline looks embarrassed to be there, Salma Hayak is there primarily so we can see her ass; the only person who seems to enjoy himself is Kenneth Branagh, who's given the opportunity to chew all the scenery he wants. His beard is probably the best effect in the movie. There's supposed to be burning sexual tension between Salma and the two leads, but there is absolutely none.The problem is the meandering and confusing script that completely shuts down several times, and gives us some REALLY embarrassing moments (the "touch my breast" scene, poor Wil Smith in drag, the endless "wandering in the desert" sequence) and in the end goes nowhere. The direction is terrible, too; there isn't an ounce of chemistry between the characters, and I found myself rooting for Dr. Loveless.What a mess. It's 1999's "Godzilla."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be clear. I think Will Smith is a great actor, in both comedies (Men In Black) and serious movies (Enemy Of The State). And Kevin Kline isn't a slouch either. So how on earth did these two get tangled up in this half-baked pastiche? Fire your agents, guys. From the opening seconds, your stomach sinks as you realize that no cliche will go unused by the hacks who cobbled together this numbing exercise in banality. The plot summary alone is enough to make you squirm, but it was a record-breaking hot day in NJ, so I went anyway. If you waste your money, too, be prepared to watch one disconnected scene after another, a spectrum of improbable (and unfunny) gadgetry, and some rather nasty zero-humor scenes. How the clods who wrote this thought we'd find massacres and lynchings humor fodder, I don't know. This movie is the pits, and I wish it would bomb. But it won't. Trouble is, US viewers are so numbed by marketing hoopla, they'd go and see a three-legged cockroach race if they were told there was a product tie-in and a name star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I generally avoid paying full price for first-run movie tickets because of this sort of drivel. Unfortunately, I let some friends talk me into making an exception, and I actually sat through this clunker. It was a hot July day, and the theater was well air-conditioned, which is all that prevented this experience from being a total waste of money.An awful lot of acting talent was just thrown away in this movie. Will Smith can actually act, at least a little - see "Six Degrees Of Separation" for an example - but here he just plays "The Fresh Prince Wears A Cowboy Hat," which is probably all that's expected of him these days. Kevin Kline can be wonderfully goofy - see "A Fish Called Wanda" - or, if the script is bad enough, he can be the boring, two-dimensional caricature he is in this movie. Salma Hayek was great in "Fools Rush In," but in this movie, her big scene is showing the camera her naked butt. I'm not making this up. Why did she even agree to be a part of this train wreck? Strangely enough, Kenneth Branagh is in this movie (slumming I guess), filling his evil nemesis role out as well as can be expected - easily the best of a bunch of pretty weak performances. M Emmet Walsh plays a part so tiny that an extra could have done it.This is a standard Hollywood mismatched-cop-partners/action movie at heart, but it can't even fill out that tired old formula worth a darn. The plots in movies of this kind are rarely worth discussing - rest assured that this one lives up to that standard, at least. The formula seems like it must be easy to get right - beat up a bad guy, make a smart remark, beat up another bad guy, etc, ad infinitum. But the fights should be exciting, and the one-liners should be funny. They aren't. It was painful to see a full theater unanimously refuse to even snicker at a jokes that the movie makers obviously thought would get belly laughs. According to the formula, the mismatched cop partners should eventually take a believable shine to each other, but these characters lack enough depth to have any chemistry at all.My friends and I all enjoyed other movies of this sort when done properly (Lethal Weapon) and other Will Smith movies (The Fresh Prince Saves The Planet - uh, I mean Men In Black). Yet we all agreed that this stunk. I want my money back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much hype for an empty, unfunny movie where expensive SFX's try to imitate the likes of ''Independence Day'' and ''MIB'' to woo unsuspecting viewers like me in theaters. Kevin Kline and Salma Hayek are so bad and Will Smith is so lost in that movie and tries to be funny with his trademark humor. Didn't work buddy!!!! I just hope this movie gets a bad word to mouth and that it goes down in flame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must have looked great on paper: a special effects-laden Will Smith 4th of July blockbuster based on a (by me anyway) fondly remembered 60s action TV show. Too bad they forgot to get a workable script before they started filming. Nothing works in this movie, nothing. What they ended up with was "Blazing Saddles" meets "Buck Rogers." This movie contains some of the most painful-to-watch racial/cripple jokes ever filmed. "South Park" seemed culturally enlightened and politically correct by comparison. And at the end Salma Hayek's character suddenly reveals that the missing scientist was not her father but her husband. What was up with that? Was that tacked on so she didn't have to choose between the black guy or the white guy? For that matter everything in this movie felt tacked on. But it's not trashy-bad enough to be entertaining either, just boring, unfunny, and crude. Total waste of time. * out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Was A Mistake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie was a mistake. Will Smith was miscast as the lead. Kenneth Branaugh gave an over the top performance. The rest of the cast performed adequately. However, overall the production was overdone. There were a few amusing moments and amazingly, the film made over $199 million dollars worldwide.I wondered why some of the users made such scathing comments about the lead, Will Smith. It seems that the protestations were overly vehement and even offensive. I find too often this is the typical response to TV comedians making the transition to film. I think TV comedians get a bad rap when making the transition to film. Anyway, although I agree that the film is lacking in many respects, there is no need to bash the lead, namely Will Smith, who has proven that he is growing as an actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1999's biggest flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's really too bad that Will Smith, given the chance to head a respectable cast in a comedy, does nothing more than prove he's unable to hold up a movie by himself. But I'll give him credit: the script is awful, the storyline is vague and only partially explained, and the characters have no distinction whatsoever. He's definitely the high point in this otherwise dead-in-the-water summer spectacle. He's not given much to work with, though, and his song in the film just makes me cringe. I actually feel embarrassed at how badly this guy has sold out.  The Good: Salma Hayek looks yummy and bares her bum. There's also a scene with magnetic collars of some sort that was mildly amusing. The Bad: The dialogue, the "action", just about everything else... The Ugly: Count the green screen shots...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So much potential and ALL of it wasted!We have:1) A good director, Barry Sonnenfeld, with two great comedies to his name ("The Addams Family" and "Addams Family Values");2) An Oscar-winning actor, Kevin Kline, well-known for his comedic work ("A Fish Called Wanda", "Soapdish") as well as dramatic ("Sophie's Choice", "The Ice Storm");3) Another Oscar nominee, Kenneth Branagh ("Hamlet", "Henry V"), famous for directing, as well as writing and actingAND THIS IS THE BEST THEY COULD DO !?!?!?! What gives?First and foremost, it should be noted that just because Will Smith is popular, that doesn't mean he's good. There's something about him when he acts that makes him appear as more of a "ham" than an actor, a scene-stealer who's insecure with being the star of a film so he overacts to conceal (albeit unsuccessfully) the limitations of his acting abilities.And for Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh to play second fiddle to HIM? Absolutely criminal. What's next? Jack Nicholson playing a supporting role to Pauly Shore?Then there's the storyline - are we really supposed to believe that James West (as played by Smith, a black man) is a hero of the Civil War? Of course, the casting of Smith serves primarily as a set-up for all the racial humor (which gets old fast). Logically, though, it's an asinine premise, a fact which audiences obviously picked up on given the tepid reaction to Smith's so-called "star power" in this weak take-off on a really good television series.Who's responsible for this mess? Maybe it's the fault of all the writers (a total of 6) for writing it, or Sonnenfeld's mess for directing it, or Jon Peters' (and Sonnenfeld's) mess for producing it, or Warner Bros.' mess for distributing it? Whose ever it is, it should just be shelved and forgotten as an embarrassing mistake.</fullReview>

I work at my local cinema and viewed it after finishing a shift, and I wish I'd just gone home instead.The actors in it all deserve better scripts and more in-depth characters. Although there are a few comic moments, and the special effects (which aren't particularly that good), it is not enough to make the film watchable.

		<fullReview>There have been remakes of really good movies or series that either are a viable continuation of a good thing or are good in their own right. This, however, is neither. This film is a slap in the face of anyone who goes to see it on account of its association with the Wild, Wild West series from the sixties.I'm not anti-Will Smith. On the contrary, I really enjoyed both MIB and ID4; but the guy is entirely out of place here. The jokes are lame, the one-liners sick. Even the effects and plot are not what you would expect. There is no chemistry between the characters.As this movie neither picks up well on anything the series had, nor has any real charisma of its own it leaves you wondering how anyone could have the gall to use Jim West's name for such a plain pain.If you haven't seen this film yet, try to keep it that way... Try to catch a rerun of the series instead - you'll be happier.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the original TV show, I was really rooting for "Wild Wild West" to succeed. Imagine my disappointment then, when it turned out to be a complete failure, a dud of a movie, a huge disaster; in a word, it just plane sucked. There were so many mistakes and errors made by the so-called "filmmakers" that I'm not even sure where to start. First, casting Will Smith. Unless your willing to completely disregard the history of the late nineteenth century and make race a complete non-factor (which is not what the writers chose to do) there is no way to sell a black James West. Hell, the giant mechanical spider was more realistic than a black army officer in the post Civil War army. Don't get me wrong, I love Will Smith, but because he is black this role was just not right for him. Second, the writing. Four people are credited with the screenplay, and God only knows how many others "polished" the script along the way. Yet, with all this talent involved, the end result is hideous. It reminds me of the old maxim that a thousand monkeys randomly typing on typewriters would produce Shakespeare sooner or later; well in this case, they had a lot of writers carefully and selectively typing on typewriters, and they didn't get within a parsec of Shakespeare. The story and characters were all wrong (they needed to look at the original show, which got it right), the dialogue is truly pathetic (I got real sick of West and Gordon saying "We have to save OUR president" "That monster is after OUR president") and NONE of the jokes work. The absolute lowest point was when the writers tried to milk humor from a lynching; perhaps in their next effort, the writers will find the humor in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, or the killing fields of Bosnia. The musical score was also a complete failure; it was flat, unimaginative, boring and unengaging. The music should have been building suspense, providing a rousing theme, etc. Except, about all it provided was a headache and all it roused was my ire. "Wild Wild West" is the posterchild for the hallow, overhyped Hollywood movie that is supposed to be a guaranteed blockbuster (see also "Judge Dredd" and "The Avengers"), and it truly deserves the heaps of scorn and criticism which have been dumped on it. I can only pray that Smith's next project can restore his now tarnished reputation, and that Barry Sonnenfeld never makes another movie again as long as he lives.</fullReview>

Kenneth Branaugh, one of the finest modern Shakespearean actors around, should be disgusted with himself and his character. The effects from "visual marvels" (ha-ha) such as "Jason and the Argonauts" and "Clash of the Titans" were far superior to this film's big Spider Machine. The plot holes riddled the movie like a Gatling Gun. And during a time when Cultural Sensitivity is such a huge buzzword in the entertainment industry, attempts at humor using the words "Black," "Coon," "Slave," "Boy," and the "N-word" are just shameful. I left the theater feeling sorry for Kevin Kline and Will Smith, for associating themselves with such garbage. To all of you out there--see this movie at your own peril!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West the movie is an insult to the memory of the 1960's TV show "The Wild Wild West". To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. Why make changes to the original formular? James West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (the legendary Ross Martin) played Secret Service agents in the 1870's who took their orders from President U.S. Grant. In the plot lines, they worked cases connected to the real jurisdiction of the Secret Service in the last century, like protection of the President and investigating crimes against the government (remember, those who the days before the FBI and the CIA). The anachronistic gadgets and dialog made the show unforgettable.The movie, however, is terrible. How can you cast an African-American (Will Smith) as a government agent in the 1870's? Very hip and cool for the 1990's, but really stupid for a movie set in the 1870's. And how about a cross-dressing agent (Kevin Kleine), again hip and cool for today, but really, really stupid for the 1870's.I hope this movie crashes and burns at the box office and the producers lose a bundle! Maybe then they'll realize that social engineering the cast and their rap music sound track will not be accepted by the movie going public who remember the original TV show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astoundingly bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God, was this a bad film. Bad plot, awful writing, horrible supporting acting. This film brings the word "bad" to stupefyingly new levels of badness.Maybe it wasn't that bad, but Lord, it wasn't good. Plot devices are arbitrarily devised, and then discarded when inconvenient. Supposedly smart characters act stupidly. The conflict between the Kline and Smith characters feels totally contrived and needless. Most damning of all, this movie tries to be something of a comedy, but takes itself far too seriously to pull it off.To put it another way, a decent concept with much potential, but irrevocably ruined by the worst writing I can remember witnessing. Even Salma Hayek's buttock shot fails to move this movie to even a mediocre level. Stay away. If you really want to waste 7 bucks, go buy lottery tickets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wild Wild West" Is No Cinch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the nifty gadget in "Men in Black" that Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith used to erase a person's memory? Some moviegoers who suffer through director Barry Sonnenfeld's big-screen bastardization of the CBS-TV cult classic sci-fi oater "Wild Wild West" may wish they could get their hands on that thingamajig. "Wild Wild West" qualifies as one of the worst movies ever adapted from a groundbreaking TV show. Indeed, even something as execrable as "The Avengers" surpasses this saddle sore sagebrusher. Audiences too young to recall the Robert Conrad &amp; Ross Martin frontier farce will have fewer objections with this frivolous "Blazing Saddles" spin on the venerable TV series. Sure, "Wild Wild West" captures the essence of the TV show, but Sonnenfeld and his scenarists cannot imitate its artistry. The title credits evoke memories of the paneled inserts that appeared during the cliffhanger moments and Elmer Bernstein's orchestral score replicates some of the punch of Richard Markowitz's original music. Nevertheless, this disastrous, $100-million plus dust raiser ends up as empty-headed as a sun-scorched steer skull in the sand. Inheriting the James West role created by Robert Conrad, Will Smith looks about as out of place as he would look at a KKK rally. Smith supercharged "Men in Black" and "Independence Day," but he is thoroughly miscast. Moreover, the short-sighted Sonnenfeld never justifies James West's change of color. Neither Kevin Kline as sidekick Artemus Gordon nor noted Shakespearean thespian Kenneth Branagh as the dastardly Confederate egomaniac Dr. Arliss Loveless redeem this thinly woven tumbleweed tale.The back story that the sextet of scribes drummed up for James West is equally as contrived. Not only do they fail to address the race makeover, but they also overlook the fact that the Northern setting where West's family and friends were massacred was more racist than parts of the Deep South. Finally, couldn't Sonnenfeld have devised a better explanation for West's cultural change? Not that most people on the even the year 2000 in our hopelessly politically correct culture will remember it, but African-Americans found their career choices extremely circumscribed during Reconstruction. Any excuse would have been better than what "Wild Wild West" serves up. And the racism here lacks the venomous vibes of "Blazing Saddles."Six scenarists received credit for this pastiche of a western. Who wrote what remains a mystery, but they dredged up a story so lame-brained that it resembles skits from a second-rate "Saturday Night Live" episode cross-bred with an antiquated Cold War thriller. President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline in such bad make-up that he passes for a bearded Charles Grodin) orders West and Gordon to learn who is kidnapping the greatest scientific minds of the century. West prefers to work alone, and Artemus feels similarly about him. Another problem with "Wild Wild West" is that it acts more like a prequel. Our heroes start out hating each other. West is an Army Captain on the trail of ex-Rebel General 'Blood Bath' McGrath (Ted Levine of "Heat") while Gordon is a U.S. Marshal on the same trail. Essentially, West is a shoot-first &amp; ask-questions later kind of hombre, while Gordon is the inventive alternative. He relies on his quirky gimmicks and falls back on gunplay as a last resort. They spend most of the movie competing with each other instead of working together, and this rivalry must have crept into their performances. Smith and Kline kindle little of the chemistry and charisma that made Conrad and Martin so memorable. At the end of the movie, President Grant makes them his first two Secret Service agents. Director Barry Sonnenfeld brings a wry sense of humor to "Wild Wild West." While Sonnenfeld's askew brand of comedy complimented "The Addams Family," "Addams Family Values," "Get Shorty," and "Men in Black," the humor wears thin in this western. Casting Kenneth Branagh as a legless villain must have seemed comical on paper, but the special effects buffoonery grows as tiresome and tedious as gibes about handicapped people and blacks. Occasionally, a scene or two nearly works, such as projecting the last image on the retina of a dead scientist. Will Smith's James West sabotages the scene by repeating ad nauseam: "That is a man's head," as if anything remotely human mattered in this ersatz opus. Furthermore, Sonnenfeld wrangles everything from previous summer epics. The Lego-style, 80 foot, mechanical tarantula that storms through Utah's Monument Valley looks as clunky as this movie sounds.Scenarists S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, Jeffrey Price, Peter Seaman, and Jim &amp; James Thomas break the cardinal rule of all action flicks. Neither James West nor Artemus Gordon is ever in jeopardy. Sonnenfeld and his joke happy writers erect hoops for our heroes to leap through but they never set fire to those hoops. In other words, the filmmakers make it far too easy for our heroes. The magnetic collar scene is probably the worst offender. Rivaling it is James West's escape from a lynch party, and the final assault on the giant tarantula will have you yawning. West dispatches several henchmen with the aplomb of 007, right down to knocking a blade-wielding villain overboard so he can quip, "No more Mr. Knife Guy." At least, in the TV show, Robert Conrad makes the brawls look believable; Conrad foreshadowed Jackie Chan in that the former performed all his own stunts, sometimes at his own peril."Wild Wild West" struggles so desperately to be funny that it degenerates into a travesty. The film dabbles in sexual innuendoes that seem extreme for its PG-13 rating. Parents should think twice before exposing their children to these questionable shenanigans. Overblown special effects, sketchy characters, zero chemistry between the leads, gratuitous humor, and unsavory violence ride roughshod over anything remotely memorable in this train wreck of a movie. Aptly enough, Robert Conrad has summed up "Wild Wild West" as "an abortion."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I decided to go see the movie, I was sure I wouldn't suffer too much, because I didn't set my hopes very high in the first place. I was wrong. The plot was downright insulting. Anyone with a vague understanding of history of technology, war, or anything else would notice how things that no one thought of until WWI were invented in 1869 by a bored genius (who, for some reason, seems very very stupid when he speaks). And, of course, the black military hero in the mid 1800s. I have nothing to add to that. I read a viewer's comment claiming that Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh did a good job, but were limited by, well, everything else. They did not do a good job. They were in the movie. I'm not even going to talk about the characters and acting, and more than enough has been said about the special effects. The movie is just plain bad! And, to top it all off, the rest of the audience was aged, in average, 11, and so every time the plot went anywhere close to romantic (and they almost never got any closer than those horrendously written word games), the entire audience yelled in disgust. They were also the ones responsible for the inch of Coke on the floor, to complete my movie-going experience.</fullReview>

Wild Wild West did have a few funny lines, but the special effects were surprisingly underwhelming. That giant spider completely and totally failed to impress me. And, Jim West (especially at the end), always seemed to just pull through the fights by RAOG (random acts of god), never skill.

Kenneth Branagh was perfect in his role; the exchange between his character and Will Smith at their first meeting was priceless. Kevin Kline was on his game all the way through this film, as was Hayek. I too, think that too many TV shows of yesteryear are being recycled into big screen flicks, but when one finally tries to break away, and become its own piece of entertainment, using nothing more than the base of the original - which in this case, would have been considered at the very least unpolitically correct - it's panned miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Wild Wild West" was a fun series, kind of like James Bond crossed with a buddy cop series in the west. It deserves better than this sad attempt at the continuing reign of Will Smith on the 4th of July. The casting of Will Smith as a secret service agent in the 1860s is a dumb coice and the "jokes" where white people come close to calling him names are not funny. The original James West, Robert Conrad, voiced his displeasure with this clear marketing move. The only lead that was cast well was Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon. He does not reach the warmth of Ross Martin, the original, but is the source of humor, however strained and purile. Throughout the series there was villain who always brought a smile when he appeared, Dr. Migeleto Loveless, one of the most sophisticated villains. Like the greatest of villains, his only flaw is the arrogance that makes him underestimate his opponent. How does this film pay him respect? They turn him into an ignorant redneck who kidnaps scientists. An insult to the character and to Kenneth Branagh. The saddest aspect of the casting is that a prime choice existed. Warwick Davis (Willow) would have perfect for Dr. Loveless and someone impersonating Tom Selleck would have pulled this movie up out of the gutter. The only other necessity would be a script that paid more attention to the series. As it is, this movie is an annoying loser.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, they made the worst decisions ever.I had assumed that this movie WAS GOING TO BE MODELLED AFTER THE TV SHOW!!! That would be a safe assumption, right? Instead they cast Will smith as the lead? I don't understand this. What was the target audience? Obviously it wasn't the fans of the show, or western fans in general.What better actor to put in this role than Bruce Campbell? You may know of him from the Evil Dead series, but I feel his true role in life was to play Brisco County Jr. (look it up). This was a Boam/Cuse production that was unfortunately short lived on FOX (1993). But it was a perfect prequel to what the WWW movie should have been. All about the old west and 'the next coming thing' (the future).But, back to this movie... There was no real thought put into this movie. It was obviously a 'formula movie'. 1 part young popular actor, 2 parts computer effects, sprinkled with gorgeous women. The only thing that the producers forgot about formula's... Mixed in the wrong proportions you WILL create a BOMB!!!It may not have been a hit if it were produced by Boam, Cuse, Raimi, and Campbell. But it would have been more successful and another cult classic.I'm glad I waited for the TV version. I have better things to spend my money on. I gave this movie a 1 of 10. I would have given it a 2 or 3, but I felt the average (4) was too high.Thanks for reading this...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, let's cut to the chase: This is an awful movie, the worst that the summer produced. It is by turns boring, offensive, overdone, and plain bad.There are some serious casting flaws. The biggest of these is Will Smith as West. Smith is too much of a smart-aleck, and too young, to pull of this role. An older actor, like Samuel L. Jackson, could have done a much more believable job.Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh chew scenery with wild abandon, but at least both are tolerable, and Kenneth at least seems to be having a good time. Salma Hayek is an intelligent, believable actress, as long as her lips aren't moving. Then it's all shot.One major problem is the awkward treatment of the character of West as a black man. The film takes place in the 19th century, when racism was an issue. The films responds to this issue with some trite references and lots of racial jokes, which were not only unfunny but offensive. I point my readers to "Blazing Saddles," which was a lot more controversial, perhaps, but handled the issue in a stronger manner, and was also damned funny.Aside from the casting and insensitivity, this film is simply boring. Nothing happens, and it can be very hard to watch. There are not enough good jokes to help, either.What should have been an exciting western with a twist turned into an agonizing quest to find the remote control before the film got any worse. I watched it through to the end, so that others like you should not have to. You have been warned.</fullReview>

I wish they stayed more to the original including a white actor for Jim West(I am black and did not feel Will fit the role)and not get to far ahead of themselves in technology.This was a horrible movie as a "wild wild west" but could have worked as a sci fi/future thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any one of the Roger Moore Bond films had more class then this tripe. Kevin Kline is horribly under used, so is the wonderful Salma Hyack. Will Smith(who is becoming more and more annoying) finally proves that he should of stayed with Bad Boys(his only great film). The effects in the movie are nothing to right home about, and the action scenes left me bored. Just more proof that the average film goer doesnt give a damn what they see, I wish Hollywood would realize that special effects and a few name stars does not make a good movie. Do not see this!</fullReview>

I can just imagine a group of second grade boys sitting around saying.... "Hey I got a great idea for a movie! Lets get that cool guy from Fresh Prince to play in a western and have some guy make cool gadgets and have alot of big machines like an 80ft spider blow up stuff and lets have some hot girl there so we can look at her breasts and show her butt for a second AWESOME!" I mean come on! This is total crap. Don't take my word for it though, just check out the horrible rating it received and read the other comments. I would comment on all the things I found wrong with this film but I dont want to sound like a broken record. I feel my fellow IMDB users have pretty much covered all the bases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The awfulness that is "Wild Wild West" is evident in each of its ludicrous, poorly-paced scenes, but there's no moment more squirm-inducing than when erstwhile box office king Will Smith examines the human head Kevin Kline's Artemis Gordon uses as a projector. At least twice, and at a stretched out, molasses speaking pace, Smith says, "That's ... a human ... HEAD." The scene is so long and horrible that the audience can't help but wince ... we're supposed to start giggling along with Smith's facial tics and gesticulations, but it's so unfunny that we can only shut our eyes.It's bad.

Even the special effects don't help the movie, it seems very out of place with action that is ridiculous in a movie that claims to be a western with its costumes and make up.

Will Smith plays himself as always, but is perhaps a little too smug this time. Clearly a lot of money was spent on the film and some of the Special Effects are effective, but the whole thing doesn't hang well together. Kevin Kline does a decent job and manages to wring a few jokes out of the weak script. Salma Hayek is bad. The film is barely watchable if you have little else to do but don't expect another 'Men In Black'.Overall 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess History meant nothing to the film makers. There were a few moments when history tried to peek through. But all realism was tossed away when the character played in the original series was made into a black male. During that time in history there was no chance of the first secret service agent being black. Therefore revisionist history wins and I give the movie two thumbs down....way down. The special effects were awful as well and it could of used some better writers. I hope they never make a sequel to this awful movie. It would have been more believable and I think entertaining if they didn't try to put so much futuristic garbage into the movie and just work with what would have been available at the time. There were many things that could have been used to spice up the movie but I don't have all day. I bet Will Smith in 20 years will say "I can't believe I made that movie, What was I thinking?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Really So Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a project that had everything going for it: A terrific cast, a director with a proven track record, great special effects, a huge budget and the promise of being the heir apparent of a successful television series. So what went wrong? Because `Wild Wild West,' directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is...well, just not very good. It's a case, apparently, of everything being poised for greatness until it all went south. And that's pretty much the bottom line here; nothing about this film works. Nothing. Not that everyone didn't try hard, because it's obvious that they did, right down to the last man and the last lame joke. It reminds me of a line from `Mystery Men': Someone refers to another as being `mysterious;' someone else says, `That's it? He's mysterious?' `Well,' is the reply, `He's VERY mysterious.' Did they try hard in this one? They tried VERY hard. But, very simply, nothing worked. The usually charismatic Will Smith (James West) didn't even have that working for him here; Kevin Kline (Artemus) didn't fare any better, and Kenneth Branagh (Dr. Loveless) proved to be one of the most forgettable villains in the history of the cinema. His over-the-top performance could do nothing to salvage a character that was anemic and uninteresting to begin with. As for Salma Hayek, it's nothing more than a case of a beautiful, talented actress being used as window dressing; and here it's like putting curtains on the windows of the Titanic even as it's sinking. Sonnenfeld will have to accept his share of the blame, since the director, above and beyond everyone else, should have seen what was happening as filming progressed (or in this case, regressed). It's hard to figure how the man who gave us `Men In Black' and `Get Shorty' (among others) could have let this one slip so badly. It's downright confusing as to how such enormously talented people could come together and go so awry in their endeavors. The principles here all have proven themselves elsewhere as masters of impeccable timing, whether it be in comedy, drama or action features, yet even that falls flat here. It's as if this project had a `Jonah' on it from the beginning. As far as the plot is concerned, I will not divulge any salient points; unfortunately, there is nothing significant enough to divulge. There are a number of jokes scattered throughout the movie that are not only bad, but seem as if they were an afterthought, possibly added to a scene only when repairs could not be effected in the editing room. If you have not yet seen this movie, and if you are a fan of Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh or Salma Hayek, or if you have fond memories of the T.V. series that spawned this film, do yourself a favor: Rent or buy `Enemy of the State,' `A Fish Called Wanda,' `Much Ado About Nothing,' or `Fools Rush In,' and let this one go. Protect those fond memories. If you absolutely must have a taste of this, try to catch the music video with Smith doing the title song. That video is the best thing about this whole project, and Hayek has a much more significant part in it than she does in the movie. Twenty years or so from now, someone will ask Smith what went wrong with `Wild Wild West;' and he'll probably reply, `Who knows? It just didn't work.' As for now, all anyone can say is, `Who Knows? It just didn't work.' And that about sums it up. I rate this one 1/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILER WARNING***There is a theory about horror films that you can tell when the screenwriter has run out of ideas when the potential victim enters the house and runs up the stairs, thereby trapping themselves on the second floor. I have applied the same sort of theory to comedy: You know the screenwriter has reached deadlock when he has his characters dress in drag to evade the villains. This idea was already dead when the Three Stooges did it in the 30s.`Wild Wild West' uses that lame clich and just about every other in this over-blown, over-budgeted, over-produced cinematic hemorrhoid. This is a movie that is so bad that it almost achieves a level of stupidity all of it's own.The movie finds Jim West (Will Smith) a post-war Federal Agent who is assigned by President Grant to find out who is kidnapping scientists. How did a black man in the 19th century get a position of authority? Beats me. His partner is Artimes Gordon (Kevin Kline) an inventor and master of disguise. He wears two disguises: President Ulysses Grant and a dancehall girl. Since he actually does play President Grant what was the point of introducing in that disguise in the first place? He creates weapons that apparently only work if the opponent stands in just the right spot.Will Smith is woefully miscast and his subplot involving his parents is painfully serious. Wherever he goes he runs afoul of a lot of racial comments which are embarrassing, offensive and lead up to an agonizingly unfunny scene involving a lynch mob.Smith and Kline spend a lot of the movie arguing and at one point are fitted with magnetic collars and chased around by giant flying sawblades. Naturally the villain who put them in these collars stays away and just assumes that the plan worked.Salma Hayak gets dragged into this mess for a few moments of screen time to put some skin on the screen, stand behind the hero and then gets out of the way so we can see more special effects or more Will Smith. Hayak has a winning personality that was on display in movies like `Fools Rush In' and `Dogma' but is dead weight here.My mouth was agape during much of this movie. Scene after scene marches by and every joke ends with a dull thud. A small fortune was spent to create special effects involving a giant steam powered spider that blows fire. It is unconvincing and unnecessary. I was struck by the fact that an 80 million dollar budget was spent to come up with effects that are at best average`Wild Wild West' is a movie built on ego. The thinking seems to have been that it was a big summer movie with a lot of expensive special effects and a familiar T.V. title that is already a brand-name. They threw in Will Smith, the star of two previous summer movies `Independence Day' and `Men in Black' and added Kevin Kline as a well-known actor and a good marquee name. Then they threw in Kenneth Branagah as legless villain and gives him an unconvincing southern drawl.The screenplay seems to have been stitched together on the spot. The actors make a joke, talk about a plot point and move on. The movie also makes the mistake of using a genre (the western comedy) that reached its peak with `Blazing Saddles'. Really, are there any jokes about the old west that haven't been worn dry? I'll take that bean-eating scene in Mel Brooks' movie as comment on this one.Rating: 1/2* (of four)</fullReview>

(And I'm sorry, but having an African-American as a "top government agent" four years after the end of the Civil War simply cannot be made believable, despite valiant attempts to try.) Kevin Kline, a fine actor, does what he can as Artemus Gordon, but seems to be recapitulating his "In and Out" persona (Ross Martin was never that prissy.) Kenneth Branagh, as the villain, plays it so far over the top you can't even see the top from where he his. Salma Hayek is undeniably lovely, but is wasted (she's basically an afterthought). Special effects are good, plot is stupid, script is awful. As a fan of the old series, I was very disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West is about to come out on video tomorrow, and unfortunately, I can't recommend it. Somehow, I got fooled into thinking that a cool trailer and an A-list cast should automatically equate to a good time at the movies. Should you see Wild Wild West, you may be minimally entertained by it all, but everything will seem worse when looking back in hindsight. Of course, my expectations were fairly high for this movie, but looking back, even someone who craves mindless fun will be at least a little disappointed. There's a lot of easy flaws to spot, and they ultimately cannot be forgiven. Here it goes....  First of all, those expecting tightly-paced action will be shocked. The fight scenes seem tired and lifeless, and the "climax" is ridiculous. The saloon brawls are pretty dull, featuring nothing but people getting punched and/or shot, all without flair. Okay, so this might be fine if the action was campy (like in Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS), but the laugh product is unfortunately low. There are a few chuckle-worthy moments, but most of the humor is forced, especially when looking back in hindsight. I suppose someone might find it funny when Will Smith repeatedly utters the line "that is a man's head" in several different tones, but it's the most obvious kind of forced comedy. Actually, Kenneth Branagh delivers more laughs than everyone else combined in a deliciously over-the-top performance, but it's still not enough. Finally, the music is completely forgettable and repetitive.  Sad to say, this is not one of Will Smith's finer moments. Given some ripe material (such as in MEN IN BLACK or ENEMY OF THE STATE), he can be a delight, but he's all wrong here. He stretches his character's comic attributes over the action ones, and much like the rest of the movie, he comes out forced. Kevin Kline does a decent job, but the whole "mismatched partners trying to get along" concept has been done SO many times that it's irritating.  Given my sheer volume of complaints here, some may wonder if it's possible to enjoy Wild Wild West. The answer is "yes," but this is one of those movies that's so forced (just take that word as a given from now on) that it's strictly BRING YOUR OWN FUN. You won't find much entertainment here, you have to force (sorry) yourself to have some if you want any. Oh, and here's an afterthought: I saw Will Smith's "Wild Wild West" music video, and it's actually better than the movie. What are the odds of something like that? MY RATING: * 1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West was a terrible dissapointment. I went into the theatre with the attitude that this would be a typical Will Smith movie. I love Will Smith and all his previous shows, but this was one movie he should've left out of his repetoire. Don't get me wrong, he was incredibly suave and slick like the Will Smith we've all know and love. This guy is a gem and makes a movie good just because he is in it. But even he couldnt save this poor storyline. Keneth Branaugh was terrible, his accent was annoying to say the least and he never convinced me he was a good bad guy. Kevin Kline was decent, again, an acting talent far to good for a movie such as this. Salma Hayek went virtually unnoticed, although her breasts and rear end made this movie somewhat of a thrill for the males. Overall, the story is just too far fetched and basically childish for it to be considered good. I mean the last scene was James West and Artemus Gordon riding off into the sunset in an 80 foot mechanical tarantula. This is 1863. Will Smith does not dissapoint which is probably the only reason anyone should see this movie, if you enjoy him and his acting you will no doubt enjoy his performance in Wild Wild West. His character is slick, quick and very cool. However, I was expecting another Independence Day or at worst Men In Black, two very good films. A possible blockbuster ruined by some shotty acting and an immature plot line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Bad Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keeping in step with the recent film remake of the 60's hit tv show "The Avengers", the remake of "Wild Wild West" disappoints at several levels. Like the original tv show, the plot of the 1999 film is typically hammy at best and relies heavily on the characters to pull off the film. Unfortunately, neither Will Smith nor Kevin Kline are charming or funny enough to do the job.Unlike his past performances in "Independence Day" and "Men in Black", Smith's James West falls flat on his face with a resounding thud. Kevin Kline fares slightly better as Artemus Gordon, inventor extraordinaire, but is bogged down by the poor script.The only winner of this film is Kenneth Branagh. The British actor, who has taken a hiatus from his usual Shakespearen roles, hits the wierdo jackpot as Dr. Arliss Loveless. Equipped with a heavy Southern twang, Branagh is virtually flawless as the legless scientist, bent on taking over the United States with a giganic spider-shaped vehicle. Other than to watch him, there is no other reason to spend money on viewing this recent travesty of a classic show.The film's only reason for existence is that it helps one appreciate Robert Conrad and Ross Martin as the original James West and Artemus Gordon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening credits of this film were highly entertaining, and the closing credits featuring Will's WWW rap was fun as well. Everything in between was a pure, unadulterated, steaming pile of crud! I sat and marveled at the drek that was being spewed out on the screen from this supposedly Summer Blockbuster movie and was totally stupefied. I've seen bad movies before, and I've certainly seen my share of big-budget, special-effects money machines - but none was as poorly conceived as this. What makes it even more amazing is that we had actors with at least a proven track record of success. We had a director (Barry Sonnenfeld) who has managed to put together his share of successful movies. And if this weren't enough, there was a pant load of big explosions and digital effects! So what went wrong?The script, the script, the script. It boggles my mind that this screenplay actually made it to production. The dialogue was atrocious. The attempts at humor were pathetic. The characters had about as much depth as the screen they were being projected on. Hayek's character was completely pointless, and had less than no reason to be there. The repeated exchange of racial/disabled insults between the black Jim West and the legless Dr. Loveless was shameful. It seemed that about every twenty minutes Kline's character launched into a diatribe reiterating the plot, and articulating what they were doing and why. I can only assume this was intended for the audience members who had just woken up and needed to get caught up with the "action."My biggest regret in seeing this film is that wish I could have warned you earlier not to see it. I'm sure there are several movie fans out there right now who unwittingly fell victim to this movie, and are at this moment still lying in bed with the covers pulled over their heads, swearing they'll never go to the theater again as long as they live. Don't go see this movie, don't let your kids see this movie, don't even recommend it to people you truly despise. If, on the other hand, you have a morbid fascination with the continuing devolution of Hollywood and aren't afraid to face definitive evidence that our culture is moments away from claiming creative bankruptcy, this one is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The TV show this was based on had a clever premise (U.S. agents in the ante-bellum U.S. with 19th c. versions of James Bond gadgets). There were some good episodes. There were also plenty of bad episodes and the movie is more like those.The best idea in the movie IS the amusing technology: Nearly all of the contraptions are steam-powered. But overall, the rest of the movie is silly &amp; half-assed. In Hollywood's favorite trick, filming began before a decent script was completed.The opening scenes are dead on arrival. Characters haven't even been introduced before there's a fight, a horse-chase, and a variety of western set-pieces that were stale fifty years ago. You haven't warmed up to the movie at all before you find yourself repelled. (McGrath tilts his hearing horn and brown goo flows out of it) Scenes in the latter half look cheap because they opted to film exteriors as digitally inserted backgrounds. Perhaps that shaved a few bucks off the $200 mil this thing cost.It has insipid ideas that will leave you groaning: - Shining a light through the back of a cadavers head to project the final image on his corneas - Henchmen hidden within living paintings - Rubber rope - Will Smith and Kevin Kline in utterly unconvincing drag, that still manages to fool the imbeciles this movie is teeming with.Smith and Kline have zero chemistry together. Because Hollywood is uncomfortable with two men relating in any way but a rivalry, the writers made them reluctant bickering partners. (Wasn't that fresh the last six hundred times you saw it?)Smith is miscast. The producers wanted bankability, not credibility. Once he was chosen to play a black marshall in 1869, the script was forced to acknowledge the anachronism. For these writers it meant doing it over and over and over! Race is the tiresome focus of too many scenes.Smith is squeaky clean, and he's an uninvolved performer. He trades on attitude &amp; likability, not competence in the role. It would take an edgier performer than Smith to send nasty material like this over. (race-bating, disabled-bashing, a lynching!??!) Nobody ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please tell me whats so great about this movie! I was seriously disappointed with it. Sure there were some funny parts, and some cool effects..but that doesnt cut it. The most plot gapped, choppy edited movie of the summer! Examples, that giant spider robot scenes (missing sidekick girls). West's fight scene below (chain flies off but still magicllly attaches, steel head goon dies without a clear reason to how he did). Dr. Loveless just falls and we dont see it for such a cool villain why no glorious death scene?? I'll spare the predictable spots for you. Not a bad flick...but not worth paying 8$ for. Star Wars was so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does not do justice to the original series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want very badly to give this movie a good review, because like many baby boomers, I am an ardent fan of the original television series. Unfortunately, this movie does not live up to the standard set by its predecessor.The movie suffers chiefly from careless plot development. The action occurs as a series of "in-your-face" explosions and reckless destruction. What occurs is almost a series of disconnected incidents, only peripherally related to the plot. There was little attempt to think through the action and organize it around a recognizable plot. The action, therefore, lacks depth and structure, unlike the original series.In the original series, there was a very palpable antagonism between West and Gordon and Dr. Miguelito Loveless, their constant nemesis. The series flourished upon the permutations of the personal conflict between the characters, and more importantly, that character development was center stage. It was what made Dr. Loveless a character the audience loved to hate: an archvillain.Dr. Arliss Loveless, as he's called in the movie, has been carried away by the global nature of his ambitions, ambitions that were tongue in cheek in the original series. Arliss Loveless is a megalomaniac bent upon destroying everything in sight with little or no provocation fo doing so. The only relationship he has to West and Gordon is a vague if recurring reference to a long ago battle in which he is said to have killed Major West's parents. Now, West would like nothing better than to destroy Loveless, and of course, the feeling has always been mutual.Destructive power and ambition were never the point to make about the original Dr. Loveless. It was his diabolical, archfiendish cleverness in getting West and Gordon into impossible situations, situations which required just as much ingenuity to escape that made Loveless an ironically likable character. He could be an anti-hero for the anti-social set or just those who hate intrusive government agencies.I agree with a reviewer, whose name escapes me, who felt that Kenneth Branagh's considerable talents as an actor were wasted in this movie. Mr. Branagh suffers not from bad acting, but from bad direction here.The other actors are similarly miscast. Will Smith plays Major West a little too flamboyantly than he should. Salma Hayek is a very beautiful woman with some talent as an actress, but her presence adds little to this film. She isn't saved by West and Gordon and she doesn't save them from villainy. She is peripheral to the plot as it unfolds and she is peripheral, as a character, to West and Gordon. She is not even their love interest and she should have been spared any involvement with this movie. She has acted better roles than this. Barry Sonnenberg appears to have thought that, since audiences went for the flamboyant style in Men In Black, the same formula would work here. But the entire production has an overwrought quality that serves mainly as a publicity venture for the actors. It lacks the depth required to give it the faintest resemblance to the original series.Wild Wild West will appeal to those who don't like to analyze what they are watching, or who don't expect a movie to have a deep impact upon them psychologically or emotionally. Kids should like it for its special effects and overblown action sequences, especially kids in the 9-12 age range. But for those who want a movie to be faithful in large part to the original subject matter upon which it is based or who just want to be impressed by a movie, this is not the movie they are looking for.I give this movie one and a half stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you would have told me 10 years ago that Will Smith would become one of the top action heroes in the industry, I would have guessed that you'd been breathing too much of that "Fresh Prince of Bel Air." And, yet, I have enjoyed everyone of his movies (yes, even "Bad Boys"). Unfortunately, now that stardom and the big paycheck have arrived, Smith proves that even he needs a good script to work from.This self-styled new and hipper Wild Wild West takes its lead from the classic TV series that starred Robert Conrad as James West. Smith, as the updated West, stars with sultry Salma Hayek, Kenneth "Mr. Shakespeare" Branagh as the evil Dr. Arliss and Kevin Kline playing Artemus Gordon and just about every other character in the movie.Smith first appears a good fit for the West role, displaying Conrad's trademark coolness under fire. But just a few minutes into the movie, it's obvious that Smith lacks the other important quality that Conrad brought to the part: that he's dangerous.Perhaps director Barry Sonnenfield realized this and allowed Smith to inject several attempts at humor. Or perhaps it's a result of a patchwork script, parts written before Smith signed on and those after. Either way, the result is the audience left having to believe that Smith would shoot anything that breathes one second and the next holster his six shooters so that he can try and joke his way from a bunch of paunchy, old slave owners that want to hang him.The script skims over everything else. Kline hams it up as a drag dressing and invention tinkering but otherwise bland Artemus. Branagh vents his anger, as a southerner defeated and crippled by the Civil War, but never explains it. And Hayek bats her eyes and show off her cleavages (yes, plural).Kline does get some extra screen time by doing a "Dave" as President Ulysses S. Grant. But even an executive order won't pull together what had promised to be a solid piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Were one to look at Will Smith's career on a time-line, one would see a dizzying climb from not-so-humble rapper, to a Prince so Fresh he made shampoo commercials seem like depression era footage of crippled people waiting in bread lines all the way to mega-blockbuster check cashin' Jiggy man.People wondered, could it go on forever? Could he be the rare action star that avoided colossal missteps and simply continued to make money with charming roles of just cool semi-rebels? No.Wild, Wild West assuaged any idea that he was bulletproof. It demolished the idea of a flawless big weekend star. It savagely beat the notion of Mr. Smith being money in the bank. It beat it like a man who had something to prove about beatings. It left that notion simply sprawled on the ground, its head rising slowly with a trail of blood from its lip the ground.This movie was God's punishment for a crime we didn't know we committed. Answers are still being sought. What transgression must we repent for? Does the lord have a plan at all? Is it worth going forward? Thanks to Wild, Wild West I don't know anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does nobody seem to like this film?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was amazed to read all the negative comments regarding this movie. I loved it! I found it funny, witty and overall very well done. Will Smith is excellent in the part of Jim West, the trigger-happy smart talking cowboy, as is Kevin Kline in the part of Artemis Gordon, the genius master of disguise. But the man who really steals the show is Kenneth Branagh in the part of the evil mastermind Dr. Loveless. He creates humour in the role of the cold-blooded criminal, as well as keeping the character's part as a 'southern gentleman'. The word-play between Loveless and West is fabulous, and the friendship that grows between West and Gordon is developed nicely. The only problem I really have with this film is Selma Hayek's character. It's like the directors were thinking, 'hey, we need a chick in this film, you know, so we have, like, sexual tension and stuff.' and had her written in. She just doesn't seem to fit that well. Overall, this movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me and I advise you to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA...and ORLANDO, FL When you go to see a Will Smith movie, you expect it to be entertaining and fast-paced. A movie with Kevin Kline might have your expectations leaning more in the direction of cerebral, tight-knit &amp; solid entertainment. If Salma Hayek is in it, well ....at least you expect a flick with visual appeal ...1, 2, 3 STRIKES...Wild Wild West STRIKES OUT! TALK ABOUT DROPPING THE BALL! Will Smith, whose laid-back, street-wise- cracking veneer, usually hides a well-focused on screen intensity that is both impossible to miss or dislike...seemed to be sauntering through the film, feeling embarrassingly like a walking anachronism, considering the "Old West" backdrop! Kevin Kline, on the other hand, who usually brings a certain air of bravura to his oft-times eccentric characterizations, seemed to display a marked inability to take himself seriously when in drag, (Which, unfortunately, is during a good chunk of the film) lapsing into a pathetic sort self-parody, which, considering the script, may have been the only way he could stomach the role! Salma Hayek, for whom no one is exactly holding their breath for her to win an Oscar as Best Actress, seemed OBSESSED with getting her lines out with as little accent as possible...Despite the fact that she was clearly cast as Mexican in this film...(As opposed to her bit part in The FACULTY!) You could almost imagine "La Mejicanita" standing there, during shooting, with her Accent/Dialogue Coach, just out of camera range! Salma...concentrate MORE on your ACTING, next time, O.K.? As far as Barry Sonnenfled's Directing is concerned...well, here we could imagine him running around frantically, till the last minute, editing and re-editing, trying to decide exactly what it is he was trying to do with "WILD"....and of course, not even coming CLOSE to getting it right! The ONLY reason I rated the movie 3 Stars (as opposed to 0 Stars!) is because of the scope &amp; the novelty of the Special Effects. The idea of seeing all those well orchestrated, and at times visually stunning effects against an Old West backdrop was the only refreshing and original element in the film ...If you are not a die-hard Special Effects buff, I can think of absolutely no reason on earth why you would find anything at all worth seeing in this pathetic excuse for a Blockbuster film! 3*STARS*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA?????</fullReview>

Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon should have been a stroke of genius. Ditto for Kenneth Brannagh playing the heavy, Loveless. Through a good director on top for good measure. Some who can play the mix of comedy and bang bang action well, like Barry Sonnenfeld and you should have something.And you do. But it's not what you want. This movie is as flat as they come. A very limp script handcuffs the cast and the result is the embarrassment everyone else on this board is complaining about. Well except for the three of four people who think overblown junk like this is good. (Go seek help!)So go watch the old show instead. Or just about anything for that matter.</fullReview>

Which makes it all the more tragic that I expected to really like this movie. I am a fan of all the major players (Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek, Kenneth Branagh, director Barry Sonnenfeld), and have generally been impressed by all of them in the past. Apparently, they all got together and decided to all get their fans' disappointment out of the way within one movie. Because I liked the actors in it so much (and they acquit themselves tolerably, considering what they have to work with), I stayed in the theater all the way to the end credits, hoping that the next scene would be better.

		<fullReview>Look at everything this movie has in it: big stars (Smith, Kline, Hayek and Branagh), big director (Sonnenfeld), big special effects (that cheap-looking spider and an unrealistic aeroplane), 4 writers (though I don't know if that's so great), and an opening 4th of July weekend slot! And what do 'we' get in return? Absolute BULL****! There's been a lot of comparison of this movie to "Shanghai Noon". Numerous critics have said, "It's the film 'Wild Wild West' should have been." I'm sure that film had a small starred cast (Chan, Wilson and Lui), a small-time director, little or no special effects, probably one (funny) writer, and a pre-summer opener, right in the middle of films like "Gladiator" and "M:I2". And yet it pleased critics, and filmakers probably discovered Jackie Chan's comic ability after "Rush Hour", and succeed with his second pleasing American comedy.But now back to "WWW". Wait a minute, who cares anymore? Go checkout "Shanghai Noon"! Or if you want a more classical western, see "Shane". Or if you want a really cool western, see "Tombstone". As for the cast: for Kline, checkout "In &amp; Out" or "A Fish Called Wanda". for Hayek, see "Desperado" or "From Dusk til Dawn". or checkout Branagh in the director's chair in "Hamlet" (1996). As for Mr. Will Smith, he was annoying here, even more annoying than in "ID4". For a funny Will Smith performance, catch any random rerun of "Fresh Prince". To see him as a real action bad-ass, checkout him out along side Martin Lawrence in "Bad Boys". For a good dramatic Smith performance, checkout "Enemy of the State". "Independence Day" and "Men in Black" were ok, but I don't think Smith was the best thing about either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild Wild West" It's that time of year. The time when Hollywood trots out it's worst of the summer. You know the drill. There's a "Godzilla" every year, somebody has to be it. "Wild Wild West" clenches the title hands down this summer, and we still have eight weeks to go!The Will Smith phenomenon has now entered it's third phase: overwhelming ego project. Teaming with his "Men In Black" director Barry Sonnenfeld, Smith has finally teetered over the edge and released an outright mess. A film that will hang in the halls of all time bad event flicks. Should we blame Smith? I think so. "Men In Black" and "Independence Day" were gigantic hits, they even call the 4th of July "Big Willie Weekend" due to these successes. I submit that these films were hits due to the films themselves, the writing, acting, directing, and not just because of Smith. "West" is finally the film that rests on Smith's comedic shoulders alone. The truth shines through clearly. Not everything Will Smith does is funny.Based in the television show running from 1965-1970, the simple plot tells the tale of a Civil War era federal marshal James West (Smith), who must team up with a weapons expert (Kevin Kline, at his most painfully unfunny) to thwart the evil plans of the villain, and legless, Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Along for the ride is a giant mechanical tarantula, President Grant, and the stunning, gorgeous, lovely, and just plain old hot Salma Hayek. The plot is just a simple excuse to push the characters through endless scenes that give birth to no laughs at all. Scenes that make the audience gringe with fear, as if something wrong is with them. Fear not my good people, these are professionals up on screen, and they blew it.The screenplay, credited to FOUR writers, has the damnedest time to make any of the jokes funny. You would not believe just how far the cast goes to make this limp material work. It's embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing for the actors. There is not one funny moment in the film, not even a courtesy laugh for the attempt. Dead silence. I also disapprove of the attempt to squeeze racial jokes into the mix. Yes, Will Smith is African-American, but do we need to call attention to it every five minutes? The movie would've been better served had it left the race issue alone and just played up the potential fun of the concept.Will Smith is simply miscast as the hero. He's an amiable actor who's proven himself with stronger material. This film clearly shows just how paper thin the Smith charm can be. While Kevin Kline tries but fails as well, it's really Hayek's role that's a mystery. She's barely in the film, and when her character is explained, you come to realize that she's not apart of the story at all. Hayek has always been a fun performer with winning personality. All this movie asks of her is to be the butt (literally) of a few jokes and keep the cleavage coming. A shameful waste of talent.Director Sonnenfeld has also been at the helm of better pictures ("Get Shorty"), but for some reason I have yet to see a truly great film directed by him. There always seems to be a spark missing from the action, like a better, funnier film was in there somewhere but he can't find it. Relying in great amounts on special effects and the considerable use of easy-to-spot green screen shots, the typical Sonnenfeld camera work is either buried under all the mayhem or just not inventive when the attempt is actually made. This is a very top-heavy production with little chance to breathe. But Sonnenfeld made this choice, he must be held accountable for it.The movie has been through many edits, and this shows with wildly out of tune continuity and many unexplained plot twists. Also grating on the brain is Elmer Bernstein's annoying and featherweight musical score. While we have Warner Brothers shamefully trotting out it's "We pray it's as big as the 'Men In Black'" Will Smith rap tune, Bernstein provides a flat score that serves no purpose to enliven the film. The cinematography is also without color, and the catering probably sucked too."Wild Wild West" is the product of zero imagination. A lifeless summer film that seems to stick out even more in this unusually good movie season. I am always wary of comic westerns, and this film seals that envelope. If this is what 160 million buys you? I'll take the 3 million "South Park" any day.------------ 0</fullReview>

How did Will simply handing the wrench to metalhead make him short circut?How did they get the metal collars off? "Hey, moviegoers are idiots, let's just fade out, no one will notice" That's what Sonnenfeld must say. Will dresses up as a belly dancer and even though Loveless is a racist, he goes crazy for Will as a woman. Wait, I thought he was racist? Whatever. Just blast the music and fade out. Who cares. "But what about logic?" --"HEY! Logical movies are for Mr. Spock!" I really enjoyed Men in black, which makes this movie even more baffling as to how it could be so bad. Mainly, I think it's Will. He is very out of place, I read that originallly it was Mel Gibson as West. Now that would have been perfect. But Noooooo, Mel has to go off and do Maverick instead. Why? Why? For God's sake why Mel?

		<shortDescription>Wild Wild Waste of My Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a significant disappointment from Sonnenfeld who seems to have been steadily improving as a director since his underwhelming Addams Family debut (there are those of us who rather wish he'd remained a director of photography).I can't quite imagine how this wrong-headed mostrosity got off the ground although I can imagine the studio light being stuck on green where Will Smith is concerned. But this? This? Who ever thought that this was a good idea for a summer movie? There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with it like at the most basic level, the idea is rotten, like the first conception of the project was rooted in some bizarre temporary insanity, the conclusion perhaps that Will Smith is all a movie needs to be a smash.This is the most cynical and contrived form of film-making, the packaging of elements to excite a broad demographic, the synergistic Burger King tie-ins, music videos etc for maximum market coverage. But what is centrally lacking here is the movie itself. It is a dismal spiritless mess, devoid of any chemistry between its leading characters, an entirely unnecessary female character (Salma Hayek in an awesomely thankless part) and an utterly rubbishy villain (Kenneth Branaugh not nearly as funny as he seems to think he is).Of course the actors cannot be blamed. They are only actors for Christ's sake. What really counts in a deal like this is the script and Wild Wild West simply did not appear to have one. The plot was utterly incidental, a routine and tiresome paper chase across the old west to find a bad guy with a ridiculous bad guy world domination plan. This would be fine if the movie dispensed with plot and left Smith and Kline centre stage with a huge quantity of electrifying witty banter, but it doesn't. Instead they are given swathes of plot-related dialogue as though we were actually supposed to be interested. In the whole film, I don't think I saw one decent line of dialogue, not a single solitary spark of wit. No clever wordplay, nothing in fact that could justifiably be called comedy writing. Not even any of Will Smith's patented verbal clowning. Just talk and pulling silly faces.An embarrassment for everybody concerned, especially Kline who really aught to know better by now. The only person who comes out of this with dignity intact is director of photography Michael Ballhaus, who makes the desert look like a surrealist painting, as though John Ford and Rene Magritte had conceived a child in a crazy threesome with Alexandro Jodorowsky.Otherwise, I want my money back. I feel cheated. I want to see something enchanting that makes me fall in love with movies all over again, not this sorry self indulgence. Worse even than Star Wars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully Awkward, Predictable, and Horribly Written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually walked out of the movie before it was over, and I suspect that audiences everywhere will experience a similar impulse. The movie (I dare not write its name) is another one of the countless pictures that must have been written by some kind of experimental Hollywood software. It takes several excellent actors, one wonderful special effects marvel, shakes them up and out pops the same crap every time.First of all, the trailers seem to imply that the setting is some kind of alternate futuristic Wild West. However, the writers decided to cram their horribly written plot into actual American history which is insulting and ridiculous. I liked Kenneth Branagh as the legless southern villain, Kevin Kline was adequate, and as usual Will Smith displayed the remarkable ability to play himself. The music in the film is traditional TV western fare which is bland and inappropriate. This movie desperately tries not to offend any age group or race, and ends up appealing to no one.Upon exiting the theater in disgust I had the familiar thoughts, "I can't believe someone was PAID to write that, I can't believe I PAID to see that." Although I have had similar thoughts quite frequently over the last few years, this incidence was by far one of the most intense episodes. Watch Tarzan again instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say this: I loved the original show, but had no expectations that this movie would resemble the show. Which was a fine expectation, as far as it went. However, I do expect some creativity when an old concept is revamped - there was none here. Beyond the gimmick of the mechanical monster, nothing was terribly interesting to me - Will Smith was not sufficiently contained, and there was no chemistry between Kline and Smith (and Kline's excellent acting was simply out of place). Branagh - ugh! He was just a loon, and a super villain should be wily, too. He just ranted and raved. I was hoping for a movie where something ambitious was attempted, even if it failed spectacularly... but they tried for nothing, and succeeded.</fullReview>

I mean, I KNOW that this was a talented group of actors (except, of course, for Salma), but the mystery is why none of it was on the screen. The few chuckles I had were painfully wrung from me. I counted two chuckles, actually. The audience around me didn't leave, but I believe it's because they were simply sitting in stunned disbelief. And, as previously mentioned, I am not a Salma fan, but geez, she played the stupidest love interest on screen I've seen in awhile. What was she thinking? Offensive.

		<fullReview>I saw this at the Directors Guild of America on Monday night (6/28/99). I was a huge fan of the TV show growing up, and the movies have proved once again that it takes inferior writing and lame acting skills to make a Hollywood blockbuster. Wil Smith uses 1999 ghetto vernacular and comedy (which isn't very funny) to drudge his way through the 1869 main role (makes sense), and Kevin Klein was probably paid a huge salary. Why else would he involve himself in such an unflattering, unfunny film. The best thing about the film were the opening credits shot in Old Western tradition...and the closing credits because it meant the movie was over. It should have been called "Wild Wild Crap."</fullReview>

Unsatisfying visuals and second-rate special effects only add to the horrible acting and the film's unclear direction.

		<fullReview>Buying this film I had in mind The Great Race and I expected to see a funny comedy with modern effects and intricate gadgets. Unfortunately the film crew failed to shoot a comedy but shot an implausible story that could hardly have taken place in the American West. It seems to me that people of the 19th century had more respect towards the President than our contemporaries. Anyway, the genre of the film is said to be comedy but the film is anything but funny. It's full of unnecessary violence and cruelty. It's hard to say what IS funny in it. The Great Race could boast a hero and a villain but whatever tricks they played on each other they never resulted in severe damage, if the worst came to the worst they threw cakes at each other or fell sprawling in the mud. Nevertheless, the vice was punished and laughed at. It was not frightening , it was ridiculous. That's why one could safely show such films as The Great Race to children; I for one saw it first when I was 5 or 6 and I still enjoy it. Maybe films of the kind should be shot in this humorous vein. I myself do not mind my p's and q's and can appreciate a thriller or an action film with all the gore and blood if the violence is justified, but Wild Wild West is not the case.</fullReview>

Will Smith mugs his way through this debacle and basically reprises his Men In Black/ID4/Fresh Prince acting ability which was great when he had something funny to say. Salma Hayek is going to have to do more than show her butt to become a star. But even the greatest acting in the world couldn't have saved this mess.

How such a talented group of people managed to spend $160 million on such a godawful train wreck is almost inconceivable. The script is witless, relying almost entirely on jokes about breasts (hypnotic, fire-spitting, buckwheat-filled, or used as jungle drums) and genitalia (throbbing phallic machines, allusions to mechanical devices, Will Smith burying his face in Kevin Kline's crotch, etc). Selma Hayek is utterly wasted, as are the usually talented Smith and Kline. Kenneth Branagh tries hard and is the best thing in the film - but can't overcome the dreadful material he's given to work with. I predict that business will plummet on the second weekend when word of mouth gets out. Avoid this dog at all costs.</fullReview>

The actors Robert Conrad and Ross Martin really made the show great. They are irreplaceable. Both Will Smith and Kevin Kline are great actors, but they are not West and Gordon...sorry.Replacing Robert Conrad with Will Smith is like replacing Sean Connery with George Lazenby as James Bond.

That about sums up a lot of his films, one or two of which are a little better and a couple are far worse. Overall, this is pretty good....but there is only so much I can take of smug people (can you say, Chevy Chase?).You can thank the special effects team for bailing out Smth's arrogant butt and making this movie fun to watch here and there. There were some very entertaining gadgets in here, especially the robots. The movie makes little sense, has no credibility and is a just a vehicle for mindless entertainment, which is fine at times. There is a place for that, for those who need a break from too-serious films.This also is an excellent vehicle for the DVD format because the visuals are razor-sharp and colorful and the surround sound effective. This is a combination sci-fi/western/comedy rolled into one and is almost a cartoon in nature. The villain, played by Kenneth Branagh, is so ludicrous that he's almost comical. Kevin Kline, as Smith's partner, is a likable guy and Hayek is there for her usual purpose: show off her ample boobs.It's entertaining but I liked the old television show of this much better, the one featuring Robert Conrad and Ross Martin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's anyone in Hollywood who clearly doesn't believe in the expression "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," it's Barry Sonnenfeld. The strange thing is his changes sometimes work - but while on the one side it results in interesting stuff like "Addams Family Values" and the shortlived "Fantasy Island" update, on the other hand it results in the shortlived "Secret Agent Man" (probably the first time the theme for one TV show has been used to inspire another TV show) and... this.If it wasn't for Elmer Bernstein's score briefly quoting the late Richard Markowitz's theme for the original TV show in one cue, it would have almost nothing in common with the breezy and exciting original show (note that the credits, either at the beginning or the end, include NO mention of the source at all). The series was a true one-off, a bizarre but diverting mix of science fiction, espionage and Westerns (in one episode West and Gordon were sent to India); the movie was a ham-fisted mess that, had it truly captured the feel and fizz of the show, could have been a huge hit AND been a good movie as well. Instead you have Will Smith as... well, Will Smith; you have one strained scene after another (note to filmmakers: if you put Will Smith and Salma Hayek in the same movie and decide to have one of them do a sinous belly dance, for the love of God pick the short Mexican one!); you have Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh (and Miss Hayek) investing this with more dignity than it deserves; and you have precious little excitement and not much for your money.For an idea of what this film COULD have been like, watch either the original show or the only series in recent years that comes close to capturing its spirit, the very wonderful and unfairly cancelled "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." You won't get to see Salma Hayek's bottom, but you also won't get any large mechanical spiders, jokes about cripples and/or blacks, or idiotic tack-on pop songs over the credits.And if you choose the original show, you'll also get the REAL Miguelito Loveless.

		<fullReview>Although the TV show this was based on was made before I was born, I managed to see reruns on TNT, and it's pretty good. Robert Conrad and Ross Martin played James West and technical/scientific genius Artemus Gordon. They were both excellent actors who had great rapport with each other. And the stories were fun and exciting.But Jesus, this movie, seems we can't dog this dog enough. The casting of the main characters is okay: Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon, and I can slightly accept Will Smith as Jim West. Although a black guy doing the work he is doing, during the tail-end of slavery, is hardly believable, suspension of disbelief would have been easier without the friggin' asinine story and the infantile dialogue. For some strange reason, their characters were adversarial and foolish, and not those who are to guard a United States President. Every actor here was misused and Barry Sonnenfeld should have known better!Kenneth Branagh is a bad guy with a thick southern drawl and no legs, WHY? Kline and Smith in drag, WHY? A prolonged, double-entendre', sitcom-like conversation about fake boobs, WHY? A racist/cripple exchange between Branagh and Smith,*rather than a gentlemanly but tense chat!* WHY?? Salma Hayek's ass crack, WHY??? A giant mechanical spider, WHY?? The Fresh Prince in a Western, WHY????Seriously, if there ever was a modern day western to see, then watch the TV show, Shanghai Noon, or The Quick and The Dead. WWW may warrant a look for it's excellent special effects, notably a well-crafted chase scene involving flying buzzsaw discs (but topped considerably by a similar chase scene with Dash from "The Incredibles"). However, to sit through this entire film, you'd have to be a fly that likes horse crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i usually like to consider myself open enough to sit through and enjoy nearly any movie but wild wild west was, hands down, one of the worst movies of the year, if not the decade. a totally worthless "action comedy" the whole movie feels like Smith and Kline are going through the motions while trying to breathe life into a stillborn script. while the performances by the two give something for the audience to watch, the rest of the movie lies dead on the screen behind them. the only good news about wild wild west is that if you were a fan of Smith before this won't destroy it, but it won't add anything to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild, Wild Waste.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now when I went and saw GONE IN SIXTY SECONDS, I thought I was seeing a movie about the audience of Wild, Wild West. This movie was one of the worst of 1999. After all of the great movies that came out in the year 1997 and 98, I thought for sure that 1999 would be great, but I should have known since I really didn't see a lot of good action trailers for 1999 movie season.The writing was bad and as far as I'm concerned, if you saw Will Smith in ID4 and MIB and in Bad Boys, you've seen Wild Wild West. He's practically playing the same characters in every movie he is in and I'm getting sick of it. That's one of the reasons why I couldn't stand this movie. And I some how knew Salma Hayek would appear nude in the film the first time I saw her on screen and realized that this movie was going no where. Sure enough that happened later in the film and I'm like, GROW UP PEOPLE!!!!!! This exploitation of females in the movies has got to stop! When Smith did his nude scene in the film, it was done in a way that you wouldn't be able to see much if not anything at all. Not that I want to see Smith nude because I don't. And I don't want to see her either because I respect females in the movie and would rather not have to look at them in that form. It's being down right disrespectful.I didn't like the constant fighting between West and Gordon. I have seen the original series, and I can tell you that when it came down to who was in charge, West was. Did West flaunt it? No. Why? Because who was there to bail West out of trouble? Gordon was. So we have an equilibrium here. I liked the casting of Kline in the movie as Gordon, but all in all, I didn't like the chemistry.The plot was bad, the jokes were bad, the egos were being tossed all over the place and wanted my money back. When I go to a movie I really enjoy, I feel as though it was done so with money well spent. With this movie, I felt like my money had disappeared and was gone in sixty seconds. But hey, WWW was much better that Battlefield Earth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty good. As far as plot goes, It HAD a plot... Save the kidnapped scientists and destroy loveless. I don't know how someone could have missed that. The movie was pretty funny, and the actors went well together. I saw what this movie got from critics and it was bashed with all negatives. It deserves more than that. This movie was more of a serious one then Will's other ones, and not just a comedy. I thought the story wanted you to think of him as a marshal, and not some guy who runs around telling jokes and shooting things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West (1999, Dir. Barry Sonnenfeld) When a body is found and the killer is identified as General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Levine), Capt. James West (Smith) is sent to find him. Thanks to U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kline), who was also on the case, McGrath manages to escape. Discovering that the legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Branagh) is the real villain behind everything, West and Gordon must work together to track Loveless down.With Will Smith in the lead role, you would think that WWW would end up as a fantastic film. It is entertaining, but fantastic is something that it is not. Everything is there to make it a good movie, and you even have four great stars in it, but unfortunately, there are not enough jokes, to make it what you was expecting.And they say you scientists are supposed to be smart. - General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine)</fullReview>

Not every film can be as good as Men in Black. This film is just bad. I don't even reccomend it to kids. The story is so ridiculous I don't want to even go into it now. True, the talent in this film is great, but they are undermined by a 80-ft tarantula. And does Will Smith have to do a song for every damn movie he's in.

		<shortDescription>the worst movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are going to make a movie based on a much loved TV show have some respect for the show,this movie has none.It takes a show that on the whole was not that bad and turns it into a really bad joke.Will Smith as James West?! James West is supposed to be a western James Bond is there an Actor that looks less like a western James Bond then Will Smith.He was only cast because of his name power at the time and it show he is not ever trying in this movie,he just keeps yelling his lines at the screen.The rest of the cast is so awful i don't even want to talk about them. The thing that makes it worse is that they have all done good work in the past that is good but here they don't even seem to be trying.Then there is the direction. Has there ever been a more incompetent director than Berry Summerfield? The "Plot" is just awful.Doctor Loveless(who in the TV show was a great character with Richard Keel as a henchman)is now a guy in a wheelchair who wants to use a gaint robot spider(That there is no way he could build in the 1860s)to kidnap the President and take over the west. Never mind that the ONE spider can only be in ONE place at once and that all you would have to do to stop it would be shoot it with a buch of cannons and that the vice president would take over for him and Grant would not be able to surrender to him,this is a Will Smith Movie.Don't even get me started on the cross dressing scene.Every piece of "plot" just leads to a mindless scene that is only there so that Warner Brothers can show you that they know what CGI is.In short this is the worst movie I have ever seen,and it makes the Awful Men in Black 2 look like a classic.I can't believe this made more money than the Classic South park movie on it opening weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sucked big time. Not that I had high hopes but all the actors involved have actually acted before. Some of them more frequently than others but hey (Will Smith acted once see "Six degrees of separation"). Salma Hayak as always is pretty darn hot but not even her nice little package was enough to resurrect this ball of dust.Kenneth Brannagh is the absolute pits. I've seen him read one of the best speeches ever written by Shakespeare in Henry V (Battle of Agincourt) and to see him running around on a mechanical spider gets a big thumbs down from me.If the movie itself didn't suck enough then Will Smith butchering Stevie Wonder's "I wish" should be enough to make everyone sick.I hope they all got paid well for this. ~Peace</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While trying to kill Southern General 'Bloodbath' McGrath, Captain Jim West crosses paths with US Marshall Artemus Gordon who is also after McGrath in order to uncover the brains behind his operation. With major scientists going missing all over the world, the President puts the two men together to prevent crazed Southerner Loveless from carrying out his threat to take over the US. The two team up using West's shoot first approach and Gordon's gadgets to take on the high-tech weaponry of Loveless.Every year we have blockbusters that throw money at the screen in the hope of buying sufficient hype and effects to make people watch. Some times these films are actually quite good or at least OK but often they are shocking wastes of money that are just plain awful. That is the case here. Not having ever seen the TV show I can only imagine that I am missing out on the knowledge necessary to enjoy this film. The plot is just a spin on the mismatched partner movies we've all seen before, however here it goes into all sorts of cross-dressing and stupid gadget antics.The action scenes are reasonable but are spoilt by just how damn stupid the whole thing is. The gadgets are just daft and the use of disguises and silly events just make it seem even more silly and not worth while. The overblown effects shots are just daft and the supposed 'visual climax' of the ultimate weapon is laughable.The spark that existed in Men in Black is totally absent here. I had ZERO laughs all through this film. Only two in-jokes actually raised a smile (an amusing 'His Master's Voice' and a dig at Lawrence Kasdan). Smith tries hard but to see the Oscar nominee dressed up as a belly dancer is just plain embarrassing and he makes a fool of himself. Kline also is foolish and doesn't bond with Smith one bit. Hayek is wasted in a small role and the film's only interest in her is in her body, cutting to her ass as much as possible - she is a better actress than this and the film does her a huge disservice. To talk of how awful Brannagh is in this film is to understate the fact. This man, who I have seen recently in 'Shackleton', 'Rabbit Proof Fence' and 'Hamlet' being excellent is terrible here ? he overacts to the point that it isn't even fun ? it is just plain daft and annoying. Having him only have half a body just makes it all worse somehow.Overall this is a rare thing ? a summer blockbuster that will stick in you memory, it's just a shame it sticks for all the wrong reasons. It is absurd yet incredibly unfunny, full of good actors but lacking a single good performance and very expensive but just looking ridiculous with every increasingly dumb special effect shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get the hate for Barry Sonnenfield's Wild Wild West. I just don't. It's like I saw a completely different film than the entire rest of the continent. To my knowledge, there's me and a couple other friends I know who love and cherish it, and the rest of the world has seemingly cast it out into the cold, inexplicably bashing it no end. Wtf. It's a rollicking good time, full of a brilliant blend of situational and slapstick humour, lively characters from a great group of performers, incredible production design, and a dash of swash and buckle. It may not have much in common with the 1960's era TV show its based on, but kudos to it for breaking new ground. Will Smith plays Marshall Jim West, a cocky (there's literally a small window of freeze frame where you can see his ebony schlock in full glory. And don't even ask me how I know that), ballsy (ok sorry I'll stop) secret service cowboy badass who is working a case against some nasty villains who want to use president Ulysses S. Grant for diabolical ends. He's led to old foe General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine in a show stopping, wickedly devious southern psycho role) a confederate lowlife who will hopefully lead him to whoever is kidnapping the nation's best and brightest scientists for some Bond villain-ish scheme. West is joined by kooky inventor Artemis Gordon (a classy Kevin Kline) and the two embark on a shoot em up quest to thwart the evil plan of Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), a dastardly mega villain with plans for America that don't involve presidents or laws or anything sane. The film is endlessly inventive, wildly funny and parades forth a reel of set pieces, each more amazing than the last until we realize we're actually watching a fifty foot tall steam punk mechanical spider stomp all over the Utah desert (there's a priceless story involving that and the film's odd duck of a producer Jon Peters, which you can watch Kevin Smith regale an audience with over on YouTube). West and Gordon are joined by sultry Rita (Salma Hayek) a Femme Fatale with a hidden agenda who tags along under the guise of damsel in distress. It's just plain fun and I still don't get how anyone could dislike it. Witty barbs, raunchy double entendres and sarcastic banter permeate the wonderful script. Nifty gadgets, detailed costumes and clanking machinery speckle the epic production design. An atmosphere of playful fun oversees all of it from beginning to end. Smith and Kline make a dysfunctional buddy duo for the ages, squabbling right up until the last frame. Branagh hams it up so far over the top as the bad guy that he nearly implodes on himself. Levine is deliciously creepy and crusty. Watch for other gem performances from Bai Ling, M. Emmett Walsh, Debra Christofferson, Sofia Eng, Rodney A. Grant and Musetta Vander. If you've seen it and already love it, good for you let's go have a beer. If you've seen it and hate it, you're a silly bum (to put it mildly). If you haven't seen it, do so, form your own opinion and fall into one of the above two categories. It's a classic for me.</fullReview>

You've got the main character, a whacky bunch of people surrounding him, AND a villain with no legs, a steam powered wheel chair AND a giant steam powered spider machine. You can't take this movie seriously and it was never meant to be taken as an art form. The critics are way to hard on it. After all the work they put into this the so called critics watch it from the comfort of their chair, adding no value to this, and criticize. Wow. Maybe they should get real jobs.

		<shortDescription>Worst Hollywood blockbuster of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WILD WILD WEST truly is a stinker of a film. Words cannot adequately express just how inane and endlessly trite this stupid, effects-filled movie is; ostensibly it's the big screen adaptation of a '60s cult TV show, but in reality it brings out the very worst of the Hollywood blockbuster sensibility.The main problem with this film is that it goes for the action comedy template, particularly heavy on the buddy buddy humour. Will Smith was riding high after MEN IN BLACK, but he's really bad here, and I mean really bad. As for Kevin Kline, you can barely believe that this was the same guy from A FISH CALLED WANDA; you actually feel sorry for him. The humour is all of the toilet variety, with a particular focus on oddly misogynistic cross-dressing jokes which quickly become old and rather disgusting. It's one of the unfunniest so-called comedies ever to make it to the screen.Kenneth Branagh gives the worst performance of his career as the hammy disabled villain, and much of the extensive budget was given over to a huge CGI mechnical spider which hasn't aged very well at all. As for the actresses, including Bai Ling and Salma Hayek, they're literally treated as pieces of meat. Barry Sonnenfeld has directed some junk in his time but even he must be ashamed of this one. It's hard to believe that between them the writers of this thing were responsible for the likes of PREDATOR, TREMORS, and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.Incidentally, WILD WILD WEST holds a special significance for me as the only film I've ever walked out of at the cinema. I believe in staying to watch a film to the end, no matter how bad - after all, you've paid to be there - but this was so appallingly awful that I felt I had no choice but to leave halfway through. Having recently watched the thing again right through to the end, I'm glad I made that choice.</fullReview>

Kevin's on screen chemistry against west works so well in contrast to Smiths acting. Kenneth is hilarious as Dr. Loveless and puts on an amazing show with his accent and raw talent. He plays a Southern Renegade so well and executes a real believable scheme. Please stop comparing to other things and laugh at what is funny. Yes it's different than the TV show and no it's not the best directed film but ever time I watch it I enjoy it. Just enjoy the magic of the film. This is for you Mr. Smith.

		<fullReview>Barry Sonnenfeld's Wild Wild West is a film that I have avoided for over 15 years. I have no frame of reference with the source materials, but even though I'm a big Westerns fan, it wasn't this, or the critical pounding it got on release, that kept me away. It was the original trailers for it, it just looked like a garbled over budgeted mess - which it kinda is. However, that's not to say there isn't fun to be had, because for all its many failings (poor effects, poor script, waste of a strong cast, superficiality), there is some verve and swagger, excitement, Will Smith's likability and some splendid gadgets. Having very low expectations no doubt helped me out, but I would hardly call this a 1/10 type of film. I say chill out with a beer, turn the home cinema speakers up and just roll with it, because thinking about it too deeply could possibly make you angry... 5/10</fullReview>

I'm going to start with the accuracy of the movie which is 5% accurate, why they have a Lincoln look a like president I don't know, the director probably didn't know any presidents around that time. Why the hell they got machines and vehicles in this movie I do not know, I mean cars hasn't been invented until the end of the 19th Century and where did that Giant Mechanical Spider come from. Also that bloody flying vehicle, hey Wright Brothers some one beat you at it. I really think the director should do this research before filming this movie.Now on to the storyline, one word for that Lame!. It's like a spoof version of the real life civil war assassin "John Wilkes Booth" who assassinated Lincoln after the civil war. I said to myself when watching this, it's like Maverick meets James Bond with the gadgets and diabolical machines.The actors in the movie lets start with Kenneth Branagh, never get a English actor to play a pure Red Neck, it doesn't work!! Kevin Kline, even though his funny in every movie I seen him in, I didn't think he that good in this, he was to predictable. Salma Hayek, I found her very annoying in this movie. Finally Will Smith, sorry but in Independence Day his Quotes and out-liners "Welcome to Earth" were painful, but in this it's even worst, I just couldn't watch it because it was irritating.Finally I like to say please take westerns seriously, this movie is a piece of s**t that needs swiping up.</fullReview>

Not only is there no mention of race in this incredibly and overtly racist time, but Will Smith, again a black man is given the job of protecting the president. It just doesn't make any sense, and it's disrespectful to an audience to make them try to believe this story. I am disappointed in Kenneth Branagh, who made a masterful version of Hamlet, for even being near this movie when it was being filmed. This movie is characteristic of many different things that are wrong with Hollywood, including representations of race, lack of feasible, intelligent, or original plot lines, and overall bad writing, acting and directing.

Who were tier aimed audience? Kids? Adults? People who remember the TV show???? It fails on all possible levels. Its just inanely stupid and insipid.

		<fullReview>This movie had none of the feel that the original t.v. series did. It was terrible. First off, I like all of the main actors in it, but with the possible exception Hayek, they were horrible miscast. First off, I love Will Smith, he is great, but considering the time of the movie, who is going to believe him as a secret service agent just after the civil war. Chances are he would have been lynched by a few people during those times for being the way his character was. That part alone strains any credibility given the times they were supposed to represent. Klein a very good actor is just too comedic and the rest is just wasted. It is way too special effects laden. Even the t.v. series as far-fetched as it could get never became that over the top. Maybe tongue in cheek but, not as much as this movie did. It is and was a big budget fiasco that tries to make the 19th century too much like an Independence Day Goes West. This has to be all of the main actors very worst movie. This is definitely a suckfest in celluloid.</fullReview>

Hollywood better quit while they're ahead in making these recurring big-screen misfires made from old TV shows. Based on the series of the ?60s, the U.S. is threatened world domination so President Ulysses Grant pairs up an undercover Secret Service agent with a 19th century Marshal, and together they must battle the criminal genius known as Dr. Arliss Loveless (Branagh) to bring him to justice. Perhaps the worst western-comedy ever made, with extravagant special effects and overdone costumes, and a roll of miscasts, especially Smith as James West.

		<shortDescription>The Only Movie I've Ever Truly HATED</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film came out I was completely hyped to see it. I mean who wouldn't be? Branaugh, Smith, Kline, Hayek, Sonnenfeld; how could it miss? My sister saw it first, and although I usually value her opinion on films, there have been exceptions, so I overlooked her advice and went to see for myself. This is one of the few times I wish I'd listened to my sister.In my opinion there are a handful of movie categories; great, good, not good but has redeeming qualities (ie cinematography or editing), fluffy fun, barely worth the effort, and NEVER should've happened. I had to add the last category when I saw WWW. What a waste of some brilliant talent. Branaugh's character was impossible to redeem. His dialogue was way too cheesy, his manner inexplicable. Kline and Smith don't fare any better. While there is the occasional joke that plays off, they are to few and far between to even rate this as "not good but has redeeming qualities". The story was beyond stupid, the 'plot twists' could only be laughing referred to as such. The entire range of dialogue was sickening. Oddly one of the few scenes worth the time for me, is the one most hated in general. It's the verbal sparring match between Branaugh and Smith, with the non-PC references. They were offensive, but that was the entire point. If they had used that take, being funny without trying to pander to political correctness, through the film they might've made something worth $8.50. Instead it looks like they tried too hard to be PG-13 with most of the comedy. In addition, the effects were pathetic, the cinematography (which at least should've been good based on the time they were working with) was parochial at best, and even the costumes seemed annoying. Overall this movie was a majorly failed attempt, and an unforgiveable waste of some of our best comedic performers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Everything about it was horrible. It was boring mostly, and stupid. Will Smith and Kevin Kline really ruined a major part of their careers with this crapload of a movie. I give it 1 star out of 10 because I laughed at one thing in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The talent in this "western" has went south!!!(*SPOILER*!!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of time! Kevin Kline is the only one who can truly act. Kenneth Branagh is overacting and miserably hammy! If it weren't for Kevin Kline, this would have been another vehicle for Will Smith's "talent". The original show was better. SPOILER ALERT! At the end, West and Gordon are on Lovelace's spider! What an inanely stupid remake of a better show! Overhyped drivel. However, the special effects, even thought they were good for a western, drowned the story. If they ever remake the story, focus more on plot and character developement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smith, Gordon's gadgets, physical comedy; second half is better (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not about the west until about halfway through, though it does start out in West Virginia. But the title actually refers to Capt. Jim West, a Civil War veteran who is sent to New Orleans to search for General McGrath and several kidnapped scientists. His partner is U. S. Marshal and wacky inventor Artemus Gordon. McGrath, however, is not the real villain in this movie. Dr. Arliss Loveless, an evil genius whose inventions are even more sophisticated and terrifying than those of Gordon, lost his legs and several vital organs in the Civil War, and he is still bitter that the South lost. We later learn that he wants to take over the United States. Among his weapons: a new type of cannon called a 'tank' which killed many innocent people during the war and is still causing death four years after war's end, a magnetic collar (responsible for many laughs in the second half), and an 80-foot tarantula.Smith's ability to deliver funny lines, plus the lines written for him to say, almost make this movie work. There is quite a bit of physical comedy, particularly in the second half, and West and Gordon make a great team. Gordon's crazy inventions include a device that puts West under the train they are riding on (good for a number of laughs), a flying machine, a bulletproof vest, pool balls that put people to sleep, and an 8-ball that is really a bomb. Kevin Kline is really good as both Gordon and President Grant, and Kenneth Branagh is a deliciously evil Loveless. In addition to the comic violence, unfortunately, there was real violence, and more explosions than I really cared for. Also, during the first half, I was beginning to worry that this movie would be a bomb. The second half took care of that. It wasn't brilliant, but it wasn't terrible either.SPOILERS FOLLOW:Kline was good as both Gordon and the President, sometimes at the same time. An early scene in the White House was quite funny because Kline was posing as the President, but the real President later walked in. The same gimmick was used when Grant drove the golden spike to mark the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad (which was funny in itself because the spike kept falling down). And we never really knew which was which in that scene.Gordon liked to dress up as a woman, which got West in trouble at Loveless' party in New Orleans. He hit on a white woman thinking she was Gordon, and nearly got himself hanged. A black man couldn't do that in the South of the 19th Century!At the end, the President announced the formation of The Secret Service, naming Gordon and West agents 1 and 2, but never identifying which was which. Giving the partners something else funny to argue about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be used only as fertilizer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie set a new standard of excrement for a summer blockbuster. The writing was atrocious, the acting horrid, and the whole execution of the project a complete shambles. It's bad enough when you take a bad tv series and make a piece of drek, like Charlie's Angels; but, when you take a great series like The Wild, Wild West and turn it into this mess, it should be criminal.Everything about this movie is a failure. I don't have a fundamental problem with Will Smith's race, had a better rationale for his character being a government agent been presented. Unfortunately, not much thought was put into that aspect and race only becomes an issue when it can be used for bad jokes and cliched plot points. Kevin Kline could have been a good Artemus Gordon, had the script given him anything to work with. I'm completely convinced that Kenneth Brannagh can't handle anything not written by Shakespeare, and not always that.There's no chemistry in this film, the jokes are lame at best and offensive at worst. The plot, what there is of it, is weak; and that stupid spider just doesn't work. A spider machine could have worked had greater care been taken, but this just screams crapola. Anyone who has seen An Evening with Kevin Smith or has heard his story about his Superman script, knows who bears sole blame for the giant spider. And whose stupid idea was it to change Dr Loveless from a cultured, but demented dwarf to an annoying redneck? That person should have to build and maintain a shrine to Michael Dunn as penance.Anyone who is thinking of renting or, god forbid, buying this movie, don't! Pick up anything else or read a book; just skip this movie. We don't want to encourage any more films like this. Better yet, seek out and watch episodes of the original tv show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In serious need of a rewrite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, we get a really, REALLY bad movie, and it's bad for mainly just one reason alone: the script. `Wild Wild West' is an example of this.First of all, I do like Will Smith, but casting him as James West was probably a mistake. Nearly all of the jokes in the movie center around the fact that West is black (I'd like to point out to those of you who didn't watch the early TV show that West was not black). When I heard that George Clooney was going to have a role in this movie, I assumed automatically that he'd be playing West. I was pretty shocked when I found out that he was only offered the role of Artemis Gordon. Clooney reminded me instantly of West's character on the TV show, he would have been so perfect for the role. This is not meant to be a racist comment in any way, but if a white man would have been cast instead of Smith, then we wouldn't have to deal with so many `black jokes', and the movie probably would have greatly improved. It's not only the jokes on West that drive me nuts; pretty much all of the jokes just aren't funny. When Smith pushes on of Loveless's assassins out of the giant spider and says, `That's it, no more Mr. Knife Guy', all I did was roll my eyes back and think, `You've got to be kidding me'. And sorry, but all those jokes on Hayek's character were excessive if anything (I have to admit, I was wondering throughout the movie if she was just acting stupid or if that's the way she really is). The script for this movie was just horrible, plain and simple. They made the whole thing to be a huge joke on the fact that James West was black. I heard that Robert Conrad, who played the original James West on the TV show, was completely disgusted with what Warner Bros. did to a show that he put so much work into. Personally, I don't blame him. This was once a great TV show, and so much could have been done with it to really improve it. Warner Bros. gave it tons of potential, but they never followed through.

In this case I don't for winning the worst picture of 1999--but this movie is very very boring.The acting, even by then-Oscar winner Kevin Kline and now-Oscar nominees Will Smith and Salma Hayek are poor. The script is weak, directing is bad, and it is terrible movie but the real worst movie of 1999 was the Haunting.If I were years younger when I saw it (i was 19, maybe too old) then I would have enjoyed it. This movie should have been edited to get a PG rating--it's a kids movie, even a teen seems like being too grown up. Grade: D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Smith returns to his old 4th of July haunts, but doesn't live up to his past glory with the disappointing Wild Wild West.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will plays James West (originally a white role), a U.S. Army member. Kevin Kline is Artemus Gordon, a U.S. Marshall. Together they are asked by the President to protect the country from the evil Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Also in the mix is the sexiest woman in Hollywood, Selma Hayek who plays a relative of a kidnapped scientist. West and Gordon aren't a good mix, with West being the muscle and Gordon being the brains, but in the end they end up working well together and saving the planet. And Selma Hayek tags along for the ride. There really wasn't anything special about Wild Wild West. The story line wasn't really original, the characters weren't really original, and the special effects actually looked kind of bad. They spend millions of dollars putting together a giant mechanical spider, yet a scene with Will and Kevin walking across the desert has to be blue screened, and blue screened badly? And please explain to me what Selma Hayek had to do with this film? Don't get me wrong, I obviously love her (and you get to see a little more of Selma than you might be used to), and she has never looked better in my opinion, but her character served no purpose. If you took her character out of the movie, nothing would change. I realize that in an action film geared towards a male demographic, you need to put a woman into the action, but at least make her have a point. Look at other 1999 action releases like The Phantom Menace, The Matrix, and The Mummy. All three were action films geared primarily towards young males and all three had beautiful female leads, but the difference between those three movies and this one was that those females leads had important roles that played an integral part in the film. Smith was his usual enjoyable self. Too bad he didn't have a character that was interesting. Kline's Artemus Gordon was fun enough, but for a guy who was really into gadgets, we didn't get to see a whole lot of fun ones that I thought would have made the movie more fun. Branagh was, well interesting as the legless Loveless. Didn't really figure out where the character was from. He was supposed to be from the South, yet at times sounded like he was from England trying to do an American accent. The supporting cast was OK, and not very memorable. And of course Selma looked incredible. Wild Wild West was a mindless, sometimes humorous film. But when I left the theater I really couldn't remember any particular scenes (except one of Selma) and didn't have a good or bad feeling. Basically I felt nothing.</fullReview>

Too bad for the guys and the gals in the special effects department, who did a good job. But Hollywood still hasn't learned that special effects do not make a movie.

		<shortDescription>Not funny. Bit of a handicap for a comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugely humourless adaptation of the tongue-in-cheek sixties spy western TV series. It's a shame, as I loved the steam-powered gadgets and spy gimmicks, Brannagh's maniacal, wheelchair-bound villain (with quartet of bad babe henchwomen in tow) and Smith's cool update of the series' central, charismatic and undeniably white hero, James West.But even Smith can't save what is essentially a comedy movie with precious little comedy. Both he and Kline don't seem to get a chance to cut loose and make the parts their own, and as a result their characters have zero chemistry together. Brannagh's villain is imaginative and well realised, but his dialogue is wretched, and Salma Hayek gets to do little more than stand or run around looking sexy in a procession of bosom-enhancing period costumes. OK, so no complaints there, but a little bit of character would have been nice.Still, the effects are good and there are certainly some unique scenes, unless you can think of another movie where an 80ft mechanical spider rampages through an old west town. It's just a shame it was let down by a criminally unfunny script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've only seen Wild Wild West on video. In my opinion, it's a pretty good movie, but not the best. Will Smith shows fans everywhere another action-packed adventure. Will and Kevin Kline made a great pair in this movie. The script was adequate, with the exception of some funny lines between these two characters.Selma Hayack had quite an ideal part in this movie. Short, pretty, talkative, and showing quite a bit of clevage. Lots of special effects, guns, fight scenes, catchy hit single by Will Smith, and cool gadgets and inventions gives the movie a bit of a shove in the right direction.If you want a movie that you can just watch don't have to think about, then this is recommended.Overall 6 out 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite enjoyable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Will Smith and his movies. I enjoyed ENEMY OF THE STATE, INDEPENDENCE DAY and even MEN IN BLACK. So I watched WILD WILD WEST for tradition's sake, I guess you can say. It was 1999's July 4 Will Smith hit. I am positive that this is the worst I have ever seen Will Smith in. I tried to enjoy this movie, and at parts I did, but most of it was lame and not very enjoyable, I'm sorry to say.Dr. Arliss Loveless, (Kenneth Branagh) a confederate rich bad guy is trying to sell parts of the USA to the highest bidding countries, using his giant machines of destruction (walking mechanicals spiders and stuff) to take hostage of President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline). The two best agents the U.S. Government has, James West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (also Kevin Kline) are sent to stop Loveless and save the president, as well as the country. West also has a personal score to settle with Loveless, since he was responsible for the death of his parents. The beautiful Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) tags along to try and save her father, who is also being held hostage by Loveless. She attracts the eye of Gordan and West.The acting jobs in this are fair, but the writing spoils it. The gorgeous Salma Hayek is underplayed, and her character is pretty much pointless except to have a good-looking girl in the movie. Both Will Smith and Kevin Kline do fairly good jobs acting, but the characters are too boring to enjoy. I'm not sure if Kenneth Branagh or the writing is responsible for the incredible stupid and annoying Dr. Loveless.This movie is very similar to Men in Black, only less modern and on a smaller scale. (save the country, not the planet) Another big difference between the two was that Men in Black was more fun, cooler, and had better characters, villains and gadgets (not to mention Tommy Lee Jones). If you are in the movie for a Will Smith movie, go rent ENEMY OF THE STATE. If you're in the movie for a lighter Will Smith movie, go rent MEN IN BLACK. I'd try to avoid WILD WILD WEST, but give it a try if you like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never heard of "The Wild Wild West" TV show before hearing about this movie. When I heard the premise, a sci-fi western about two James Bonds with six-shooters, I was very, *very* excited. The combination of the two genres was both visually appealing and clever! I made it a point to read nothing about the movie, and avoided the preview trailers, so that the best scenes wouldn't be spoiled.Unfortunately, my efforts were wasted.. the best scenes were few and far between, and many fell flat. The movie spent more precious time with strained sex jokes and implausible/nonsensical scenes (the lynch mob being the most glaring) than developing the premise to full potential. There was no suspense, very little imagination put into the gadgets (though I did enjoy seeing everything steampowered), and cliches galore. Will Smith was underwhelming and Selma Hayek nonexistant. Kevin Kline was enjoyable, though.The plot went nowhere and the characterization hardly subtle or clever. Overall, I was sorely disappointed.Oh, and can *anyone* explain how the "robot man" Smith was fighting on the spider shorted out?!(BTW, hope I didn't rip anyone off with my summary, but I don't want to wade through 182 comments..)</fullReview>

I heard that Sonnenfeld says he wants to work with The Fresh Prince in every movie from now on. If that's so, God help us, because he was a complete miscast for Wild, Wild West.It's a shame that the artists at ILM won't have their name seen by the audience, who will undoubtably run from the theatre as soon as the credits roll (I ran before that point). Their work is spectacular, but is eclipsed by everything else that is bad about this movie, as is almost always the case with spectaular effects.The opening credits are the only other good thing in it. Nice design work.1/10... not even a rental.. wait until they push off an episode of Dawson's Creek to show it on the WB channel.</fullReview>

Branagh's southern accent is even worse than James Van Der Beek's in Varsity Blues. Salma Hayek overdid everything and was just there for looks. Also Kevin Kline seemed to not want to even be in the movie.Even if you can get past the fact that there's an 80 ft. metal tarantula (beautiful 3D), Armani suits, a train from any cartoon, armani suits with quarter glasses, and all the repeating backgrounds (even after they walked 20 miles) the movie isn't that funny. There were 3 times that I was contemplating leaving, but then I saw an effect that made me stay.If you're looking for a fun, exciting, good movie, this is not it.Congratulations is deserved to Elmer Bernstein and ILM though.

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the studio plants and hype -- disappointing at the most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hoped Wild Wild West would be a really fun movie, but it wasn't. Normally a standard movie with pretty good acting, directing, story, music, dialogue, etc., is about two and a half stars. What adds let's say another two and a half stars to make it great is extra aspects and special touches, a spark of originality, or a bit of unique entertainment. Unfortunately, with Wild Wild West, we have most off the latter, in a moderate degree, but not much of the former. The original 1960s spy spoof Wild Wild West is a great piece of classic TV history and Americana, and this new movie suprisingly does a good job of being faithful to its source. Jim West as a black man is fine, and Will Smith does okay. He is a very charismatic actor, who can carry just about anything, and is the best thing about this movie. But here's the bad news: this is his worst movie yet, and his worst performance. Never has he been so lazy in his wisecracking strut, and never has he had such a large volume of bad one-liners. Kevin Kline is okay as Artemis Gordon, and Kenneth Branagh is also "all right," hamming it up as the legless Dr. Arliss Loveless. Salma Hayek has a pathetic and retarded little role designed simply to flash her butt-cheeks a couple times, and all the other supporting characters aren't much better, except for Loveless female cohorts. The direction, cinematography, and editing were decent, but they weren't able to make you excited or gripped at all by the action. The script had some clever bits (like the double-entendre banter between Loveless and West), but overall it wasn't that funny.The sci-fi technology is appealing, but the sets and desert CGI looked pretty fake, and the brief parts we see of the Old West look like an underpopulated group of actors in costumes on soundstages. The movie just wasn't realistic, or grounded in any kind of reality. This isn't because of the bizarre goings-on, Men In Black was a great effort from Sonnenfeld and Smith, and was everything this movie isn't. They had a great concept, they started out good and quite promising (loved the opening credits), but tripped shortly into it, and skidded the rest of the movie until it slowed to a stop at the ridiculous and dumb ending. Maybe I would have been less objective if I saw it with a big crowd, but my Thursday night 9:30 showing had about 35-40 people in it, who were largely silent-a bad sign. The guy who said this was 100 times better then Star Wars is a proven plant from Warner Bros., so ignore him. If we had taken time to get to know the characters, and believe the story and surrounding, instead of being forced to accept "because it's there," it would have been a lot better. They messed up big time, and I suggest waiting until the dollar theater, or better yet, video, where you will enjoy it a lot more.For those of you who still doubt, I'm a teenaged guy who is very forgiving. I thought Godzilla, The Avengers, and Wing Commander weren't that bad (the latter being the best of the bunch, and the two former being "okay, but lacking and disappointing.") I feel guilty being disappointed with a movie so many like, when usually it's the opposite. The song and it's companion music video are good though. &gt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flat Like the Pancake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this-- the trailer was great-- will looked really hot, I love Barry Sonnenfield, big special effects-- but now I think it was mostly the Will Smith song that made it.Nothing in this film was funny, nothing was exciting, nothing was intriguing, nothing was clever, nothing raised my pulse at all. It wasn't exactly BAD, it was just so absolutely flat. And the best part about it was certainly Will Smith.This is one of those films that just kind of passes before your eyes but doesn't involve or excite you at all. If you need to pass two hours in air conditioning, there are still a lot of other movies out there you can see for the third or fourth time which you would get more for your money out of than this one. You may want to see it because you (like me) are addicted to special effects. Well, like I said, there are other movies you can see again...There may be legitimate reasons to see this movie, but I can't think of any right now. Go, don't go... it doesn't matter to me, and it won't matter to you.It could be that people who find two hours missing from their lives and think that they've been abducted by aliens were actually watching Wild Wild West.--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a screenplay this bad could spoil talent this good. When you combine the incredible acting ability of Kenneth Brannagh, the inestimatable humor skills of Kevin Kline, and the sheer charisma and style of Will Smith, not to mention the capably quirky directing of Barry Sonnenfeld, you would expect a very entertaining movie.Or at least not this drek.This movie, plain and simple, stunk to high heaven. Everybody tried so very hard, but to no avail. The script just was too muddled and clumsy.In particular, I'm remembering a scene in which Smith and Brannagh, as hero and villain, are exchanging rejoinders. The lines are meant to be witty, but they're not. They're meant to be cutting, but they're not. They're meant to be enjoyable ... and they almost are, due to the talent of the two actors. They're trying their best, you can tell, to take those stupid lines and make them convincing (in much the same way that Gene Hackman did with his part in "Superman IV"), but even these actors aren't up to the Herculean labor this entails.And poor Kevin Kline! He just seems to have a knack for finding films that waste his talent; worse, make him look like a bad actor. Anybody remember "In and Out", that homophobic movie that felt like a two hour "knock-knock" joke? The man is talented; we all know that. Look at "A Fish Called Wanda". "The January Man". "Sophie's Choice". His work in NY's Shakespeare in the Park. This is a good actor, and for such a great actor to look so bad ... oh, the humanity!Don't see this movie. Trust me. But also don't give up on the cast or director. They have talent, really. Buckets of it. You just can't tell in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Bad Roadrunner Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought The Mod Squad was as low as you could get on this classic TV show to Big Screen Film jump a lot of studios seem to be doing. Before that was the very disappointing Avengers. My new low is The Wild Wild West not only because it was SO bad but because it had so much potential. I don't know what movie BadBoy-11 saw but it sure wasn't the same one I did. The only thing I can figure is that Will Smith has to be BadBoy-11 or maybe it's someone whose career depends on this piece of crud. It's hard to insult a 60's TV show but this movie did it. You're better off watching reruns of the original then wasting your money on the film. I heard George Clooney backed out of this film and I have to say GREAT CAREER MOVE George you have some taste! How this bad script got past Kevin Kline's usually great taste is beyond me, the money must have been too good to pass up. Can you tell how much I dislike this movie yet? The only dance scene I hated more then Will Smith dressed as a woman in this movie was the one in The Mod Squad (don't ask). Do I have anything nice to say? Okay, I liked the RCA dog / megaphone scene but 98% of the audience will miss that because they either have a) fallen asleep b) walked out, or c) have their eyes closed because they can't stand to see a very good TV show made into a very bad 170 million dollar BOMB! My advice to Warner Brothers if they convert any more TV shows is to go back and see what you did right (or should I say WRITE (that's a hint!)) on The Fugitive because that was best TV to big screen film yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Wild Waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to say this is a great film; it could have been - but it isn't. It's a sad waste of Will Smith, Kevin Kline, and Salma Hayek's acting talents. Kenneth Branagh does give a terrific performance as Dr. Loveless, but the character is so one-sidedly nasty, that watching him becomes uncomfortable.This is obviously a movie that storyboarded well. Unfortunately, they forgot about the other elements that a good film needs: a story, a script, characterization, and pacing - not to mention music (this film has the worst score I've ever heard outside of the porno industry).If you've seen Independence Day or Austin Powers or were a fan of the original series, you'll be terribly disappointed with this film. In fact, you could make a laundry list of everything that those films do right that this one does wrong. Except for a glimpse of Salma Hayek's butt (sorry girls you don't get to see Will's) this one isn't even worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The music video is much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To jump right into the point, I did not like the movie. It lacked the action which these types of movies are expected to have, and it lacked the good writing you'd expect when action is substituted by words. Will Smith is himself minus the funny jokes, and Kevin Kline was a victim of the bad direction and the boring dialog. I kept wondering why they picked Kenneth Branagh for the role of the southern villain, and I never got my answer. There was no chemistry between the characters as none of them connected on any level. All in all, it was an incredible waste of talent (and money).The only cool thing in the movie was the giant spider robot. However, there is so much a robot can do without good programming.This is going to sound weird, but I think the music video is a lot better than the movie itself. It has more action, more sex and better writing.</fullReview>

First of all the paper-thin plot involved some General Loveless and his giant spider machine kidnapping the president so he could take over the United States. The machinery and Will Smith as a cowboy seemed all out of place in the 1870's southwestern setting. And worse, except for a few jokes the movie wasn't funny. Kevin Kline and Will Smith as women were just plain revolting. The good actors, decent directing, and art direction couldn't even save this Godzilla-sized stinker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great to look at with inventive gizmos, but everything else didn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just want to say I really wanted to like this movie, but I have to agree this is not like the wonderful series it took its inspiration from. But while it looks great- some of the scenery is fantastic- and there are some inventive gizmos especially the magnetic collars that attract metal blades, it just didn't work for me. So what drew me into seeing the film in the first place. Obviously because I wanted to see if it was any good compared to the series, but also the cast. People, this is a great cast, but the poor writing and surprisingly unfocused direction simply wastes them. Will Smith is like marmite you love him or hate him, for me it is dependent on the film, but I cannot deny he has winning charisma. Sadly that didn't come through, Smith looked uncomfortable here. Same with Kevin Kline, usually good at delivering fun and witty lines, but because the writing was so poor he seemed stuck. The worst case though was Kenneth Branagh as Dr Loveless, this man is simply brilliant in Shakespeare and is a good director in general, but here he shamelessly overacts and I also disliked the treatment this film gave of Loveless. We know that Barry Sonnenfeld can direct comedy, the two Addams Family movies are proof of that, but here his direction is unfocused. The special effects are overblown to say the least, plus the plot is really predictable. The biggest problem though was the writing, even though I am not a scriptwriter or do nothing in the film industry I could tell how smutty the dialogue was, the one-liners particularly below average. And the climax with the mechanical spider was badly drawn out, not helped by the poor design of the spider itself. Not even the music by the brilliant Elmer Bernstein could save this film, there were times when the music felt rather overpowering and that is extremely rare with Bernstein. All in all, tries hard with a couple of redemptions, but it didn't work. 2/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one great looking movie...and that's about all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the flashy looks and beautiful scenery of this movie, this is absolutely nothing but corny action, bad dialogue, mediocre acting and nonsensical direction. This film is like filth coated with gold shavings, and beneath it's flashy exterior, there is no other reason to see this, unless you're twelve years old or younger.Evil inventor and confederate Arliss Loveless (Keneth Branaugh) is on the move, and it's up to veteran of the civil war, James West (Will Smith) and good guy inventor Artemis Gordon (Kevin Kline) to stop him. To add to the eye candy, Salma Hayek is thrown in the picture when West and Gordon rescue her from Loveless, and she literally has nothing interesting to say or do, adding to the general tone of the film. When Loveless is out to kill President Ulysses S. Grant, West and Gordon really have to try their darnedest to stop him, but it's not going to be easy, when he has invented a giant mechanical spider. The craziness and chaos ensues.I'll start with the positives, though I have already stated the sole positive aspect of the film. This is a great looking movie. The west has never looked so vibrant and colorful. The special effects add to the dumb and goofy storyline, but they also look really cool.The negatives...where should I start. The acting is not horrible, but it's not good either. Kenneth Branaguh is mainly known for his directing and acting of Shakespearean plays, and in those plays he gives over the top performances. He does the same here, and though he is a fairly dastardly villain, at the same time, it's hard to take him seriously. Will Smith has charisma and charm, but he acts just like he does in every other movie. This is the late 1800s, not 1999, so why does still act like a modern guy? Because that's what the fans want, and that's what the idiot writers came up with. The plot is really stupid, as is the script as is most of this train wreck.Some scenes may look cool, but they don't make sense. For instance, in one scene, the camera is about 30 feet away from the President who is at the opening of a new railroad. Everyone including the president is blissfully unaware that Loveless is coming with the giant improbable spider. We see the spider's giant leg step into frame, and then the President realizes that he is under attack. This little technique used here is trying to surprise the characters and the audience at the same time, but it just doesn't make sense. Why wouldn't the president be able to see the spider before we do? It's coming towards him on a flat plain with no trees. He should be able to see this thing from a mile away, not when it gets right next to him. Another scene features Gordon and West riding on what we assume are horses. The camera backs up, and we see they are actually on the giant spider, and as the camera backs up, we begin to hear the loud noises this machine is making. Why does backing up make us hear the spider, because logically it shouldn't. It's that same awful technique of revealing something to the audience in a scary or humorous manner, whether or not it makes sense.Though I could gaze at this movie's beauty for a long while, at the same time it makes my brain hurt from under use, and my ears bleed from awful dialogue. Eight year old boys will probably give this flick a standing ovation, but most others will start to turn this off as the life gets sucked out of them.My rating: * out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for language, violence and some sexual comments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If "Wild Wild West" has any ultimate value as a movie, it may be by showing that star power, action sequences and a lavish effects budget won't automatically form a great movie unless there is careful thought and planning put into the production. The first ten minutes are particularly choppy, to the point of discouraging further watching. It does then settle down to be barely passable and watchable, but it cannot escape the fundamental and multiple flaws inherent in the production, and should leave the average viewer with the sense of having wasted their time. On the plus side there are a couple of nice little touches here and there, Will Smith is generally as smooth as ever and not all of the jokes fall flat, but mostly it's a muddled effort.Firstly, the movie never settles on a consistent tone. Is it a comedy, or an action movie? Or is it a western with sci-fi aspects? It is actually a hodgepodge of all of these elements, and with due diligence and a stronger script it may well have been a success at spanning so many thematic parts. In reality the struggle for tone is exacerbated by confusion as to which audience it is intended for. It's a little too smutty for kids, and a little too clean-cut for adults. For those who like action in their action movies, there are certainly many sequences, not all of which are particularly well-choreographed, but there are also lengthy passages where not much action takes place at all.The plot, of course, is as far-fetched as can be, which can be overlooked as it's almost the least of the film's problems. Smith brings modern-day smarts and sensibilities to his character, which comes off as a little disorientating in a film set in the 1860s. Kline's performance is nothing to write home about, but he does his best with the mundane role he has been given here. Hayek is completely wasted as the female object of desire who is strictly along for the ride. However, far and away it's the gross miscasting of Kenneth Brannagh as the supervillian that really sticks out like a sore thumb. In one particular scene between Smith and Brannagh comes the film's biggest transgression ? a series of racial and disability-based insults for which there cannot be any artistic defense in what should be a basic, harmless action movie. While the film is set in turbulent times just after the Civil War, it seems the film-makers felt they had to make a point of playing up the racial aspects, and disparaging comments are made about whites and blacks throughout the film. It's actually quite bizarre to imagine how anyone thought this was a good idea as it detracts sharply from the movie and should be a big discouragement to anyone thinking of letting children watch it.</fullReview>

If you want to see a funny Will Smith movie, see Men in Black, don't bother with this.The only thing worth giving a star to this movie is you see a butt shot of Salma Hayek(is that how you spell her name).I heard the only reason that Will Smith was proud of this movie was because it gave him the freedom from his 4th of July box office hit expectations.

		<fullReview>Let's face it, that movie was one of the biggest disappointments of the 90s. As bad as the Avengers. I am a BIG fan of the series. The series wasn't perfect, but it set up its own little universe where anything was possible and I went with it. All of that was chucked in the film. There are so many things wrong that I'd be here all day listing them, but here goes. 1] The casting was fatally flawed. Smith was his usual smart-mouth jerk self. He was as out of place here as popeye would be in Empire Strikes Back (but not Phantom, but that's another topic). Kline almost had his character down, but I could never see him becoming friends with smith-jerk. No chemistry was evident between them, and that's a major problem. This is my big beef with this film. Smith is so wrong for this film that I was never in the story. He's the weakest link in all the films he appears in, mostly due to his attitude. I'd like it if he just went away. His character here would have been killed on the spot the moment he opened his foul mouth. No one acted like he does until the late 20th century, and the world is not better off because of it. Rosie o'donell would make a better James Bond. 2] Story- It's obvious that the crew had never watched more than a single episode of the series. Very few of the basics were done right, and they were mis-used. Artemus is a master of disguise, but never in women's clothes. This is some cross-dressing writer's nightmare. The train was excellent, but the leads acted as if they'd used it for years instead of their first trip on it. Kline and smith just seem to plod along, always bickering, until they trip over Loveless and his scheme. No where is there any hint of intelligent research or fact gathering. Robert Conrad said it best-"This film was made by an ex-hairdresser and a ex-set designer, and it shows. Maybe they would be better off in their former jobs." No talent is on show here, except for the CGI crew, sets and Elmer Bernstein's music. An incredible waste of time and money. On top of all that, they destroyed the town built for the movie "Silverado." This will be forgotten about soon, while the series will live on forever. Rating: 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I'm a fan of the original series and Will Smith, Kevin Klein, Kenneth Brannagh and Barry Sonnenfeld, but...oy! What a completely joyless flop!This is actually a perfect bean-counter's film: put all the elements in that you know previous successes were based on, have pretty people (male and female) show up and act smug on screen, and then blow things up. Part of the "old school".Blurf. Boring. No surprises, none at all. "Godzilla" was grand opera compared to this. Will Smith walks on, smiles, gleens and preens and does his "Fresh Prince" gig...completely out of character and time. His performance has all the elements of the "star quality walk-on from Airport '77", except this one last 90 minutes. Sonnenfeld's sense of direction and momentum seems to be a bit lost, as if he just gave in and let the excesses mount. From Verhoeven I'd expect this, but in Barry...Salma Hayek is completely wasted...she's hardly even a plot twist, much less a plot device (she had more to do in the video!) Only Kevin Klein and Kenneth Brannagh show any flair and sense of the adventure.Save your nickles and wait for Will Smith's next flick...so long as he and Sonnnenfeld check their ego at the door.</fullReview>

Will Smith should be embarassed at himself. He has made some decent movies ("ID4" for example), but this movie puts him in the ranks of Eric Roberts, Leo Rossi, and Shannon Tweed. If he makes another movie like this, he'd be better off sticking to Cinemax after dark movies--or possibly Lifetime Television for Women Original Pictures.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And I have ALOT of time on my hands. I've seen ALOT of movies.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will is such a fine actor, what was he thinking. No chemistry between Will and Kevin Kline. Kenneth Branagh must have needed the money because I can't believe this great actor and director is in this mess of a movie. Salma Hayek and Bai Ling are a real waste here, they can do much more and better. The futuristic contraption that appears throughout the movie, looks very much like the big bug from Independence Day. They put more money and care into the wardrobe and the look of the film than they did the script.....big mistake!! I guess they thought with all the promotion that was done for this movie,they had another Men in Black on their hands, with all the music and product tie-ins. One more thing.....how does a song from Enrique Iglesias "Bialamos" tie in with this movie, is it with Salma being latina? I don't know but that seems kind of lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was clear from the theatrical trailer that Wild Wild West was going to be a Will Smith vehicle, we had the music video, lots of wise cracks and some excellent olde-worlde special effects to go on. I decided based on the trailer to skip the film at the cinema and pick it up on DVD. I'm glad I did.Wild Wild West is a bloated film, over the top in a somewhat agonising kind of way. It relies on Smith's happy go-lucky charm, some good effects and Salma Hayek's impressive cleavage to get through its 105 minutes running time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tied with the awful Avengers for the worst adaption of a classic 1960s TV series. It makes me wonder why anyone would bother to pay for the rights if they aren't going to make anything that bears much resemblance or makes good use of the original's concepts. Sonnenfeld who did such a great stylish updating of the Addams Family seems to have been drinking absinthe when he cast Will Smith as James West. Smith is a fine actor but he's no more suited for the part than Jim Carrey or Tom Hanks would have been either. Did no one notice he and Kevin Kline didn't have one tenth of the chemistry that Robert Conrad and Ross Martin did? The reinvention of Dr. Loveless is not only Kenneth Branaugh's worst performance but an insult to the great work Michael Dunn did on the original series. The whole film misses the charm of the "James Bond in the old west" that allows for the fun of repeated viewings of the classic episodes. Atrocious attempts at humor add nothing. Perhaps Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could have captured the arch flavor of Conrad's work. A sad waste of another beloved childhood favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a question for all of the people involved in the making of this movie. Did you spend any time at all watching the old TV series? Did you spend any time trying to figure out what made the old show popular? Or did you spend all your pre-production time thinking up all the cool special effects you could use??!!I was a fan of the old TV show. I like Will Smith. I like Kevin Kline. I like Salma Hayek. Obviously, I expected to like this movie.I did not like this movie.Perhaps all my complaints can be summed up with my criticism of Will Smith in the lead. He does NOT play James West. He plays Will Smith. He plays the same character he played in "Men in Black" and "Independence Day." Not one person involved in the mess, in fact, seemed to care one bit about the original TV series. Well, if you don't like the old TV series, why try to make a movie out of it?Go figure.</fullReview>

How could it not be great, it had a great Director, 2 of my favorite actors (Kline and Smith), and a horribly under-used Selma Hayak and a T.V. show that was perfect for movie translation. What a terrible waste of talent. As with so many action flicks, they forget the most important part is still the screen writing. a little deeper character development could make the difference. It could also be it was in need of one actor change. Instead of Kenneth Branagh, how about Alan Rickman!

However, when they both agreed to make this movie, I believe that Pheobe Cates and Jada Pinkett Smith should have had both of them committed. This movie is one of the worst ones that I have ever had to sit through.(But I haven't seen Universal Soldier the return yet either, so don't quote me on that) There is practically no action, the plot is ridiculous, and what really makes it sad, is that the cast had what it takes to make a great movie, unfortunatley, the script did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie hoping that it would at least be entertaining and maybe find a few laughs along the way. I was saddened by the fact that I found neither. I had heard many people come away from this movie disgruntled that they had wasted not only $7 to go see it but they had lost 100 or so minutes of valuable time from their lives. There are much better things to do with your life such as getting that all important root canal work done (without painkillers). This pathetic attempt at grabbing a familiar title (from the classic TV show) throwing in a couple of big name actors and adding a few fire works just to rake in a quick $100 million is not only insulting to those who endured this rubbish but it is a terrible waste of two talented actors. Of course what's more pathetic, the fact that Barry Sonnenfeld made this movie or that enough people had nothing better to do with 2 hours of their time than to sit through this drivel.Not only was the humor void of any substance but by the time you realized that they were trying to make a joke it left you with more of a groan than a chuckle. And the only half way interesting story line (the one between Salma Hayek and her kidnapped father/husband....whatever!) was barely mentioned as a point of reference before it was buried deep within this abysmal quagmire. Do yourself a favor SKIP THIS MOVIE ENTIRELY!!!!!!</fullReview>

All in all a dumb movie that will be forgotten within months. Barry Sonnenfeld should do something he is capable of, e.g. produce a sequel to th Adams Family which is one of his better movies.

		<fullReview>I was quite keen on going to see 'Wild Wild West' the first time I saw the trailer but a bit more dubious after a second viewing. However, I still dragged myself out when it hit the local cinema yesterday afternoon and was glad I did ... if only to be able to warn you not to bother.I enjoyed a few things about the film. There were some good jokes and visual gags, and a bunch of fascinating 'steampunk' inventions.Unfortunately, apart from a few highlights, it seemed as if the script was an early draft rather than a polished product, and the plot was left limping from set piece to set piece. What really left a sour taste in my mouth was the inclusion of a significant number of offensive jokes. I didn't think it was justifiable for the black hero and the disabled villain to tear verbal shreds off each other with a succession of cheap puns. Bearing in mind the predominantly young audience of the film, this seemed very irresponsible.I suppose the bottom line for me was that I was hoping for an entertaining film of the same calibre as 'Men in Black'. I was disappointed and, particularly in view of the prejudicial jokes, I would suggest that you look to see what else is showing before paying your pennies for a dose of 'Wild Wild West'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh, the humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to start this article with a full list of what I consider to be this movie's advantages (or the reasons for one to watch this film). The first item of this list would probably be the amusing jokes and situations throughout the movie. The two other items would be Salma Hayek's butt and Salma Hayek's cleavage. Other than that, most of the movie was senseless infantile trash, suitable material for yet another episode of "Power Rangers".The movie, based on a 1965 TV series by the same name, tells the story of one Jim West (Will Smith), a supposedly extraordinary US marshal, and another one Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), a supposedly extraordinary US marshal as well, shortly after the civil war. While the two are separately investigating the same certain case, they bump into each other and are teamed by the president to save the USA. They reveal a conspiracy by one Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) to take the USA apart so the land would be handed to its "rightful owners" (namely Loveless himself, as well as Britain, Spain and Mexico). Loveless' intentions are to make the president sign the contract for the USA's surrender after taking the entire US hostage by producing a mass destruction weapon, developed by high-caliber scientists, which were kidnapped and enslaved by him. The gunman West, teamed by gadget-man Gordon, are out to destroy Loveless' plans and save the world.The result of this plot (a fairly standard, chewed-up "good vs. bad, good kills bad and saves the world" plot, actually) in this case, is a movie lacking any sense or logic (or coherence with history), which will by no doubt insult the intelligence of any brain-equipped viewer over the age of 15. I suppose the gimmick of the movie is the fact that at those times there were no electricity, so all the gadgetry had to be completely mechanical. The answer to the electricity issue, however, was always steam and springs -- starting from Gordon's spring loaded gadgetry and the reasonable steam powered train and tank, and ending with the completely preposterous steam powered wheelchair (controlled by a joystick and possesses some amazing remote-control capabilities), or a steam powered megaphone (!). Another scene presents some supposedly powerful (yet small) magnets with a rather peculiar behavior (a full list of all the factual mistakes in this scene, not to mention the whole movie, is far beyond the scope of this article). Besides the technical lack of logic, some actions performed by some of the characters are absolutely senseless as well. An example for such irrational behavior lies in the final duel between West and Loveless. I will not describe the actual act here so I would not "spoil" for anybody (as if it is possible in such a predicted film).Some compare Will Smith's character (Jim West) to James Bond. I find this comparison utterly groundless. How can one compare the elegant yet discreet and cunning gentleman, working in the secret service of her highness to the brutal rash man who deals situations by "shooting first, shooting again, shooting some more and after everybody dies, trying to ask a few questions" (as was put by one of the movie's characters)? How can one compare the deliberated and clever agent to the hot-blooded US marshal who slaps the breasts of a woman in public, during one of the scenes? Bond would never do that even if he were certain the woman is indeed a man!While the movie is very infantile, it contains some very adult-oriented jokes and scenes in it, which I have found quite amazing (in fact, the film was rated PG-13 for this very reason), considering the other parts of the film. The peek at Salma Hayek's tush is actually quite innocent, but a close up of at Ms. East's (Ling Bai) rear-end in a G-String is not innocent at all. Such more scenes are probably the whorehouse scene (depicting half naked people), the fight on Loveless' "spider" (depicting some freaks of nature) and finally a scene where light is being projected through a man's once-was-head to see the last picture he have seen before he died (which, horrifyingly, turns into a joke as well, as Will Smith repeatedly mumbles: "T-that is a m-man h-head"). These scenes stand in contrast to the infantile content throughout the movie -- while most of the movie is probably appropriate for little children alone, other is certainly not. Having seen the movie with my 11 years old brother, I sometimes think maybe he shouldn't have seen it at all (although he apparently liked the movie).Finally, what really intrigues me most is the participation of a high quality actor as Kenneth Branagh in this silliness. I suppose he played his role well (a mad man's character, anyway), but I don't think this movie would look good in such an actor's resume.In the bottom line, the film might have been quite funny; but then again there are much funnier films. I gave it 2/10 because I could have stayed in the theater throughout the movie (although I have been with my little brother, a fact which probably prohibited me from leaving). If you are above the age of 16 and you have the choice, DO NOT go to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whatever happened to plot or character development? They tried to cram in too many unbelievable special effects and didn't bother to develop the characters. The one scene around the campfire was a poor attempt to give background information on the main character. It was too short and extremely unemotional. Everything went too fast and it was difficult to follow exactly what was going on. The television show was better at plot and character development on a weekly basis than this movie. Will Smith was very likeable as Jim West. Kevin Kline certainly had potential as Artemus Gordon but he came off as a whiner. Salma Hayak appeared to be a plot device with two main purposes. #1- Give the agents clues without them having to spend any time working for them. This allowed more time for overdone special effects. #2- A consistent source of cleavage!!! This movie was certainly obsessed with breasts.All in all, I was highly disappointed. What a great potential with the actors and the history of the TV show. Unfortunately the director seems to have decided that special effects are all that sells movies today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm directing the so-called "Director" of WWW, Barry Sonnenfeld, to see a John Ford Western. Maybe then he could learn how to showcase its' beauty and wonder without making it a convenient backdrop to an 80-foot spider, where the entire screen looked computer-generated--therefore, fake.Never have I been so offended at a movie for leading me to believe it was a Western, meaning the action was nowhere near exciting and the music does not lead to a sense of urgency. In fact, the music is dull. I can tell that Elmer Bernstein had fallen asleep when writing the music and just went with the scribblings he did while dreaming. Probably dreaming of a chick-flick where music isn't as important as an $180 million summer blockbuster.I'd be much obliged if someone could tell me what Salma Hayek is doing in this picture? That's it. She doesn't serve to help the film in any manner other than have guys stare at her body. Highly under used.The chemistry between Smith and Kline is nonexistent. When they're supposed to be "bonding" by challenging each other every other minute, I wasn't convinced that they were becoming partners. Kenneth Branagh should be crying himself to sleep after accepting the role of Dr. Loveless. Spewing racial epithets at Smith while circling 'round and 'round in his wheelchair were not worthy of his acting credentials.The humor? Flat. I laughed one time. I don't even remember which part, but I do know it was only once. Maybe a smirk or two once in a while, but only one actual guffaw. Scenes that might have been funny were extended for laughs, and didn't work. I'm yelling "Get on with it! It's not cute anymore!" and the actors aren't listening.This movie is the perfect example of how you can't buy a hit with money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible lightness --- boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With all the wonderful superstars cast in potentially delicious roles, it was more than a mild disappointment to find that it was technically brilliant but so empty! I normally love the brashness of Will Smith; his talents were wasted here. Meanwhile Kevin Kline was miscast as the weak geek. Although attractive, Salma Hayek was weak as a love interest. Brilliant in "Henry," Kenneth Branagh's rendition as a southern red-neck left much to be desired. Boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the avengers again?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for the past two summers, we have seen two films take their premise from a popular 60s television show, cast fine actors, throw in intriguing special effects and set designs, and fizzle like an open can of 7-up. i saw the avengers last summer when i was vacationing in london, and was befuddled as to why the film was conceived at all, let alone released. wild wild west brought up the same questions among my friends. smith, kline, and the usually delightful kenneth branagh brought much more to past movies such as much ado about nothing, the ice storm, enemy of the state, and so forth. even smith's goofy exuberance cannot mask the fact that he and kline have no chemistry (they never looked at each other the ENTIRE movie) at all. the dialogue is corny and flat, branagh is not believable as an evil southern aristocrat, salma stands around and looks beautiful, and so forth. to conclude my lengthy criticism, go south for south park if you can laugh long and hard without being overly offended, and wait for eyes wide shut in a couple fridays for intensity from the greatest of them all, mr. stanley kubrick. unfortunately, the west ain't wild.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie falls way, way, WAY short of the hype that preceded it. To say I was disappointed is understatement and I'm telling ALL my friends to not waste their money (and I have a lot of friends). There was a level of intelligence to the TV series that was lacking in the movie. If one were to separate the movie from the TV series, the movie still falls short. It was all too predictable and while Wil Smith is a good actor, someone else should have played Jim West. Robert Conrad's Jim West was cool and collected even under pressure. Smith's West couldn't get over "That's a man's HEAD." Conrad's West wouldn't have even flinched. If it were possible to give an F- grade, I would to this movie. Save your money, go see something else. Don't even waste your time renting it when it comes out on video.</fullReview>

The movie does an adequate job of using race as a plot element, but I would have preferred that color had been ignored. Considering that the hero was black, I don't feel that they did a good enough job explaining how he was in such high regard of the president.I have enjoyed Will Smith &amp; Kevin Kline in other movies.

		<fullReview>Lame! Quick breakdown: everything to blame for this movie lies in the crappy screenplay. I've heard better script ideas from a 5-year-old retelling his dream --and this was written by four adults! Smith does the same character he has in "Bad Boys," "ID4," "Men In Black," and "Enemy of the State," but he lacks his charisma and charm. He and Kline also lack chemistry. Hayek overdid everything --I feel she was only put in as a marketing coy. Oh yeah...the tarantula thing. How could that be possible in 1869 if it's not even possible now? And since it's 1869, what's up with the Armani suits and the quarter-sized shades? Too unbelievable for the audience to let slip by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe how bad this movie is. Not only is it unfunny and annoying, but it accomplishes the incredible feats of making Will Smith unlikeable and making Kevin Kline seem boring. And besides that, it has something to offend just about everyone -- there are sexist jokes (LOTS of them), homophobic jokes, and jokes about the handicapped, for starters. There's also a scene where Jim West (Smith) barely escapes being hanged by Southern rednecks, played clumsily for laughs. This scene really made me uncomfortable -- if you're going to milk humor out of a black man being lynched, at least give it some kind of twist. Almost everything in the movie feels uninspired, like all involved were just going through the motions. Salma Hayek is no more than decoration. Kenneth Branagh is entertaining in a couple of scenes; at least he tries awfully hard. The giant mechanical spider is pretty neat, and one of Branagh's henchman, a metal man, should have been in the movie more. This heavy-handed mess doesn't hold a candle to "Men in Black," and "The Mummy" remains the action movie to see so far this summer.</fullReview>

West and Dr. Loveless trade racial and handicapped insults in what must have been a writer's attempt attempt to be funny. It wasn't and the writer should return to school. They spend more time in the South than in the West.

		<shortDescription>They should use this in film school as a 'worst case scenario'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, here's my two cents. What it looks like is that somebody had the not-so-stupid idea of remaking the original 1960s James Bond/sci-fi/just plain weird 'Western' series into a big-budget movie. Then somebody else said 'Will Smith is interested!' and over the cliff we go. Cue a radical rewrite as a Will Smith 'comedy' vehicle. Smith looks great in a cowboy outfit, but as Jim West he sleepwalks through the movie, smug, self-absorbed and oddly detached from the rest of the cast. West is supposed to be best mates with sidekick Kevin Kline's Artemus Gordon character, but both men have all the chemistry of two strangers passing the time in idle conversation at a bus stop. Over-the-top villain Kenneth Branagh and his crew of female no-goods do strike the right chord, but they're not enough to save the movie. Selma Hayek is fine but woefully underutilized, and all players are at the mercy of an unfunny, ham-fisted and sometimes tedious script. Considering the rich possibilities offered by the original series' ideas, this dull, misguided movie is an outright heartbreak, along the lines of the similarly botched 'Avengers' train wreck. Hope they don't decide to remake 'The Prisoner' and then get a call from Will Smith's agent...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The moment I heard Will Smith was cast for the roll of James West I began to have my doubts. Will Smith has proved to be a fine actor in some recent roles, but at the time of this film he was still The Fresh Prince and that image was hard to shake. It was also hard to reconcile as an agent in 19th century America. It was like the 1980's had somehow merged with the late 1800's and produced something mutant.I found the humour, plot and acting uninteresting. It says something when you feel after 30 minutes you're money and time could have been spent elsewhere. The inside jokes and re-imagining did nothing to help matters. I'm in no hurry to see this again, though as a fan of the original television show I'd love to see someone take a more serious whack at this in a few years. More dramatic, darker, but with the occasional wit faithful to the TV show.</fullReview>

How can you have a film set in the post Civil War era with modern 21st Century slang? It is just inexcusable and ruins the movie. The writer should have taken the time to pay attention to this type of detail.Will Smith is not believable in his character at all due to the poor dialog and his weak insincere believability in his character. Smith does not compel you with his under-dramatic acting. His poor acting and basic boredom he brings the viewer ruins any chance of the film being remotely interesting. Its bad enough that the dialog is weak and the writer is clueless about the time-line, but when your lead actor shows no passion or drive in his role, how can the film possibly mean anything at all? I recommend skipping this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It just doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of the fans of the series, I went into this thinking that it was going to be a clever homage to the series. Boy did they sucker me in. I warn you, I am giving spoilers in this, so be advised.First of all, the pros:1. Kevin Kline. Personally, I find him to be inspired casting. My favorite role in the series was Artemus Gordon, and I can't think of a better actor to have played him in this. (Though now that I think about it, Jeff Goldblum could have pulled it off, maybe.) Kline manages to inject some life into his poorly written character, and I enjoyed every bit of him onscreen. Gordon in the series was a partial stage actor and disguise expert, and if anyone can pull that off, Kline sure as h*ll can.2. Kenneth Branaugh. Yes, he was over the top, yes he was a cartoon, but what a cartoon. Since it's obvious that his character is not going to pull off his sceme, I wasn't to interested in how diabolical he was. Personally, I thought he was enjoying every minute of his over-the-top role, (Though I could be misreading his look for despair) and It was quite fun to see this Shakespearian actor chewing as much scenery as possible.3. Ted Levine and M. Emmett Walsh. Both Levine and Walsh take their forgetable roles and turn them into something we remember. Levine is always a reliable actor, and before he is shot, and in his death speech to West, manages to take a role that we have hated through most of his running time and make us feel sympathy for him. That's quite a feat. Unfortunately, He is removed from the procedings far too early. And of course, the always reliable M. Emmett Walsh. Is their any role he can't play? I'm serious. He is Hollywood's everyman, Whenever there is a supporting role that could be wasted, he always manages to make it something you remember. He even manages to steal a few moments with his role.4. Salma Hayek as an ACTRESS. She really does everything she can. But it's not enough. It's not her fault. There's nothing in the character for her to do with. She's simply there for something to look at, and you have to feel sorry for her. I can imagine the studio's pitch now. "This will be a wondeful opportunity. You'll have a great script and a great role. The director of ID4 is attached, and so are Will Smith and Kevin Kline. Can you think of a better opportunity?" Those evil liars.5. The train. I loved it. Most of it's features were ridiculous, but it was lovely to look at, though not as much as Salma.The Cons:1. Will Smith. Don't get me wrong, I love Will Smith as an actor, but he did to many things to make the role comical. In the series, West had a few one liners, but for the most part he was stoic, and the comedy was left up to Gordon. This made it believeable that West could fight six guys at the same time. Whereas in MIB and ID4, Smith could kick some major *ss, in this, do to all the comedy touches, he seems like he would have a problem kicking his way out of a paper sack. Another thing that ruins his performance is an (I think) unintentional move to make the role 90's hip. This is the old West in the 1860's. Not the 1990's. It just doesn't work here. And put away those ridiculous sunglasses for god's sake.2. The gadgets. This was the most fatal blow. The original series relied on some out of place gadgets, but they were within the realm of possibility. One I remember was a recorder that West used to play back a conversation and make it appear that he was in a room while he was really scouting out a building. Even the most outlandish of inventions were usually believable and were, for the most part, modified trains, or the like. Here Sonnenfeld approaches Science fiction realms, and it is sorely out of place. Sometimes Barry, subtlety works better that going completely overboard. I can believe the bulletproof vest, but too many inventions were just ridiculous. and the whole Loveless thing. I can believe a man with his legs gone, but how does someone live without a liver? Where does the bodily waste go? Because when that happens to people in real life, it's usually fatal. Pool Balls that shoot out gas? I can believe an explosive, but GAS? There are many more, but I'm running out of space. I will say though, that some seemed to be there just to be there, and most served no purpose. Also, how does a man fall at least 4o ft. to the ground and not break something?3. The script, or the lack of one. Let me give you a simple synopsis of what happens. They meet. They find Loveless. They lose him. They find him. They lose him. They find him. They get separated. They get together again. They fight him. They win. During this, Salma pops up.If this appeals to you, then go for it.4. Salma Hayek's CHARACTER. What was her point? She added absolutely nothing to the film, save for a sexual object to be fought over by West and Gordon, and the film could have been reduced by at least ten minutes if she wasn't in it. Thought I will readily admit, she is lovely to look at, and what an *ss.5. The strained duo relationship. Seriously, how many times have we seen this? Hundreds. How many times has it worked? Very few, save for, say, "Jaws". Here, it doesn't, and the spark that made the series work is given up. I think the film would have risen above crap if they had liked each other, but not by much.6. Kevin Kline obviously looking like he wishes he were somewhere else. Poor Kevin Kline. I feel nothing but sypathy for him. As trained as an actor as he is, sometimes his disgust is apparent, especially when they have him dressed as a woman. I can undertand his feelings. I wanted to be somewhere else too as I watched this. He really does fight for his life in this role, and thanks to that, he is one of the few, along with Branaugh, Levine, and Walsh that manages to leave the procedings relatively smelling like a rose.I'm sorry. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. The fact that I liked most of the above actors cannot make me reccomend this film. It reaks of a turkey that was put out strictly to cash in on those who like Smith or Kline, or who remember the series with fond memories. Unfortunately, they spent too much on the special effects, and not enough on the script. It had the potential to be something great, but if fails. Miserably. See any of the above named actors in something else. They will thank you for it. Avoid this like the plague.* for Kline, Branaugh, Levine, and Walsh, and for Will and Salma doing their best. Not for anything else</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't care much for the original "Wild Wild West" series as I thought sometimes it was too smarmy for its own good. Compared to this big budget misfire, though, the TV series is a classic in sophisticated wit and sharp social commentary (as its fans no doubt attest to already, but no matter...).Let's get the biggest problem with the big-screen's "Wild Wild West" out of the way early: it has no sharply defined story. All right, it DOES deal with how Loveless (Branagh) kidnaps brilliant scientists to construct a huge metallic spider to kidnap President Grant to make him surrender the good old US of A to foreign interests. But there are so many useless side stories that go nowhere and extra characters that make no sense in any sub-text that the story gets fuzzy and becomes static at best, secondary to the FX at worst.Did anyone think Will Smith and Kevin Kline worked well together? We're talking two completely different acting styles here that don't mesh - brash, hip and street-smart (Smith) and classically-trained "legit" theater (Kline). It's not that they don't do well in the movie, but they just don't do that well in the scenes they have together - and since they're playing James West and Artemus Gordon, respectively, a lot depends (and fails) on that.And what was Salma Hayek's purpose? Romantic interest? Window dressing? Just plopping a woman into the center of the plot because there was one in "Men in Black", Sonnenfield's previous collaboration with Smith? Remember, Linda Fiorentino actually played a character that was important to the plot - and she was an actress (sorry, Salma) suited to the role. All Salma does is be beautiful. Though she's good at it, there's not much more to her part than that.Levine is unrecognizable under tons of makeup as Bloodbath McGrath, but he also gives the most creative and active performance of the group (well, him and Kline). Branagh does what he can in a part where it's all you can do but think about where they put the matte lines. And what was with Loveless' women? More window dressing, you'd think, and you'd be right. Hire models and you GET models.The special effects are good, though. The huge spider that terrorizes the Old West is well-done and the metal collars/ spinning blades scenes are imaginative. But then there's the story again.I was totally under-whelmed. A plot like this needs urgency but with all those writers laboring over the script (and you can bet there were that many more script-doctors brought in) you can safely believe that coherency is going to be the last product brought forth.One more point: Will can certainly handle a gun with the best of them, but he never seemed that interested in the goings-on. It's like he was caught in a time warp and, oddly enough, is the only black person we see during the whole movie. Is that a statement? Probably, but not an affirmative one.In the end, all you're left with is good FX in service of a bad movie. That usually isn't a bad thing, but when the aforementioned movie cost almost 200 million dollars to make... THEN it's a bad thing.Three stars for "Wild Wild West", one for each word in the title. Everyone involved will recover, I know, but I (and the rest of the world) really need to lie down and rest.Where's Robert Conrad when you really need him?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While WWW isn't perfect by any means, it's a much better and more entertaining movie than the many negative reviews suggest. Apparently a lot of critics had this odd idea that WILD WILD WEST was supposed to be Meaningful or something....Instead, it's a fast-paced if not very complicated light action flick, with superb work from Kevin Kline (pay close attention to the closing credits!), much scenery-chewing from Kenneth Branagh, and a score that cheerfully updates and expands on the TV series' original theme. Will Smith mostly does a credible job in the Jim West role, which is liberally re-invented for the movie. Not all of the gags work, but enough do to keep the smiles coming. And the gadgetry is consistently clever and effectively realized.Go into this expecting anything more than rock-em-sock-em entertainment (and a liberal quantity of innuendo and double entendre) and you'll be disappointed. Go into it expecting a couple of hours of skillfully-made light adventure, and you'll be more than satisfied.Me, I'm hoping for a sequel....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>totally awesome dudes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>you know, I went and saw this movie with a mate of mine and my wife, it was totally awesome, such a fun movie full of humour - we all enjoyed it. some of it is slapstick, some stupid, some clever but overall fun making the movie one of my all time favourite westerns (if you want to call it that). it is hard to compare it to another movie as I don't think there are that many in the same genre (ie: comedy sci-fi western). I'm surprised so many people here didn't like it, I cannot see why. without giving too much away, take a western, put some jackie-chan style humour into it (perhaps a bit like Shanghai Noon), stick some modern and futuristic and totally made-up wacky Bond-like inventions in it and what you have is a weird but wonderful mix - it also has a plot which is a lot better than some of the recent movies of the last couple of years in cinemas here 8/10!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just completely worthless in every conceivable way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tried to keep an open mind when I saw this, I really did. I have never been a fan of Will Smith, but I always hated him more as a rapper than as an actor, so I figured I could afford giving him another chance. Just a little footnote here; I didn't actually pay any money to see this. It was given to me by a friend of mine, who is a huge lover of movies. He simply couldn't stand it, and just immediately took advantage of the chance to get rid of it... not to say that I'm unhappy with that, though... I have enjoyed the few minutes of the movie where Salma Hayek shows skin. Anyway, the movie comes on. OK. The beginning looked decent, and the opening credits are in an interesting style which I've been told is quite reminiscent of the original series which this is a remake of/based on, even going as far as using the same music, or at least something a lot like it. However, from there and until the very end of the film, it slopes continually downward. The plot is a nonsensical mess. The editing is sloppy and lazy. The acting is just barely passable... even Hayek was disappointing in this. The characters are tired stereotypes, each and every one of them. The special effects are laughable. The humor isn't... it's just bad. Not even "so bad that it's good" bad, but more like "so bad that it's gone past good, and gone back to bad". Yes, I stole that line from Ghost World. The best line in the whole movie... anyway, back to Wild Wild Mess... sorry, West. Wait... West? As in western? This is a western? There's one single scene in which the "cowboy" in the film actually fires his gun. That looked semi-cool, but the surrounding film is just... so terribly pedestrian and substandard. The film has, I think, four or five somewhat entertaining scenes, or, rather, parts of scenes. Unfortunately, it's surrounded by so much pointless film. The few decent scenes involve Salma Hayek flashing her buttocks, which is most likely the primary reason for me sitting through (most of) it once. Others include Lai Bing(or is it Bing Lai? Whatever) showing her butt in a thong. Then there are maybe one or two decent fights and that's it. Almost two hours of film, and that's it. This film is honestly not worth sitting through, unless you're incredibly tolerant and have an almost unhealthy amount of patience and spare time. I would recommend you just search the Internet for the butt-shots and forget you ever heard about the movie. You'll save yourself a lot of grief and regret. The film is a prominent example of what you shouldn't do when making a movie, and it's only real purpose is to show to wannabe film-makers just to give them a good idea of what to avoid like the plague, when putting their movie together. I recommend it only to the biggest fans of the actors, as just about anyone else will hate this as much as it appears almost everyone else who've seen it do. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't take this movie too seriously you will enjoy it a great deal.It takes you on a fanciful flight through an unlikely Wild West following the adventures of Jim West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline). Kenneth Branagh's Dr. Loveless is truly an evil genius. I found the story to be kinda like Gunsmoke meets Star Wars. The action is fairly fast paced and doesn't get too bogged down anywhere. Definitely on my 'A' List for recommended summer viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you loved the original TV series, then you will like this film. I am surprised at all the negative reviews of this little gem. I loved it! The chemistry between the characters is outstanding, the witty banter fun, and the ridiculousness of the sci-fi style inventions completely captures the tone of the original show. It isn't meant to be a serious film! The cinematography is well done, quite the homage to the genre, and the goofy half-man bad guy is perfect! The pace is fast and keeps your attention. It is a MUCH better film that the boring recent release Cowboys and Aliens. That was a dud. Wild Wild West is lively adventure that is completely enjoyable! It is a fun film. Those who hate it have either never seen the original TV show (or have and didn't get it) or they have lost touch with their inner child.</fullReview>

"WWW" has the same "look" as Men In Black.Every great "bad guy" has to have a unique and original systematic way of killing off their enemies. "WWW"'s villain has one of the coolest methods I have seen in years (although it isn't that logically done. I mean,of course, the way West and Gordon can outrun a blade that is going fast enough to chop down trees or anything in it's way).Anywhoo, "Wild Wild West" is a very good movie, Although it didn't seem to appeal to everyone. Oh yeah, that giant spider was pretty neat too (although it is COMPLETELY impractical).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the theater expecting a spin-off of the television show I watched while growing up. Well, the names are the same, but Will Smith is way too tall to be Jim West! Likewise for Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon! But both of those guys, and Kenneth Branagh as the evil Dr. Loveless, were outstanding as they spoofed the TV show. Smith is a funny man and when given some excellent lines, he delivers. This is a movie which deals the race card, time and again, and everybody loves it. Smith, as a black secret agent in 1869, gets to whoop up on the "rednecks" and make them look inept and silly. And he has an excellent rapport with Kline, who does a masterful job as Artemus Gordon, master mechanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sick of people with problems with this movie. It was "Wickey Wickey Wild" and it "Got Jiggey With It!!" A whole bunch of morons complained about the giant spider. I'm of the school of thought that there are two things that can be added to improve any movie, one is a giant robot (or monster) the other is Don Knots of tv's "Three's a Company". A lot of people said "Oh a giant mechanical spider... that couldn't happen." Yeah that's right buddy that couldn't happen... IN FICTION!!! These people missed the whole plot. True it isn't the greatest movie ever made but it certainly was better than "Phantom Menace". It least it didn't have a cute kid; the one thing that can ruin any movie. My only problem was the trailers and adds gave away the giant spider, I think they should have kept that as a surprise like the Marshmallow Man in "Ghostbusters." Anyway it's not this movie that's not towing the line, it's western society. If it wasn't for the fact that this was a science fiction / action movie (and thus treated with bias by Holly Wood) Kenneth Branagh would probably receive an Oscar for best supporting actor. Anyway if you want to see a fun movie see Wild Wild West.</fullReview>

One could argue that Will Smith has been typecast this way, but I think he brings it on himself. In Independence Day, MIB 1 &amp; 2, Hitch, WWW, and I, Robot, Smith plays the same role. The movie is nothing but a vehicle for Smith,as are his other films. I only went to go see this movie because I like the theme song. Salma Hayek's character was a complete waste of the movie and really should have been edited out of the movie. Every other actor in this film was pushed aside to let Smith shine, not that it worked, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, understand that anyone who hates this movie is mean and can't have fun. There is nothing wrong with something that's popular. I don't like hearing about how people make careers out of making fun of things that other people like whether it's Will Smith, Ricky Martin, or some other band or movie that a large group of people like. "Wild Wild West" is a fun movie. It has everything an outgoing person could want, action, comedy, great cotumes, sets, special effects, and a good story. The original Jim West was white, but the movie pulled off having a black Jim West. They also put an interesting story behind him since black people weren't respected by stupid white people back in the 1800's. I happen to be a big fan of Will Smith, so of course he was just as great in this movie as he was in "Independance Day," "Men in Black," or "Bad Boys." Kevin Kline as Artemus Gordon was equally good. He was really funny. He and Smith made a great duo. They had great one liners together. I was mad that I was mad that I and a few other people were the only people laughing in the theater full of leeches. I really have to give credit to Kenneth Branaugh for his performance as Dr. Arliss Loveless. I knew him as a serious actor, and this is the first comical thing he's done. He's the third best villain of this year next to Darth Maul in "The Phantom Menace," and Agent Smith in "The Matrix." The scenes of action were exiting.I wish there were more shootouts, but John Woo didn't direct this. (NOT A FORM OF CRITICISM) I also liked the fight scenes where Will Smith beats up a bunch of guys in a warehouse, saloon, and inside the giant mechanical tarantuala. Anyways, I liked this movie. It was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With little excitement and pretty much no real humour, this movie is a definite failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the music video for Will Smith's "Wild Wild West" probably back when it was a current song, but for years, I knew very little about the movie. In fact, I just watched it for the first time eight years after its release. Since the IMDb rating is 4.1/10, it's obvious that this 1999 blockbuster isn't very popular, and after watching it myself, while it clearly wasn't as bad an experience for me as it was for certain other nay-sayers, I am not left wondering why.A former Civil War hero named Capt. Jim West meets a U.S. Marshal named Artemus Gordon while attempting to kill General "Bloodbath" McGrath. At the White House, the two meet President Ulysses S. Grant, who sends them both on a mission together to stop Dr. Arliss Loveless, an evil inventor who is a threat to the United States of America, and has recently abducted many great scientists! Unfortunately for West and Gordon, this mission will be made more difficult by a number of things, including some of Loveless' clever, life-threatening inventions! If you ask me, "Wild Wild West" does have some reasonable action sequences, and I definitely did occasionally find myself in mild suspense, but overall, it fails as an action movie, as most of it doesn't work, and is just plain boring. This 1999 blockbuster also fails miserably as a comedy, with one lame or mediocre gag after another. I did smile a bit, but don't recall ever actually laughing at any point. One gag I can remember off the top of my head is the "She's a breath of fresh a#%."/"She's a breast of fresh air" one, which definitely counts as a lame gag. Loveless' inventions add a sci-fi touch to this primarily western movie, which gets a tad awkward. Towards the end of the film, it gets even more tiring than before.I have never seen any episodes of "The Wild Wild West", the 1960's TV series which this movie is based on, but it seems to be very popular with those who have seen it, unlike this 1999 flop. Without a doubt, this film was a letdown after the successful "Men in Black", a film which, just like this one, was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and features Will Smith in a starring role. Since this movie flopped and the original TV series obviously didn't if it had a movie based on it made thirty years later, I think it's fair to say that whether you've ever seen episodes of the show or not, and whether you like the show or not if you have seen it, it's probably best to skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West (1999): Dir: Barry Sonnenfeld / Cast: Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek, Kenneth Branaugh, M. Emmet Walsh: Pointless and utterly stupid adventure that boasts nothing more than a budget. The only thing remotely wild about it is that it combines western elements with science fiction. Witless plot regards yet another world domination scheme by a villain whose body is mechanical from the waste down. He is played with extreme madness by Kenneth Branaugh in one of his worst performances. Will Smith plays Jim West who searches for kidnapped scientists. If they are ever found then they will have to live with the fact that they were part of this film. Kevin Kline plays a disguise expert whom West reluctantly companions with. Preposterous and silly plot with predictable mayhem that results in one of the biggest over produced pieces of junk to be released all year. It has interesting gadgets and a giant mechanical spider but it lacks the spirit of Barry Sonnenfeld's superior and similar Men in Black. Smith and Kline have little chemistry and Salma Hayek is ridiculous as a scientist's daughter. It is Branaugh who is the most unfortunate and placed in position of looking the worst as this nitwit villain. Insulting the creators of the original TV show is pretty much all Sonnenfeld accomplishes here. It should be left in a ghost town to be forgotten. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Wild Wild West" (1999) is definitely one the worst blockbusters of all time. It's a train wreck from start till finish. I guess in 1999 no one could have predicted that after the success of "Men in Black" both Will Smith and Barry Sonnenfeld would fail so hard with their next and even more ambitious (in budget therms) project. "Wild Wild West" is all over the map. It's has some nice concept but no content. The plot is so poorly done that you simply don't care what happens on the screen. Humor is so unfunny that you start rolling your eyes. Script, directing as well as everything else here were so poor, so miscalculated that this movie sometimes isn't watchable at all. The one could say that it had a good special effects sequences at the time, but when nothing works, effects don't help.Overall, there isn't any joy in this movie. Even if you are a die hard fan of Will Smith or movies themselves - "Wild Wild West" is surely not to be seen one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I enjoy watching and reviewing the hundreds of movies that I have on IMDb, there is an inevitable downside. Of course, I could sit and watch nothing but classics, the stone-cold iconic movies that have stood the test of time and remain loved by all. But then I'd be missing perspective and let's be honest, not every movie is a classic. There are those that make you question why you bother going to the pictures at all or inspire you to become an actor or director - not because you're good but because you can't possibly be as bad as those you've just seen. As a fairly prolific writer, I do have to dip my toes into the murky waters of Turkeyville but this bizarre sci-fi western comedy felt like a baptism of bilge. It was so focused on its unusual steam-punk take on the old TV series that it completely forgot to add humour, tension, excitement, chemistry or entertainment. You know things have gone wrong when Will Smith's dire "Wild Wild West" track is the best thing about a movie.Sharp-shootin' ladies man James West (Smith) is forced by President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline) to investigate the disappearance of several eminent scientists after things come to a head, literally, when one turns up decapitated. Unwillingly teamed up with inventive US Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kline again), West and Gordon track down their chief suspect - former Confederate General "Bloodbath" McGrath (Ted Levine). But McGrath is only the muscle for the suave, wheelchair-bound Dr Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) who has plans for the US almost as big as his secret weapon the scientists have been forced to create for him..."Wild Wild West" is such a monumental failure that it's hard to know where to begin. Aside from Levine, the cast are universally dreadful - Kline &amp; West are an awful couple on screen with zero chemistry while Salma Hayek, as the obligatory love interest, is a shadow of her sultry self. Branagh is probably the most embarrassed he's ever been, spending the whole film on his digitally-removed knees and overacting with a dodgy accent and even dodgier facial hair. The plot is utter nonsense, dispensing with any sense of reality from the first shot and getting worse as the movie goes on. I'd given up on the film when Kline blasts past the horse-riding Smith on a jet-powered penny-farthing bicycle. But the film is filled with insane contraptions such as the enormous mechanical spider, the train with more toys than Inspector Gadget and Kline's ridiculous pop-up notebook and pencil. I might have got on-board with the madness if the script made me care but it didn't. The jokes fell flatter than a Russian satellite (and the constant racial gags felt forced and uncomfortable) and at no point did I care what was happening, mainly because it was obviously written by a bunch of people on extremely strong medication.The only comfort I can take from this is the brief shot of Hayek's behind and the knowledge that movies are unlikely to get worse than this for the remainder of the year. Levine's performance also deserved better than this mess but overall, "Wild Wild West" misfires like a broken Gatling gun. It's all concept and no execution - even the CG effects look cheap and poorly done. The film-makers may as well have got the budget (an estimated $170 million), set fire to the money and filmed that instead. It should never have got past the planning stage but since Will Smith was in the middle of his cultural assault on the Nineties at the time, I suspect it was rushed through without giving it much more thought than necessary. This was a bad judgement on the producer's part - the movie more or less halted Smith's previously unassailable success by shooting it right between the eyes and marked the start of his career decline. The arrogance of youth can be forgiven for many things but inflicting "Wild Wild West" on us is a crime that should come with some serious jail time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the humor here was too adolescent for my tastes, but the guys did what they could with the madcap script. Will did his usual bankable job, and Kevin Kline was very good as well. I liked when he was playing President Grant. The Salma Hayek role was strange; she was little more than a decoration.However, the surprising choice of Kenneth Branagh as the dastardly Arliss Loveless paid off, as he was the best part of the movie (worth an extra star). Sporting an unusual facial hair design and dark hair, Branagh is unrecognizable, even when you know it's him.There were a few funny scenes amidst the lunacy, such as the one where Jim rudely whistles to get the attention of his own lynch mob, then proceeds to make the most ridiculous speech imaginable. I also liked the scene where Loveless and Jim are trying to outdo each other with decidedly un-PC insults. My favorite scene is when Artemis unveils his contraption to obtain an image from a dead man's retinas of the last thing he saw before he died. Jim is decrying this nonsense the whole time, but when an image of a man appears, he immediately proceeds to matter-of-factly and effortlessly read along with Artemis the entire text of a brochure in the man's coat pocket (at a distance, in the dark).Some people complain about racism in this movie. I took it not as racism but as making fun of racism.This would be a movie to watch perhaps at a party when you just wanted something on in the background, where nobody's really paying much attention, just watching a scene here and there. Mostly absurd, sometimes amusing and somewhat imaginative, with Steampunk touches. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things I Loved vs. Things I Hated !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly.. Things I loved : 1_The main idea of 2 against-each-other partners in the old west using advanced funny weapons. (thanks for the original TV show I presume !).2_Will Smith and Kevin Kline being together in a buddy-movie. Every one of them is a gifted force of nature and highly witty.3_The movie's own image : it presented polished, huge, attractively dazzling another world. The cinematography achieved what it madly dreamt of. The C.G.I was great. It managed somehow to reach "seemingly" to some of the 1960s' ambitious large fun like (The Great Race ? 1965) which by the way got a poster this movie (intentionally or not) was as the same as it ! 4_ Some of the moments for being so cinematic : President Grant tries to nail a pin to inaugurate the new railway then something appears. The wild mechanical spider (too imaginative). The intro of Dr. Loveless. Killing Loveless' hidden killers in the drawings. Jim fights the tricks of Artemus' train. And Loveless transforms into half-electronic evil man to combat with Jim.5_Some droll moments : "My name is West.. Jim West" said by Well Smith with all the ridicule of the world in his eyes. And the classic last shot (Yes, it's so classic and rare to end a movie by this pointless question and answer). 6 and 7_(Salma Hayek) in one particular bit I bet you know it and love it very much (related to a very creative pajama if you're still guessing !). Without a doubt it was the most memorable, stunning, wicked, and delicious moment of this movie as a whole. I believe they put it at one point to regain some of the 180 million budget back. Along with being nominated for the Razzie of the Worst Supporting Actress for this role, (Salma Hayek) already won the ALMA Award and the Blockbuster Entertainment Award as the best Supporting Actress for this very role ! I can see why ! Her bu.. Sorry!.. Her performance was so entertaining !8_The Wild Wild West's music video. This is the best music video ever made for promoting a movie. Before the theme song, its direction and Stevie Wonder's appearance?the girls' looking and dancing were fair enough and more enjoyable than many sequences of the movie itself. Then.. To things I hated :1_ The crippled Loveless, with detestable continuous jokes concerning his paralysis (OH MY GOD !).. Nobody was ashamed ? or feeling a little disturbed because of that ??!!2_The script. It's hasty, dealing with the matters as idiot as it can be. And most of all, it didn't connect the events (read : the action) that well, with easy solutions all the time ; they find Artemus' bag by accident to untie their bonds, Jim disguises as a horrible belly dancer to appear suddenly (!) and seduces the originally castrated Loveless who responds to her (??!!), so on and on. Not to mention the dry sense of humor like Jim's speech before hanging, the pun of Jim and Artemus conversation while the last was about to wear a woman's cloth; actually these were fine ground for comedy but they have been utilized ridiculously.3_Will Smith disguising as a belly dancer !!! That's certain.4_The way they handled the sexual fun ! I mean com'on folks, you had to re-shoot some new scenes after the test audiences' poor results (to inject some humor) so speaking of Salma Hayek, why the heck they didn't "inject" her in more appealing situations (concerning a dance maybe). Aside from Loveless's sexy girls ???? we didn't have the chance to feel their sexiness. That's one reason of this movie's floppiness I can tell you that.5_ Kevin Kline playing 2 roles !! All the people was confused : Why?, anyhow he didn't add anything especial to the role of the president. It looked eventually naive and pointless. So the score is : 8 good, 5 bad. Still an amusing time anyway. I was the only one who enjoyed it at the time of its release. It was banned roughly in a way that was over-the-top, and the regular audience just played along. I recall that right after it I read for one of my friends (great hater for the movie) a phrase of some review saying "the 2 leads act like everyone of them was looking to the other's image in separate mirror !" he told me blindly "yes, that's exactly it" nevertheless I still, to date, don't understand the meaning of it (and I doubt that my friend himself ever did !). I don't think also that it deserved all of these Razzie Awards. For little instance, the year of 1999 witnessed 4 other movies that were based on TV shows, (Wild Wild West) wasn't their worst at all, I'll give you their names to decide alone am I wrong or not : (The Mod Squad), (Dudley Do-Right), (Inspector Gadget), and the one and only (My Favorite Martian).. Remember the pain ! Therefore (WWW) is underrated crap that needed more and more time at making it to be a real top-notch crap. Although it's in my list for the worst movies based on TV shows, but still the most watchable among them definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nothing like another television show from the old days made into a movie. Wild Wild West stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline as a couple of government agents sent out by the president of the United States. Keep in mind here everyone, Will Smith was a higher string pick than Keanu Reeves for Neo in The Matrix to play the roll of Jim West. It all seemed to work out in the end though, so no complaints. However, yet again, the mysterious Barry Sonnenfeld has managed to yet again make a movie that did not do so hot in the box office, and has made a movie that can be watched time and time again when it airs on TBS Super Station. Oddly enough with all the criticisms that come with this particular movie, there is something about it that keeps me coming back for more. Perhaps it's the villain, Kenneth Branagh's witty charm as he wheels around in his very ahead of its time ? for the time period ? powered wheel chair, or the fact that his beard is very troubling, but mysterious at the same time. All in all this movie, even though not regarded as most as good, I believe to be one of the more interesting movies to close out the millennium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Bad Movie-Good Steampunk Technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rather bad movie version of a good TV show. Totally ludicrous casting of Will Smith as James West- in real life it never would have happened. Kline is OK as a rather effeminate Artemis Gordon who spends one third his screen time wearing a dress.Branagh is totally wasted as Loveless, the legless industrialist who wants to take over the US.Other scenes just fall flat. Sonnenburg, a good comedic director pretty much misses all the marks here. What saves this movie is the pseudo Jules Verne like steam punk technology. There is a sinister riverboat that launches a tank that converts into an armored railroad car. There are steam powered bikes and wheelchairs. There is a flying machine, and, of course the steam powered tarantula.Truly an awesome piece, this 80 foot high steam spider devours everything in its path. Movie is worth seeing alone for this, but we have to wait too long to see it, and it is underused. Smith and Kline have decent chemistry together, but the movie itself is not very good. Anyway, it is worth seeing should it appear on TV or cable. There are worse ways to waste 2 hours!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, if you consider that this was one of the most expensive films ever made, at roughly the same price tag as an unmanned mission to Mars, then of course it's hard to defend "Wild Wild West". On the other hand, if you look at the other films in this price category, then it's in good company -- what was so bloody great about "Titanic" or "T3"? From a personal point of view, I watched this thing on TV, so I got to see it for free, and the studio thankfully got burned for their attempt to brainwash the world into thinking that this was a must-see movie. Many IMDb reviewers touted this as one of the worst movies ever, but frankly I consider this blasphemous as long as Jerry Bruckheimer roams the earth. OK, so it didn't fully live up to its hype, but at least it's a solid enjoy-and-forget evening-filler. Its strong points are the acting and the audacious SFX which delivers a convincing utopia of a high-tech Wild West. Unfortunately the script isn't always au pair and the jokes mainly focus on the fact that the main characters are a megalomaniac cripple, a black guy, a geek and a floozy. Studio bosses, the lesson to be learned here is to never underestimate the power of the script. Us movie-goers aren't that daft, you know.</fullReview>

Well even considering it was a summer movie solely made to make money with no artistic aspirations whatsoever, the whole thing felt flaccid. It just goes to show that a big budget and a talented cast cannot (in most cases) overcome a weak screen play. This film should be watched only if you are in desperate need of escapism, 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Rating: ** out of ****. Wild Wild West is a movie that has some good things about it, but it is not a good movie. It lacks a decent script to satisfy the audience. We are set to rely on technology and the actors for this movie to be a success. Only one of them works.The technology part is actually quite good. The special effects are really impressive. The sets are also quite nice looking. However, this movie is mostly based on its success here and no where else. The acting is mostly a disappointment. Will Smith gives off some charm but it is also a bit uneven. He is an actor that has strength in comedic parts, however most of the most of the comedic parts dont work well. He looks kind of out of place in the fight scenes. Kevin Kline gives 3 performances, only one of them is any good. He is actually somewhat amusing as President Grant, but as a hooker and Artemus Gordon he is very flat. Salma Hayek is beautiful and has a great ass, but she is also flat. The only one really to give a solid performance is Kenneth Branagh, he is so over the top but he is so good as a villain.The script is avery big weakness here. Theres a funny one liner that Smith says but other than that there is not much. The jokes are mostly flat. Especially the "boob" jokes. Overall, Wild Wild West is really unsuccessful but I dont feel that its horrbly bad. Its not good, its no better than mediocre but not terrible. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West is not a bad film. OK, it's certainly no MIB but just because it's been made by the same people doesn't mean that it has to be judged by the same standards - they are different types of films. Will Smith is a bit limited in this film but his chemistry with Kevin Kline is great and they have some great moments together. Kenneth Branagh is wasted here but makes a decent villain whilst Salma Hayek is only going to be remembered in this film for her arse (and that's no bad thing!)I haven't seen the original series so I didn't go into the cinema expecting anything and it was a good way to pass the time. Sure it's not a classic, but in the same way it doesn't suck: it's got some great lines, a great performance from Kevin Kline and some good effects. I even like Will Smith's theme song. In the same way though, not enough time has been spent on the performances and the plot is what REALLY lets this film down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I subjected myself to *Wild Wild West*. It wasn't *terrible*, but...well, I really liked Independence Day and Men in Black, and I guess the producers thought..."Hm, movie, we open it on July 4...if it's got Will Smith, we're in shape!" But...Will Smith doesn't automatically make a movie good. You have to give him a good movie. And it's almost unforgiveable to take Kenneth Branagh, one of our greatest Shakespearean actors, and only use his top half, and make that top half look really stupid, and make that top half talk in a stupid Southern accent, and generally waste every bit of his talent. They pop in another Shakespearean for good measure, Kevin Kline. He just about saves the movie from total failure. He gives his role a good shot, and he pleased me, at least. All the gadgets were cool, I guess. And Salma Hayek appears in a throwaway role. Don't even get me started on all the highly annoying anachronisms (calling a tank a tank, calling nitroglycerin "nitro," an incredibly unbelievable hydraulically powered mechanical spider, high-powered magnets that provide a bit of visual humor but throw the laws of electromagnetism out the window...etc). On levels of badness, though, it is at least better than *Big Momma's House*.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Wild West review by Average Man Critic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story -1. Jim West and Art Gordon, two of the best U.S. Marshalls must stop a madman from killing the president. Staring Will Smith and directed by Barry Sonnenfield... cool.Characters -0. Both the heroes and the villians were one dimensional. To be a good hero you must have certain traits, but of them all you must simple have to be likeable. In WWW, our heroes where annoying at best. Acting -0. Will Smith is probably the best black actor in Hollywood, second only to Sam Jackson. His performance in Enemy of the State was perfect and showed that he didn't have to have catchy one liners ("Welcome to Earth!") or blow a lot of stuff up (Bad Boys)to be a good actor. WWW was not one of his best roles, for the first time, I was waiting for him to just shut up. As for Kevin Kline his performance was decent, but easily forgetable.Cinematography -1. If there is one thing I have to give to WWW, it would have to be the special effects. Though certainly not the best I have seen, he did an excellent job with what he had and did not make the movie another special effect extravaganza. The mechanical spider, though absolutely ridiculous, was nicely done.Beginning -1. The introduction of our main characters were funny. It was interesting to see a naked Will Smith fighting his way out of a water tower. End -0. After an hour into the film, I was bored and slightly mad at myself for wasting $9.50 after ALL my friends had told me to stay away from the film. Everything seemed to fall apart. The acting, the story and certainly the believability. Although both end songs (WWW and Bailamos) were worth at least a dollar of the admission price.Attention Holding -0. The only thing that stopped me from leaving was the fact that I was not about to let 9.50 go to complete waste.Memorable -0. WWW leaves you with a bad after taste that you will soon forget in a couple of minutes. Although I must admit you will be singing the title song for quiet some time.Could Watch Again -1. Believe it or not, as much as I trashed this movie, I would not mind watching it on video with all my friends over so we can laugh at the complete waste of a movie this was.Full Package -0. Neither the writer, director or actors tried hard enough to make this film likeable. And believe me, it could have been. I honestly feel that casting Will Smith as West was a great idea and I also feel that Sonnenfield is a good director. But one of the reasons why WWW failed was because the director was trying to pack so much into this film for marketing purposes, that he failed to remember that he was making a movie, not a commercial.Wild Wild West = 4 out of 10. Disappointing, but certainly not the worst of the summer films. I would rather see this than Blair Witch or the Haunting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Spider!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, did this film get canned on the internet! I went back to have another look but I couldn't find a peer who liked Wild Wild West. I liked it a lot. It was the mechanical spider that did the trick for me. The rest I either mildly enjoyed or forgave. Wild Wild West features a couple of lawmen, one a quick draw ask questions next type (Will Smith), the other a nerdy gadget man (Kevin Kline).They're after a genius madman with no legs, no genitals and 32 feet less of intestines called Dr Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). The mad genius wants to take over the U.S. in the eighteen hundreds when the White House was still being built and the trans national railroad was about to be joined by President Ulysses. S. Grant (also played by Kevin Kline). Dr Loveless's master war weapon is his canon armed, steam driven beast. The mechanical spider is astounding, along with its little brothers, the train with legs and the wheel chair with legs. To my apparently juvenile eyes these special effects really are whiz bang and well worth seeing the film for. Kline and Smith go through the motions I suppose although Kenneth Branagh looks as though he's having a ball. The women are meer adornments in whore's underwear. Salma Hayek (From Dusk Till Dawn, Fools Rush In) is reduced to swinging a half bare arse in a no brainer role. Wild Wild West is surprisingly violent for a film aimed at a younger audience, (or perhaps too violent for old codgers like me) and has a lot of graphic sexual content which is much less troublesome because its pretty wholesome. Strange demographics seem to be in existence these days. Director Barry Sonnenfeld made his name with the Coen Brothers as their cinematographer in films like Blood Simple and Millers Crossing. Men In Black, an obvious double with Wild Wild West was his other collaboration with Will Smith. He also directed Addams Family Values and Get Shorty. Sonnenfield has gone fairly firmly mainstream with Men in Black and Wild Wild West The results will I think lurch into blockbuster territory all because of a spider. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie having little idea what to expect. Having seen Will Smith brandishing a six-shooter on the poster and noting the word "West" in the title, I naively assumed that I was going to see a Western.WILD WILD WEST is not a Western. It's more like an Edgar Rice Burroughs or Jules Verne fantasy, the ones where steam power technology was going to solve all the world's problems. The story follows federal marshals Jim West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) as they attempt to thwart a plot to blackmail the United States into total surrender by use of an eighty-foot fireball-shooting mechanical tarantula, built by an ex-Confederate scientist named Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) who is missing not only his legs but his entire lower body and who has a bevy of beautiful but evil females in his service. I swear I am not making this up.WILD WILD WEST wants to be an action flick and a comedy flick also. As action, it is utterly ludicrous, going far beyond all suspension of disbelief and generating no suspense or shock value. As comedy, it is strictly hit-and-miss. The infantile sexual innuendoes are extremely annoying and unfunny, and Sonnenfeld shows the same penchant for weak gross-out humor that marred his previous effort, the otherwise hilarious MEN IN BLACK. But there are some inspired moments too: an outrageously weird scheme by West to free Gordon, a train pursuit that becomes a wacky slapstick scene, and a sequence that spoofs THE DEFIANT ONES.There's nothing wrong with the acting, but a lot of talent is wasted. Will Smith is competent enough, but did better in INDEPENDENCE DAY (a film even more brain-dead than this one), in ENEMY OF THE STATE, and MEN IN BLACK. Kevin Kline is one of the most versatile actors in the business, and he proves it here, giving us a goofy but lovable intellectual and a second role as a hardened politician where he makes both his face and voice unrecognizable. He is unconvincing playing a female role, but apparently he wasn't supposed to do a good job of it. Kenneth Branagh, my favorite actor, is given a stupid comic-book villain role, and plays it that way; this movie squanders his abilities. Salma Hayek's Rita Escobar is a completely superfluous character, having no purpose in this movie except to give us an embarrassing, unappealing and unamusing shot of her derriere. More appealing to males with raging hormones is Ling Bai in a short appearance as the villainous Miss East.WILD WILD WEST is good for a few laughs and nothing else. Fans of the actors will be disappointed. MEN IN BLACK is by far the superior movie.Rating: ** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw WWW last night too. It wasn't so bad. There were times people laughed at the jokes but on 20% of them. It's sure not one of Smith's best movies but it's still good passing entertainment. There are some lame scenes though like West in a exotic dancer costume, it's just out of place. It may be a quirky series but this is too much. Also there's not much of Salma Hayek, her brief appearance in From Dusk Til Dawn maybe okay, but the mystique would be gone in another movie. So, add the revelation of Mr. Escobar as a bad idea (he doesn't look too old after all). After reading on Kevin Smith's descriptions of his dealings with Jon Peters, I wonder how much of this movie was hurt due to his dumb whimsies. The good parts include the art direction and the gadgets. I liked the attempt for a Jules Vern-ian direction. The Air Gordon was nifty in that it was extrapolated from Da Vinci's designs. The auto-buckle in Gordon's train doesn't cut it for me. The mechanical spider is a lame Peters idea. It's a incredible design but I can't really fathom how it will destroy the United States. Certainly there's no weapon to match it, but it has to stop sometime. Never mind how Loveless managed to gather the resource to build such a thing. Smith and Kline's interaction is okay. Branagh is truly over the top. The verdict: 3 of 5 stars.</fullReview>

But I still am not too sure about the film. The story is somewhat amusing but unfortunately, Smiths humour in my opinion is not expressed to the max. The jokes are laughable for children of a young age and not for 15 year olds like myself-I was tonight watching an episode of Fresh Prince Of Bel Air and Will is so much funnier in that! Wild Wild West is still a highly amusing film-Special effects, good actors performing well, Salma Hayek looking gorgeous and a superb soundtrack to match-Sadly, one of the tracks appeared in the film-The soundtrack has a huge range of artists from Eminem to Tatyana Ali, yet throughout the movie, the only song we hear is Will Smith &amp; Dru Hill 'Wild Wild West' and this is only at the end when the credits are running through. In my opinion this should have been included a lot more in the film. As a final over-look on the film, I would say it is worth seeing and I don't believe it is as bad as the critics make it out to be-Me and my mate had a good laugh but I am not so sure if Big Willie has lived up to his full acting potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spectacle of special effects with a grand cast and weak premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the different setting, it would be difficult for anyone to not compare "Men In Black" to "Wild Wild West" when the star and director are the same. This film just demonstrates that even if you bring all the right people together, with a big budget and the great special effects, if it isn't a good script it isn't a good movie. The premise of this film is probably it's weakest point. Half an hour into the film you might be asking yourself, "Just what the hell is going on anyway?Now the special effects artisans have not let us down in the creativity department. There's plenty of dazzling sequences that astonish the audience with gadgetry a plenty. But the special effects are almost too special, at least for the time period the film is set in.As I'm sure many will agree, "Men In Black" was a smash hit and a fine film that mixes equal parts comedy, special effects and science fiction. The outlandish elements of a film with an extraterrestrial background are easily swallowed with perfect suspension of disbelief. But if you tell the audience that it's the old west, then go easy on the 80 foot mechanical tarantulas if you please.Well, let's just pretend that I fell asleep for the part where it's explained that time travelers from the distant future settled in the old west and brought their advanced technology to the past. That still wouldn't quite do it. Something about the characters aren't all that intriguing either.Take Salma Hayek's "Rita" for example. I guess she's supposed to be a damsel in distress, but maybe she's more appropriately penned as a damsel inconvenienced. We don't really get a sense of what she's all about until the end of the picture. In one scene she panics and puts herself and our heros in jeopardy. When moments like that come up, it's difficult to comprehend why a character would do such a stupid thing. Let's not blame the character, after all, it's the writer who was in full control. My apologies to the writer if that particularly stupid scene wasn't in the script and rather made up on the fly, but I seriously doubt it.Will Smith's character "West" is a Government agent/gunslinger who quite matter-of-factly brings up the "painful" death of his family within a thirty second scene which feels too much like a "and this is why he wants to kill the bad guy really really badly, and he'll deserve it too" moment.Kevin Kline's character "Artemus" is a little more interesting, and of course, Kenneth Brannagh's "Dr. Loveless", being as evil and demented as he can be, but not too threatening. Again, if someone can simply explain how a person could possibly survive after being cut in half a hundred years ago, I'd happily overlook the elaborate steam engine wheelchair.Given all that, the film had it's moments, it's lines, it's eye candy (and I'm not necessarily always talking about the special effects) but over all quite a disappointment. I'm reluctant to focus on the negative of any film, but Barry should've found a way to incorporate the aliens again. I guess it's not too long before we go back to tried and true and see "Men In Black 2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film with some trepidation, having heard the 'professional' critics pan it, and having read many of the user comments here. I was also a big fan of the original TV series of the 60s, so I was hoping that the film version wouldn't stumble as badly as the film of The Avengers. I wasn't keen on Will Smith as Jim West, not because he's black and the original role on TV was white, but because his screen personality didn't seem to fit the original role played by Robert Conrad. However, having now seen the film, I am pleased to report that I really enjoyed it. The effects (not just the mechanical spider, but also the removal of Kenneth Branagh's lower half) were very well done, and the film was well-paced, witty and entertaining. OK, it's not going to win Best Picture, but it was good fun, and that's really what a film should deliver. And it was infinitely more enjoyable than that over-hyped pile of trash, The Phantom Menace. I think a previous comment gave the best characterization of the film when s/he said it was like a Roger Moore Bond film, with West as Bond and Gordon as Q. Oh, and don't be put off by that atrocious music video that is being played as a trailer - the film is nothing like that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last film I saw directed by Barry Sonnenfield before seeing his latest film, "Wild Wild West" was his adaptation of the popular Elmore Leonard novel, "Get Shorty," a superbly funny and enjoyable film boasting a good cast including John Travolta and Gene Hackman and a film which is still undoubtedly Sonnenfield's best. When hearing about his next film, "Wild Wild West," I did anxiously expect to see a similar movie of the same calibre, the film having an excellent cast and a promising story as it seemed from the film's trailer. The wonderful music video gave me a sense that Sonnenfield's film would be one of the most fast-moving, hilariously funny blockbusters of the year!When I saw the film on its British release, I found the film completely different to what I had expected. I found the first half hour so slow and uneventful that I was soon suffering from extreme boredom, the small amount of material in the scenes nowhere near enough in quantity to keep us interested for such a long amount of time.The overall plot takes place over a hundred years ago in the usual Western setting and deals with the President of the United States hiring the two best guns in the West, handsome gunslinger James West (Will Smith) and mechanical whizz-kid Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) to discover the mysterious kidnappings of many scientists by a certain General "Bloodbath" McGrath (Ted Levine). This leads them to discover that the entire scheme is one led by the supposedly-dead and legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), whose plan is to assassinate the President and divide the United States, with a little help from the likes of his own magnetically charged flying decapitator and a gigantic mechanical tarantula along with his selection of dangerously seductive accomplices. Providing the romance is brothel-woman Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek), who is reluctantly taken with the two in order for her to find her allegedly kidnapped father.It seems like something fun, but most of these things are introduced far too late. After the long prologue, things do pick up quite a bit, with some genuinely funny moments and enjoyable action, but the lack of pace still tends to creep up every now and then. I'm not saying the film is awful, in fact most of the material and acting is absolutely fine, it's just that Sonnenfield really should have shortened the film by about 30 minutes, making it far more enjoyable. Still worth seeing if particularly favour some the actors, however, especially Smith!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey this is supposed to be a comedy, right? Well it only raised about three laughs in the cinema. It had the potential to be funny but it just wasn't.This from the director of Men in Black too? Basically the problem was he shot a script that wasn't ready. Some of the lines in it were so lame. There were a lot of moments when it could have been really hilarious but the dialogue spoiled it.Also, it became exceedingly slow going and boring. I fell asleep in the middle of it and missed much of Salma Hayek. I was not alone as the people I was in the cinema with started to leave right at the queue for the end (when the villain is disposed with)Revise the script and it will be funny. Edit out the dodgy bits about sex and you could make it a children's movie.</fullReview>

Sorry, he's not THAT funny.The movie is a waste of a nice premise, good actors and groovy 3D effects. I guess the stars of this flop are not too proud with the result too...

		<fullReview>Director Barry Sonnenfeld re-teams with Will Smith in their semi follow-up to the 1997 hit film "Men in Black." Smith plays a government agent(?) who is assigned to work with an inventive agent (Kevin Kline) to rescue president Ulysses S. Grant (Kline) from an evil legless inventor (Kenneth Branagh). The chemistry between Smith and Kline is as weak as 100-year-old wine. Branagh sounds as though he's reciting lines from a Shakespeare play and cracks a few unfunny color jokes ("Well well well, Mister West, how nice of you to join us and add color to this otherwise monochromatic affair.") The only reason to see this outing is for the above average special effects (dig the mechanical spider) and Smith playing the hero (again). Selma Hayek is wasted.

		<fullReview>A lifeless, humourless, heartless, crassly exploitive waste of perfectly good celluloid and workstation rendering time. Besides a few funny one-liners ("shoot first, shoot later, then shoot some more...") this exercise in cinematic vanity (on both Will Smith's and Barry Sonnenfeld's part) is completely devoid of life as it trips over itself in its attempt to be hip, cool while simultaneously trying to evoke the the original TV series' "James Bond meets Jules Verne" spirit. Most of the jokes are anachronistic in a bad way (unlike the high concept of the series) and the plot is just plain boring. I guess the best way to describe this movie is: boring. And that spells death not only for a summer blockbuster wannabe but any action/comedy. I was also disappointed in the usually brilliant Elmer Bernstein's lackluster and unimaginative score. I guess it must have rubbed off on him from all other parties involved in this unmitigated mess. I guess I'll just have to go see Phantom Menace again. 4 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the story is hokey, the acting is occasionally great but mostly ho-hum, and the overall effect is kinda cheesy... but isn't that the point? I remember watching the original show when I was a kid, and I thought it was great... and the movie is exactly in the vein of the original series. It has the same kind of cheesy, overacted villain (very well hammed-up by Kenneth Branagh) with the same improbable plan of taking over the USA with a huge, anachronistic device... and I liked it a lot!But I didn't love it. Wild Wild West fails because of the overuse of one-liners from Will "July 4th Mega-Hit" Smith and some terrible writing by the 6-writer committee that put this movie together. (I would say Salma Hayek helps bring the movie down too, but she's always an asset to *any* movie.) If they would have come up with a coherent story instead of piling so many things into one film, "Wild Wild West could have been a great movie.Overall Verdict: see it on bargain nights or matinees, or wait until video.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be frank, this movie was bad. Not the absolute rock bottom worst, but given it's cast and the team who made it, I don't think it was out of line to have been expecting better than this. Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh are tremendous actors, but this material is beneath them. Selma Hayek is very charming, and I really liked "Fools Rush In" and some of her other work, but she was there for eye candy and there's no hiding that. Will Smith has never been a "great actor", but he just reads well. He's very attractive and likeable in general, and he is here, as well, but the writing was not good enough for the lead to get by on being attractive and likeable. Parts of it were entertaining and funny, and the crowd seemed to be having a good time. Truthfully, I did too. But it was entertaining and funny in the "completely-bad-brainless-junk-to-waste-an-hour-and-a-half" sort of way. As a movie for the archives, though, it's pretty much a flop.

Somehow, the pieces just don't click together, and the end result is a movie that's pleasant, but never quite engaging.

		<shortDescription>Contains so many flaws I could not keep up with them all. But it was a wild ride. *1/2 out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WILD WILD WEST (1999) *1/2"Wild Wild West" stars Will Smith as Jim West, an undercover secret agent cowboy who likes to shoot first and investigate later. The film takes place over 100 years ago, right at the point of the continental railroad connecting. Jim and his new partner, Artemus Gordon, a master of disguise and invention, are assigned to recover a group of the worlds most intelligent scientists from a madman named General Bloodbath. They try to investigate in two main ways: Gordon uses costumes trick Bloodbath, while West uses force.There is another character in the story, however, and his name is Dr. Arliss Loveless, a traitor whose lower half was blown out from underneath him during the recent war. He demands that the United States surrender their freedom to him and his accomplices. So he kills General Bloodbath and uses the scientists that he stole for a brilliant masterpiece war weapon shaped like a giant spider and can blow out fire balls from its mouth."Wild Wild West" is so completely filled with problems and obvious flaws that I could not catch all of them in my notes. I'll explain each and every one of them that I caught-but first lets begin with structure: The film opens to what seems like a standard three act formula (the kidnapped scientists being the problem, the evil General Bloodbath being the main villain, the two secret agents being the hero). The problem begins about a third way through when the film opens a brand new problem and villain; Dr. Loveless wants to take over the world and West and Gordon must stop him. Great, that sounds O.K, right? Wrong. What ever happened to the kidnapped scientists? Did Loveless let them go? Absolutely not. He is the scum of the universe and we're supposed believe that our villain is going to release his hostages. I think Not. But the audience doesn't know what to believe because the movie just drops the subject like it never existed. Now, this did not have to be such a problem if the filmmakers used the changing of events as a false first act. However, they didn't even attempt to solve the first initial problem. Thus, already we have a major doubt in the production.Second, let's look at the movie's characters: Most of the characters used in "Wild Wild West" are never developed and are operated as plot puppets, not having any mind of their own. But one in particular stands out in my mind as of being a complete waste of acting, the Salma Hayek character, whose name is Rita. First of all, she appears about a third way though the film and is rescued by Gordon. She then severs the propose as a tag along to West and Gordon when we learn that she is an assistant of Dr. Loveless, but later we learn that this is also not true. After Loveless steals her back from the heroes, she disappears from the film completely, never to be seen again until the happy and peachy premise to tell the heroes that she is doing oka y and to wish her luck with life. Lets see, her presence in the movie is to be what?Now, lets take a look at the stupidity of the plot of "Wild Wild West," as if I haven't already screwed up any chance of someone desiring to view it, here's some more to straighten my opinion. The horses in the film appear at random for convenience of the characters. The giant robotic fire-breathing spider controlled by Loveless is supposed to make us believe that America will surrender on its knees, but our two heroes take care of this "major" problem in ten minutes, proving just what little problem it severed. Gordon discovers and invents the theory of flight in what seems like five minutes. The heroes try for ten minutes to try to get a certain magnet off their neck, but for as big a deal that it possesses in the movie, the filmmakers never do show them taking off the obstacle. As long as you can look yourself in the eye, and remember that the hero never dies the first time though, and continue to want to drive all the way to the theater and pay top prices for this junk pile, I'll say that your one opinionated person.Some of the movie does work. For instance, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are wonderful as the title roles, bringing a sometimes funny tone to the film-breathing some life into it. And Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Loveless, superb and perfect, way over the top resulting in a ideally crafted villain. For a buddy comedy the music isn't all that bad either.This is the second film of Will Smith's opening of the fourth of July weekend and I am sure many people will go see it. Why do audiences fall for filmmakers' scams? It is obvious at the negativity generated from the critics that this film is no good. And by watching the previews someone surely can tell that it is no Oscar worthy material. Like the upcoming "Lake Placid," however, the built up hype is nothing more that a bunch of hot air in a balloon that will surly come splattering out when word of mouth comes around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As some of the previous commentors have mentioned, there are some obvious flaws in the movie. I did notice the two bad Green Screen effects, and I think they should have fleshed out Salma Hayek's character a little more (not to be taken literally). I'll be the first to agree that a poorly made film can destroy a good story. When I go to a movie though, I expect a fun story with some character development and maybe some nifty gadgets or plot twists. Usually what the director and the actors want to portray and what actually gets portrayed bear no resemblance the one to the other.Basically what I'm getting at is don't nitpick. WWW in my opinion is a good movie. While I'm still debating as to whether or not I would like to own it when it comes out on video, I would definitely like to see a sequel.I saw the seemingly disjointed relationship between Jim West and Artemus Gordan as nothing more than two people with dissimilar backgrounds and opinions being thrust together for the first time, and gradually becoming friends. I live near Prometory Point and I think that it was neat that the ending scenes of the movie focussed on that historic time and locale.I do recommend everyone going and seeing this movie at least once on the Big Screen. Remember, its just a story made by human beings no matter how famous or talented they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat enjoyable, but mostly a letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the original series I found this movie quite true to the original premise, except for the casting of Will Smith as James West. This was the biggest mistake of this movie because the script was written specifically for Smith. I liked him in Independence Day and Men in Black, but he did not work in this movie. And, the relationship between West and Gordon was strained and disjointed, due mostly to the writing but also the acting of Smith and Kline. Speaking of Kline, he was horribly underused here. He's quite funny but the script didn't allow him or Smith to BE funny -- all the lines that were supposed to be funny just fell flat with both audiences I saw this with. The good points: Kenneth Branagh and the special effects. I rate this movie as "eye candy" at best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a waste of a great cast (well, at least Kenneth Branaugh and Kevin Kline are great). Will Smith is probably a lot better than this performance indicates -- I thought he was a lot better in "Enemy of the State," for example -- and it's hard to tell about Salma Hayek, as she had virtually no acting to do here. The only thing I thought was really GOOD was Kenneth Branaugh's southern accent. Not a terrible film, but definitely NOT a good one, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatest train ever built; Kevin Kline's a dazzler in every movie he stars in, and its a stitch to see a noted Brit, playing a Southern Gentleman/villain. But somewhere, somehow the authors seemed to have lost their sanity and tried to combine the authentic wild west with some cockamamie spider machine. And who's the Bozo that figured a battery-driven wheel chair wouldn't look entirely out of place? Don't the studios do their "preview screenings" anymore? It tried to please the children as much as adults and I believe it got all of us very confused. But a good candidate for Video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blame Elmer Bernstein for this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I sat watching this movie, I had a hard time figuring out what was wrong. Will Smith was on the mark, Kevin Kline was on the mark, the story was pretty good, and the visuals were stunning. Granted, Salma Hayek pretty much ruined every scene in which she opened her mouth, and we could have had a little more interactions with Lovelace's lovely minions, but, despite some flaws in the script, I knew I should be enjoying myself more. It was during a transition scene that I realized what the problem was. "Wild Wild West" has perhaps the most uninspiring soundtrack I have heard in a long time. Instead of enhancing the movie, it was dragging it down.For example, the opening credit visuals are similar to those of the television show. One would think that the main theme would contain some kind of tribute, as well, but I could never pick it out, hard as I tried. The only time I heard the original music appear is late in the movie during one scene. It would be one thing if the TV music wasn't memorable, but it was, and it should have served as a basis for the movie music. I know that Elmer Bernstein is a great composer, but he did this movie a disservice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted at times this movie had its good points. The fighting scene at the end where Will Smith encounters all those men with interesting weapons sufficing for a hand or a head, or when Will and Kevin first meet but usually this movie was filled with bad innuendos and jokes. The ending was far from surprising. The "bad guy" played by Kenneth Branaugh (an actor I usually enjoy) gave one of his worst performances. The next time a screenwriter decides to recreate a television show into a movie maybe they should study it a bit more in depth and realize that it was winning the Wild West that mattered and not the well busted small butted women that were in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun film that doesn't use its full acting potential. I give it a 6.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie contains too much acting talent to be a flop. Will Smith does a fine job portraying Jim West and you hardly realize that he is an African-American playing a Caucasian role. While Smith is always fun to watch, he is still hard to believe as an action hero and his jokes are rarely anything more than cute. Kevin Kline is a truly gifted actor who is too good to play second fiddle to Smith and expresses this every time they are together. Kenneth Branagh plays a good villain, but his jokes are also very lame. Any attractive female could play Salma Hayek's role and she doesn't stand a chance at being noticed in this film. The Story is fun and believable, except for Smith's intrusion into Branagh's hideout as an African belly dancer. The real strength of the movie lies with the cool contraptions and gadgets that appear everywhere. The supporting characters are also very cool (General Bloodbath McGrath and Pres. Ulysses S. Grant) are very well played. Overall, it wasn't a disapointment, but not much better than Independence Day or Men In Black (Smith's other summer blockbusters). Sadly, if you don't see it in the theater, you'll hurt yourself, because this movie will die off on the boob tube's lack of expressing full technological graphics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would only comment that it was...well, okay. I had no problems with the rivalry between the two agents: the show never presented their "first meeting" (although one episode kind of hints at it in a really vague oblique manner). I thought that bad pun/humor level was well within the standards the series itself established. I didn't mind the sexual innuendo per se except for the numerous homosexual jibes. Yeah, the movie is about two guys who travel together and fight crime, but if they'd tossed in as much homosexual innuendo in Men in Black, it would have been a much less funny movie.The movie also spends too much time on the drag sequences, to the point where it crashes to a screeching halt repeatedly every time they returned to their concept. Yeah, they did that on the series too _very_ rarely, but I guess I don't share Peters and Sonnenfeld's glee in the subject matter.For the actors, Kline was probably the best, I wouldn't describe hm as wooden (and was he doing Grant throughout the entire movie as well? We weren't sure about that). Smith was...competent. Brannagh was over-the-top, but there were times when that seemed to work and times when it didn't. Hayek was wasted. Ted Levine has yet to give a decent performance that I've seen, and WWW was no exception.The plot was...okay. There were some gaping plot holes (a couple of cannon shots would seem to demolish the spider - Loveless is going to threaten the entire U.S. with this??), and a couple of dead ends (so what if Rita is Escobar's wife? What's the point of Gordon impersonating Grant at Promonitory Point as a delay that results in West getting shot ten seconds later?)As everyone else has commented, the sets and design were gorgeous. I liked the person-in-a-painting motif at Loveless' manor (the rifleman sequence was interesting), although the Spider bit was never explained.Overall, there was enough there to remind me of the old series, but if it somehow becomes a series of movies, they could drop all the drag humor and homosexual innuendo (M. Emmet Walsh just look embarrassed to have to react to it), not rehash the plot quite so many times (Kevin Kline recaps the plot verbatim at least twice), and find a decent follow-up villain, and they might be set for a long-running franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sonnenfeld et al. wreck a decent premise.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Badboy-11's comments not withstanding, anyone old enough to remember the show will fondly recall the cooperation and mutual respect between West and Gordon, none of which is present in this weak attempt at capitalizing on a great premise. The idea of blending SF, secret agents and the wild west was a winning combo in the 60's, and it should have been great today--but overproduction, an oversized CGI budget, curious casting and a weak script cripple what should have been a "gimme."At least in the tv show, much of the gagetry was *plausible.* Sonnenfeld's WWW is a worst-parts bastard child of "Blazing Saddles" and your choice of any James Bond movie with Roger Moore. There is no sense of team work and they spend far too much time working against each other than working to save the Union.Branagh clearly has a great time--he plays it to the hilt, and loves every minute of being the Southern-fried Evil Genius Bent on Ruling the United States as Revenge Against Those Who Betrayed Him. He's dignified and polite, thanking you for attending his "modest soiree" even as he kills you.And someone has to say this, so it might as well be me: Much as I love and admire Will Smith, casting a black man as Jim West in 1869 makes as much sense as casting Leonardo DiCaprio to play lead in the "Shaft" movie now in production--folks, it just doesn't work! (Hey, please don't flame me about this--it's not a racial thing, it's an acknowldgement of history.)And yes, I have just as much a problem with a steam-powered 80' ironwork spider--was there a problem with wheels? Or caterpillar treads? What a silly, unstable way to travel. I KNOW it's SF/Fantasy, but please!In addition, just as with Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, the overt sexuality is inappropriate for the target audience. IN the case of WWW, there is the additional problem with sexuality being inappropriate for the time period--I mean a black man slapping a white woman's breasts in Reconstruction Era Louisiana, and living long enough to draw his next breath? I can only suspend disbelief for so long....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West is an entertaining piece of film that showcases the popularity of Will Smith. Smith has an engaging persona and WWW capitalizes on that factor. He's cool, calm, charismatic, and quick with his hands and with his mind. He's paired with the gifted Kevin Kline and the two create a good team. West is headstrong and impetous, and Gordon is thoughtful and contemplative. Together, they work well. Even if they constantly rub each other the wrong way. Kenneth Branagh is over the top as Dr. Loveless and he seems to enjoy this part. The film zips along at a good pace and there are enough gadgets and special effects to keep you going. The only thing I would've liked to have seen is more of Salma Hayek. Her part in the film is explained, but it seems that she doesn't have much to do. There are times when the script sags too, but Will Smith's charms help you smooth over the rough spots.</fullReview>

OK....Independence Day and Men in Black were fun, successful movies, but in my book it was in spite of Will Smith, not because of him. His street attitude and jive-ass dialogue was bad enough in those contemporary films but is totally impossible to swallow in a movie that takes place in the 1800's.But the biggest sin this new movie commits is that it just plain is not funny. It tries to be, and other than a couple of fairly amusing spots, the vast majority of the stuff is totally lame and not remotely funny.In my book the only thing that even made the movie the slightest bit worthwhile was Salma Hayek in her underwear and the 80-foot tall mechanical tarantula.I was a big fan of the original tv show and when I saw Robert Conrad (the original James West) on tv the other night totally dissing Barry Sonnenfeld and the new Wild, Wild West movie, I was kind of disappointed because I thought it is was in poor taste and just sour grapes on his part. However, after seeing the movie, I think most of his comments were probably on target.It's too bad that the movie couldn't have been more entertaining and especially a lot funnier.</fullReview>

She's barely a blip on the screen. This leaves the film entirely in male hands and Smith, Kline and Branagh aren't up to the task. Branagh (Dr. Arliss Loveless) has decided that the proper way to portray a madman is to speak shrilly at all times. Smith, usually energetic cocksureness, has settled into mere swagger; and Kline looks like he'd rather be kissing Tom Selleck again.The important relationship is Smith (Jim West) and Kline (Artemus Gordon). The two actors never develop any believable connection; they rarely look like they even want to be in the same scene together. With the central dramatic hook gone, WILD WILD WEST is reduced to being a formulaic action film. It still comes up short.Sonnenfeld has shot a claustrophobic movie rather than a grand adventure. Scenes, especially action scenes, are shot in extreme closeup with very quick cuts. It is, at times, impossible to decipher what's happening. Already distanced emotionally from the film, the audience is not even thrown the bone of thrilling FX.In addition, Sonnenfeld has crabbed scenes from numerous other action films; but again, he can't get them right. For example, early in the film, Jim West finds himself hanging over a cliff from a horse's bridle (see TRUE LIES). He urges the horse to "back up" just like Arnold; however, the suspense is ruined by the fact that he's only hanging ten feet from the ground.Much like this scene, WILD WILD WEST leaves the audience hanging.

Poor performances from nearly all the actors detracted from the movie, but if you're not a serious film critic, you probably wouldn't notice it.The film itself shines in the area of special effects. A lot of you are probably saying "hold on a sec, special effects is like laser or lightsaber fights from Star Wars!" Well that's not all there is to it. The giant mechanical spider that goes roaming around the west is very well done, as are all the fancy gizmos that Jim West uses to save the country.If you like action films, Wild Wild West is one fun movie that you shouldn't miss this summer.</fullReview>

There were various "nods" throughout the film that I liked (music or sets) and despite the "lower" budget that was spent on effects, the budget should have been spent on hiring better script writers or on Will Smith to put in his trademark humor into the movie -- intended or not, the movie was not all that funny. It was more of a plain action film than a Will Smith film and that is where this movie's falling is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very ambitious movie, but it falls short of the mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the chemistry between Will Smith and Kevin Kline (two, in my opinion, very charismatic actors) was almost non-existent. This is truly a shame as they are the central characters. I can't quite put a finger on it, but our protagonist just don't jell, either as a team or as would-be (soon-to-be) partners.Second, Salma Hayek is totally wasted in her role. Anyone could have done this, or better yet, don't do it at all.Third, the "real" action in the movie takes place too late in the film. That combined with some questionable suspension of disbelief factors, the movie seems overly long.Finally, the chances of an African American working as a U.S. Marshall in 1863 are slight, but apparently that's been accepted by the audience, evidenced by their arrival to the theater. That said, why did nearly every scene feel the need to remind us that James West was black? "Blazing Saddles" already did it, and better. (By the way, I'm African American)On the positive side, however, the movie does have a few interesting ideas; in particular, the making of Dr. Loveless, who was played wonderfully in the original series by Michael Dunn (a midget), a man who had no lower extremities whatsoever. I thought Kenneth Branagh went a bit over the top, but when doesn't he?I also enjoyed the ideas' of this being the initial teaming of our heroes and how they get that incredible train. M. Emmett Walsh is always a treat!The special effects were outstanding! The giant tarantula was truly inspired.All in all, the movie is pretty true to the original series, but lacks its' tongue-in-cheek approach. In the TV series, Artie (Ross Martin) was a "cool" genius; Kevin Klines' Artie is more of a "goofy" genius. This might not be a significant point, but due to the lack of chemistry between Smith and Kline it makes me wonder if that was the way to go.The night before I saw this movie I saw the music video for Will Smith's "Wild, Wild West"; It was actually better than the movie.</fullReview>

Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for something good to happen that would pick up the pace, but alas, there was nothing to fulfill my hopes. I'm sorry for all of you looking for a good review or that you're a true fan of the movie, but you're not gonna find it here.

		<fullReview>Once again a major movie studio has slapped together a thinly plotted, special-effects laden piece of junk and tried to pass it off as the next "blockbuster". While this film will probably make a lot of money, it did not impress me at all -- and neither should it impress any discriminating viewer. Many of this movie's key elements (including the giant mechanical spider, the flying bicycle, and even the villain Dr. Loveless) are so incredibly farfetched and unrealistic that it's just plain ridiculous. Add to this a weak plot and flat jokes and you have one rather poor film. Maybe if the public will quit spending millions of dollars on every "summer blockbuster" that is released -- regardless of its quality -- then the big studios will finally make some decent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Film. The Actors were Bored.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE! This movie is not SO completely terrible that theatres should be torched and writers and director and actors to be hung. But it wasn't good. It could have been so much better. If you were expecting "Men in Black" in the old west, you can just get that thought out of your head. "West" has all of the effects, but half of the wit and interest of the former.Lets start with the bad news. Will Smith (James West) and Kevin Kline (Artemus Gordon) have neglible chemistry. For as much as they bicker, you could get the feeling that the actors did the scenes by individually, and computers were used to place them together in the scene. In fact, the partnership as played by Smith and Kline seemed forced. Forced dislike; Forced tolerance; Forced friendship.Ironically, there's better chemistry between Smith and Kenneth Branagh (Arliss Loveless). As adversaries, they bounce off well together. All of the best scenes in the movie involve these two together. Anyway, Branagh seems to inhabit his character the best. Loveless seems to fit best in this obviously insane world of the movie. He's not real and THAT'S THE POINT. THIS IS A COMEDY. GO OVER THE TOP!Also, did you have the impression that Salma Hayek (Rita Escobar) would have a role in this film? I thought so too! Her entire role consisted of her commenting, "He is soo. . . [insert adjective here]" when Smith would do something. If you hire Salma Hayek, LET HER ACT. GIVE HER A PART IN WHICH SHE CAN ACT.Anyway, this film is not all bad. There were several good scenes involving all of the characters. Kline is engaging when he finally gets fed up with West. Will still has his charm and sarcastic retorts. Hayek is still adorable. It's just that Salma doesn't have anything to do; Kline is TOO reserved for the good of the movie; Smith only gets to react to Branagh.In summary, the movie doesn't work because there is nothing for the characters to react to. Notice I didn't even mention the special effects. They can't save the movie. There's a slim chance that the movie can ride on Will's charm or Branagh's silliness. But it isn't likely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the promise that Sonnenfeld displayed in his collaboration with Will Smith in MEN IN BLACK is totally trashed here. There's more fizz in a can of week-old Diet Coke than there is between Smith and Kevin Kline. The f/x are the gooey icing slathered on this non-existent cake of half-baked ideas, but considering that the writing teams involved worked on the SHORT CIRCUIT movies and TV scripts, (THE LOVE BOAT, THREE'S COMPANY), this is no surprise. The one bright spot in the cast is actually Kenneth Branagh, having a wicked good time as the nefarious Dr. Arliss Loveless. However, his cheekiness and Smith's unflappable cool aren't enough to transform this sow's ear into a silk anything. Most definitely a future video rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith was great in Independence Day. He was 'just okay' in this film, which had a poor plot that had occasional moments of humor. I wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't even worth the matinee price I paid. Can't even recommend to 'rent the video'. Some of the scenes were unnecessary and poorly written and the chemistry between actors was nonexistent.The villain was handicapped, which made it difficult to fear him; it is likely that wheelchair users will take offense to. I took offense to it. The deep south almost-hanging routine was poorly written and in bad taste. Not funny. Having both characters appear in several scenes 'in drag' was also in poor taste and didn't add to the film. Offensive to family values and not a movie to take the kids too. Now, the same could be said of "Blazing Saddles", which was a great movie, but this movie isn't even close.It did have several good scenes, but these weren't enough to save the film. The "east meets west" scene where West confronts the asian girl was my favorite.The original theme song was only played briefly, once, in the film; a poor substitute was used for the opening score. Visuals for the opening credits were good, however.I have to agree with Ebert and give it a one star thumbs down. It's too bad, because I was looking forward to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SONNENFELD AND SMITH BOTH FIND SECOND TIME NO CHARM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lucky streak that has seen both Barry Sonnenfeld and Will Smith hit box office gold for their last several movies apart ("Addams Family Values"/"Get Shorty" &amp; "ID4"/"Enemy of the State" - respectively) and one together ("Men in Black") comes to a scene chewing, badly scored and just plain dull end the Fourth of July, 1999. It's a shame that so many people are going to endure this train wreck of movie because "Wild Wild West's" the only thing out there for two weekends, but that's what Warner Brothers was counting on. Dr. Loveless would envy the evil genius of the modern distribution pattern where audiences are herded in like cattle the first two weeks with the dinner bell of slick marketing, therefore ensuring huge returns before word of mouth gets out. Lucky timing also helps. With no other big popcorn movies out this entire summer besides the not quite overwhelming "Star Wars: Episode I," "West" will benefit from the same scenario that helped "Men in Black" - which rode a big wave of disappointment with "The Lost World" - to box office manna.From the opening notes of the entirely new score, this "West" makes one misstep after another. Gone is the familiar ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum bum bum be-bum bum bum, replaced with a theme that defies an audience to try humming it when leaving the theater. Gone too is the animation/freeze frame device that separated the sequence breaks. Granted this device took advantage of television's required commercial breaks, yet it also helped tweak the suspense by making each episode into a mini-serial. There's an attempt at some sort of half-assed homage in the opening credits, but high contrast monochrome images with blueprint schematics aren't the same thing.In short, if you liked the series stay far away from this not-even-trying-to-be update. Yet, I'm no purist about these things. I like Will Smith and as much as I thought casting him as James West was the worst type of stunt casting I was expecting to be taken in by his affable charm again. Especially as I thought Kevin Kline was a good choice for Artemus Gordon (not great). There just isn't any chemistry between the two. The old series was a lot better, ironically, because the play between West and Gordon drove the show. The irony lies in the fact that Robert Conrad was THE star of the show but the late Ross Martin always more of a partner than a sidekick. There's more zip between West and the badly accented Kenneth Branagh playing the now legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (the original was a dwarf using his brain to get back at the Western culture that esteemed physical strength), even though the trading of racist jokes (Loveless) for cripple ones (West) is never witty - much less funny. More could have been made of these antagonists who find themselves trying to either destroy or save a white society that excludes them.For an action comedy that tries repeatedly for both targets, its aim could use that other James (Bond) behind the trigger. Not only does "WWW" fail to thrill us, it never seems to make us laugh either. The only time I laughed out loud (and it didn't exactly bring the house down) was when West is described as a man who "Shoots first, shoots later, shoots some more and when everyone's dead, THEN asks questions." This is surprising considering that all of Sonnenfeld's films to date have been marked by sly, quirky humor. Although, it must be pointed out, the other films also had strong stories and characters that the humor was servicing, not vice versa. Like good icing on a better cake. In the end we could blame the writers, two of whom gave us the very enjoyable action comedy "Tremors" incidentally also set in the dusty west.But it wasn't their names that got this hodge podge green lit at $150 million plus. You get the feeling that yet again a better script and approach was chucked once the two 800 pound gorillas got involved with their "proven track records" to guide all decisions. It has been reported that Will Smith has said of missing out on Neo in "The Matrix" that it will become the role he will always regret letting get away. Seeing as the directors apparently said "No thanks" when it became apparent Smith would insist on injecting his "trademarked humor" (whatever that is) into the role, we can only be that much happier he was allowed to only ruin one film this year. And Sonnenfeld has been interviewed saying he blames not being able to preview it more to fine tune the humor.For anyone still naive enough to think that the powers-that-be care more about giving them a good time for their $8 versus making the payment on their new Idaho digs, I'd like to point out a favorite pet-peeve of mine: throwing pop tunes over the end credits just to nakedly sell cds. Unlike the tracks used prominently in "The Matrix" - listen to Propellerheads' "Spybreak (short one)" and you instantly recall the showstopping lobby shoot-out - that make up "Matrix's" first soundtrack (there's a separate one for the score), none in "WWW" show up until the end. With the artists involved featured prominently on TV and print ads, you're supposed to think whenever Smith goes into action something by Enrique Iglesias would kick in. "No, you stupid cows in the audience we want to sell you meaningless tie-ins," the exec's can almost be heard saying. This suggests the work of the one other person who probably has as much to do with the "Wild Wild Waste" as the director and star - producer Jon Peters. The former hairdresser again pops up involved with a film that should have been much better, like the Batman franchise. But, that's another rant....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very well-done, and surprisingly well acted movie, however, it has some casting issues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My overall take on WWW is a good one. Whatever happened to a good old-fashioned piece of ENTERTAINMENT?WILD WILD WEST is EXACTLY that. I was not wowed by the movie but it definitely sufficed as a fun and entertaining film. There are no brains needed, just eyes and ears. What the movie lacks in energy, it more than makes up for with goofiness, acting and sets. One of my only gripes about the movie is the casting of Will Smith and Selma Hayek. All the critics agreed that Will Smith (who didn't do such a bad job in the long run) was the energy and it was Kevin Kline and Kenneth Brannagh who were miscasted. I found that fact to be the complete opposite. If Smith even made an attempt to try and act like an army captain in the old west, the film would have been much better. But instead, he acts like he did in Men In Black (a film where being wise-assed and sarcastic was called for), or Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The movie reeked of the Old West, but Will Smith just didn't fit inside the mold (not because he is black but more due to the fact that he isn't able to act like i.e. Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp in "Tombstone," which is what this movie called for). My feeling is that Barry Sonnenfeld owes Will Smith a lifetime debt because of what Smith did for him in Men In Black, and that is, make Sonnenfeld a millionaire. One word for Salma Hayek, unnecessary. She added some eye-candy but ultimately was not needed.So much negativity, but let me wind down by saying Kevin Kline was terrific, and his gadgets were great. If you like 007, you will definitely get a kick out of his gadgets and oh, the disguises too. Saving the best for last, Kenneth Brannagh was this movie's shining light. For those of you younger folks not familiar with him, he is an accomplished BRITISH actor. He carries a Louisiana accent with him the entire film and doesn't shed it once. You'd think he was southern he was so good.I'm a huge fan of modern movies which re-create the Old West, because it seems not so hard to do, but so hard to do WELL, and Sonnenfeld should be proud of himself for those accomplishments. For those of you expecting non-stop action you will be disappointed. This is not an action flick, but rather a spaghetti western with some cool twists. So, turn your brains off, ignore the critics completely and have some fun.</fullReview>

The green screening in this movie was so apparent that when the scene with Will smith and Kevin Kline walking in the desert came about anyone who knew anything in the theater laughed. The fight scenes were cheesy and fake looking, and many didn't make much since or were pointless, watch for the scene with the paintings. The jokes in this movie were funny I must admit however many were very mean toward blacks and the handicapped. I could go on but I'll end this by asking what was with the iron guy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to win a double pass to the preview of this movie through my local newspaper. It was on Monday evening, and it was exciting to see a movie two days before the general public. Or so I thought. Beginning with the opening credits, which I believe must have been the longest credits known to man or beast, the movie was a huge disappointment. "Hi! My name is Salma Hayek! Can anyone out there understand why I was in this movie?" Then there was the "friendly" banter between Smith's character and Branagh's. I am not a champion of PC, but this was stupid and insulting. Everything else was just silly, not horrid, but far from good. I can't imagine how annoyed I would have been if I had to pay for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I was not exactly anticipating this movie's release and had never liked the TV series, I decided to go check this one out on the basis of the previous work of the talent involved. I liked Sonnenfeld's previous films (especially his work with the Coen brothers) and Men in Black in particular was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, this is not remotely as exhilarating as any of those films, and while often inventive and engaging, it pretty much falls flat. There are some good gags, mostly when Smith and Branagh trade insults, and Kline is good as usual. Hayek shows her ass and that's about it. The violence is dark but not blackly funny as it should be--just sort of cruel for the hell of it, such as when one very minor character gets shot point-blank in the belly. There is a good scene where Smith fights off a number of bizarre, zombie-like henchmen, but the action is poorly-lit and, like other sections of the film, somewhat confusing. I wonder if this was meant to be released later in the summer and post-production suffered from a bumped-up schedule. The best scenes often seem rushed, whereas others meander with unnecessary padding.

		<shortDescription>great looking production design is not all a movie needs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The high expectations for "Wild Wild West" will lead to somewhat of a letdown. After the successful special effects comedy "Men In Black"; star Will Smith and talented director Barry Sonnenfeld have delivered a great looking mess. Smith and Kevin Kline always deliver the goods; but I don't feel much chemistry there. Also, all women in "Wild Wild West" have been asked to do little more than look pretty; leaving the lovely Salma Hayek reduced to the role of eye candy. Only Kenneth Branagh, as the villain Loveless, really stands out. He's a joy to watch, playing oh-so over the top, working well out of his element and obviously having a bit of fun. (and is it ever not great to see ol' M.Emmet Walsh anytime possible?) Visually, there are lot of inventive things about "WWW", particularly those cool gadgets and it's villain's unusual disability. If only it's story had been so inventive...there really isn't much of a story. What we're left staring at is a wonderfully designed, but noisy, soulless, and cumbersome contraption (much like that incredible spider weapon).I was never all that familiar with the original TV series, so I don't know if this film's saturday matinee spirit was fitting-but I appreciated it. Don't get me wrong, "WWW" has it's positives--but it's not what we had hoped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing but ultimately disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I was not exactly anticipating this movie's release and had never liked the TV series, I decided to go check this one out on the basis of the previous work of the talent involved. I liked Sonnenfeld's previous films (especially his work with the Coen brothers) and Men in Black in particular was a lot of fun. Unfortunately, this is not remotely as exhilarating as any of those films, and while often inventive and engaging, it pretty much falls flat. There are some good gags, mostly when Smith and Branagh trade insults, and Kline is good as usual. Hayek shows her ass and that's about it. The violence is dark but not blackly funny as it should be--just sort of cruel for the hell of it, such as when one very minor character gets shot point-blank in the belly. There is a good scene where Smith fights off a number of bizarre, zombie-like henchmen, but the action is poorly-lit and, like other sections of the film, somewhat confusing. I wonder if this was meant to be released later in the summer and post-production suffered from a bumped-up schedule. The best scenes often seem rushed, whereas others meander with unnecessary padding. Kids will probably like it...I'd recommend seeing it at a matinee or when it hits the second-run circuit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I was walking out of Wild Wild West all I could think was, "Eh." I was hoping for a movie with either the blockbuster lavishness of Independence Day or perhaps the flat out cuteness of MIB, but I found neither. The usually likeable Will Smith played a character who was neither likeable nor interesting. The incredibly talented Kevin Kline and the lovely Salma Hayek were horribly wasted in what were painfully one-note characters. The only person who truly managed to shine through this sad film was Kenneth Branagh. He was funny, despicable, and pulled off a great Southern accent for a Brit. Will Smith's memorial day hat trick will probably be unaffected when it comes to box office, but this movie doesn't hold a candle to its predecessors OR to the talent of its cast.</fullReview>

It is much better and more memberable than the forgettable theme they replaced it with. It the same as if you went to a Hawaii Five-0 movie and didn't hear it's classic theme song. This movie is not in the same league as MIB. It is ok but it could have been better. In this movie Loveless is a Southern loyalist who lost the bottom half of his body in the Civil War and was responsible for the Death of Jim West's parents. In the original series Loveless was a Little Person who was just evil and wanted power for him self he didn't have a political agenda that I can remember. I think much of what made the original Wild Wild West at TV Classic was lost in this translation. It is ok but not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Smith continues as a sure-fire entertainer by tackling what is now a classic of TV lore. Yes, they do incorporate West's being black into the script (I had wondered if they would or if it would even be acknowledged) but it plays into the plot line using the bad guys being from the south. Kline again amuses and enhances a film partner. GCI work is astounding and fun- doesn't dominate. This felt like a good fun 2-hour episode only missing the halted manner of West on-film originator Robert Conrad and smarty-mouth Ross Martin. It's an intro- showing how the two got paired and ends leaving us waiting for more rollicking, sexy fun in the Wild, Wild West.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of the summer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Will Smith plays Will Smith playing James West - he's likable, I guess, but hardly believable. Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh are just painful to watch: Kline spends half his time in bad drag, and Branagh (who, through the miracle of special effects, is cut off north of his belly button) is WAY over the top as the bad guy. The height of wit in this movie is Branagh making racial jokes at Smith's expense and Smith making amputee jokes at Branagh's expense. The special effects are interesting for the first four minutes, but quickly lose their charm. Even Salma Hayek and that model from Victoria's Secret can't save this one. Save your money and watch the Wild Wild West video on MTV a couple of times - you'll have more fun.</fullReview>

The special effects were very well done and original. I'm not sure what I had a problem with, but I think it was the chemistry. Since the movie recounts Gordon's and West's first mission together, they were frequently at odds with each other.

Elmer Bernstien's score could be called at best "workman-like". It's there, but it doesn't inspire.

		<fullReview>Directed by Barry Sonnenfield, also from Men in Black, Wild Wild West takes the movie and sets it back a hundred or so years. Unfortunately, it also sets back the careers of all those involved with this movie. Starring the sorely underutilized Kevin Kline and the always unversatile Will Smith, the humor in this movie is not-existent. However, since I am not in this movie's apparent audience age of 4-8 years old, I found this film to be an exercise in patience. If you about 8 years old, you'll be able to appreciate a few of the jokes and humor in this movie. Otherwise, seek entertainment elsewhere and just rent Men in Black again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can the west ever be tamed? Well that's the goal of James T. West (Will Smith) and inventor Artemus Gordan (Kevin Kline). Spawned from a far greater series this West has its moments. The action sequences are spectacular and only paralleled by great special effects. Kenneth Branaugh pays the psycho inventor Dr. Arliss Loveless (oh the irony of names, but it adds to the campiness of the whole thing). For once the trailers didn't give away a crucial plot/character element, i.e. Loveless wheelchair. The west is full of out right humor but is much more appreciated for its snide and subtle humor (sheep and French for instance). The best thing about this movie is the fact that it branches out on its own and creates a whole new West and leaves the TV series safe in history. The only parallels come in through genre and a few name sakes. If you were disappointed with Star Wars this movie will give a start to making it up to you.</fullReview>

Not that it is a big problem though, Smith has enough power and charisma to carry the weight of the whole movie. The most interesting part of this movie is the art direction. The excellent sets and incredible gadgets (an 80-feet tall tarantula) are all designed in a Jules-Verne kind-a look. Instead of looking like an ordinary Western, WILD WILD WEST is a refreshing mixture of nineties' science-fiction, adventure and humor.</fullReview>

With the amount of talent involved, it should have been better.Having never seen the television show before, the premise of a sci-fi western intrigued me, and still does. The production design is the true star of the movie. From its elaborate sets, costumes, and steel machinery of the monster spider, there's hardly a time on screen that there is not something interesting to look at.Sadly, the movie fails on all other aspects. The action sequences never build to exciting climaxes; the comedy is not very funny; and the chemistry between Smith and Klein is almost non-existent.You may never be bored by what you see, but everything else in this movie is just plain flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went hoping for a continuation of the feel of the '60s show with the special effects of '90s... and was disappointed on both counts. Will Smith and Kevin Kline are among my favorite actors but aren't given much in this film and they certainly don't gel as partners. The original James West (as played by Robert Conrad) had a certain "coolness" about him; the Smith characterization craves center stage and craves it loudly. Ross Martin's Artemus Gordon was humorous yet confident; Kline's is mildly amusing yet geeky. Kenneth Branagh's character was excellent, although NOTHING like the original Loveless.The story starts off slowly and builds to a predictable, boring end. The special effects were "OK" but not awe-inspiring. One thing that was kind of irritating was the addition of a racial storyline, apparently to cover for putting Smith in the lead role. It certainly wasn't presented as realistically as it would have been in the 1860s, anyway.Your best bet is to wait for the dollar theater to see this one.</fullReview>

Whatever success it does have, it won't be due to the acting performances by the stars of the movie such as Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Salma Hayek.Having seen the movie at a special preview before the world premiere, I must admit to being rather disappointed. While I didn't expect a whole lot from the trailer (my only thought was "what in God's name is that spider!?") I was still not satisfied. Will Smith's acting is OK but no more than that. Kevin Kline has some great moments, but suffers from the horrible plot. Salma Hayek is only in the movie for one thing: Her name and good looks (which of course is a bonus for the film).Having said that, I still give the movie a 7 out of 10 - which in my book is an average OK movie worth watching on video or TV..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know what? There is a giant mechanical spider in this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is fairly obvious that the crew behind this film were really proud of their giant robot spider as it was featured in all the trailers and a good portion of this film. In fact the way the movie plays out it looks like the movie's main reason for existence was to feature said spider in a movie, the rest of the film being unimportant to them which is why most of the movie seems like underdeveloped filler to get us to the spider. Which is why the film suffers and is an example of Hollywood not coming up with anything new and instead resorting to remaking an old movie or old television show, in this case a television show I have never really seen any episodes of in my entire life. I will admit that once in a while Hollywood will hit pay dirt with these remakes as it did with "The Fugitive", but these hits are few and far between. Usually you end up with a horrible film like say "The Avengers", "The Mod Squad", or this movie. This film though seemed destined to be bad as I remember that it came out the same time as the Columbine shootings and they did re shoots on the movie to make Gordon against guns thus most likely ruining some of the continuity of the film. It also did not help that Barry Sonnefield directed this film, as he did good with the first "Men in Black" movie, but all the other movies of his that I have seen end up like this film. He does not seem to know what audience he is marketing these films too, he puts lots of violence in them seemingly aiming his movies more to adults, while at the same time he puts lots of goop in movies cause kids like goop. Will Smith and Kevin Klein are uninspired and in the case of Klein uninspired in two roles, why not just get another actor is beyond me, I guess they were trying to cut some costs so they could pour more money into that spider. Both actors seem to be just there to get a paycheck, but once again this could be partly do to the re shoots because after being essentially done with the film they are called back to shoot additional scenes. The villain, Loveless was horrible as were most of the twists and turns in this movie that is set in the old west, but boasts machines that did not appear in that era, which could have been good if done more correctly instead it seems like precious little time was spent on the script and more time was spent once again on the spider which looked okay, but nothing special. At least they did not try to hide what it looked like, like the makers of the bad "Godzilla" movie tried to do. So in the end this film is rather bad, I did sort of like the collars with the saws, but even that scene ended stupidly as somehow in the middle of a cornfield our heroes fall into a chasm filled with goop and that sadly is what most of this movie is...goop and a giant spider.</fullReview>

The rest of the cast is largely wasted,employed merely to stand around sides splitting at Mr West's amusing sallies or scowl at him,depending on which side of the Mason - Dixon line they come from. Frankly it's about time Hollywood forgot about plundering old TV shows and remembered how to make original and stimulating entertainment. Surely that can't be too much to ask?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I did laugh a fair bit in this mad sci-fi Western (a small genre with only Back To The Future III and Westworld for company!). This is largely due to the charisma of Will Smith and Kevin Kline, although the latter is not quite on form. Kenneth Branagh might have romped off as the one thing to remember this film for were it not for two things. Firstly I think he gets carried away and ends up not just a mad scientist but a rather demonic one. It becomes a bit rich for the mix. In this he's not helped by the look of the film, very dark and strangely coloured - no doubt a combination of design and the necessity of incorporating the computer graphics. The other issue is Salma Hayek, who, not for the first time, threatens to overbalance the film with her sex appeal. She's a card that Sonnenfeld overplays. Or maybe that's just me... 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little over a month ago, I saw Wild Wild West at Target for $4.50, I heard horrible things about the film, but I figured, it's the rental price, sometimes these movies are not as bad as most say. So I went ahead and bought it, my mistake, I watched it tonite and wasn't really impressed. I mean, while it's a little better than what most would say, it does fall flat with too many fancy effects and Will Smith almost has a love affair with himself in this film. Now Will Smith is one of those rare actors that you can tell on screen as well as off that he has a huge ego, but everyone still loves him because he has a charm and such a presence on screen, he's easy to forgive. However, even though I am not a fan of The Matrix, he turned down The Matrix for this?! What the heck was he thinking? This movie was just very average and held nothing special.Jim West is a war hero who is just loving life as it's loving him right back, he's pretty much won everything he's been handed. Artemus Gordon is a master of disguise and a genius, so when an evil master mind, Loveless, threatens to take over, President Grant partners Artemus and Jim together who of course at first have no chemistry and have to capture Loveless. When a can can girl comes into play, who wants to save "her father", she helps them track down Loveless and they must come up with a clever idea to defeat him.Now, Wild Wild West isn't a bad film, it's just made a little strange. Like the cast, Will Smith may be charming, but this movie, he comes off more of a jerk than a smooth cowboy. Selma Hayek, beautiful girl, strange role to take on, the accent was a little distracting I'd say, not to mention I wasn't really impressed with the "acting qualities" she has. Now, for a family film, this isn't a bad idea, it's cute in some moments and funny in others, but for a film on entertainment that you're just looking for a good time? I wouldn't really recommend it.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still think that Matthew McConaughey and Oliver Platt would have been a better choice as James West and Artemus Gordon.And the screen play could have used a little tweaking , maybe by taking some input from Conrad and maybe some of the fans who know the show inside and out.I just look at this movie as a spoof of a good movie.Kline made Artemus too effeminate. The only good point of this movie was Salma Hayek . I hope that someone would like to make this movie over again with a better script and actorsBut hey this is me</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a big fan of the TV series and like most people who went to see the movie I tried to keep an open mind. The film falls short in so many area that not even the special effects can save it. The race card is played as a statement to the social injustices of the time. We are all aware of the how poorly blacks were treated during this time period. We don't need it driven home while we are in the entertainment mode. It's a bad idea all around. Will Smith offers some comic relief to the otherwise sad statement but at times seems to try to hard. I would bet he even found the script a drag. The movie is played on cable from time to time. It's not worth the electricity or the wear and tear on your set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Horrible, But Far From Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild Wild West" seems to have gotten a really bad reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. After all it is based on a television series with one of the more outlandish, albeit cool, fun and original, plot devices. The way I see it, director Barry Sonnenfeld took the television show to a different level. The original was different and hip for the 1960's, but I doubt that same approach would have worked in the 1990's. True the film took a lot of liberties with historical facts, assumed or otherwise. But so did the t.v. show. And the addition of more current '90's references didn't help (I'd say that's my biggest problem with the movie, aside from Will Smith's ridiculous belly dancing scene). But then the original series wasn't a stickler for accuracy. Just look at the mens' 1960's hairstyles and the women's 1960's style make-up. And I notice from a post about the original series that several "Gilligan's Island" reference was made, though I don't know why. I just see it as a fun, silly romp, just like the original series was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Razzie winning director Barry Sonnenfeld (Men in Black) this is an alright transfer of a TV programme to film, but how it was really popular is a bit of a concern. Will Smith as Capt. James West is basically trying to stop a plot to destroy the (not very big) United States, they know this because scientists in destructive fields (fire arms, explosives, etc) have been kidnapped. He is accompanied by inventor U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (twice Razzie nominated Kevin Kline) to stop the suspected General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine), and then the real villain, Dr. Arliss Loveless (Razzie nominated Kenneth Branagh). Soon enough, the villains kidnap the one person who can surrender the United States, Pres. Ulysses S. Grant (Kline again). Also starring Razzie nominated Salma Hayek as Rita Escobar and M. Emmet Walsh as Coleman. Filled with not hilarious small jokes, weapons and some more modern things, such as a mechanical spider, this is not a bad film, but it is certainly not one to watch very often. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song for Smith's title song (why?) and Worst Screen Couple for Smith and Kline. Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I amazed that so many people disliked "Wild Wild West", and even compared it unfavorably with such formula movies as "Enemy of the State", the ultra-predictable "Independence Day", and the long-winded and tedious "Ali".I enjoyed "Wild Wild West" so much that I grabbed the opportunity to see it again on TV. It does not pretend to be anything other than what it is -- light-hearted entertainment, not intended to be taken seriously. The plot is outrageous, the special effects brilliant, the complicated gadgetry delightful, and the performances over the top. Despite a few dull moments, the script is witty and amusing, and the characters, absurd as they are, are always consistent.Perhaps those who disliked the film were expecting something different, that is to say, more of what they are used to. If so, their disappointment is understandable. But the very essence of this comedy was its sheer unpredictability. It is not "The Ladykillers" (the Alec Guiness version) nor "Kind Hearts and Coronets", but I found it highly enjoyable, and certainly laughed out loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read many other reviews of this film and I struggle to find one that says nice things about it. The wackiness of the inventions is what really does it for me, the magnetic homing guillotine is excellent and who wouldn't be slightly scared of an 80 foot tarantula. The draw of this film for me is the way in which the people react to these mechanical creations; because it is set in a time when mechanics were quite rare it is fun to see how inventive the designers have to be. I think Will Smith and Kevin Kline have an amazing on screen inter-action with each other, scenes that are mostly conversation are kept entertaining by their delivery of some great lines. I have seen this film many times and seriously recommend it to anybody who would "like" to see Kevin Kline in a dress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though I normally like both Will Smith and action comedy's, I cant possibly like this. This is so irritating all the time. It teases the true history all the time. And there is only one example that is representative for that: the entire movie! That is the best example to that I can give. And by the way, this is supposed to be funny, right? Well none of the things I can find in this movie are funny. Its just so boring. I had a hard time sitting through this movie, so when it had ended, I could almost hold a party and celebrate its end with a party bigger than the fanciest meet and greet party after an Iron Maiden concert. It ain't enough with Will Smiths quick and catchy phrases. It ain't enough with such a great actor as Kenneth Branagh. It ain't enough with anything. All the quick moves that would be impossible in real life ain't funny, their not funny at all. They're just irritating and, most important, they're NOT cool. There is practically no cool moments at all in this. As I told you, just horrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild, Wild West" could have been a good film. It had great stars and a great director. So what happened? BAD script. Usually this kills a film. You could make a television show out of it: "When Bad Scripts Happen To Good Films." Will Smith plays West, and Kevin Kline plays Gordon (As well as the President). The two of them have to learn how to get along as they try to stop Loveless (Kenneth Branagh)from killing the president and taking over the United States.The special effects and gadgets (Loveless's Spider devices are pretty cool), but they only serve to remind you that this could have been a good film. The women in the film (Salma Hayek, for example)are seen as just sex objects. Hayek seems to be in the film just to cause friction between Smith and Kline.One more thing: Am I the only one to be disturbed by Smith in drag?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The poster boy for Hollywood marketing gone wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every summer Hollywood studios release their big 100+ million dollar movies with 50M marketing budgets attached. Pretty soon we are subjected to fast food tie-ins, massive billboards along freeways, magazine covers, TV specials and basically anything else that the studio can think of to convince us to watch their film. To be honest, I always thought of their marketing as an insurance policy by the studio as opposed to building hype for a big project. When a film costs 170M you want to make damn well sure the bills get paid and the studio doesn't deny you future projects, (plus, the studio wants to make sure they make a good profit off of the film). It's a sad fact in Hollywood when films only get made for that one goal: to make money and to do whatever it takes to make sure that gets done.Wild Wild West is a big-budget movie that a degree of hype that was only overshadowed by Phantom Menace during it's summer of release, basically that means that besides a Star Wars film it was the most hyped film of that summer. I recall seeing trailers for this film in front of TPM and quite frankly I didn't think much of it. That's to say I wasn't intrigued into seeing it nor did I refer to it as a "flop in the making" when I would talk about it in future conversations. Naturally, when the film faded out of memory of the press and whimpered out of the box office only to be quietly released on video, I had to see this one to see what went wrong.One of the oldest arguments I've heard is that "summer films are supposed to be unrealistic and are supposed to be fake", this argument should only be used in certain cases. It should only be used when small nitpicks are made such as me saying "in scene 124 I noticed a small discrepancy in the backgrounds used for shot #121", but when a 80 foot tall steam-powered tarantula walks across the desert shooting fireballs in local towns...then the argument gains meaning. This movie tries hard to re-create the Wild West, considering the amount of effort they went into making costumes, sets and showing little details to re-create the atmosphere, (such as showing the construction of the Capitol building). Ironically, it seems the filmmakers at the same time figured that they shouldn't follow history and are basically free to do whatever they want, so "unleash the tarantulas and the henchmen with armour-played scalps" the producers probably said the first day of filming.Wild Wild West tries, it really does, it has the star power of Will Smith and the acting abilities of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. It has the CGI which I must say looks impressive for what it does, it has the action, it has the atmosphere executed rather well like I've stated before. What went wrong?The script was terrible and no attention was paid to keeping anything believable or intact with poor pacing dragging everything down. Will Smith's style of humour and acting does not belong in a film about the wild west, nor does Kevin Kline's abilities deserve to be wasted trying to be a foil to Will Smith's acting or a prostitute, don't even get me started on Branagh's accent which borderlines on stereotypical and just plain annoying. The film tries to institute gadgets into the plot as well, none of which are particular clever and most are just trying to look "good" in a 19th century setting, (such as using a man's head for photographic evidence, sounds marginally clever but just looks ridiculous in practise. Then there are the scenes intended for comedy, such as the lynching scene where Will Smith tries to explain his actions and the word "redneck" which just plain falls flat as it tries to use out-dated 19th century stereotypes for comedic purposes, (such as using examples of drumming in Africa and Smith's alleged "roots" there).It's not a horrible film, and I'm still a little hesitant it won Worst Picture and is now in the ranks of Battlefield Earth &amp; Showgirls in badness according to the Razzies. It's more of an overly ambitious summer film that tries too hard and as a result all of it's flaws are brought into a larger focus. It really isn't as bad as watching Travolta play a Klingon rip-off or watching Elizabeth Berkley trying to act.4.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is immediately clear to see why this film has garnered such awful reviews and comments, and why it is considered one of the worst (if not THE worst) films of 1999. On a realistic standpoint, the acting is bad and the dialogue is worse; the visual effects are crappy and the comedy is even worse; and...Well, you get the idea, I suppose.But even after all the bad reviews, all the lame comments, and all the truly horrible filmmaking, I can't help but liking the film --- just a little bit. But I'll admit: the first half of the film is truly dreadful. The idea and the plot are interesting, but are totally wasted to the point it's almost painful to watch, really...After the half-way mark, however, things begin to pick up, although they never reach the heights 1997's "Men in Black" did. Kline and Smith are --- or, more appropriately, would have been --- perfect together, if not for the fact that their dialogue reaks of rotten cheese. On the other hand, some sequences do deserve a chuckle (the "exhilerating romp through the cornfield" being one), but unfortunately, the laughs don't hold up.If a little more thought had been put into the production design and script, "Wild Wild West" could have turned out to be the surprise hit of 1999. As it stands, it's an awkward, unusual, half-hearted attempt at another "MiB". I suppose you could do worse --- just don't waste too much money on this stinker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Reading user's comments after having seen the flick yesterday night on TV, I'm not overly surprised by the 'lukewarm' reception the movie got. For one thing, big name actors, special FX, right on the heels of MIB, you could expect a big good ol' blockbuster but, well, that's not what you get.Eg. right on the heels of a somewhat moving view of 'America in its humble glorious beginning' (a 'small white house', the Capitol in construction...), corny jokes start flying (the President getting its fair share...) and that's right about the spirit of this movie, offbeat, uneven (well, VERY uneven), outrageous jokes (some very bad, but when they're on the mark, they are a great laugh and leave you wondering 'Oh, my God...'). In the end, unusual, surprising, uneven, an unusual not that bad 'big-budget' flick.One last comment, I have to agree with other imdb-ers out there on one point, though I love mister Brannagh ('Much ado about nothing' is one fine movie !) he's absolutely awful in this movie. Well, at least, Kevin Kline, while maybe a little sub-par in this one, is quite good and Salma Hayek, well, she doesn't act that much, but for this role, does it really matter (grin).Alain</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has only two things going for it - Salma Hayek. OK, bad joke, but then, this whole film is one big, bad joke. Sometimes, when a movie combines several different genres, as with a great recipe combining different foods, we get much more than the sum of their parts. In this one, it's the exact opposite. It's like combining sushi, barbeque sauce, peanut butter, and broccoli in a blender. Each ingredient is just fine, but the combined result is simply horrible. That's what we get here - a combination Western, comedy, Jules Verne-esque sci-fi tale, and big budget effects spectacular that succeeds only in leaving a really bad taste in our mouths. The two "heroes", Will Smith and Kevin Kline, are, as partners, the antithesis of the "Men in Black" duo, in fact, they actually seem to have *negative* chemistry in that, when they're on screen together, they are far worse than each is alone. Kenneth Branaugh, no matter how hard he tries, cannot succeed at making his sawed off combination of Southern patriot/mad genius character seem anything but bizarre. The situations and accompanying dialog are rife with cringe moments, most notably a scene in which Smith and the chief villain fling cripple jokes and racial taunts at each other, which is soon followed by a scene involving Smith, a busty white woman, and then a lynch mob. It's supposed to be funny; it ends up being a huge embarrassment for everyone in it. I could go on, but suffice it to say that any movie in which the last half hour or so is spent fighting aboard a 50-foot high steam driven mechanical spider is one to run, not walk, away from as fast as you can. 2/10 and that's only because, if you fast forward past any scene that doesn't feature Salma Hayek, you'll get maybe 10 minutes of actual entertainment value. Otherwise, this stinker would get a 0.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has several strikes against it. I like the actors, several of whom I empathize for having been in so rotten a film. Next, I am a history buff, and while I can take suspension of disbelief, I was livid at the ridiculous historical errors this film made. I was deeply offended by the racial humor. Finally, this film is an insult to the people who paid money to see it.The actors are fumbling around the picture. Will Smith seems confused about how to play Jim West, Kevin Kline seems almost embarrassed to be in this film (In TWO roles, no less!), Salma Hayek is there to show off her butt crack, but the greatest pain is watching the magnificent Shakespearean actor Kenneth Branaugh playing Arliss Loveless overacting every scene using an atrocious Southern/Western accent. It's hard to believe this guy was such a great Hamlet.The humor is struggling, and at many times, offensive. The lynching scene made me wonder if African-Americans were just as offended at seeing Will Smith equivocate pounding a woman's breasts with communicating by drum like in Africa. The racial element also took an odd dark turn, which began to confuse me about whether the film was a comedy or a drama.Now we get into the biggest historical blunder in the film.**POSSIBLE SPOILER(Like you care)*** Arliss's grand plan is to kidnap President Grant and force him to sign a treaty that would divy up the U.S. to it's earlier owners (Britain, France, and Spain) and of course leave some for himself. First, by the time this movie was taking place, not one of these countries would want their old territories back. France, in particular, had given up the purchase because they simply couldn't maintain control there anymore. This plan also ignores the fact that President Grant, as inept a leader as he was, would likely not ignore that several of U.S. trade partners had just conspired against him, evil madman or not.Enough of that, this movie offends on all levels. I don't blame Robert Conrad for accepting 3 of the Razzies this load of garbage picked up that year. I suggest you avoid this film at all costs, because it's just not worth the pain.</fullReview>

Will Smith, Kevin Kline &amp; Kenneth Brannagh are all great actors (unfortunately the rest of the main cast are crap), and the characters of Kline &amp; Smith were great too. So what was wrong with it? 2 words: 'The' and 'plot'. It was as weak as p***. Like it had been put together in 2 minutes for a childs cartoon. It just gave good actors good characters nothing to work with. I'd still like to see a Wild West 2, as I said, the premise is a good one. It just needs a storyline to at least stop the viewer from slipping in &amp; out of sleep for 90 minutes.I would though like to see Will Smith stick to comedies. Like Eddie Murphy &amp; Leslie Nielson they're made to make people laugh. Both of those have attempted 'serious' films with no great success. Hopefully this will be the end of Will's attempts at non humorous films.3/10 (for everything other than the plot being ok).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unbelievable from the start, but a big hit amongst the young Will Smith fans. The black man in the American west has now been seen as a fashion icon amongst the young female community, and is mirrored in summer carnivals in the UK. Kenneth Brannagh continues to spread his wings amongst the Black American community. He had worked with Denzel Washington in 'Much Ado About Nothing', Laurence Fishburne in 'Othello', and now Will Smith in 'Wild Wild West'. He even worked with Adrian Lester in 'Love's Labour's Lost', but has not yet managed to enlist the talents of Wesley Snipes and Samuel L. Jackson. In this film, he plays the confederate antagonist against Will Smith's yankee protagonist, but the special effects and storyline makes the encounter far fetched. An interesting attempt to work with Will Smith on Kenneth Brannagh's part, but overall not a very good self contained film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one TV redo that lives up to its hype!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually and conceptually brilliant, Wild Wild West is true to its TV source material, while being innovative and modern for movie goers. The action is furious and the acting is fantastic. While many may have criticized making Jim West African American, Will Smith does a great job, and in a sense, makes the legend of Wild Wild West more modern. Taking several liberties with the original TV continuity, Wild Wild West stays true to its heritage, unlike other recent TV-to-Movie translations Mission:Impossible and Charlie's Angels. The plot itself is bold and brilliant, as I have not seen any movie visit this angle of the historical West. Making Dr. Loveless a Confederate diehard, who plans vengeance against the United States and President Grant, is inspired. The interaction between Agent West and Dr. Loveless is classic, as both are respectful but scornful of each other. Making Dr. Loveless a vengeful cybermaster is better than the diminutive devil of the series. Also, Dr. Loveless's fatal foursome was another classic cliche of the old series. Wild Wild West is a fun romp; leave your brain at home, and let Hollywood weave a web of western wow!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild, Wild West was, without a doubt, my favorite when I was a child. So when I first heard about this movie, I wanted nothing to do with it. But, when I took the plunge and finally watched it, I was very surprised. Will Smith played the role of James West with the same gusto that Robert Conrad used in the 1960's. As for Kevin Klien, he wasn't trying to be funny. The role of Artimus Gordon wasn't for comic relief. It was a very complex role that I feel was perfect for Klien. True, the story line was hokey, but so was the TV series. To watch any movie that uses a story line from an old TV series you must remember that it ISN'T the series. Once you do that, you can enjoy the film. This film has it all over Hot Shots and other so-called comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere near as bad as ID4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How seriously were you people taking this film? It's just an entertaining bit of Hollywood fluff, by no means a particularly brilliant film, but certainly not as bad as most of the garbage LA produces. Maybe those of you who'd seen the TV series (I haven't) were disappointed that it was different. Maybe those of you who love westerns were disappointed that it didn't take the genre seriously. I don't know. But it was nowhere near as bad as crap like Independence Day. I think the premise of a technologically advanced 19th century works well, and the four main actors all have plenty of charisma to carry it off. Sure, the jokes are lame, but then they usually are in Hollywood movies.I really don't think this film deserved to bomb the way it did. I'd give it 7/10.</fullReview>

It certainly didnt have much relevance to the story. call me cynical but did will Smith produce the song before the story was made? It wouldn't suprise me.

		<shortDescription>Whoa...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been much of a fan of the old WILD WILD WEST show, but I have to admit this movie almost made it look good by comparison. The film is just so frighteningly bad in a way I've never quite seen on the big screen before.The idea of Jim West being a black man in the Reconstruction era was an inspiration that should have created some welcome dimension. A marshall who starts out hesitantly unsure of how to deal with people who will automatically hate him, and then becomes tough as the story unfolds, is more fun than your typical western-parody static swaggering conceited hero. With his earnest everyman charm, Will Smith should have been the right actor to essay the role. Unfortunately, he ends up playing it as a static swaggering conceited hero. On steroids. Whose idea was this?The only other performance I remember much is Kenneth Branagh's. Whatever else can be said of his acting choices, they certainly are original. He's morbidly interesting to watch at first...but after a while I was looking away from him and all the other actors in embarrassment.This is a loud, showy and imaginative film (with a few good scenes, incredibly) and by all rights it should be entertaining if only because it's such a bizarre, colossal wreck. It isn't. Maybe it's because of the knowledge that this will hurt the careers of Sonnenfeld, Smith, Kline and the rest, or because of the clash between its tedious tongue-in-cheek attitude (one of the things I didn't like about the TV series) and its depressing references to the racism of the era. Well, as the saying goes, only really talented people can create something truly bad, and these people have earned enough credit in the past to make me look forward to their ascent from the ashes. After that, who knows? WILD WILD WEST may become my favorite bad movie. I must say, it definitely took guts to make it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Expect a TV Show Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you expect "Wild, Wild West" to be a remake of the 60s TV show, you'll be disappointed. If you expected to see some great special effects, you'll probably be disappointed there as well. If you expect a great storyline, well, you'll probably be disappointed.However, if you can let go of all your preconceptions and just go along for a silly little romp, then I've seen many movies much worse than this one! The movie has definitely been made with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and if you can accept that, then you won't walk out thinking you've wasted your time in watching.Will Smith and Kevin Kline obviously were having fun with this comedy, and the writers were over-the-top in taking the characters from the TV Show and moving them to the extremes. Easiest to see in this vein are their "aversions" to each others ideas. The Jim West (Smith) character in the TV show always used the little tools and tricks that Artemis Gordon (Kline) designed. Likewise, Gordon wasn't afraid to use a gun in the series. By making them caricatures of caricatures, the story line becomes just plain silly.My biggest complaint though is with the special effects. With all due respect just because you can create something on a computer doesn't mean you should! Backgrounds and other tricks looked silly. The stock shots (I'm guessing they were stock) of monument valley were wonderful, the blue screen backgrounds of the desert paled by comparison. Sometimes less is more, and I think the movie could have done much more with a lot less computer-generated effects.The one exception to this rule -- Kenneth Branagh's makeup was amazing. Equally impressive was his accent. I never would have known he was the actor without reading the credits.Adults might enjoy this movie for a laugh, and kids will generally enjoy the effects. There is a great deal of violence, some of it disgusting (a decapitated head), and a bit of sophomoric humor concerning women's breasts, plus a great deal of sexual innuendo. Will Smith also gets a free shot of his naked backside. Language is kept to a minimum. All this combines to explain the PG-13 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't take my word for it. I just don't like most modern movies--especially action movies. Too loud, too in-your-face, predictable, and please no more computer effects. So I was ready to hate this one, especially after hearing how bad it was. I was too lazy to change the channel last night and ended up watching the whole thing. And maybe it was due to low expectations, but I liked it. It was so silly and unbelievable that it charmed me. That 80' mechanical tarantula, all steam-powered and like the fantasy of a diabolical Victorian was a hoot. A lot of the jokes were lame--but this is a movie to cause no real offense. It's fun.

		<fullReview>O.k., this movie got a very bad rap when it came out in the summer of 1999, but the summer period is always a time when movies slated, and it was up against The Phantom Menace. Wild Wild West is not as bad as everyone thinks. The effects are excellent (Apart from certain green screen shots which are sloppy), especially the mechanical spider, the film has a lively, fun, if admittedly, slightly tired formula, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. On the bad side, the script is a very hit and miss affair, quite a lot of the jokes unfortunately don't work, leaving the actors looking foolish, the acting is ropey, and there is quite a heavy amount of racism, sexism etc. The film is splendid to look at though, costumes, sets, props all first class. On the whole Wild Wild West never set out to redefine cinema, it did totally the opposite, a very superficial effort from the Men in Black team, but still very enjoyable.3 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West is fun, exciting, and funny. Will Smith stars as the tough talking, shoot first ask question later, ladies' man James West. Kevin Kline plays Artemus Gordon, the smart, inventor of the duo. They don't like each other but must team up to stop a psycho, Dr. Arliss Loveless(Kenneth Branagh), who has kidnapped the country's best scientists and is prepared to hold the U.S. hostage if the president doesn't surrender the government. The film is a action comedy. There is a lot of buddy comedy between Smith and Kline, some of it that is laugh out loud funny and some of it that's not too funny. Branagh is convincing as Loveless, he's acts goofy and bleeds evil. Now a lot of this film is fantasy. All the gadgets that are built by Kline and the evil toys built for Loveless, everyone knows that they couldn't happen in that time. But while watching this film it is pretty cool to see them. There is a lot of action. This is a big budget film. There's much more action in this film than in the other Smith/Sonnenfeld collaboration(MIB). There are gunfights, fist fights, and lots of explosions. In all the film isn't that bad. It's fun to watch and will make you laugh. I like it. And I think anyone who hasn't seen it should. It's a fast, fun and funny ride that will make you wanna be a cowboy. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When will they learn that special effects are worthless without ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, `without a decent script' is the standard way to end that sentence, and indeed, the script to `Wild Wild West' is execrable - I'll get to that in a moment. But I was going to say, `a sense of visual flair'. A film's special effects are only ever as good as its art direction. `Wild Wild West' is crammed with computer-manipulated images, and while some of the computer manipulation is convincing enough (although most of it is cheesy) the images themselves are poorly conceived and ugly, ugly, ugly. No spectacle, no visual delight. Lots of awful fish-eye lensmanship and unconvincingly lit night scenes. And look at poor Salma Hayek! It takes real skill to make her look as unattractive as those costumes and that camera-work make her look. Overlook every single vice of the script, and the film is STILL bad.I can't recall having seen a more poorly-written comedy. (I've seen WORSE comedies, with slightly better scripts but without Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh struggling to save them. Kevin Kline in particular. Branagh is struggling partly to save the film and partly to keep his accent steady.) The most I will allow is that the `no more mister knife guy' line was sort of amusing, or would have been under other circumstances - but then I'm a sucker for puns. Otherwise it's pure vacuum. It's like a comedy written by anthropologists from a far land who know vaguely what comedies look like but don't understand what jokes are. And yet the theory that it was meant to be a comedy is the most charitable explanation.Still, you can watch the film and then forget that you've seen it, so it doesn't quite rise to the hights of badness inhabited by things like `Showgirls'. For the most part it's negatively rather than positively bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The inevitable result of backwards Hollywood filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a bad movie, which is not to say that there were no good things about it. Salma Hayek was in it, and the tarantula was pretty cool the first dozen or so times it appeared. However, after having watched this movie for the first time (on DVD), I have to wonder how Hollywood gets away with having so little respect for its audience to release a film like this and expect us to spend our hard-earned money to go see it. Who approves projects like this? Doesn't anybody, at some point in making films like this, stop and say, "Wait a minute, this is REALLY bad?" Well, I guess not, since they keep pumping 'em out, and somebody keeps going to see them.This film was obviously conceived in the complete opposite way that a film should be. Instead of starting with a story, I believe they started with an actor: "Will Smith needs a blockbuster movie for next summer, any ideas?" The response, "How about a remake of 'Wild Wild West' with Smith as Jim West?" No problems so far, other than the fact that, with the exception of "The Fugitive" and most even-numbered "Star Trek" movies, not one decent flick has had a TV series as its basis (although I'm willing to let "Wayne's World" slide). But so far, on Fresh Prince and a fairly interesting premise alone, we'll give it a chance.Next issue: "Who can be the Will's sidekick?" "How about Kevin Kline?" Now it's getting interesting. When I heard that these two were to be in a film together, I was immediately interested in seeing it (and in fact, although the movie was NOT good, neither Smith nor Kline appeared to be going through the motions in this film. I can't imagine anyone doing much better than they did with this ridiculous, insipid project). But after that, things started to go downhill fast."Well, 'Wild Wild West' wasn't very effects-oriented, and Will Smith is an "effects movie" actor (ID4, MIB). So somebody think up a cool effect." Silence... then, "Well, how about a giant robotic tarantula that stomps towns and blows stuff up?" The excited Hollywood guys jump up clapping, and say, "OK, you've sold us. Make the movie! It'll be huge! And see if you can't get a story together while you're at it, before you start shooting, if at all possible."Decent movies have started with less ("Armageddon" for example, and "Godzilla," which, as incredible as it may seem, is much better than 'WWW,' which if nothing else tells you how truly bad this movie is), but rare is the movie that brings its good ideas together in such an irritatingly discombobulated trainwreck as "WWW". I watched until the end only to see if it could get any worse, and only in this did it fail to disappoint.</fullReview>

The spider weapon effects were fantastic and were easily the highlight of the film. That doesn't mean the rest was tripe. The whole film was watchable and funny, though not in an intelligent Woody Allen sort of way.Kevin Kline is one of my favourite Hollywood actors and did enough to be funnier than Will Smith without stealing his thunder. Will himself, with his limited acting abilities, came across OK and had his chance to perform some old Prince of Bel Air japes.If I had a choice between renting out Independence Day or this on DVD then Wild Wild West would win it. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite all the criticism of Wild Wild West I still bought the DVD, and having not seen the movie at the cinema either. Foolish? Maybe, but I enjoyed the movie nonetheless. Will Smith was, well, Will Smith (perhaps slightly miscast), Kevin Kline did well in his role, and it was great to see Kenneth Branagh let his hair down and do something fun (and not Shakespeare). Salma Hayek's role was admittedly almost none existent, and I felt cheated by the conclusion of her plotline (as little there was of it). The story did suffer for pacing; the sequence with the collars locked together went on too long in my opinion. Some of the jokes did fall a little flat. The opening credits sequence was great, and Elmer Bernstein's score was exactly right for the movie. But there was still not enough of the Wild West/Western influence. The effects? Stunning. The 80-foot Tarantula was certainly the visual highlight, and the sets and costumes were wonderful. Some good DVD extras as well. So should you buy it? No, rent it first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Barry Sonnenfeld who also directed Will Smith in "Men in Black" returns to try his hand in the wild west, but fails miserably. I honestly don't believe we can blame Will Smith or Kevin Kline for this mediocre film. They did the best they could considering what they had to work with. Although the critics were right this time in their poor appraisal of the film, I believe it is at least worth the video rental price, and there are some great special effects. I am pretty disappointed that there were so few jokes since this was openly geared toward being a comedy. Without being overly critical there are a few laughs in it, and if you are a fan of sexy co-star Salma Hayek like I am, then you definitely need to rent the video, but don't expect to hear her say much, she is obviously there for viewing pleasure only. The story is basically about President Grant (Kline) whom orders two of his best men to thwart the evil genius of Dr. Arliss Loveless. One is an inventor and US Marshal Artemus Gordon (also Kline). The other is a civil war hero and gunfighter James West (Smith). After getting over there distinct distrust of each other they work together to complete their mission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A special kind of disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any hack (almost inevitably produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) can make a bad movie, but "Wild Wild West" is that special kind of disaster that only talented people could have made. Barry Sonnenfeld is a talented director - he made the truly inventive "Men in Black" in 1997 - and the stars have been appealing in the past. But when you become too successful in Hollywood, eventually people don't question your judgment when they really should. That's what happened here.The film stars Will Smith and Kevin Kline (who disowned the film before it was released) as mid-19th century Treasury agents out to stop a mad villain - Kenneth Brahagh, who I assume really needed the money to make another Shakespeare film - from destroying America with his giant mechanical spider. I'm not leaving much out by way of plot here, but never have I seen so many jokes fall flat - Smith's constant jibes about recently-abolished slavery are especially appalling. (Mel Brooks could have made 'em funny, but that's about it - and now I'm reminded of how great "Blazing Saddles" was, but that's another story.)The sad part is that there are a few flashes of inspiration throughout "Wild Wild West", such as a dazzling shot of 1860s Washington with the Capitol Dome under construction in the background. But the whole production gives the aura of successful people assuming everything they touch turns to gold. This movie definitely did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>since i've got a new computer with a standard DVD player on it, but no Digital Versatile Disc, i decided to rent one to see if this whole hype is true. I thought i'd see The Matrix, but since it was rented out (wouldn't you know it), i took Wild Wild West from the shelf, because i saw it had a lot of extra documentaries and heard it had a lot of special effects. I didn't really take because i thought that it would be a very good movie, because i had already heard it was bad. So, you can imagine, i had very low expectations of it and i only watched for the extras. But, i found out this movie is pretty good! I liked it from the beginning to the end. The credits sequence i liked very much, and everything that came after it. True, it had a very thin plot and true, it was a bit silly at times, but it's not meant to be taken seriously. It has a lot of funny moments and i loved all those crazy gadgets. Will Smith again gives us a great comedic performance, although his character is very much like J from Men in Black. He and Kevin Kline have great chemistry and make a very good team. The only low point of the movie is the villain: he isn't scary, or funny, or menacing at all. Arliss Loveless is a very boring and sometimes irritating villain. But i liked every single scene that involved James and Artemus getting in trouble and trying to get out of it. If you're in the right mood for a silly movie, and don't take it too seriously, then i think you'll like it.Don't read negative reviews about it: they'll give a wrong idea of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad screen play? Poor directing? Who gets the blame?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem to be impossible to make a boring movie when your stars are Will Smith and Kevin Kline. I mean, what the charismatic Smith doesn't have in maturity the talented Kline more than makes up for in experience and timing (see "A Fish Called Wanda"). But somehow, Wild Wild West is dull and leaves you wondering what went wrong.I suppose one reason the movie is bad is because it lacks atmosphere. You would think the title "Wild Wild West" would indicate a strong western (as in cowboys and desert) influence, but the only west here is either 1) supposed to be Jim West, who is about as shallow a character as they come, or b) the seemingly thrown-together cowboy outfits and occasional horses that are supposed to make us feel like this is a gosh darn real Western. Really, this movie is more about the North and South and the grudges left from the Civil war than about the East or West. Another downfall is poor pacing. I found myself looking at my watch to see how long the movie had been on the first time a point came up where I could see a possible conclusion close at hand. I did that 45 minutes into the 1 hour, 46 minute film. I did it three more times before the climax actually arrived. It seemed as if the movie was out of gas long before it was actually at the end.Finally, one sure fire sign of a bad movie is when characters get into promising situations early, then either engage in lame dialogue or lame responses to move the movie on to the next scene. In WWW, you only had to watch the first scene after the credits to get a sense of, "uh-oh" (the very first scene, of a man hunted by a flying metal disc, was actually intriguing). With rare exception, WWW offered lame conclusions to every situation. In fact, at one point there is supposed to be a huge explosion, but all we see is a little burst from the inside the building. We are supposed to imagine the rest. It feels like the movie's funding ran out and someone had to cut corners.Finally, Selma Hayak is awful. She is like a young Charro. There was no chemistry, and she adds little as the sort-of love interest.When it was all over, I could only muse at what might have been. This could have been a franchise for Will Smith. I wonder if he realized during the filming of the movie that the final product would be so poor, and, perhaps, cost him so much in the long run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see that a lot of people just absolutely HATED this movie. I thought that this was a very funny, slick, and entertaining movie. Will Smith gave another one of his smooth performances and Kevin Kline was great as Artemus Gordon. I agree that Salma Hayek had little to do except look hot, but that was no problem with me. The best performance was by the character Arliss Loveless, I loved the evil delight that Ken Branaugh brought to this role. The special effects were top notch, and the verbal sparring that Jim West engages in with Arliss(in particular the racial and legless jokes), were very funny. So I guess that I'm in the minority when I say give this one 9 stars out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>JUST ENOUGH FISTFIGHTS TO SAVE THE MOVIE.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bearing in mind the awful reviews this movie had and the fact that the leads are totally miscast, "WILD,WILD WEST" is not that bad after all.It does have some of the flavour of the classic 60's action series although Will Smith is no comparison to hard man Robert Conrad as Jim West;Conrad's anything goes,breathless fighting style would have allowed him to tie up Smith in seconds and Kevin Kline is hopeless as Artemus Gordon having none of the light and shade that the late Ross Martin gave to the character.Only Kenneth Branagh succeeds as Arless Loveless the villain in a performance so over the top that it cannot fail to make an impression and indeed it does.His racist comments directed at Smith throughout the movie seem somewhat misguided but Smith gives as good as he gets in his pithy comments about Loveless's legless state.Special effects are par for the course for a summer blockbuster with the giant spidermobile taking top honours. What saves the movie are the plentiful fistfights which were also the saving grace of the TV series and although they are indifferently choreographed these brawls will suffice for those who realise that any action movie that contains a strong fight quotient cannot by definition be a complete failure.By the way.check out the video packaging and try to convince yourself that the Jim West portrayed therein is really Will Smith and not Spike Lee.It must be down to the eyes and glasses!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, this flick was bad, but it could have been a lot worst...I found it was incredibly bold to have casted Will Smith in a role which could or could have not been better portrayed by a white man, but what it really needed was a better screenplay...I was upset at the scaling down of both Gordon's and West's past which was more detailed in the novelization...The biggest flaw of them all was a lot of the plot was more than just confusing--much of it just didn't make any sense (it wasn't suppose to be Shakespeare, but c'mon? what was up with the cyborgs towards the end?)...and although Kenneth Brannaugh was oft blasted for taking the role he took, Salma Hayek's sole memorable scene was baring her derriere for the camera for no apparent reason at all--not that I'm complaining, but does she really want to be remembered 30 years from now as the actress who bares her butt for no apparent reason?

		<fullReview>Well... I am so glad I didn't have to pay a cent to see this flick! (not being all that fond of Ye Will Smith of Independence Day Fame) It was a good excuse to watch this so- called 'block buster' (???) free of charge.The opening scene, though unnecessary, was quite something. Mister Smith in the water tank naked as the day he was born! Nude shots of him taking out the bad guys, without even his strides to hide all and sundry!!! Loved the naked butt-cheeks shots of him.But why did it end right there? This movie simply falls flat on its face, fortunately I was in a theater full of adults, not kids, because some of the stuff portrayed in this wasn't really for the kids. However, the movie was presented to us in a juvenile way that even kids would've fallen asleep to.Western? This wasn't really a western as most of the action scenes were gung ho rather than GUN ho. As for the technology? So un western!Comedy? Not likely! Just about none of this was amusing and I cant remember a single joke anyway, it was quite forgettable.Action? Kind-of, but then again, still fairly standard, nothing original. Certainly not exciting.Acting: What acting? There was none! Will is rather an eyeful physically, but his acting was absent in this bomb! Kevin Kline was dead boring and uninteresting. As for the gal who ends up on the train with them (in the dumbest way imaginable) she was just plain train terrible!Special Effects: Oh boy, there is a lot of that! As with dozens of flicks before this, quote "amazing F.X." un quote just does not save a movie with absolutely no plot and terrible acting. Giant mechanical Spider: Cool! Cool! Cool! 8/10 for coolness. Not as memorable as the House in the Haunting, but goes on my list of Most Memorable Props. CONCLUSION: Movies that rely on props in order to make box office sales do not work! Point of Interest: We should see more Naked Will Smith!!!</fullReview>

Generally I am not really a Will Smith fan (acting OR singing) but he seemed to do the trick with the strangely catchy song "Wild Wild West". I agree that some of the actors could have been better cast (Will Smith included), but I have to admit that I enjoyed this film. It's simply not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. I would definately watch it again. Maybe everyone out there should see the original 60's series "The Wild Wild West" with Rob Conrad and Ross Martin to fully appreciate the story. This was actually a film worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that you know who is watching the movie on an aeroplane. That's where I saw Wild Wild West. The people watching were those, like me, who were either laughing out loud or stubbornly refusing to do so.The plot of this movie is pretty thin, but is far less anarectic than Star Wars Ep 1. But it is full of humour. It is a movie that makes fun of itself, and of other iconic movies. I suspect the plot is intended to be totally fanciful as a means of completely escaping from the bounds of reality.Kenneth Branagh, whom I have seen in a great range of roles, overplayed his character with ruthless efficiency. It was an absolute tour-de-force. The energy delivered in playing the quite unbelievable Loveless actually made it believable. There were shades of Davros from Dr Who in this character.The other lead characters were equally strong.I felt that the movie slowed down in the last third, but it had a very pacy start to keep up with.All up, a most enjoyable movie of great richness. Those who don't enjoy this movie are locked in a world where the emperor is always expected to wear clothes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this has to be the closest I've been to walking out on a movie in some time.To begin with, the cinematography was bad - all close up low field of vision action with cuts that were too fast.Also, it seems as if someone decided to make this movie for really small children. Jim West, gun toting cowboy only used his guns once, and even that was in a comedic role which lasted about 2 seconds. Pathetic - this is a wild west movie!!!!I really should say something bad about the story, but there wasn't one worth mentioning. I can say however, that somebody edited out story sequences! Entire sequences would be ended with no explanation to the audience of WHAT ended it(Notably the "bad guy gets electrocuted" and "oops we pulled the wrong lever" scenes).What more can I say - this movie blows. Perhaps the amount of hype a movie gets is inversely proportional to how good it is just so the studio can get the early audiences in to recoup losses they *know* they're going to make. (An exception here is Star Wars: Episode I, but then I'm a star wars fan so it's biased)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are very few movies that (in my opinion) are not worth $1.75, which is what I paid to watch this bilge, but this movie certainly makes that cut. I spent a considerable portion of the movie speculating on what prompted a group of (presumably) reasonably intelligent people to make this movie. The sad part was watching Kevin Kline, an excellent actor, and Will Smith go though their lines like they were reading aloud from a book. They have zero chemistry together, and there is an attempt at a male bonding scene that is so out of place, as to be excruciatingly painful to watch. My suggestion: avoid it at all costs. If someone wants you to watch it with them, get them to pay for your ticket, and also for the portion of your life you'll certainly waste by watching this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loveless? Try lifeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you heard Wild Wild West is bad? Believe me, whatever you heard, it's actually worse! Wild Wild West is a lifeless lump of a movie bearing only a superficial relationship to the classic ?60's TV series. The blame can't be laid at the feet of the actors, as Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branaugh are certainly game enough (although Kline as President Grant is embarrassingly bad casting). The blame has to go to the half dozen hacks responsible for the screenplay and director Barry Sonnenfeld. The casting of Will Smith would not have been a problem if they had just ignored the race issue entirely and presented it as color-blind casting (the series frequently featured blacks in prominent roles that were probably not available to blacks in post Civil War America), but the script makes the mistake of trying to make it plausible that someone of Will Smith's color could be a close confidant and advisor of the President. And Sonnenfeld brings none of the warped perspective that worked so well in MIB and the Addams Family films to this material. At this point we must re-examine his career and decide if he is a talentless schmuck who's been lucky before this, or a gifted director who had a lobotomy right before filming began. Since Sonnenfeld made a big deal about how the bad buzz about the film before its release was wrong, I guess he still believes it's an Oscar contender no matter what anyone says. One of the worst things about the film is the score; it was actually a relief when Smith's ubiquitous rap version came up over the closing credits. Elmer Bernstein's bombastic music is from some far grander film, perhaps a sequel to Lawrence of Arabia. It had none of the flair of the anachronistic jazzy score from the series. The makers of the film seemed embarrassed by the source material and sought to distance themselves from it, leaving them without any concept to hang their hats on. Fortunately reruns of the original are still on TNT and can be watched by people who want to see something resembling entertainment. When people without talent make a bad film, at least it's occasionally amusing; when talented people make a mess like this, it's a waste of $180 million. How many Blair Witch Projects could be made with that kind of money?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, me and my friends went to see this movie with one reason; we want to see how bad is it. Well, as expected, it IS bad.It's a shame really considering that this film comes out from the team behind "Men In Black". Smith seems more average than usual, and frankly this is the only film that I wished he just shut up. Kline makes a decent sidekick but there's no chemistry between them as they are just a flat characters. Kenneth Brannagh seems like the only one who's having fun, although he make an unthreatening, if not rather ridiculous villain. Salma Hayek....mmmmm she's ok considering that little screentime she has but I believe she would be really good if she were given a funny role... Believe it or not, my friend seriously said that she would be a good Jar Jar Binks... The only cast that leaves any impression on me was Ling Bai's miss East, Loveless' concubine.The dialogues were horrible! And those attempted jokes... Oh, I'm sorry but we were laughing about how bad was it.It's not entirely bad, though. It has a very good FX and production design; the gadgets, the train, even that mechanical spider. But that's the problem. There's nothing majorly wrong with the visuals of this film, and that really is what the key problem here is - its all style, absolutely no substance. It looks like they've spent too much money on it that they didn't spent enough money for the script.Nevertheless, I wouldn't say this is the worst movie ever, as I don't mind to watch it again on video with friends (just to make fun and comments out of it....) But still, not a film that I would recommend...Well, to top off this, how many stars should I give for 'Wild Wild Mess'...er I mean 'Wild Wild West'? 4 out of 10 --- 3 stars for FX and production, 1 star considering the amount of money they've spent, 0 for everything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried hard to like this movie. I really did. But by the time the Wild Wild West was over, all I could do was look at the person next to me and ask, "What the hell was that?' The acting in the WWW was okay, but it could have been better. The story just fell apart during the beginning. They screenwriters should have spent more time on the script. The special effects were awesome, if somewhat borrowed. This was my first movie after seeing The Phantom Menace six times in a row. For some reason, after seeing TPM, the WWW made me feel like it was an unfinished movie.The acting was okay, but could have been better. Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, and Salma Hayek are great actors, but they seem befuddled by their roles. I felt sorry for them. Maybe they should have argued strongly with the director about the script.The story is a complete waste. There is nothing funny about anything in it. The race jokes made me extremely uncomfortable, because they were not timed properly and did nothing good to add to the story. In the past I have only seen race jokes infuriate people instead of bringing them together, so I never liked them anyway. Most of the other jokes in the movie die. There is one that I did laugh at, which had to do with Kevin Kline's fake breasts.I did not feel that the special effects were out of place for a movie set in the 19th century. The Wild Wild West was always a fantasy, and in fantasies, anything can happen at any point in history, so that part of the story is not the problem. However, the mechanical spider does look like how a MT-AT is described in the Star Wars: Jedi Academy trilogy (Novel, by Kevin J. Anderson).Although I do not like to blast bad movies with sarcasm and cruel one liners (the filmmakers already feel bad enough, give them a break...) I thought this film should have been reviewed worse than The Haunting, a film that I gave a positive review to because of it's creativity. I cannot recommend this film to anyone, but if you really want to see it, don't let me stop you. *1/2 stars (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hapless special effects extravaganza that may have more relevance and appeal to viewers aware of the original television series. Unfortunately the target audience missed it by 30 years. The female roles seem to have been injected at a late stage to spice up a caper movie that falls as flat as the mechanical spider that threatens the US Presidency - or something. The villain (a dwarf in the tv original) has no legs, which I suppose is a pc compromise, but how refreshing it would be to see a disabled person in a life affirming role.I saw this with my polite 13 year old, who didn't want to watch South Park with his Dad. He said it was "quite good" which clearly justifies my vote of 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Will Smith in other, and in my opinion, far better films, such as Enemy Of the State, Independence Day and Men In Black, I was expecting to go into the theatre and see another good movie. I was wrong, the acting is weak, the story is weaker. The only good thing going for the movie is the special effects, which are not even close to as good as those found in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The movie did contain some humorous lines, although even those were not well delivered. All in all, this movie falls short of other Will Smith titles. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild Wild West" was the dumbest movie I've seen this summer. What was the director thinking. Why would he have Kevin Kline play both Artemus Gordon and the President and then yet try to make the audience believe that they're not the same person and its just a "funny" mix up. They must think the audience is stupid. When a movie with many plot gaps and enough boob shots to choke Jim West's horse I feel "Wild Wild West" was a waste of the film it was shot on. I give it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more I think about this film, the more I hate it - which is pretty appropriate, it's a film made to deter thought. No plot, not plot twists (what was there to twist?!!), lame blue screen, several bizarre wastes (Salma Hayek, anyone? Not to mention, waste of my time), lack of continuity. This film is just lame - there seemed to be no connection between the explosions, mediocre acting, or the spider scenes. Come to think of it, the film described itself with "Shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more, and then ask a question or two when you're done." My description of this film: Dumb now, dumb later, dumb drunk, dumb sober, and then get a refund or two when you're done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us who actually remember the original series fondly, this was indeed shameful.Wil Smith is not the 19th Century spy/lover type and never will be. And to tell you the truth, he looked a bit chunky-maybe George Clooney or Denzel Washington could have pulled it off. Kevin Kline was a hopeful, but here I think the direction was at fault. Instead of being suave and silent, he came off as whining and ineffective. Definitely not Artemis Gordon, master of disguise.Even the Elmer Bernstein score had me wishing for the old one.

		<fullReview>While the use of computer graphics was fairly impressive in Wild Wild West, the movie failed horribly in plot development and scripting. Wild Wild West was just unable to meet the expectations set by The Matrix and Starwars. It was unoriginal, the action scenes were not at all impressive, and about 90% of the better scenes were shown in the previews. I think I would have enjoyed the movie more if it came out a couple years ago, or at least before The Matrix, which in my opinion puts almost all other sci/fi-action movies to shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides a few funny moments provided mostly by Kevin Kline, this movie was rotten. Taking ludicrous stunt moves and action from the nineties and plunking them down in a western setting was the first big mistake. Second was casting Will Smith. Sure, Smith may be a big "pop" sensation, but unfortunately that's all he brings to this movie: pop fluff. Smith's attitude and acting style DO NOT fit into a western movie. He's too "urban" sounding and acting. He talks like the fresh prince of bel air.All the stunts and fight scenes were so contrived and badly choreographed I found myself constantly shaking my head. Also, Salma Hayek was totally wasted. A woman as beautiful as disbelief. Give me The Magnificent Seven or Butch and Sundance any day. Only in a Hollywood movie do people NOT bleed when they are hammered in the face by shovels and huge monkey wrenches. Only in Hollywood can one man fight of 5 or 6 with ease.I still don't understand how we were supposed to believe that giant spider would actually work. Speaking of which, Kenneth Branagh made the most of a bad situation and seemed to have fun with his role.Wait for video. That's all I can say. There's no fx here worth seeing on the big screen, so save your 9 bucks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim West (Will Smith) is the fastest gun in the Wild West. The delectable ladies can never get enough of him and the fiendish villains will never find out what hit them. With his quick reflexes, impeccable wit, and righteous charisma, Jim West is always up to the challenge against any and all innumerable odds. Jim West is out to tame the West. Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) is a U.S. Marshal, an inventor, and a master of disguise. He too has plenty of charm and looks. Gordon has the ability to masquerade himself as an unsuspecting damsel-in-distress...In the villains' corner: Insane professor Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) is ruthless, heartless...and leg-less. This crippled villain has a lot of dirty tricks up his sleeve. Loveless is assisted by a renegade Confederate known as General "Bloodbath" McGrath (Ted Levine). McGrath himself has a grudge against Jim West...Why are all the prominent scientists and inventors being kidnapped? It's up to West and Gordon to track down these scientists and thwart a madman's scheme for power. The madman behind the kidnappings is none other than arch-nemesis Loveless. Loveless has, as his arsenal, lethal flying disks, several cannons, a fortified bastion, and an 80 foot mechanical tarantula! As evident by the destruction of a small town, Loveless has a blatant disregard for public property. Dr. Arliss Loveless is hoping to capture President Ulysses S. Grant (Robert Conrad, the ORIGINAL Jim West) and therefore gain the strength to rule this nation...Throw in a love interest, Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) and everything is all set. That is, except for one minor conflict. Both Jim West and Artemus Gordon frequently find themselves vying for Rita's affection...Nevertheless, our dashing heroes must fight for the freedom of humankind. As the sun rises, the adventures continue with our heroes keeping their heads up high. The action rushes by the minute...The Wild West will never be the same again! Jim West and Artemus Gordon must be prepared for lots of trouble!WILD WILD WEST is based on the hit TV series of the 1960s. The science-fiction and Western genres merge in this rather odd tale about heroes and the numerous challenges they must face. Star Will Smith teams up with director Barry Sonnenfeld (MEN IN BLACK) once again in this entertaining motion picture. To tell you the truth, I thought that WILD WILD WEST was a great, but not exactly spectacular motion picture. The $80 million plus special FX were flamboyant enough, and the humor was always rife in this movie. I found myself having a rather marvelous time watching this delightful action picture. From the intimate love scene in the beginning of this movie to the invigorating climax, WILD WILD WEST is fun in the West!WILD WILD WEST succeeds because it keeps the viewer on the edge-of-the-seat. Lots of exhilarating action scenes are worth mentioning. One cool scene involved Jim West inside a room, surrounded by some "susceptible" paintings. In an instant, gunmen appear from the paintings and a brief gun battle ensues. Needless to say, West blasts his way through these six to seven outlaws. West does not even break a sweat! The scenes where Will Smith rides underneath a train are superb as well. The climax is superlatively awesome.Yes it is true, Will Smith does all of his own stunts. Yes, you do get to see Will Smith cross dressing in this movie. (Believe it or not, it leaves a lot to the imagination!) Will Smith is "as slick as they is."Though WILD WILD WEST is a palatable flick, there are quite a number of flaws in this movie. First, the acting is something left to be desired for. I especially found myself startled by seeing respected thespian Kenneth Branagh portray a paralyzed psycho. It is unimaginable to see a Shakespearean actor act like a redneck. Kevin Kline would probably be the last actor I'd expect to see in a Western, but hey, his versatility did amaze me. On the other hand, I was dejected at the dearth of Salma Hayek's presence in this movie. This beautiful actress could have had a much stronger role in this movie. As for the proliferating breast jokes, sexist remarks, and redneck riffs, they do degenerate into utter idiocy. Finally, this film also relies more on coincidences rather than coherence. (i.e. Gordon's chance encounter with Rita Escobar, amongst other segments.)Speaking of Kline, he had some inspired moments. It's extremely funny how Kevin Kline tries to emulate some kung fu moves at times. I was also amused at watching Kline perform in drag!As much as I was impressed by this production, WILD WILD WEST is entertainment and nothing more. This motion picture does not have an iota of logic or realism. Watch this film solely for your own viewing pleasure. Do not anticipate anything scholarly in this movie. If you are looking for insight, look somewhere else buddy!Although WILD WILD WEST is not Will Smith's biggest accomplishment, it is a movie that he should be proud of. "The Wild Wild West" music video is also a must-see.Just keep in mind that, in the words of Ulysses S. Grant, James West "...shoots first, second, then some more, and then asks questions of all the dead people lying around."RATING: **1/2 out of ****. (Based purely on its entertainment value.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, at first I didn't know what to think. I had been anticipating this movie for months and couldn't wait to see it. Then, because I saw "Summer of Sam" on Friday and had to wait until Saturday to see "WWW", I got a chance to read and hear a multitude of reviews prior to going to the theater. Once again, people either REALLY loved it or REALLY hated it. It never fails to make me giggle when people overreact over movies. Even moreso when they HATE it, like people who react to movies in that fashion were really going to do anything substantial with the 2 hours they rant about having wasted.:)As a film, this movie is terrible. As a movie, especially a July 4th, Summer movie, it's just OK--and even that may be a little too generous. I saw the same previews and trailers as everyone else and I certainly didn't go into this movie expecting any kind of revelation. I went because Barry Sonnenfeld is sure to show me something different and I love both Will Smith and Kevin Kline. I went to eat some popcorn, put my feet up, and wallow in what's not good for me--a guilty pleasure, if you will. I don't know what time of year "Casablanca" was released, but I'd wager it wasn't the July 4th weekend. I'm curious to find out exactly what people were expecting from a Sonnenfeld/Smith/Kline movie with 80ft. mechanical spiders, set in the old West.If I have one, big disappointment about this movie, it is the fact that the dialogue is sooooooo lame. I don't understand how someone like Barry Sonnenfeld, the same man who directed "Get Shorty", would let those screenwriters put down their crayons before they had tightened up the ship a little (or a lot). Kevin Kline I can forgive (a little) because what actor wouldn't jump at the chance of a supporting role in a summer film with a guaranteed audience (regardless of reviews) that will be about 100X the number of people who saw "The Ice Storm"--an infinitely better film? But Barry? Tsk, tsk, tsk! Shame on you.This is a fun movie, don't get me wrong. I'm just saying that my enjoyment of this movie wouldn't have decreased significantly if the sound had been turned off. The visual effects are stunning, although in fewer numbers than the previews might make you believe. Salma Hayek is only there to show off her ample bosom, and she does a great job. I think she is supposed to be there as a romantic interest/conflict between Smith and Kline, but it's given little attention. Kenneth Branagh is wonderfully over-the-top as Dr. Arliss Loveless. One note about the character of Dr. Loveless: I've heard and read that many people are taking issue with the racial epithets and "cripple" jokes. If anyone out there happens to see a "break", could you give it to me. I mean, COME ON, Will Smith is a BLACK MAN!!!! He is playing a U.S. Marshal in the 1870's and the bad guys just lost the Civil War. Exactly how do these PC police believe Confederates would react to Jim West? As far as the "cripple" jokes go, West is simply giving as good as he gets.All in all, this movie is pure, eye-candy. There is very little substance here, but I think that may be the point. If you're looking for a little guilty fun, go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before all of you Will Smith fans get mad at me I will admit that Will Smith is a good actor but Wild Wild West was a terrible movie. It's the screenwriters fault for wasting Salma Hayek, Will Smith, Kevin Kline, and Kenneth Branagh. That is an incredibly talented cast, but it was wasted in a tangled mess of special effects and an aimless plot. Normally, I love popcorn movies like ID4, MiB, and Armageddon. But those movies were exciting and had somewhat of a plot and were funny. Not here, in WWW, most of the jokes fall flat and the plot is mainly a series of boring action sequences.Will Smith is the reason most people will go see this movie. The test screenings failed for a reason, and Barry Sonnenfeld cannot hide the fact that he has made a mediocre movie. The crowd laughed a total of three times in the movie, and the loudest ovation in the movie was the back of Salma Hayek's dress. This movie really is a disappointment, as the largely negative reviews point out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways, this movie received hype similar to what Star Wars did. The music videos, commercials and appearances on Oprah gave the impression that this was going to be a real blast to watch. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Will Smith couldn't pull this one off and what resulted was a rather boring movie. The special effects were interesting and made the movie somewhat bearable but the story line was less than adequate. At various points I almost decided to leave. In fact, the couple sitting beside me lasted approximately 30 minutes before they decided to go.Watching this movie, I couldn't help but feel a lack of chemistry between Smith and Kline. Although they work somewhat amicably together, they lacked the chemistry necessary to make the movie fun. Hayek's character was insignificant and made me think that her role in this movie was to be nothing more than eye candy.They story/plot line slowed down at points causing the audience to lose interest and the ending scene seemed hurried or incomplete. Some of the humor generated a chuckle out of me but nothing more. The audience was very quiet for a Will Smith movie and I think this had more to do with poor writing than Smith and Kline's inability to pull of the lines. Overall, I found this to be a big disappointment compared to Independance Day and MIB.</fullReview>

The special effects were great (especially the spider), and the gadget train was really cool. Few problems I had was that Salma Hayek was wasted big time (other than a nice look at her behind), and some of the jokes fell flat. Other jokes worked well ( like the one with Will wobbling his knife in his shoe at that one guy). But in the end, it's a forgettable movie.

		<fullReview>The main word I use in my description of this film is "fun". Maybe that is an overused word, but that's what this movie is. There is a certain joyfulness to the proceedings that is truly infectious. Will Smith takes this role and makes it serious when it needs to be, charming when needs be, and witty almost all the time. Kenneth Branaugh is a delightful bit of work in this film, and the most extertaining villain in years. On the down side, a few of the jokes don't quite work and the ending does lose a bit of steam. But the scenery and sets are gorgeous and Kenneth has a high time chewing them. Kevin Kline does a good job and Salma Hayek is given little more to do than look pretty (something she is a master at) but the main star of this show are Will Smith's charismatic performance, the sets, and the amazing special effects. This movie had me laughing in a way Austin Powers 2 only wished it could have. This is a wonderful movie. Put your brain on hold (thoughts like "A giant tarantula could not have been made in that time" have no place in this film) instead just enjoy the most rollicking ride of the summer.</fullReview>

Think of is as Men in Black set in the 19th century. The acting is similar to that movie as is the humor. Lots of humor and some very entertaining situations and great one liners.My biggest complaint was that the movie was too short (2 hours including previews and other assorted stuff at the beginning).If you are looking for the Wild Wild West, look in your TV guide.

		<fullReview>Honestly, what most people didn't like about this film is that they cast Will Smith in a part previously carried by a white guy, a popular actor, and the lead of another popular television show, Ba Ba Black Sheep. It insensed many people, and others felt outright insulted. If they had named this ANYthing else, it would have been MUCH more successful. But alas! No one listens to me. LOL It made its money back, barely, but has a horrible rating here at IMDb. I personally think it deserves better than the 4.whatever rating it holds today, but there is further cause for this phenomenon. The South was depicted as insanely ignorant, and the north was given victory only by virtue of Southern capability gone awry. Neither the North NOR the South liked THAT one, I can guarantee it.Me? I don't take sides. The Civil War stops here, with my family line. I had kin who fought on both sides, so I don't share the same prejudices, even though I'm from the South.

Add a few funny contraptions you could see in the hands of "Doc" (Back to the Future) and the ridiculous "bad guy", so ridiculous and funny you feel kids will just love this film.Nonetheless, the plot is fairly annoying, special effects are completely out of context.

		<shortDescription>Absolutely hilarious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest movies ever made. I love the exchanges between Smith and Kline. I know a lot of people don't like it, but I can't understand why. The acting was good, the jokes were funny, and the visual/special effects were incredible. If you're looking for some deep, thought-provoking movie, don't watch Wild Wild West. If you're looking for a good way to pass some time and get some laughs, this movie provides that service.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could have substituted Bond for West, put him in Monument Valley, and had "007 Goes to Arizona". This was a good comedy with plenty of corny gags, scads of witty repartee, and tons of super duper gadgets wielded by both sides. I despise this type of film when played straight, but this movie was never offered as anything but silly entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, this movie has been maligned a lot. I don't think it's so bad. But I do think it could have been better. I could think of other actors to play James West instead of Will Smith. But Kevin Kline is a very good actor, and he does manage in his dual role as Artemus Gordon and President U.S. Grant. The visuals are quite outstanding. I'd say it's still worth watching, if only once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess it would make sense to trash it. It seems so ridiculous. All these ridiculous inventions. A black U.S. Marshall in the 1800's.But then if you weren't prepared for ridiculous, should you REALLY be in a movie theatre?The whole concept of films works on one single premise. A suspension of disbelief. Keeping that in mind, Wild, Wild West was pretty kewl. I particularly enjoyed not having to watch Kenneth Branagh retelling Shakespeare AGAIN. He actually appeared to enjoy his work. As for Will Smith, he is capable of acting, this movie just didn't seem to call on that skill too much.Of course Kevin Kline was perfect as Artemus Gordon/President Grant. Just the right touch of snobbishness and admiration.Which is why I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, I liked this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of 60s Western/Spy TV series features inspired casting of Will Smith in lead role of James West, with an understated Kevin Kline as side-kick and master of disguise Artemus Gordon. Duo match wits, to the extent wits are at all involved, with wacko Loveless and renegade Confederate General McGrath. Film is hampered by too much reliance on special effects and a cartoon plot - it plays more like a series of videos. Interestingly, the actual WWW music video (which is excellent) has no connection whatsoever with the plot of this movie. All that being said, I didn't take anything very seriously, and I really enjoyed the movie. Perhaps if I had seen it on release, with high expectations, I would have been disappointed along with most everybody else. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised, particularly with Smith's spirited performance in lead role. Some good fun; a recommended rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I *know*. I've heard all the criticisms. But if you look at the film in the right frame of mind, it's an absolute masterpiece. It's a spoof of *everything*. The opening credits - 70's cops shows (complete with radically-colourised box-out close-ups of guns twirling, wah-wah guitars and cheesy organs, the lot...)Then there's the very premise of the movie. It's *so* ridiculous that it makes perfect sense. You wonder why no-one's tried it before...Ok, so some of the effects shots look artificial. I got the impression that that was half the point - that they were designed to look like they were just thrown together, as a backlash to the meticulous realism of the effects in certain other big-budget productions opening in the last few months or so. (Not _episode_ naming _1_ any _the_ names, _phantom_ of _menace_ course...)The dialogue *sparkled*. Kenneth Branagh really seemed to be relishing his opportunity to ham it up as the evil Dr Loveless - a bit of a departure from the Shakespearean style he's renowned for. And it worked beautifully. His interchanges with Will Smith are among the cleverest and funniest in the film.There are so many film, cult TV and miscellaneous popular culture references it's not even worth trying to spot them all. (Yes, Dr Loveless is a take-off of Dr Strangelove...) Some of the funniest gags are the ones set up miles in advance. Bloodbath McGrath has a gramophone horn for an earpiece and a small dog - ring any bells? And as for 'Air Gordon'...The score works beautifully to reinforce such references. Just as the opening credits were styled like a 70's cop show, with music to match, so jokes in the movie are backed up by the subtlest of musical hints.Most of all, the movie is *fun*. If you switch your brain off and leave it at the door, you'll have fun. If you leave it *on*, you'll have even more fun. But you have to *want* to have fun. Too many people seem to go into movies wanting to dislike them, trying to pick holes in every corny line and dodgy effect. That's not the point of watching a movie like Wild Wild West.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Will Smith it was a duty for me to watch this movie - and it is one of the funniest I've ever seen. Sonnenfeld's humor seemed a bit strange to me in "MiB", but this time it really made me laughing many times. The story can be regarded as the typical "James Bond 007"-plot; also the gimmicks, the "hot babes" and evil mind Dr. Loveless make this film some kinda 007-movie. Nevertheless it offers a really "sick" kind of humor. Although I did not like Kevin Kline very much, he's awesome in this film. Summing up, I'd like to say that this movie is one of the best and funniest popcorn-action-comedy I've ever seen with a very good cast, perfect effects and witty and humorous dialogues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fine Western with the quirkiness that we all loved from the series. The casting is surprisingly appropiate and the writers are respectful enough of the audience's intelligence as to not just pretend that race is not an issue in an Old West setting. My only real beef is that they chose to cast Branagh as West's nemesis... but the fact that they changed his name to Arliss makes me wonder wether we might not see a sequel where his little brother Miguelito comes back for vengeance.... I'd go see it in a heartbeat.No it's not the original series, but short of tossing Robert Conrad, et al in a time machine and regressing them to their 20's there's no way to duplicate the original series. The movie is a good ride in it's own right with all the action and gadgetry you could ask for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True to the spirit of the original TV show, the movie was not just a "turn the crank" remake. Will Smith's Jim West is distinct from the original (and no, not just because of the color of his skin), but still a blast. I predict that some will argue that it's the exact same character we saw in MIB, Independence Day, and Fresh Prince, and I'd have to agree. But, call me small minded, I *like* that character, especially in an over the top fantasy like this.My only regret is that the all the fantastic special effects were shown in the commercials. As with the Phantom Menace trailer, by the time I saw the movie I already had seen all the eye candy. Wild Wild West's comedy carried the show anyways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WILD WILD FUN!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave it to Barry Sonnenfeld the director of GET SHORTY and MEN IN BLACK to do a faithful and exciting new version of the classic 1960's t.v. series. This is one hell of a exciting and fun movie! I haven't felt like a child when watching a fun movie since JURASSIC PARK. This is one summer movie that promises the goods, and delivers! Will Smith plays Jim West, a U.S. Army officer who along with a U.S. Marshall, Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline), are ordered by President Grant to search and find the top U.S. scientists who were kidnapped. Along the adventure they meet a beautiful and mysterous woman named Rita Escobay (Salma Hayek) who is also looking for one of the missing scientists. Then they realize that kidnapper is a powerful, evil, and legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), who has an extremely devious plan. First of all, this is no CITIZEN KANE, SCHINDLER'S LIST, or 2001, it's not a thinking movie. This is a summer film, it's supposed to be fun and exciting, and fun and exciting it is! The action scenes are very exciting and original. The effects are very top-notch (close to STAR WARS standards). The gadgets from Artemus Gordon are very cool. And the acting is very much well done. I'm sure that die hard fans of the t.v. series aren't going to accept Will Smith playing Jim West, but Smith does a good job! He is funny, witty, and very charming, he plays a very good action hero. And Salma Hayek is very very sexy as Rita Escobar, I've seen almost all of her movies, and I have never seen Hayek as beautiful as she was in this film. But the two stand-outs in acting are the two Shakespeareian actors, Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh. Kevin Kline is perfect (as usual) as the highly intelligent and witty Artemus Gordon. He fits the role perfect since Gordon is the smart one of the two heroes. And Kenneth Branagh is the most fun and best villain that I have seen in years. He was both cruel and very funny at the same time, you like him, yet you want to hate him at the same time. It's fun watching both West and Loveless take cracks about one another. This is the perfect film of the Sonnenfeld trilogy (the other two being GET SHORTY and MEN IN BLACK). It's along the lines of the previous two films that he's done, (more like MEN IN BLACK though). But Sonnenfeld learned a lot from Danny DeVito and the Cohen Brothers when he was their cinematographer, how to make a fun and exciting film. And he does succeed to the highest with this film. Out of the summer movies, this is the topper (maybe only EYES WIDE SHUT can be better), you get what you are promised. After you see the underrated STAR WARS, or if you haven't seen STAR WARS yet, GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!! A highly entertaining movie, and one of the years best!***** (out of *****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If not worse... 'Wild Wild West' is an absolute train wreck of a movie. It existed only to make money and sequels and luckily America's movie going public wasn't stupid enough to warrant a Wild Wild West 2 but they are stupid enough to indulge Will Smith's massive ego which I think is the greatest problem with this picture. I can tolerate giant metal spiders but I can't tolerate a performance like the one we get from Will Smith in this film. To put it bluntly I think this performance is bad enough that it should have completed killed his career...The fake breasted women and giant spiders are stupid to be sure but I don't think these are the major problems with the film. I could totally get behind a movie that tries to do James Bond stuff in the wild west. I think the western lends it's self well to genre bending. I am a huge fan of the short lived Bruce Campbell show 'Brisco County Jr' and they did stuff much sillier than what is done in 'Wild Wild West'. I think the problem I had with the spider and the women are that they are played for gags. The entirety of the scene with Kline's fake breasts is based on tiredly setting up gags. Gags aren't funny. They showcase lazy writing and are placed in abundance when a comedy can't generate humor off the plot and characters development. These characters are so boring and clich that gags have to be used. The fact that the climax and main threat of the film is giant eye sore of a gag kind of ruins what ever chance this movie had of having any kind of credibility. The gag isn't even that good in terms of gags. Will Smith merely says "he's got an eighty foot tarantula" and Kline goes "I was just getting to that". Really? Can't come up with a spider related gag? Have to just narrate the scene and hope it amuses people? And yet this isn't why I hate this movie. I could tolerate gags to the point of merely seeing a mediocre film but the problem with 'Wild Wild West' is who is delivering these gags, Will Smith. Smith's performance in this thing is probably close to being one of the worst I've seen on film. Why? Because it's reeks of foolish arrogance. Smith thinks he's a million bucks on the screen and it shows. It's a surprisingly pretentious performance coming into an extremely stupid movie. Smith plays this West character like the classical action heroes did during this time. He tries to move slickly and stylishly and sound like he knows everything about everything. The problem with this is that when the movie is as stupid as 'Wild Wild West' Smith becomes condescending to the audience. It's not that he takes this material seriously that bothers me but that he shoves this material in our face. And this is only the action hero piece of the story, the comedy side is far worse. When Smith is forced to set up a joke he acts like this West figure is too cool to degrade himself to stupid stuff. The audience degrades themselves and so should Smith. Of course it leads up to him wearing a dress and the moment is uncomfortable in the sense that Smith plays this West to the point where we think the way he builds this up showcases a sexual repression worthy of the darkest nightmares of Freud. And they of course have to include racial humor because we are dealing with the Civil War era. All this racial humor consists of is Smith saying how stupid the rednecks around him are and making fun of them for being backwards southerners. This approach of having backwards hicks only works so far until we meet Dr. Arliss Loveless. There comes a moment when West is actually about to be lynched for bonging a women's breasts and the speech West gives is just about the most unfunny awkward line delivered in any comedy I've ever seen.I guess it goes to show you that even throwing cheap emotional triggers like racism in a film don't work unless the characters are the least bit compelling. It shows a sense of desperation that since the film can't make us care about West they have to remind us of such a dark era in our nation's past. I'm surprised more people weren't gravely offended by the racial stuff in this film because the thought of using such heavy material in such sap for the sake of doing so is offensive to me. The scene were I just about felt like muting everything Smith said was when he tells the story of his family and his flight from slavery. West tries to show how rugged and tough he is by eating a charred lizard because he was taught by Indians. I don't care and I find it offensive and perpetuating even more stereotypes as it tries to have a heavy tender moment. God bless Kenneth Branagh! He's the only thing that comes close to being watchable in this film but even he gives the worst performance of his career here. Arliss is an entertaining villain and I gravitated towards him simply because he sought out to do what I wanted to do, kill Jim West. Branagh seems to be having quite the fun time in this role and some scenes involving Loveless are entertaining particularly his introduction and his speech to the foreign delegates aboard his spider. If you find yourself having to see this film use your DVD remote to make it a one man show starring Branagh. I wanted this villain to win despite the fact that they show him as a poorly written racist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a whole new westBarry Sonnenfeld the director of Men In Black and Get Shorty re-teams with Will Smith in this wild west film with a twist. Will Smith (Men in Black, Hith) plays the hero Capt. James 'Jim' West but is outdone by Kevin Kline (Orange County) whom plays U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon. Salma Hayek (Dogma) is gorgeous as always, and plays her part perfectly.Summary written by Julian Reischl {julianreischl@mac.com}: One day in the wild, wild west, a famous scientist is found dead. Or better: Decapitated by a devilish device, as it seems. Special Agent Artemus Gordon, quite inventive himself, finds out about the man's last sight and is forced to team up with James West, a man who relies on nothing but his gun. They first suspect General "Bloodbath" McGrath to be responsible for the killing, but as he's not bright enough to invent the flying decapitation device himself, a more evil mastermind behind the scenery is soon proved to exist. Dr. Arliss Loveless, who, by the way, has kidnapped the nation's best scientists, seems to plan on taking a major part of the country as his personal property. But Dr. Loveless did not spend enough thoughts about possible intervention from two men, who may get a little distracted by the sudden appearance of beautiful Rita Escobar, daughter to one of the abducted scientists.And thats, that. 6/10.</fullReview>

Will Smith and Kevin Kline work together perfectly because they are the opposite of each other. This was movie was made to make you laugh not cry so don't go watching it expecting a powerful drama. Will Smith just made me laugh the whole time. In my view Will Smith and Barry Sonnenfeld should work together more often.The humor in this movie was not outrageous at all and not at all that racial. When you watch this movie you will see Will Smith funny in one scene and then a bad boy in the next. So he's not just a comedian. The same for Kevin Kline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie so many times to think that I would get tired of it and so far I haven't. The more I watch it the more I keep thinking why it had a bad wrap. I can't think of anything but Will Smith playing Jim West. Which was a white character in the original TV show(Not being racist or anything but they should at least be true to the TV show. Something that been a problem lately with TV show movies. But other then its extremeily untrue to the show I liked it because it was enjoyable to watch. I mean I do like the type of movies that are just made to have fun(Lake PLacid, Deep Blue Sea, Big Daddy, The Waterboy, etc) And this movie was one of them. I will admit that this movie did have some problems. The first thing was the racial marks that were made a bunch of times. That was getting old, even though the scene with Smith and that Loveless guy making fun of themselves was pretty funny. The other problem was some of the one liners in the movie. Like: "That's it, no more mister knife guy" and "I learned that from a China man." Those lines should've been off the script but they took the chance to keep them. Another thing that I didn't like about the movie was having Salma Haleck being in the film where she had no purpose in the film but to show her cute little butt in the movie. But if u ignore these flaws, you got a very enjoyable movie. Will Smith and Kevin Kline work very well as with Kenneth Branngh as the evil Dr. Arliss Loveless, which I like to add is in my list of best villains. Number one is Jeremy Irons from Die Hard With a Vengence. Kevin Kline also does a good job playing President Grant, originally offered to Robert Conrad but put it down since he too didn't like what they were doing to the movie.Some of the fight scenes weren't bad either and that 80 foot spider scene was awesome. Barry Sonnenfeld, the director of Men in Black and Addams Family, does a good job making this movie into some kind of super hero movie. He also did a good job making the comedy scenes real funny. I mean that touch my breast scene was just too much. I've read some magazines where they said this movie was the worst of 1999. I tell u what I've seen alot worst then this. Example: Blair Witch, Life(totally unfunny) The Mod Squad, Galaxy Quest etc.I give this movie a 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes I will defy all trends and say that Wild Wild West was underrated.Firstly let me say I saw this film in Australia several weeks before it was released thanks to the wonders of pirates, the copy I saw was excellent, plus I payed nothing for it, so this movie costed me zilch. And it means I wouldn't have been crying if it sucked and I wasted $10(AU) on it.When my friend brought it over, I quickly kicked him out, raced to my room and shoved it into my 6head sony hi-fi video recorder, cranked up my sony digital amp and set it on pro-logic. I pressed the play button with low hopes after the reviews I heard, and what I got was.......WILD WILD WEST, Uhhh, Wild Wild west...blah blah blah. Was a pretty cool movie. When it started I was treated to a cool cool scene of some poor 19th scum been chases by something then loosing his head....then boom a credits sequence which looked pretty cool and suited the movie. I thought yeah its looking good from here. And yes it did, and yes it got better.Actually I loved this film, why? because it was ridiculous, because it was completely zany and stupid it was fun, it wasn't a flic to take seriously. Examples are 19th century contraptions that can't even be built today!. Like giant mechanical spiders. Still that was done pretty, the spider wasn't really fancy, used steam, suited the day. But i'm going off the subject.I personally believe people attacked this film for a couple of reasons, 1. They tried to take it toooooo seriously. You can't, you just can't, this isn't 8mm. This is just a fun movie. 2. It was released at a bad time, that was not long after the columbine high school shootings, and this film had alot of gun related scenes in it.Anyway i'll just finish here, I give this film a 8.5/10 And in comparison its 800000 times better than the Exorcist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A witty, clever, anachronistic romp through the post-Civil War West, Wild Wild West showcases many exceptional talents. Many people complain that the movie is a "lame, bloated blockbuster", but I have to disagree. I've never seen the original TV series, and maybe I'd have a more informed opinion if I had, but I immensely liked what I saw. I had never known Kenneth Brannagh was English until I saw him in the second Harry Potter, but I thought he did a wonderful job as Dr. Loveless. Will Smith was both funny and dedicated as Capt. West. I've only ever seen Kevin Kline in this movie, but I thought he did a fine job, too. Salma Hayek is, as ever, a perfectly good reason to watch this movie. If you like nothing else about Wild Wild West, you'll like her. I know President Grant was never that good of a leader, but when your movie has a giant, mechanical spider, historical accuracy doesn't really come into play. I liked everything about it; I don't what else to say. The cinematography, the story, the gadgets, the comedy, it's all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reverse Science Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction is a strange balance. You need to project into the future, but the only tools you have are what you know. So we have crazy stupidities like the future of Star Wars. The idea behind Wild, Wild West, the TV show was to make a science fiction world as it would have been envisioned a century ago. Jules Verne with all the limitations made explicit for fun. It was placed in a `Maverick' context as a further conceit. This reverse `Flintstones' was one of the cleverest conceptions in TV history. It succeeded because it didn't have to do much, with the competition as poor and tired as it was.Now come some of the thicker minds in Hollywood, who clearly don't understand the core appeal. They twist this into some Luddite manifesto by giving all the fancy inventions to the bad guy. The inventions are at core modern. Think about the notion of sexpedal locomotion and rayguns. Modern. Sorta cuts the guts out of the idea.And spend all your credit with the audience on some `explanations' about racism, self-mutilation and misogynism. Even two of the best actors in the world can't save it. And no, Will Smith is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic, heavy-handed mishmash suffers from lack of script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Men in Black, Will Smith teamed up with director Barry Sonnenfeld to produce a movie that was high on special effects and perhaps a little low on plot. That film's saving grace was the appealing performances of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, as well as the clever script, which gave the actors plenty of throwaway lines. With that kind of pedigree, the expectations of the 90's version of the 60's show The Wild, Wild West were fairly high, and the movie was endlessly hyped as yet another 'movie event.'But the result is kind of like Men in Black on a bad day. Smith's character, intended to have the same kind of devil-may-care attitude that Mel Gibson's had in the Lethal Weapon movies, comes off as not only thoroughly obnoxious but also incredibly stupid. We've all seen films in which the protagonist is foolhardy and illogical in his never-ending quest for justice. Smith's Jim West comes off as selfish instead of philanthropic, thick-headed instead of cunning, smug instead of suave. He's not a daring secret agent - he's nothing more than a stereotypical arrogant cop.Smith gives the worst performance in the film, but he's not alone. While Kevin Kline (as Artemus Gordon)and Salma Hayek come off okay, Kenneth Branaugh (yes, the Shakesperian!!) is all wrong as the evil Dr. Loveless. He's way, way, way over the top. For someone who once played Hamlet, this is a major comedown. Can anyone say "Orson Welles"? I knew you could! Remember when, years after Welles did Macbeth and was a regular in Shakespeare's plays on Broadway, he was found in horrible dreck like Transformers and Slapstick of Another Kind. Is this once-great actor wandering down this path? He may not have Welles' corpulence, but he sure has the hamminess!All in all, this is a waste of energy. Special effects are fine, but in this day and age, they're really not all that special, are they?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film! I loved every minute of it! Will Smith was fantastic as James West and Kevin Kline in his double role as Artemus Gordon and President Grant showed, again, his versatile acting skills. Selma Hayek and Kenneth Branagh were excellent, as was M. Emmet Walsh with his portrayal of Coleman. The stunts were great, and the special effects were terrific. I especially enjoyed the dialogues between West and Dr. Loveless at the party. The mix of comedy, great special effects and gadgets (the magnetized neckpieces) and the "always-at-odds-with-each-other" byplay between West and Gordon just makes for plain fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild, Wild and Way Wrong West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the '60s TV series about a couple of intrepid secret agents in the 19th century who work directly for the President (Grant, in this case). Now, the thing is - and I'll say this up front - to me, agent Jim West IS Robert Conrad ...and always will be. I mean, Conrad is THE MAN, all right? Now, modern filmmakers, being the doofy flakes that they are, probably thought: is there any reason why James West cannot be ...Will Smith? Well, I could have told them why: because for all these years he's been Conrad! And Conrad certainly brought a unique sensibility to the role: the way he carried himself makes it difficult to imagine ANYONE else as West, let alone an actor specializing in easygoing comedy. Will Smith's comic timing worked well in "Independence Day" and great in "Men in Black", but is totally inappropriate for this part. They might as well have given him a different name, maybe as a replacement for the real Jim West. Of course, modern filmmakers, being the doofuses that they are, also thought, is there any reason we cannot include a giant spider in this movie, but the other Smith (Kevin) has already explained enough on that subject. Will Smith's chemistry with partner Gordon (Kline) is OK, but seems strained at points. English actor Branagh plays villain Loveless with a thick Southern accent to the point of self-mockery. Hayek is there as eye-candy, but I'm struck by how short she is, almost little-person size. The FX are good, as should be for such a huge budget (last I heard, about $180 million!). And there's nothing really that bad about the plot. But there's no sense of real danger - and therefore, no real tension. Here's where Smith's limitations show: all the kidding around make for a pointless story. I guess it's supposed to be plain fun. Hey, just for fun, let's get the real Jim West to beat up the Director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to all the bad reviews I had read on the Internet, I had to check this movie out for myself. Well, I have a sense of humor and I found this movie to be OK. Indeed, I agree with those Internet critics who gave this movie a favorable review.Some Internet critics complained about the technological sophistication; but according to more in depth reviews of history I found the tech' portrayals in the movie to be thoroughly accurate. For example, our mechanical knowledge as a society has not dramatically improved since then, and the flying bicycle! Well, the plane "as we know it took form shortly there after. As well, there were no complaints about the gadgetry of the original 'Wild, Wild West'On the other hand, I do believe some people may have gotten offended by some of the blunt language that people in America used publicly at that time, as well the portrayal of prostitution.I do think Will Smith gave a more comedic and mature performance in this movie than in 'Men in Black' and 'Enemy of the State.'</fullReview>

So its not believable, big whoopin deal. Neither is somebody lifting a spaceship with his mind but that doesn't make star wars any less enjoyable. I thought the humor was excellent and the back and forth between smith and kline very good. Its definitely a movie I watch whenever it is on and I recommend it. Its not intended to be "real" so watch it for what it is a laugh fest with some adventure and hijinx along the way. I should note I've never seen the TV series so I can't compare the two for those who are looking for a blast from the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Smith Goes South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1869 Louisiana, an old man is decapitated. After the credits, we are introduced to rapper Will Smith (as James "Jim" T. West). Interrupted during a nude bath, Mr. Smith goes to Washington and meets the President of the United States. Smith dresses his body in black western gear, beginning with a hat on his privates. Next introduced is future partner and master-of-disguise Kevin Kline (as Artemus Gordon). Interrupted during a sex sting, Mr. Kline is posing as a prostitute with very realistic cleavage. They are hired to prevent demented Kenneth Branagh (as Doctor Loveless) from assassinating President Ulysses S. Grant...The original 1960s TV series had a great theme song, as did many successful old shows. You had to tune in to hear "The Wild Wild West" theme, at least. At the heart of the stories was the friendship between the original West (Robert Conrad) and Gordon (Ross Martin). If you were lucky, the wicked "Dr. Loveless" (Michael Dunn) would make an appearance. There is little in this re-make that duplicates the original series. The leading character is completely changed. The rapport between the co-stars is non-existent. You do get race jokes, cleavage (highlighted by Salma Hayek) and special effects (highlighted by a giant spider).** Wild Wild West (6/30/99) Barry Sonnenfeld ~ Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Awful, But Definitely Not Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild Wild West" is not a good movie. That should be understood from the get go. When it came out there was A LOT of hype for it and with the plot that this movie had there was no way that it could deliver.This is a good movie for between the ages of 12 and 15. I don't believe anyone over 15 would find the humor to be funny nor would they really be interested in the lame plot, where an early teen might not be so critical. The special effects and mechanical devices are also more geared towards a 12 to 15 year old as opposed to someone over that age mark. Saying the acting is nothing special might be a bit too generous. It all just was a bit too wacky for it to be taken seriously. It seemed like Will Smith and others were probably having a blast with this movie and not taking it like a serious project at all, and it definitely shows. There is nothing truly to hate about this film, but it is definitely sub par. If you're an early teen it might be worth a watch, but anyone older than that should definitely seek something else out instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nowhere Close To The TV Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's to say about this abysmal excuse for a movie? Ross Martin must be rolling in his grave and I'm sure Robert Conrad is shaking his head in disbelief after this classic television series of the 1960's was transformed into an awful mess thanks to the money-swindling hoodlums that Hollywood employs. What appears to be a Western shoot-out, becomes nothing more than a lame-brained science-fiction bore that garners huge praise along with other classic television shows turned motion pictures like "The Mod Squad" and "The Avengers". Never one was I ever settled in my seat when I watched it that it left me with an empty feeling inside of me. I was hoping this movie would pay tribute not only to the series but to the Western genre as well. In the end, it failed on both levels. It was much less than I bargained for and the story wasn't very deep. I don't often mind the over-the-top silliness that many films of this kind movie often provide, but in "Wild Wild West", the light-heart humor was absent even when it was trying to be funny. The wacky gadgets that Jim West (Will Smith) and Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) have in their possession seem more awkward than funny. What was the letdown of the movie is primarily the law of physics. If they would've further concentrated on the timing with the adventure, I would have rated this movie a little higher. There was just so much nonsense with this movie I feel even a five was a bit too much.The strong qualities in the movie are the special effects (some things were cool, others were banal)and as always Salma Hayak looks great and as always gives it her all performance-wise. But the weak point is that there's nothing remotely funny about this movie. It tries to manipulate you into thinking it's funny,but it fails to reach its goal. It did not even reach the pinnacle as nagging amusement. It was just plain annoying and a total waste. You can find better things to do with your life than to watch this turkey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, as an old guy I hate new stuff. Adam West is Batman, KFC is Kentucky Fried Chicken, and no one will ever convince me that Will Smith is James West.That being said, as long as you don't try and tie the series and this movie together, it works. If it wasn't for Kevin Klein, this movie would fall flat. But Smith's West blends well into Klein's Gordon and the duo works. It's a fun, easy going James Bond/48 Hrs/Lethal Weapon flick.A few disappointments however, including Arliss Loveless. The late Michael Dunn was a genius as Miguelito Loveless. Had any other actor portrayed that character, it wouldn't have worked. This is what happened with Arliss. There was enough Miguelito to try and make the characters similar, but without Michael Dunn (heaven doesn't give shore leave) it just won't fly. A completely new villain would have been a much better choice.As much as I enjoyed this movie, however...I am happy to see they never made a sequel. This was a one hit wonder. If they ever chose to resurrect the franchise, they should get back to WWW roots. The darker, more action-laden flavor of the first season of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know much about the original TV series, so I don't have any references to compare this movie to. I just saw it as it is: Comedy/Action with bit of odd ball sci-fi mixed in, and it wasn't so bad. Was there crudity in this movie that I didn't detect ? I don't know, but things were pretty light hearted as I saw it and I kind of liked it. I did like the cinematography of this film. The color was nice, and CGI integration I thought was superb. The odd ball couple of Will Smith with Kevin Kline's chemistry worked, and Selma Hayek added feminine touch which wouldn't have existed if it were up to just Smith and Kline. If people didn't like this movie it's probably because it made jokes about everything without any regards to the original plot. I'm offended too when I see a movie that just took cursory ideas from say a good comic book series, and absolutely ruined its concept and artistry. But I have no frame of reference for this movie because I never got acquainted with the original series. Maybe they shouldn't have called it Wild Wild West, and called it an original movie.7/10</fullReview>

He was just so.....grossly self-absorbed in an evil genius sort of way. Loved all the 'technology' and the jokes. If you ignore the fact that this could never happen and that some people thought it to be a 'flop' then it turns out to be a really great adventure, a fun getaway from the monotony of the everyday. plus i really thought they chose good people for the cast, Kevin Kline, Will Smith, Kenneth Branagh, and selma Hayek all did great.

		<shortDescription>If only it weren't a remake ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real problem with Wild Wild West is that it is a remake of a successful TV series that looked absolutely _nothing_ like this film. The characters from the TV series really don't even come close to being anything like the characters in this film.The truth is that the actual film, while sometimes clunky and silly, is somewhat of a guilty pleasure. The dialogue, sometimes is sharp witted and hilarious. The storyline, while outrageous, actually has a beginning, middle, and an end. And the ending, is not dragged out an extra half hour longer than necessary.I feel funny standing up for this film, it's not that good. But then again, it's not that bad. It won't kill you to watch it. And there is one really good reason to watch it, Kenneth Branagh.I'm definitely a fan of the actor besides this film and I find it ridiculous that he never got higher crediting in ads than Salma Hayek (although he might be thankful). All of that aside, his portrayal of Loveless is hilarious and well balanced. Branagh knows the character is ridiculous, he may even be aware the whole film is an exercise of spending and wasting money. He therefore feels free to play Loveless as cheesy as they come and still he lends credibility to the role. If only someone had told Smith and Kline not to take their roles so seriously ...Speaking of Smith, the film seems desperate to explain away West's skin color. I mean in these times, a black hero, uh-uh. Since the film felt it impossible to just ignore it, they constantly refer to it. This works on some level, it gives Smith's West reason for anger and revenge. It also results in probably the best banter of the film while West and Loveless trade digs at each other by sliding in comments that alluded to West's color and Loveless' lack of legs. But it gets mentioned once too often.As for Kline, the writers didn't even really try with his Gordon. Kline spends the movie walking around with invention after invention and while at some moments it works, Kline could have been asleep at it would have made no difference.But the most worthless thing about the story is absolutely Hayek. Forget every other negative or positive thing about this film ... Hayek is more than unnecessary, she's absolutely ridiculous. Why? She really has no purpose besides her body. I mean you absolutely scratch your head and wonder why she's there. She doesn't hurt the story, but once you've picked at the obvious flaws of this film ... the dust will settle and you'll ask yourself, "what did Salma do?"Is it a good movie? Well, no. But to me, what really matters is, was it a waste of time? I say no.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, the film wasn't that bad. It had humour, it had action, it had Salma's bare bum. What more could you ask for? Well, a decent baddie would have been nice for a start. Our own Ken Brannagh was hopelessly miscast - possibly the worst casting that I have ever seen.The kids should like it, but I can't recommend this for adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big budget summer spectacle? Yep. Is it cheesy? Definitely. Is it a blatant starring vehicle? Without a doubt. Does Will Smith sing the movie's theme song a la Men In Black? Of course. Is it catchy? Debatable. As a movie-goer with a brain, I'm supposed to not like these films. Maybe it has something to do with not supporting big budget films released by a major studio that recycle old ideas that should rightfully bomb, but don't.Wild Wild West is standard formula. Good guys go after devilish bad guys who want money and power in these sorts of things. Throw in some one-liners, scenes of carnage, a lot of CGI, a respectable Kevin Kline, a buxom Salma Hakek and you have this movie. I didn't pay to see it and in a few years time, I doubt I'll remember much of it. It's that kind of flick. A way to divert an hour's attention. There is absolutely nothing of merit to go on about at length.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mild, Wild West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strange film....very strange. It's clever....but misguided. Fans of the original t.v. series will find very little familiar here, the title character, played by Will Smith, is the film's main problem. Street smart, hip, rapping dialogue doesn't fit in easily with an Old West backdrop, where in reality, someone would probably have shot him in the back. Having said that though, the film's climax, with the giant mechanical spider is one of the best f/x sequences yet committed to film in my opinion, very "War of the Worlds" in tone as it menaces and destroys a Western Town. All in all, if you can overlook Smith's streetwise 90s humor being a century out of place, the ending alone is worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's time to retire this genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie producers (I refuse to give them the dignity of being called "filmmakers") who really think that movies based on old TV shows will work might want to reevaluate not only that conclusion, but their career choice. Now, I liked the "Brady Bunch" movie because it was a parody of a really bad TV show. "Lost In Space," for all its many, many flaws, was also better than the TV show it was based on. "Mission Impossible" wasn't a great film, but it did work as an action movie. "Star Trek" and "Naked Gun" had the advantage of just being continuations of shows that were unfairly cancelled. "Charlie's Angels" was also a parody, and it was very entertaining. Those are the only TV show-movies worth mentioning. "Wild Wild West" might be a parody, but it travels so far from its source material, that any resemblance is lost on an audience that probably never saw the show anyways. This movie certainly won't create any new fans of the show. Come to think of it, I seriously doubt anyone involved in the production of "Wild Wild West" the movie ever saw the show either. "Wild Wild West" is an awkward, odd, and pointless movie. It does not rise to the level of badness occupied by the movie "Batman and Robin," but it seems like it's trying to. I won't bore you with the exact details about the plot. This movie is pure formula: smart-alec cop #1 (in this case they're federal agents) meets more serious cop #2, they don't get along but their forced to work together to find the bad guy they're both chasing. And a girl gets involved. Unoriginality is not an unforgivable sin in a movie. If it were, then James Bond would be out of a job. This movie fails because it's just really awkward. It degenerates into race and handicap jokes that no self-respecting person would laugh at, and keeps bouncing back and forth between wanting to be serious and wanting to be funny. (Contrast the carnage of one of the scenes involving the villain's super-tank with the goofiness of the preceding and following scenes.)The suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy action movies is stretched beyond the audience's ability to rationalize. It suffers from Reed Richards' Syndrome (named after the master-inventor leader of Marvel Comics' "Fantastic Four", who has built everything from time machines to faster-than-light space ships). The weird inventions in this movie are both (a) impossible and (b) revolutionary. If people really had these gadgets then the world would be revolutionized by them. A flying machine in 1869? Gordon's rocket-cycle? (Let's not talk about the giant spider!) I know this movie is NOT SUPPOSED TO BE historically accurate, but COME ON! This movie makes "Gladiator" look like a History Channel documentary.I really feel sorry for anyone who paid to see this movie. And the next time you go to see a movie based on an old TV show, make sure it's free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may not have been as good as Men In Black, but it's okay. It's got pretty good special effects, an okay story, good jokes, and Will Smith!!I really liked when James West (Smith) kept saying about that professor who's head was cut off "That is a man's head." and it got slower and slower until Artemus Gordon's invention showed the professor's last image of General McGrath. Brian Orndorf (or OrnDORK) and a lot of other people may not have liked it, but there are a lot more who like it, or just as much who like it. This is one good movie that you probably will enjoy, unless you don't like Will Smith or the story.P.S.: What was Brian Orndorf thinking. His lies about this being the worst in the summer may hurt Barry Sonnenfeld or Will Smith's feelings. Sonnenfeld tried his best to do this, so this Orndorf shouldn't have been so mean. This was a hit, but not a gigantic hit, just a hit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Special effects can't save it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild Wild West contains some really interesting special effects. In fact, there are even times when I started to want to like this movie because of them. Even though Kenneth Branagh has both of his legs, for instance, you would never know it from this movie. Moreover, the incredibly huge mechanical spider seems to really be cruising across the deserts of the southwest. However, these special effects did not prevail. I still came out of this movie extremely disappointed. Perhaps the biggest disappointment was in the plot itself. Klein and Smith, while interesting and funny actors in their own right, are not able to revive a story that really has no point. I spent half the movie saying to myself, "What are they trying to do again?" The jokes are weak and immature. The character played by Salma Hayek is obvious eye candy. They don't even play the cool "Wild Wild West" song enough. I do not recommend even renting this movie. Better yet, wait until it goes on Blockbuster's favorites list, watch it, and return it for a store credit!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that with all these millions and FX's this moviecouldn't lift.The story was simply and plain, but one gets the sense thatthere are no ties between one sequence to the next. The actorstried to be fun and tried to say funny jokes, but they justsimply fail.Not to mention that to see this flick one must left thehistorical knowledge in suspense,(and I'm not talking about ablack sheriff). The actors were bad, Salma Hayek is just amindless adornment in this film, and not even Branagh do enoughto save this doomed film.This film tries to do what a TV series do it best, without themoney the producers spent on this very bad film.And the worse was the ending battle with the giant spider. Fromwhat I know this was (I mean the spider) one of the requisitesof the producer Jon Peters, who tried to insert in the "SupermanLives" project, and for that reason the writer Kevin Smithleaves the project. Peters has the idea that spiders are themost feared animal in all the world, but the way it is displayedin this film, is not menacing, or feared. Noisy, yes; massive,yes; astounding, maybe; but after a simply pair of tricks, thenovelty falls flat down.This are of the kind of flicks that shows almost all on theirtrailers. So seeing the film means no news or twists to you, notto talk about surprises.After a while watching this film my mind begins to wander toanything except this movie. So I you want be bored to the nth,then you MUST SEE THIS FILM!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, no, this is not a great movie, it's a summer movie. I took my 10 yr old brother and we had a great time watching it. Will Smith is very appealing,(as always), as James T. West. He's funny, witty, and very stylish. Kevin Kline was perfect doing Artemus Gordon. It's a take on his role from In &amp; Out. I was also surprised to see thespian Kenneth Branagh in it but he was nastily over-the-top as Arliss Loveless. As with any summer flick the action and special effects were great. I don't know what everyone's gripe is. I enjoy having a good time at the theater come July and this movie doesn't dissappoint,(to me), in any way. I also found it humorous as to how they viewed an African-American lawman in the old west. It was light and a clever small satire on that issue. All in all at least 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

I did not care who lived and who died by the time the film reached the second reel. Seeing a film where you don't really care what happens can be a unique experience. Add to it that Salma Hayek is billed as being in this movie (even though she doesn't seem to be) and the film earns it's reputation.I would recommend this film to:*Die-hard Will Smith fans*People who enjoyed "The Avengers"I wouldn't recommend this film to:*Fans of Kenneth Branagh*Fans of Kevin Kline*Fans of Salma HayekI can't say I liked the film.

Do not do that. You'll get disappointed.Do expect a predictable movie about a mad scientist who wants to conquer the US and has to be stopped by to other madmen, being a black cowboy who 'first shoots, shoots again, shoots some more and then tries to ask some questions' and another mad scientist who wants to plan everything. However, Smith is about as cool as Dr Spock in the first Star Trek series and Kline is about as stylish as Doc Brown in Back to the Future.However, there are a few nice jokes (i.e. Smith is offered a cigar in the Oval Office). And that's about all the good there is in this screenplay.If you're under 14 and like Will Smith and science class, then you're bound to love this movie. If not, don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim West (Will Smith) is the fastest gun in the Wild West. The delectable ladies can never get enough of him and the fiendish villains will never find out what hit them. With his quick reflexes, impeccable wit, and righteous charisma, Jim West is always up to the challenge against any and all innumerable odds. Jim West is out to tame the West. Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) is a U.S. Marshal, an inventor, and a master of disguise. He too has plenty of charm and looks. Gordon has the ability to masquerade himself as an unsuspecting damsel-in-distress...In the villains' corner: Insane professor Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) is ruthless, heartless...and leg-less. This crippled villain has a lot of dirty tricks up his sleeve. Loveless is assisted by a renegade Confederate known as General "Bloodbath" McGrath (Ted Levine). McGrath himself has a grudge against Jim West...Why are all the prominent scientists and inventors being kidnapped? It's up to West and Gordon to track down these scientists and thwart a madman's scheme for power. The madman behind the kidnappings is none other than arch-nemesis Loveless. Loveless has, as his arsenal, lethal flying disks, several cannons, a fortified bastion, and an 80 foot mechanical tarantula! As evident by the destruction of a small town, Loveless has a blatant disregard for public property. Dr. Arliss Loveless is hoping to capture President Ulysses S. Grant (Robert Conrad, the ORIGINAL Jim West) and therefore gain the strength to rule this nation...Throw in a love interest, Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) and everything is all set. That is, except for one minor conflict. Both Jim West and Artemus Gordon frequently find themselves vying for Rita's affection...Nevertheless, our dashing heroes must fight for the freedom of humankind. As the sun rises, the adventures continue with our heroes keeping their heads up high. The action rushes by the minute...The Wild West will never be the same again! Jim West and Artemus Gordon must be prepared for lots of trouble!WILD WILD WEST is based on the hit TV series of the 1960s. The science-fiction and Western genres merge in this rather odd tale about heroes and the numerous challenges they must face. Star Will Smith teams up with director Barry Sonnenfeld (MEN IN BLACK) once again in this entertaining motion picture. To tell you the truth, I thought that WILD WILD WEST was a great, but not exactly spectacular motion picture. The $80 million plus special FX were flamboyant enough, and the humor was always rife in this movie. I found myself having a rather marvelous time watching this delightful action picture. From the intimate love scene in the beginning of this movie to the invigorating climax, WILD WILD WEST is fun in the West!WILD WILD WEST succeeds because it keeps the viewer on the edge-of-the-seat. Lots of exhilarating action scenes are worth mentioning. One cool scene involved Jim West inside a room, surrounded by some "susceptible" paintings. In an instant, gunmen appear from the paintings and a brief gun battle ensues. Needless to say, West blasts his way through these six to seven outlaws. West does not even break a sweat! The scenes where Will Smith rides underneath a train are superb as well. The climax is superlatively awesome.Yes it is true, Will Smith does all of his own stunts. Yes, you do get to see Will Smith cross dressing in this movie. (Believe it or not, it leaves a lot to the imagination!) Will Smith is "as slick as they is."Though WILD WILD WEST is a palatable flick, there are quite a number of flaws in this movie. First, the acting is something left to be desired for. I especially found myself startled by seeing respected thespian Kenneth Branagh portray a paralyzed psycho. It is unimaginable to see a Shakespearean actor act like a redneck. Kevin Kline would probably be the last actor I'd expect to see in a Western, but hey, his versatility did amaze me. On the other hand, I was dejected at the dearth of Salma Hayek's presence in this movie. This beautiful actress could have had a much stronger role in this movie. As for the proliferating breast jokes, sexist remarks, and redneck riffs, they do degenerate into utter idiocy. Finally, this film also relies more on coincidences rather than coherence. (i.e. Gordon's chance encounter with Rita Escobar, amongst other segments.)Speaking of Kline, he had some inspired moments. It's extremely funny how Kevin Kline tries to emulate some kung fu moves at times. I was also amused at watching Kline perform in drag!As much as I was impressed by this production, WILD WILD WEST is entertainment and nothing more. This motion picture does not have an iota of logic or realism. Watch this film solely for your own viewing pleasure. Do not anticipate anything scholarly in this movie. If you are looking for insight, look somewhere else buddy!Although WILD WILD WEST is not Will Smith's biggest accomplishment, it is a movie that he should be proud of. "The Wild Wild West" music video is also a must-see.Just keep in mind that, in the words of Ulysses S. Grant, James West loves to "...shoot first, shoot later, shoot some more and then when everybody's dead try to ask a question or two."RATING: **1/2 out of ****. (Based purely on its entertainment value.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'It's a whole new West' - Don't be fooled, it's still as crappy as the original TV show..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild Wild West is a story all about how the avenging Southern plantation owners are angered at their losing of the Revolutionary War, so one of those psychotic slave beaters builds an 80 foot steel tarantula so that he can meet up with President Grant at the Utah hammering of the golden spike - so President Grant will see the enormous spider, and somehow forfeit everything civilized, and hand the rightfully owned country all over to this lunatic. I'm sorry - I must have been sick that day way back in History class. I don't remember any of this.. oh well, what can you do?The movie stars Will Smith as Jim West - a back talking former slave who lacks brains, Kevin Kline as (Are you ready for this one?) Artemus Gordon - a spy who loves to cross-dress, and invent really stupid gadgets that would normally be deemed useless (actually, in real life, they wouldn't even work), and perhaps the lamest of all characters.. drum roll please! The movie also stars Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Arliss Loveless. That's right. This guy is very pathetic - and very unbelievable. How so? Well, he lost his whole lower body in the war, and he somehow has a VERY large quantity of steel (which didn't even exist back then). What's a half-man going to do with a huge supply of steel? Why, build an entire city - AND a huge spider, of course. And, that my friends is what makes Wild Wild West the horrible piece of garbage that it is. Perhaps the best character, and the only one who put a smile on my face, was Salma Hayek's Rita Escobar. Although she's nice to look at, she doesn't fit into the story at all, and she could have been done without - had this been a good story. But it's not - so let her be.Let's dissect it some more. West and Gordon meet up with Loveless about 8 or more times through out the whole movie. Alright, now, about 3 of those times, Dr. Loveless had the chance to do away with both of them - BUT DIDN'T! Didn't even dream about killing them, oh no.. keep them alive! Hell, Loveless needs them to stay alive to.. to.. - no reason. Wait, could the reason be because only the deaths of the two heroes could make it an even worse movie for the audience? Naw, nothing could have made this movie worse than it was. That couldn't have been it.I can't get this villain it out of my mind: This half man can build a whole city and a huge spider. What does he need slaves for?! Why does he even care if he won or lost the war at all?! He's got women (Who practically throw themselves at his non-existent genitals), he's got money (Either that or he stole all that steel), and he's got the good-ol' American racist South on his side. Hell, this guy even looks like he has a pattern that he tacks onto his face each morning in order to get his beard to look the annoyingly pathetic way it does.This movie isn't all bad, no. There are few (VERY few) select parts which prove to be enjoyable. The entire magnet collar run through the corn fields shows up to be a memorable part, as does the train which West and Gordon a re assigned. The train in itself is impressive, not the unrealistic gadgets that come along with it (I.E. Some sort of a spring pad at the end of the caboose that always lands you right directly into an awaiting chair inside. [I know what you're saying to that one, and - yeah, it's exactly what I said]).Halfway through this movie, you'll wish movie theaters did give refunds out to people.. and you'll know why almost everyone is endorsing this movie - it needs all the endorsement it can get in order to lure you to it ("Buy these glasses!" "Come here, you'll get a really cool head set!"). In short, don't go. And for heaven's sakes, quit playing the damn Will Smith song! It's not worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a light hearted buddy film, with the fantasy twist we all expect from The Wild Wild West, it proves to be an entertaining romp. My only major complaint is that the director simply didn't bring out the comic genius of these two fine actors. Kevin Kline has shone brightly in films such as A Fish Called Wanda and Dave, but here he barely manages a soft glow. Similarly, Will Smith has given us brilliant performances in Enemy of the State and Independence Day, but here he is reduced to poor puns at the expense of a handicapped man (albeit a twisted evil one). Someone who would have let them have a bit more of themselves poured into the film would have made it more than above average. The minor complaint (you know I had one) is that Salma Hayek is used as the worst sort of window dressing and appears seemingly only to show off her (very fine) behind. Please save that sort of thing for the dreck films like Austin Powers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this movie. I have watched it least a few times and I would watch it again. I found it very entertaining and funny. I don't like the usual boring westerns. I like this because it's different. I guess a lot of people found it too over the top and silly. This is just how I feel about the movie. I really like it. It's one of my favourites. If it was one of the regular boring westerns I probably wouldn't be interested anyway. I found it eccentric and a little out of the ordinary and that's what I like. That's just my take on it. I also like deep meaningful movies too but it's nice to watch something silly every now and again. I don't get the really bad ratings. One star is really harsh. I have seen movies that are MUCH worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a blockbuster parody, what do ya expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild Wild West" has to be one of the most notorious films ever made. Released in 1999, it's a blockbuster parody of the late-60's TV series with Will Smith in the starring role, which should tip everyone off that the film's not meant to be taken seriously (not that the TV series could be taken all that seriously either, just more serious than this movie).Kevin Kline plays James West's reluctant partner and he's a wiz with gizmos. Many complain about the "lack of chemistry" of the two stars, but I think it's a bunch of Barbra Streisand (BS). What these people don't get is that these characters are NOT SUPPOSED to like each other. As far as I'm concerned, Smith &amp; Kline make an entertaining team and are perfectly suitable for this movie.Kenneth Branagh and Ted Levine are also on hand as villains, but it's sassy, petite Salma Hayek who wins the prize for best supporting actor. This is only the second film I've seen her in and she just shines. Salma appears in some attractive outfits, including one with white fishnet stockings, and she's just a beauty to behold.BOTTOM LINE: I don't get what the whiners are complaining about with this movie, unless they were uber-fans of the TV series and were expecting a serious film adaption. "Wild Wild West" is an energetic goofy blockbuster spoof with all the requisite trappings, like 1999's "The Mummy" and 2004's "Van Helsing." I call these types of films "big dumb fun" movies because they're not meant to be taken too seriously; they're "Summer blockbusters" and solely exist to entertain &amp; amuse the viewer. Knowing this will help you appreciate "Wild Wild West." So turn off your brain and enjoy the ride.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in California, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona and Idaho.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember those days. We were all fooled and I was part of that fool's parade, playfully called: Will Smith Can Do No Wrong During the Fourth of July.Following the fantastic Independence Day, came the very fun Men in Black. Two years later, WWW, or Wild Wild West premiered. Granted, it sometimes can take three years to nail a great action/comedy/adventure. But, come on, guys, you had plenty of time to get a better Will Smith vehicle than this piece of horse's manure.I remember seeing this on opening weekend in 1999. For the first part of it, I remember kinda liking it, but hoping the great talents behind and in front of the screen would make this a grand western ? probably my least favorite genre.Nope, the movie got progressively worse and worse, more and more preposterous and ended with the most WTF climax that was an absolute chore to get through so we could go home. Leading up to the laugh-out-loud finale, were a ton of silly scenes poorly edited together without the sense of logic, humor, grace or entertainment.I vowed, easily, that is, not to ever see this movie again. Thankfully, this movie did fall off my radar and was easily forgotten until fifteen years later. It was then that I discovered the How Did This Get Made podcast. It was/is my mission to watch/re-watch all movies on their show list and then list to their podcasts where they spend about an hour ridiculing, often very hilariously, movies. Sadly, this movie was on that list.Fine, I'll get through it one more time. And with every viewing I have of a movie, I give it a chance. Meaning, here, I went in with an open mind and thought, maybe I was wrong before. It was a decade and a half ago, after all.Again, nope. This movie was actually worse than I remembered it. My only advice is to listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast. Don't even bother watching (or re-watching) this waste of time. The podcast is hilarious and gives much more depth to the making of and behind the scenes I didn't know about which far exceeds any joy you'd get from this turkey.And?the podcast's guest star is?Kevin Smith. He was incredible. This movie was not. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts: Mercifully, Kenneth Branagh is great in so many other things. Besides me mentioning him here, forget he was ever part of this. His character was classless, humorless and, ah-hem, had no legs. I forgive Will ? he was probably pushed hard to be in this, Selma wasn't huge at the time and Kevin had to take anything he could get a hold of. But, Kenneth was just plain embarrassing to see on screen. Just go see his other fantastic films, instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember enjoying this movie when I first saw it in theaters back in the summer of 1999 I was only 8 years old at time. I'm going to get to my likes and dislikes about this film: My likes: I liked how this movie was action packed the fight's were nicely done although most of the action in this movie is done by will smith not kevin kline. I liked the cast I thought most of the actors did a good job. I liked the special effects they were impressive I mean for a movie that came out in 1999 I was impressed.My dislikes: I thought the chemistry between kevin kline and will smith wasn't too believable.

		<shortDescription>The collective stick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, while not the greatest movie of all time, I found enough to be entertaining. Never saw the original television series. Movies are made to entertain. You can bash every movie for faults but what you should really be judging is whether it was entertaining or not.And so, I say this was entertaining. The special effects were fun and the villain really felt like a classic super-villain, insane but brilliant. You really wouldn't like the movie if you were looking for something intellectually stimulating but is good for a laugh even if you are generally laughing at the movie.Personally, I think most critics and most people in general have a rather large stick up their collective asses looking for perfection.It's not perfect but fun at least.

		<shortDescription>Bad Jon Peters!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's my understanding that Will Smith regrets his involvement with "Wild Wild West" (even going so far as to publicly apologize to Robert Conrad for desecrating the original TV show). I guess that might be necessary to the devotees of the TV series who were disappointed with the film. But what were they expecting with a big Summer Will Smith movie involving a giant mechanical spider? The problem here is that it's a movie full of misshapen jigsaw pieces that just don't fit. No one does; not Smith or Kline, and certainly not Branagh. I think it's fair to say that Smith is playing a slightly acerbic version of "J" from "Men in Black" [1997]. Branagh is playing your average cartoonish bad guy with a southern drawl, but he's just an uninvolving as the rest of the film. Kline, while he uses the little he's offered, doesn't even elicit a laugh when he's disguised as a buxom whore (when does one NOT laugh at a man in drag?). I feel the need to watch him in "Silverado"[1985] again just to cleanse my palate.The end result is a poorly-paced lumbering effort with no discernible energy (unless you count the energy used to get to the next gag), full of jokes that just fall flat. It's disappointing in the extreme that such a comedy failure came from the same guy that gave us "The Addams Family" [1991], "Get Shorty" [1995] and "Men in Black" [1997]. More heartbreaking still is that the pyrotechnics on this film ran amok and burned down most of the set (which was still standing from the filming of "Silverado" in 1985). Still, as bad Westerns go, it's still not as bad as "Jonah Hex" [2010]For those who remember the proposed Nicolas Cage Superman reboot (1998), Producer Jon Peters rallied heavily to have the Man of Steel fight a giant spider on screen. Thankfully, that movie never happened. But it's great to see recycled ideas being shoehorned into movies where they don't belong. Nice going, Peters.3.5/10P.S.: Will Smith owes Stevie Wonder an apology for the title song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Wild Wild West', directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, is a Half-Baked action-comedy, that deserved a better deal. Though the film was popular at the box office, the reviews it received were far from encouraging.'Wild Wild West' is a mega-budgeted action-comedy, where, Two of the best hired guns in the West must save President Grant from the clutches of a 19th century inventor-villain.The writing is not up-to the mark. It appeals in some portions, but at places, it fails to hold you. Direction by Barry Sonnenfeld is just about okay. Cinematography is good. Editing is alright. Acting Wise: Will Smith and Kevin Kline can do better. Kenneth Branagh isn't menacing enough, while Salma Hayek deserved some more footage. Others lend support.On the whole, A Strictly One-Time Watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is indeed a mixture of several movie styles and themes: western, sci-fi, espionage and politics. But it's above all a well done comedy with some good special effects and unpredicted gags and scenes. The acting is also good mainly those characters performed by Will Smith and Kevin Kline. The several invented gadgets by US Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) some of them on the spot, are imaginative and sometimes even hilarious. And the action is almost constant riveting your permanent attention on it. A movie not to be despised although not a masterpiece because the theme and the plot doesn't allow more than what is shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A matter of taste and nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To like this film you must open your mind to the possibility that this can maybe happen. Remember,history is replete with untold tales of wars unwon. This one sheds premises on what could happen if a confederate got his hands on the best minds the world has ever seen. Now the characters are in need of depth. Will Smith is always great to watch fight but leading man material I still sometimes debate although "Ali" brought him closer to Actors stage. Selma Hayek I think played the role to the best that was given her. People forget with even suttle period movies the role of the women in America must always be represented and her being willing to risk her life for her husband made her character believable. My hats goes off to Kevin Branagh whom played the villain with sheer hatred in his heart. Not calling branagh a racist but after watching that part he sure scared me. And that is what acting is about. Give this film a good place on your DVD collection when you want to just watch mind numbing action with very little thought. At the very least try to catch all the banter between branagh and Smith. Some of those comments are really borderline to see the least. You may even find Bill Meher using some on his show they are so racist. But all in all a decent film.</fullReview>

Will Smith is far too convinced of his own charisma, the visual effects are shoddy, most of the jokes fall flat, there's no plot, Salma Hayek plays almost no part in the non-plot, and the silliness doesn't sit well with the ill-advised references to slavery and massacres.That said, I do have a soft spot for this movie. It gets worse with every viewing, but there's genuinely a lot to like about it. I love Kevin Kline's little gadgets, and the train, and the giant spider robot, and Kenneth Branagh's hammy performance, and Hayek's corset.

If that is not a hard and fast rule it should be. Everything leading up to the historical event, can be fantasy. But the historical event has to be the exact event, otherwise the story loses any focus. This is the case with Wild, Wild West.The idea of Will Smith as the agent, excellent, nicely done.

		<shortDescription>Underrated and Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is highly underrated. Sure, its not as great as the TV series, which is a considered a classic in my book ( and in most peoples books as well). But the movie is nowhere near as bad as everyone keeps saying it is. Its a movie that shouldn't be taken so seriously when watching it.The CGI steampunk spider is what most people claim to have saved the movie, but i disagree.I enjoyed the movies scenes in which the spider was not present ( my favorite scene was when Loveless's steam powered tank attacked the train). In fact i almost forgot about the spider while watching the movie for the 1st time. I especially got a kick out of Kenneth Branagh's acting as Dr. Loveless.I say Loveless was the best part of the movie. But that's not to say I enjoy the use of steampunk technology. I consider this movie to be an excellent use of the Steampunk style.I do admit, the acting is a bit over the top, especially Will Smith and Kevin Kline. But i did not think it was terrible or too cheesy like everyone says it is. It is kinda silly in some way, but overall i enjoyed both of them. I do admit though, Salma Hayek's acting was weak and made her character boring. Usually, i am against movie remakes of classic TV shows, but this is one i can agree with. If it was a direct remake of the TV series with little new elements, i would not bother to watch it. So I give the producers and writers of this movie props for trying something new and different in remakes.Overall, i feel like this movie is not only underrated and enjoyable, but over-criticized. Try watching it without thinking of the TV show and of Will Smith playing James West. Whether it is better or worse, you will mostly likely have a different view on the movie than you did before.Final Verdict: 8 out of 10 I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild WestStarring: Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek, Kenneth Branagh, Ted Levine, Bai Ling, Musetta Vander, Sofia Eng, Frederique van der Wal and M. Emmet WalshGenre: Action/Comedy/Western/Sci-FiRated: PG-13I'm a huge fan of Will Smith and his movies but this one I think was one of his decent ones but not exactly the best. A lot of people and movie critics have hated on this movie, but me I'm not jumping on the bandwagon of hating on this movie, I actually think it's alright. So the movie is based off the old 1960's television series. The movie is about a former Civil-War hero, Jim West (Will Smith) and a US Marshall, Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) who both have a different way of handling justice but Ulysses S Grant (Kevin Kline, again) teams up the duo to stop Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). While on the mission, our heroes get distracted by the appearance of Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) who tags along in the mission and is the daughter of one of the captured scientists. The humor in this movie is alright but can be a little dry at the same time, not mention the movie could've had better writing but no one's perfect. The chemistry with Will Smith and Kevin Kline is basically your average Action/Comedy duo, Will Smith's character is the kind of who relies on his instincts and asks questions later while Kevin Kline's character is basically the total opposite and yet sophisticated. I'd have to say the thing I didn't like about this movie was the giant spider which I thought was kind of ridiculous. I was also hoping that they would do a sequel to this movie but after the years have pasted with this movie, it doesn't look like it's going to happen. But overall, the movie is just popcorn entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The night of the big spider!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The '90's saw a vogue ( still continuing, alas ) for big budget movie versions of classic television shows. In the space of a few years we saw 'The Fugitive' 'Mission: Impossible', 'The Avengers', 'Maverick', 'The Beverly Hillbillies', and 'The Addams Family'. Some proved entertaining, but most fell flat, often because the makers had no understanding of what made the originals work in the first place. Barry Sonnenfeld's follow-up to his successful 'Men In Black' reunited him with its star - Will Smith - for an adaptation of Michael Garrison's Western cum spy show 'The Wild Wild West'. Smith is an amiable enough performer, but lacks the charisma necessary for the role of 'James West' ( which Robert Conrad had in spades ). Bruce Campbell would have been better in my view. Kevin Kline provides some laughs as his partner 'Artemus Gordon'. The story has West and Gordon meeting for the first time whilst investigating the disappearances of noted scientists, among them the father of sexy Rita Escobar ( Salma Hayek ). Their rivalry ends when they work together on the orders of President Ulysses S.Grant. The trail leads to crippled mad scientist Dr.Arliss Loveless ( Kenneth Branagh ) who is constructing a giant mechanical spider to kill the President and take over the country.I am staggered at the vitriol this has attracted ( most of the reviews look like the work of one very angry person ). Did I see the same film as everyone else? There is a lot to like about it - Elmer 'The Magnificent Seven' Bernstein provides a cracking soundtrack ( one of his last ), the gadgets are cool, the action fast, the girls - particularly Hayek, who has a nice arse - are hot, and the spider itself a magnificent creation, almost like something out of Jules Verne. Its certainly more fun than the last James Bond film - the horrid 'Quantum Of Solace'. Some nice touches of humour such as the dog peering into an ear trumpet, inadvertently recreating the 'His Master's Voice' ( better known these days as 'H.M.V.' ) logo. The unexpected use of the original theme tune as West and Gordon gallop off to to find Loveless is a rousing moment.Where it goes wrong is the casting. As I said earlier, Smith is bland as 'West', but the very worst performance comes from Branagh. Its not just his abominable American accent ( how many seconds, one wonders, did he spend practising it? ). He looks like what he is, an embarrassed British actor in this film only for the money. Making him a paraplegic instead of a dwarf was also a mistake.The film was a huge box office flop, meaning we are unlikely to see any more big screen adventures for Jim and Arte, and that's a pity as I still think there's a good film waiting to be made based on 'Wild Wild West'. With the right people in the key roles, this could have really been something. To my mind, the worst thing about it was Will Smith's awful song.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen so many negative reviews that I had to hop on and register to add my take on this movie.First off, let me get a couple things straight. There are two types of movies in the world, A movies and B movies. A movies are the ones that win Oscars and awards, B movies are usually sub-par or off-the-walls goofy.This movie is somewhere in between. In terms of budget, it could hang with the best of the best, in terms of script and plot, it's a B movie at it's heart. And most of the reviews I'm seeing are reviewing it as if it were meant to be taken seriously.This movie is what it is, silly and fun. Will Smith gives a serviceable performance as does Selma Hayek. As far as visual effects go, it's pretty damn good for its time. Sure the plot is fairly nonsensical, but this is a movie to be taken lightly. It's not meant for the hard-core movie buff, it's a family film and a fun one at that.Don't let all of the negative reviews turn you off from this movie. It's worth watching, especially if you love the nostalgia it brings back.Plus, honestly, who can hate the amazing song in the credits? Honestly, if you aren't bobbing your head to that, you might not be human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not that bad!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a very solid film, not a masterpiece but an OK movie. Seriously I don't get why this movie is hated so much. It got lots of cool action scene and hilariously moment in it that will keep you interest in most of the time. Storyline is fine and special effect was well done by 1999 standard, it just a typical summer blockbuster that come out every year.Will Smith is charming as always in this film and Kenneth Branagh did a great job portraying the main villain. I think this movie is not meant to be taken too seriously and the audience should be fully aware of this when they are watching it.Overall I enjoyed this film and gave a solid 7 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>for some reason this movie has a pretty low rating on this site(4.1/10).i thought was very good.it's funny,exciting and action packed.there's also a fair amount of suspense and lots of irony.Will Smith and Kevin Kline really work well off each other.i thought they balanced the sci-fi and western elements very well.i liked the villain.i thought he was very menacing and cruel.and he also had a twisted,but funny sense of humour.for some reason,this movie didn't do very well at the box office,which mystifies me.it is pretty light in tone and is sometimes played for laughs and sometimes it's played straight,and for me,it works.my vote for Wild Wild West:4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All the gadgets in the world can't save this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's post Civil War. Army Captain James West (Will Smith) is on the hunt for rebel General McGrath (Ted Levine). U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) is looking for missing scientists. It looks like McGrath has been kidnapping the country's greatest scientists to create an unimaginable weapon system. Meanwhile the legless Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) builds weapons, and Rita Escobar (Salma Hayek) looks for her scientist father.This starts off badly with Kevin Kline dressed as a woman. He is SO VERY UGLY. It is truly disconcerting to see the old guy picking Kline over Salma Hayek. It is disturbing in so many ways that hurts deeply in my soul.Then there is all the distractions of those CGI wacky inventions of Gordon. It doesn't impress as much as breaks down most of the scenes. It take me out of the scene and reminds me of a Bugs Bunny cartoon. So much of this movie's budget is wasted on unnecessary and distracting effects. The film is better off not spending all that time pointing the camera at every little gadget of Gordon.Kevin Kline and Will Smith could have been a good buddy cop duo. And having Salma Hayek doesn't hurt anything. I think the actors were lined up for a great fun time. But the action never seems to be as much fun as it should be. It's constantly trying to impress us with some wacky CGI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie made for all of the wrong reasons.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that when you make big budget summer blockbuster type of movies the idea is to make the biggest movie with the most butts in seats as possible. But when you care so little about the storytelling and leave almost nothing from the original TV show then what's the point of even making the movie? Even if this movie was a success at the box office in comparison to how much it cost to make(which it wasn't), it doesn't change the fact that it's a movie that you'll forget 10 minutes after seeing it.Barry Sonnenfeld with this movie shows that he's not a real director, but more of less just the glorified cinematographer we all know that he is. He's good at being the guy behind the camera and getting all the close ups and all the nice shots type of stuff. But he has no place in working with actors, overseeing changes to the script, dealing with studio pressure who want you to change your movie in ways that make no sense but hey if we add this random new character with little importance to the story we might sell a few more toys!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's funny here and there,....but feels like it's missing purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Barry Sonnenfeld has released a lot of films under his name that aren't exactly what you would call normal films. What I mean by normal is that it does not pertain to the real world. Examples like these are Men In Black (1997) and The Adam's Family (1991). They are not your regular comedy's dealing with normal people. That's a talent Sonnenfeld has - making strange but funny movies. However, Wild Wild West (1999) was a mismatch of ideas and comedy. I can also see why the original stars of the movie weren't pleased with it either because it wasn't anywhere close to the TV show.This particular film sets up the origins to how the two main roles, Jim West and Artemus Gordon come together to save America. But even this isn't done well. The only origin explained is how they meet - there really isn't much of a back-story to any of these characters at all. Jim West even has a girlfriend that only has a very brief introduction and is never explored again. Playing these two main roles are Will Smith (West) and Kevin Kline (Gordon) and to be honest, their on screen chemistry isn't great, but it's also not horrendously terrible.The comedy is really on and off here - a hit or miss. Sometimes Smith and Kline do exchange so remarks that'll spark up a few chuckles, but it is not as frequent as one would hope for. In fact, for the times that aren't funny, they're more awkward instead of just falling flat. Most of this is related to the sexual innuendoes. It just doesn't seem appropriate for the film. It made me uncomfortable to see cross-dressing that didn't look natural or attractive for that matter. I'm amazed that the supporting cast was written to be so dumb to fall for such obvious flaws.The rest of the cast isn't too bad. Salma Hayek is the sex symbol as usual, even though her character is kind of meaningless. She's only there to make the characters of West and Gordon drool and fight for who could bring her to bed with them. M. Emmet Walsh is also a good supporting character even though he doesn't get as much screen time as he deserves. Kenneth Branagh was impressive enough that he could make long speeches that seem to be rich in high vocabulary, although I'll never understand his taste in pets. Another thing that's not explained.It's sad to see that the four writers to this movie all agreed on having the super weapon that the villain wants to use to obtain his goals is by using a giant mechanical spider. I mean, in the 1800s? How ludicrous is that? It's one thing to have a preference for spiders,...but not to model your super weapon after it. Really guys? It's because of this that this movie can not be taken seriously at all. This is where I think director Sonnenfeld could have opened his mouth and said something. But because he's so used to working with weird material, it flew right over his head. Ugh.So along with the few laughs that viewers might get from West and Gordon's wisecracks are the gadgetry and music (sort of). I had a lot of fun with the eye candy in this film. Most of it was because of Gordon's ingeniousness and a little bit of the other things not created by him. To have a mini wrist note pad seems very useful! The score, composed by Elmer Bernstein, wasn't bad either. It had a reoccurring theme and stuck to it. I am curious though to why he didn't stick to the original theme from the TV show....he even hinted at it at one point in the film! Come on...that's proof that you could have stuck to the original theme.The cast, special effects and music isn't bad but instead of sticking to the traditional western genre, director Barry Sonnenfeld decided to keep things weird like the rest of his films. As a result, the comedy can be awkward and villain's show of power is stranger than is menacing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie it complete rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie simply appalls me, and it is not as if I have not given it a go. I have watched it three times now, and the more I watch it the more I hate it. There is so much in this film that disgusts me, such as General Bloodbath McGrath(Ted Levine), and Arlin Loveless (Kenneth Brannagh). It is more than just the characterisations, but the characters themselves. The scene where McGrath empties the ear fluid out of his ear, and simply seeing Loveless with half a body trundle around on a wheeled contraption simply turns my stomach.Then there is the mixing of the characters of West and Gordon. It simply does not seem to work. James West (Will Smith) is a smooth talking, fast shooting, Negro cowboy and Artimes Gordon (Kevin Kleine) is the smart inventor of all strange contractions who also happens to be a US Marshall. Personally, the pairing of these two characters simply does not seem to work, at all. I simply won't even suggest that the whole idea of a heroic Negro in the immediate post civil war period doesn't work, but then again, is this not simply an attempt to rewrite history.Of course, there is the idea of transporting us back to the mid-nineteenth century where industrialisation was taking hold, and then once again rewriting history by adding all these wonderful inventions (the tank, the motorbike, and the aeroplane) years before they actually appeared. Okay, they do say that we shouldn't take this film seriously, but there is significant difference between farce, which you are not supposed to take seriously (such as The Simpsons and Futurama, and even then the Simpsons can take farce just that little too far) and outright stupidity. This film clearly falls into the second category.Simply put, this movie puts a serious stain on the the resume of both Kenneth Branagh and Will Smith. Men in Black was silly, but it was still a good movie. This movie was simply just plain silly. It isn't even a Western, the only thing that makes it such is that it set in the 1800s. There is no taming of the barbaric lands, but rather an evil scientist that must be defeated. In fact, this film seems to take the opposite of the Western where the progress fights between itself, with the good inventor that is Artemis Gordon fighting the evil inventor that is Arlin Loveless.One final thing, while it makes the Negro the hero, it then in turn insults me to no end by turning the disabled white man into the villain who, no longer being able to have sex due to his disability, surrounds himself with beautiful woman as a way of compensating himself and showing off to the rest of the world that he is still a man. I suspect that the women are attracted to him because of the fact that he is no longer a man, and as such are not threatened by him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy and fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is borderline psychotic, but that's what makes it enjoyable. Aside from the 'mechanology' nonsense and the plot(?), it's a lot of fun to watch. Will Smith is probably the main reason for this. Kenneth Branagh is able to rock a Seneca beard long before Seneca Crane could, and Salma Hayek looks amazing in whatever she's wearing. While Kevin Kline looked like a combination of Robert Downey Jr. and Bill Murray, he and Smith made decent partners.There are token characters aplenty though, which is a major downfall for the film. It might be offensive to pretty much everyone, but not in a way that painfully insults anyone. (Or at least it didn't offend me, a young Caucasian male.) I don' think it's too much to ask the audience to play along with what's going on, no matter how ridiculous it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to be perfectly placid about this movie in saying that although the acting and cinematography was terrible, the overall stunts/ action was pretty entertaining. When I first saw the movie I thought it was great, but that was when I was 8, now I have had a chance to review the context of the film more closely and I truly realize that it was atrocious. I mean a giant spider driven by legless Loveless? Come on. I think the movie deserved exactly what it received, but I also believe that some of the fighting and gun play were good for entertaining children of younger ages. The humor would also be a plus on being angled toward a younger audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horrbly Underrated Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite surprised by the negative reviews for this movie. This was a very entertaining movie. Sure, it's weird and ridiculous, but you have to realize that was exactly what the intent was. It was meant to be a satirical remake of a popular television show. Kevin Kline and Will Smith present excellent performances, the cinematic direction is interesting, and the soundtrack is superb. The story is quite original, especially when compared with the uninspired superhero movies of today. No, this movie is certainly no Oscar-winner, but it certainly deserves more than 1 star. If one thinks this movie is bad, then one has not seen truly bad movies. For me, this was a very enjoyable film, and it has a giant mechanical spider, which is really quite awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West is set during 1869 &amp; starts as US President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline) orders US Marshall Artemus Gordon (Kevin Line) &amp; Captain Jim West (Will Smith) to work together &amp; discover who has kidnapped twelve of America's top scientists during the past year. Gordon &amp; West reluctantly agree to work together &amp; find out from General 'Bloodbath' McGrath (Ted Levine) that crazed southern confederate soldier Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) has created a giant mechanical Spider which he plans to use to kidnap President Grant &amp; force him to sign power of the entire US over to him. With his army of mechanical weapons Dr. Loveless seems to have the upper hand but the courage &amp; determination of Gordon &amp; West is the President's &amp; US's only hope...Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld &amp; based on The Wild Wild West (1965-1969) TV series which ran for over a hundred episodes it seems that I should hate this big budget Hollywood adaptation, I mean with comments that say it's 'completely worthless', 'utter utter crap' &amp; 'an awful waste of talent' in the IMDb comment section surely Wild Wild West is the worst film ever made that no-one would ever like? Right? Wrong. I liked Wild Wild West, yes that's right I liked it &amp; it has problems but is a fun ride that I found more entertaining I had any right to expect considering Wild Wild West has a really bad reputation. Straight away I liked the playful &amp; often funny script, sure it's absurd with a huge mechanical Spider, a legless villain, flying machines, decapitation traps &amp; a plot to take control of the US but I was entertained &amp; thought it moved along like a rocket with barely a wasted moment as the jokes, visual gags &amp; special effects come thick &amp; fast. The humour is hit &amp; miss I will say that, I thought some of it was very funny like the hilarious speech Will Smith gives to the Louisiana plantation mob while at other times I thought it was embarrassing like Will Smith turning up in a see through Harem outfit to save Kevin Line but what the hell at least it tries &amp; there's just about enough positive here to outweigh the negative. While the film never takes itself seriously &amp; it's good fun there are times when Wild Wild West slips into embarrassing slapstick &amp; some parts are just too goofy like Will Smith bouncing between two trains on a bungee cord, or the revolving billiards table or people randomly emerging from paintings or the silly flying Penny Farthing bike although at other times it's funny like when Will Smith takes on some bad guy's while naked or Will Smith &amp; Kevin Kline trying to outrun two huge spinning blades through a cornfield. The narrative is poor, gaining clues from the burned in image of a decapitated heads eyes, a woman finding out where Loveless is by listening to his female guards talk about how the desert will effect their hair &amp; so on but plot isn't really the strong point of the film.The special CGI computer effects are pretty good, the giant marching mechanical Spider looks great as does the whole film including other machines such as a tank, trains &amp; the Loveless wheelchair which itself grows legs at the end. The production design is great with a period wild west look combined with the whole steam punk technological look with huge pistons, huge metal machines bolted together with huge rivets &amp; the intricacy of the designs are impressive &amp; memorable. There's not much violence here, a few fist fights &amp; a decapitated head. Apparently undergoing expensive re-shoots to add more humour after test audiences didn't know if it was meant to be a comedy or not, maybe that's the reason some of the more silly moments are present. The ending was also re-shot with Will Smith fighting those men in the engine room as originally he only fought &amp; killed those female guards.With a supposed budget of over $150,000,000 Wild Wild West was the most expensive film made in 1999, although shot in oragney desert hues the film looks good with great production values. Will Smith apparently turned down the lead in The Matrix (1999) &amp; is pretty cool here, Kevin Line is a nice contrast while Kenneth Branagh is very theatric as the main villain &amp; his female guards are hot even if they are underused &amp; just sort of stand there.Wild Wild West is a film that many seem to hate, I say to hell with them all because I really liked it. I thought it was funny, exciting, cool &amp; very enjoyable to watch &amp; if some of the goofier moments had been toned down then I think more people would have liked it. Ceratinly nowhere near as bad as many make out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two secret agents combine resources to foil a plot to assassinate President Grant.Wild Wild West was a TV series in the 60s, and provided the inspiration for this spoof anachronistic steampunk western comedy. As someone who never saw the original series, I really don't care whether the film betrays everything it ever stood for or not. I simply say the following: - it is clearly set up as a vehicle for Will Smith (at that point riding the crest of his wave); - it is handsomely mounted; - it is over the top and, clearly, intentionally so; - it is mostly quite amusing; - it is full of action and decent effects; - the main characters are well drawn and likable.I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

Him and Will Smith really worked well together despite every one else saying they were both terrible.And the technology was spot on! Now, this is another point people did not seem to get. That type of technology existing back then is just impossible! It's a joke! And a damn, fine, entertaining joke at that! Salma Hayek plays a typical damsel in distress and Kenneth was spot on as Dr. Loveless and you could tell he was having fun with his villainous role!

The dancing and music was also a mark of genius with the addition of "Ole School and new school" was wonderful. Stevie Wonder, and the original "Wild Wild West Rap" incorporated with a new rap by Mr. Smith was genius. We are still continuing to watch The Wild Wild West on DVD repeatedly.So if the movie is not your cup of tea , try something else.Stop being a winer and get over it.

		<fullReview>Wild Wild West (1999) is an action western comedy American movie. The story is happened after the civil war, this movie talks about that the intelligence agent James west is a smart and suave romantic cowboy sheriff and Gordon is good at dressing and proficient in various organ, which they are following the order to arrest the ulterior motive strange Dr. Lefolisi. Lefolisi wants to use the strange giant mechanical spider to attempt to assassinate U.S President. At first West and Gordon dislike each other, but soon they become close co-operation and mutual trust. The two main characters after untold hardships, during the movie there has humor, romance, and many strange weapons and fight scenes, so the west and Gordon's mission is full of adventure and excitement. This movie is a classical American heroism movie. James west is traditional cowboy, but Gordon is a modern agent. The movie's background is after the civil war, everything is becoming new. The old and new, black people and white people, traditional and technology are striking contrast. In this movie we can see the special American west scenery. There has the high mountain, wide desert, sparsely wooded and desolate. The people who live in west, they are natural and gallant. James west is a classical example. He is strong; his body is full of muscle and power. He is good looking and romantic, he is so popular in girls but he is never stable. He is smart, brave and humor; he can complete any impossible mission by himself; his behavior looks crazy but every time he is lucky. Of course in this movie has a bad guy. At first bad guy is stronger than good people and always win. Bad guy often has so many men, and good guy has to fight with so many people. At last always good guy win. I like this movie, it is not only talk about hero and west, but also show the scenery at that time. On the movie has a train. This train is a clues runs through all story. In fact this train is a real antique train in the world.</fullReview>

It's one that would haunt me for the rest of my life if I were him. Granted, reading the script he was probably like "what the hell," but after the success of the trilogy and the 'blah' of Wild Wild West , he's probably upset and heartbroken. He's a very successful actor now, but imagine if he had chosen to do The Matrix instead. He would have perfected that part in ways that Keanu Reeves couldn't, the movie would have been that much better. Besides, the character of Neo would have just been much cooler considering Will Smith's and Keanu Reeves' places on the "cool scale."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this movie so bad. I was going to see it with a friend of mine who I don't see often. But this was so horrible. And I mean really, really horrible.First of all, I don't think the effects are all that great. I mean, sure, they're okay. But they weren't anything to write home about. And effects are never enough to carry a movie. The directors of this movie apparently didn't know this.The worst part about this movie is how incredibly mind-numbingly insipid it is. I was so bored out of my mind, I tore apart my soda cup to keep my brain from melting away. The script obviously was trying to appeal to the Intelligence Impaired, and those of us with an IQ were left bored to tears.I truly pity Kenneth Branagh &amp; Kevin Kline. Both are fine actors who will have to live with the shame of this movie forever. They did good jobs, I suppose, but how well can someone do when they are only seen from the torso up, as Branagh was? Kevin Kline was stuck with a character showing little to know development or depth, which is a shame. And I truly believe someday people will realize Will Smith is not a good actor. Attrative, yes. Good at fights and stunts, yes. A money-drawer, yes. But talented, no. Salma Hayek is a talented woman, but she too has a role with absolutely no depth. Seriously. We kept learning new things, including in the very last minute, which would completely alter her character. So don't even bother with this one, folks. Besides, you get the overall effect of the special effects from that terrible music video which is always on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay my quick review for this movieGood parts: The comedy in the movie was funny...well some of it was, I laughed my a** off at one scene and replayed it over and over again, some of the effects were also smart like how they had them coming back together when they had those magnetised things round their necks. The acting was great and some of the action was enjoyable alsoBad parts: The story is boring as hell and also most of the movie was just so cheesy that it made me sick. I fell asleep half way through it first time watching it, second time i actually managed to stay awake only because i wanted to see if the movie was worth at least an eight...i was wrong it got lower...will you normally impress me with your acting, but this no...Just...just no5/10</fullReview>
