		<shortDescription>Solid, Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Citizenfour was quite powerful as a humanizing portrayal of Snowden. I didn't learn anything new particularly about NSA programs, since I've been reading each story I come across, but the film quite effectively transported me into Snowden's hotel room in Hong Kong and into conversations with Snowden, Greenwald, Poitras and MacAskill. Snowden comes off as a completely responsible, quite sincere, thoughtful young man. He very clearly and explicitly says that he does not want to be the story, and one believes him. Whereas Assange can impress people as narcissistic and Bradley/Chelsea Manning's sexual confusion was only one of a number of facets which distracted from Cablegate, Snowden sounds like a young Ellsberg ? very intelligent and well-spoken.Poitras's style was interesting, I thought. The camera a number of times holds for lengthy periods on fairly static shots of architecture, which served to impress the viewer with the monolithic, pervasive nature of the NSA's networks. There's a long disorienting shot out the window of a train at night or going through a tunnel, which draws you into the dark network Snowden's revealing.The film successfully touches on a number of different aspects of the surveillance state, bringing in the idea that when we talk about "privacy" we're talking about security, about our constitutional right to freedom from unlawful search and seizure. I think this is a hard sell for too many viewers. I don't fault the film here. I saw it with a friend who was a few minutes late because she was watching the Giants' game. In discussing the movie afterward she questioned just how important some of the issues raised were. Greenwald and others speak passionately about the dangers of the surveillance state, but my date pointed out that she can't feel much fear that the NSA is going to be breaking down her door because of anything she's said on the phone or in e-mail. My own experience is that friends and colleagues on the one hand self-censor and don't mention politics, drugs, Bittorrent use, etc. in e-mail or social media for fear of the all-knowing eye, or on the other hand seem oblivious to any danger ? why worry about Google programmatically reading every single e-mail sent or received, if it means free e-mail and potentially more accurate search results when shopping? Snowden at one point convincingly says he doesn't think it is possible for anyone no matter how brilliant and educated to individually fight all the electronic surveillance systems in existence. We're told of the multitude of methods of surveillance and repeatedly shown NSA officials blatantly lying to Congress about their existence. The lack of accountability for this last has been personally troubling to me ? I remember Watergate and Iran-Contra ? how is it that the heads of the NSA can with impunity flat out lie to Congress about spying on American citizens? What will viewers come away with when walking out of the theater after Citizenfour? I'm wondering how many will see it as a call to action, and how many as a well-executed depiction of Edward Snowden's experience, which may not be seen as intersecting our own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important documentary of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I write this, a few days after the film's release, so far only three users have posted reviews about it on IMDb. Given that the film ends with the revelation that 1,200,000 people are on the US government's watchlist of people under surveillance, if you're contemplating adding a positive review, the first question that you have to ask yourself is: will this make me number 1,200,001? I've followed the media stories detailing the contents of the documents Snowden leaked, so that part of the film wasn't new to me, and in fact I felt some of Snowden's more serious disclosures were underexplored in the film, maybe because of their somewhat technical nature. If you're looking for a documentary that lays out in detail all the ins and outs of what the NSA is up to, this isn't it. The main strength of the film lies in its portrait of Snowden as a person. The filmmaker and other journalists basically meet Snowden in person for the first time with cameras running, and it's fascinating to watch them getting to know one another in such a highly charged, high stakes situation. Snowden is very articulate and precise, and obviously motivated by a very moral sense of right and wrong, in much the same way as Daniel Ellsberg. Whether or not you agree with Snowden, the film definitely undercuts criticism of him as being unpatriotic or mercenary. The documentary works well as an introduction to the Snowden story for those only casually aware of it, and also as a tense real world political thriller, sort of like Three Days Of The Condor come to life, but without the gunmen and Faye Dunaway. All in all, a very important film that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizenfour Scores a 10If you never want to see a bad film in the theater again, I suggest you limit your viewing to documentaries. They are far better on average than fictional fare. Case in point: "Citizenfour." "Citizenfour" tells the story of Edward Snowden's leak of NSA documents. Those documents reveal how our government, with the cooperation of major telecom and internet companies, has been surveilling our electronic communications. Moreover, our government has been spying on electronic communications around the world. You might ask, "Haven't they been doing this for years?" Yes, they have, but that was mainly (not exclusively, unfortunately) when there was probably cause, a warrant, or a history of criminal activity of the target. They have now been looking at everyone's communications without cause, and this can have a chilling effect on private communications and thought, journalism and our right to petition the government. "Citizenfour" hits all the marks of a good documentary: it is topical, relevant, well organized and thought provoking. It is quietly dramatic and not overblown. In fact, the director could have manufactured more drama out of the subject through editing and dramatic music if desired. The restraint serves the film well. Filmmaker Laura Poitras interviews Edward Snowden from the time he leaves his job at Booz Allen as an NSA analyst to leak the famous NSA documents that reports the spying programs up to the time his identity as the NSA whistle-blower is revealed. I thought I knew enough about this case, that there was no need to see this movie. I was wrong. Throughout the film, we see Snowden explain his decision making process, and what we see is revelatory. If people thought that Snowden was in it for fame or attention, watching this film will change that perception. Snowden was dismayed at the government surveillance of ordinary citizens and made a choice to leak that information. He did not name names and as far as he is concerned, did not reveal any information vital to U.S. security. Heads of the NSA and other security agencies are shown in the film denying the existence of the surveillance program to Congress and on news programs. Other whistle-blowers or people investigating the program are interviewed or shown testifying such as former NSA intelligence agent William Binney. As the movie unfolds, so do the revelations of the extent of the spying program as it did in the London Guardian and other media outlets. First, U.S. domestic spying was revealed, then international spying, then spying on officials in other countries, even German Chancellor Merkel. Suffice to say, I knew some about the program but not the extent and the manner in which it unfolded. What the film did was allow Snowden and Greenwald to take control of their own narrative, wrest it away from the mainstream media and government propaganda machine. Some of the shots in the movie start out of focus because Poitras started filming when something important was being said and to cut the takes for focus issues would have been unnecessary. Besides, the focusing was metaphorical of the main characters', Snowden and Greenwald, attempt to get a focus on the issues. We are brought along in this process. More effects and camera tricks could have been used to enhance the drama in the film, but the director wisely made a choice to focus on the content and characters. "Citizenfour", unlike all the overly dramatic movies from Hollywood, is a case of substance over style. Rating: Pay Full Price, see it twiceThere is little to complain about in the film other than I wanted more. The cinematography is not award winning, but it's exactly what the film needed. The timing in the film and editing were excellent. The director's choices were precisely what this story required. Peace, Tex Shelters</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward Snowden went from obscurity to fame overnight when he blew the whistle on the NSA's massive espionage program in June 2013. Litigator-turned-reporter Glenn Greenwald got recognized as the person helping Snowden expose the story, along with The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill and The Washington Post's Barton Gellman. But while the world saw the footage of Snowden speaking in the hotel room in Hong Kong, there was another person in the room with him, Greenwald and MacAskill: Laura Poitras, who filmed the interview. "Citizenfour" (the name that Snowden used when he contacted Poitras) tells the story of the interview and international reaction to Snowden's revelations.It took guts to film and release this documentary. I think that in the end, the main outcome of Snowden's revelations is that the US's and UK's reputations are ruined. The documentary includes footage of hearings on the surveillance in Brazil (whose president was a victim of the surveillance) and Belgium (the seat of the European Union, whose heads of state were victims). I suspect that the peoples of Eastern Europe are the most befuddled by the revelations. For years under the Soviet occupation they looked to the US as a beacon of freedom, and now they see that the US is no different from the USSR. The British government, meanwhile, comes across as a US proxy in Europe."Citizenfour" is a documentary that not only deserves a lot of recognition, but should spark more discussion about the surveillance apparatus. As for Edward Snowden, he remains in political asylum in Russia, and his partner Lindsay Mills has joined him there. Oliver Stone is now making a movie about his revelations. In the meantime, I recommend the documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind." Ed Snowden Welcome to a real-time documentary that doesn't have a political agenda yet covers the most controversial and important whistle blowing in this century. Edward Snowden disclosed extensive information mining of US citizens by NSA and other agencies. Laura Poitras's thrilling but sometimes slow documentary takes us to Hong Kong to witness Snowden's alarming the world about the US spying on its citizens and world leaders among others.Citizenfour (the handle Snowden used when communicating) keeps the audience front row and center as Snowden makes contact with director Laura Poitras to arrange footage of his process, and most importantly with reporter Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian to write about this game-changing event. Neither is hesitant to take on the story, possibly because of its incendiary nature and the honesty of the whistleblower.This story is like a great Jason Bourne spy story (without the glamour and tensions) pitting former intelligence operative Snowden against the great American political and media machines. In the outside world, German chancellor Angela Merkel expressed shock that the US was monitoring her cell phone conversations.Poitras smartly includes President Obama condemning Snowden as unpatriotic and a danger to the American people, an argument going on even as you read this review. Curiously, the documentary makes no argument and goes easy on the suspense, making significant historical cinema but not gripping drama.The so far unanswerable question is whether he's a hero or a traitor. The Snowden exposed to the ever present harsh light of camera and mics seems completely at peace with himself as he considers the rough life he has elected as a whistleblower. Indeed we are fortunate to see him at the most stressful point in his life being cool and level-headed. While Poitras makes sure we get to know him intimately, she never loses sight of the fact that this doc is about government spying.Citizenfour is a fascinating, risky, and brave film for everyone who is interested in the challenges of truth telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Walk a Mile in his Shoes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Edward Snowden. You know the name and you know the story. Hero of the People or Enemy of the State? Ultimate Patriot or a double-spy for the Russians? Protected as a Whistle-Blower or Guilty of Treason? Chances are you long ago made up your mind on how you view Ed (his stated name preference). In January 2013, Snowden contacted documentarian Laura Poitras via an anonymous email name "Citizenfour". By June, the two were meeting in a Hong Kong hotel along with journalist Glenn Greenwald. What follows is a mesmerizing look at the actual footage shot of Greenwald interviewing Snowden. This is Ed Snowden before the media storm. This is Ed Snowden continually proclaiming that he is not the story, and he is trusting Greenwald to determine what documents are fit for public release. He voices concern about jeopardizing national security, while at the same time being adamant about exposing the immense and widespread governmental tracking of digital movements by millions of people ? most with no known ties to terrorism.The timeline is public record, so the core of the film is really an intimate look at the man who, acutely aware of the coming fallout, proceeded with pulling the curtain back on NSA actions that he deemed inappropriate. Ms. Poitras structures the film as a thriller, and it will certainly cause tension in every viewer. We can't help but put ourselves in Snowden's shoes. Would we feel the need to go public with proof? Who would we tell? How would we tell them? Would we be willing to release our name, knowing it could put everyone we love in danger? Would we be prepared to watch our President publicly call us out as unpatriotic and a danger to the nation? These questions are impossible for us to answer, but add weight to the scenes of Snowden answering Greenwald's questions while Ms. Poitras works the camera.One of the more interesting points made in the movie is that what we once termed individual freedom and liberties, is now couched as privacy. We have come to expect our privacy, and certainly don't appreciate our government digging through our emails, search history, texts and phone calls. But how to balance the individual "right" to privacy with the government's need to collect intelligence in the name of national security? That's the key question, and one with no clear answer.Regardless of your opinion on Snowden and his actions, the film presents him as an idealist believing he is doing the right thing. Most of this occurs before the media firestorm, but we do see the anticipated fallout. Once Snowden goes into hiding, we witness Greenwald becoming the face and voice of the cause. He is a talented journalist and exceptional speaker, and doesn't back down from the reaction of those who stand accused. The film allows us to take notice of the personal attacks on Snowden as an attempt discredit his documentation. Making Snowden the story distracted the media and the general public from the real issue. It's a fascinating film that will surely make you uncomfortable and cause re-evaluation of the chain of events. You may not change your mind, but you will most certainly have a better understanding of the human side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching history unfold before our eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that, in today's world, telling the truth may set you free, but it can also make you an inmate or a corpse. Activist folk singer Joan Baez, however, reminds us that, "Courage has to do with being afraid and doing what you have to do anyway." It is a fitting description of whistleblower Edward Snowden, whose story is told by the Oscar-nominated American filmmaker Laura Poitras (My Country, My Country) in her intimate and intense documentary Citizenfour. Snowden, a 29-year-old former NSA contractor and intelligence analyst, aware of the serious personal and legal consequences, nevertheless exposed the fact that the government, in the name of fighting terrorism, was spying on all American citizens and those of other countries, in every area of their lives, whether they were suspected of wrongdoing or not.According to Snowden, he was able to access anyone's records, bypassing codes, passwords and encryptions and said, "We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind." As the film begins, Poitras tells us in voice-over that, when she was working on a film about the dismantling of personal freedoms after the terrorist attack on 9/11, she began to receive encrypted e-mails with the codename of Citizenfour, revealing the desire to come forward with startling information about government surveillance. One of the e-mails told her that "In the end, if you publish the source material, I will likely be immediately implicated. I ask only that you ensure that this information makes it home to the American public." The film almost exclusively relies on edited conversations, mainly between Snowden and author and journalist Glenn Greenwald interspersed with TV news reports, courtroom trials, and Senate hearings where officials are shown lying at hearings about the government's role in data collection. It does not pretend to be objective and there is no debate about any of the issues brought up in the film or the efficacy of Snowden's actions. It is his story, told from his point of view. Interviewed by Poitras (who is unseen), Greenwald, at the time working for the Guardian, and reporter Ewen MacAskill in a room at the Mira Hotel in Hong Kong where Snowden remained in seclusion for eight days, the heretofore unknown whistleblower reveals his identity for the first time saying that he wants to come out publicly as the source of the information, to show the NSA "I'm not going to let you bully me into silence, like you have everyone else." Snowden says that he made the decision to come forward because he feels there's a great threat to the future of American free speech. "The elected and the electorate," he says, have become "the ruler and the ruled." Though he says repeatedly that he is not the issue and his personality should not deflect attention from the material disclosed, the human angle nonetheless becomes an important part of the film and we have an opportunity to assess the personality and character of man who has already played an important role in history. Through all of the discussion of his methods and the nature of the material he revealed, Snowden presents his case in an eloquent manner, remaining calm and centered, saying that he anticipated the consequences and is prepared for them.One of the few times he shows emotion is when talking about the government's interrogation of his girlfriend who, he says, knows nothing about his activities. The tension is palpable, however, and the film takes on aspects of a spy thriller when, after the information has gone public, everyone in the hotel room reacts with paranoia to the fire alarm testing going on in the hotel. Communication, however, eventually reverts to coded e-mails which Poitras shows on the screen when Snowden seeks asylum in Moscow. Though it reveals no new information that hasn't already been reported all over the world during the past eighteen months, Citizenfour is fascinating to observe as history unfolds before our eyes, offering the look and feel of immediacy, not that of a historical retrospective.While it has taken several years, the warning message in Al Gore's 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth on the potentially disastrous results of climate change seems at long last to be getting through, though even now, it may be too little, too late. When it comes to our right to privacy in today's wired world, however, the prospects are not as bright. Though perhaps preaching to the choir, the film is an important reminder that in the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., "Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter," or those of abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass who said, "Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will." This film begins to crystallize that demand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Single-Most Groundbreaking Documentary I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most important film you will see all year - possibly ever - is "Citizenfour". This is the single-most groundbreaking documentary I've ever laid eyes on, surpassing some of Michael Moore's greatest works. The amount of people that will be affected due to the information in this film is staggering. Every American owes it to themselves to see this. It will undoubtedly change the way you operate and think in more ways than one.As you may already know, the film centers around Edward Snowden, the much-talked about 'whistleblower' that leaked an enormous amount of top secret information concerning the National Security Agency. It revealed the many ways that the NSA was spying on billions of people, creating a huge political conversation. However, "Citizenfour" in no way participates in that conversation. It doesn't try to debate whether it was right or wrong for them to do that, it leaves all of that up to its subject. That's one of the countless reasons why it succeeds. It isn't a documentary that needs a ton of flare, it's actually quite the opposite. It states the facts, lets us decide how we feel about it, and all in the most simplistic and brilliant manner.The majority of it takes place in one hotel room where Laura Poitras (the director of the film) and Glenn Greenwald (the first journalist to leak the story) listen to everything Snowden has to say. We watch them go over the program files and documents that serve as the evidence of what the NSA has done - scenes that include astounding stats and figures - those being some of the most powerful moments I've ever witnessed. It's a gut-punch of a movie, but one that's undeniably needed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very interesting documentary - both thought and discussion provoking!Although it didn't provide very much 'new' information to those already familiar with the events of last year (other than the revelation about a second whistle-blower at the end), this documentary puts together many elements previously made public (i.e. article releases, TV interviews, legal and political hearings etc.) in a contiguous time-frame, so that anyone not immediately familiar with the subject matter could fully understand both the time-line of events and the impact of 'Snowdengate'.Following the screening this evening a Q &amp; A took place with the Director Laura Poitras joining via Skype. Unfortunately the connection dropped out several times (consipiracy theorists of the world unite) but it was a useful session nonetheless! I would definitely recommend this movie/documentary, whether you agree or disagree with Snowden's actions and the subsequent consequences of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Oh what joy, in the open air freely to breathe again!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Citizenfour begins in a tunnel with dim overhead tubing. The scene is disorienting for we don't know exactly where we are.A.O. Scott of the Times suggests that Laura Poitras' tightly edited documentary might presage a "dystopian allegory." It might also represent a birth canal through a new born will emerge.And then suddenly bright sunshine bursts into view. For, the exciting first scenes of Citizenfour promises the same exhilaration of freedom that Beethoven's opera Fidelio's "Prisoners Chorus" as prisoners emerge from the bowels of prison, into the light of day and gleefully sing "Oh what joy, in the open air freely to breathe again!" Monday, June 3, 2013 is the day the world of the National Security Council (and other intelligence agencies) secrecy metaphorically died as Edward Snowden let loose on the world the dirty little secrets that the US government, through the abuse of "spyware" was keeping tabs globally of the private thoughts of nearly everyone, regardless of caste or class. Dramatically, Poitras builds tension, as a voice off the screen, muted in tone and pitch?the better to create a sense of balance, in a documentary that has already been attacked for being partisan?through the use of the first e-mails Snowden began contact with her, as the text flashes in black and write across the screen in an old fashioned Hollywood spy caper.More, she gives immediate substance to her viewers of what encryption is o outwit government hackers as in the following frames messages are quickly made readable in standard English. Not only that, this cinematic technique provides something graspable to the average Joe or Jane of, perhaps, cryptography and mega-data that are used daily in print or on television with endless repetition that might simply remains meaningless. So, Citizenfour also seeks to show the ordinary citizen the means of government intercepting Internet, tapping the telephone, sweeping billions of personal messages a day out of the public's view and behind closed doors.Even through Snowden's exposure of abuses of "powers that be, with the connivance of corporations continue to disregard the constitutional and legal safeguards that protect US citizens from arbitrary rule.Citizenfour is a film about the whistle blower Edward Snowden. Although we might think we know the man, Poitras' documentary introduces to Snowden in the flesh: a man who has risked his life and freedom to expose the American government's perversion of its democratic vocation and of conspicuous misuse of power. He comes across as a thoughtful young man, then 29, of substance, well centered and at peace with himself.For eight days in Snowden's room in Hong Kong's Mira Hotel, Poitras filmed the conversations he had with Glenn Greenwald and the Guardian's defense and intelligence correspondent Ewan MacAskill patiently answering questions and with the patience of a teacher explaining the ins and outs of the deceitful spying that the NSA with the cooperation of friendly governments.Her camera captured the former Booz Allen analyst on loan to the NSA who had no intentions of hiding his identity. Worried about Washington's vendetta to use the 1917Espionnage Act against whistleblowers exposing government malfeasance, Snowden left the US to sound the alarm of the oppressive control of the American spy agencies on the lives of ordinary citizens.And if Snowden is crystal clear of anything, he is careful not to unnecessarily outing operatives, nor exposing them to bodily harm."Pin the target on my back," "nail me to the Cross," he says to Poitras, as he openly tells her that he is assuming full responsibility for leaking highly classified documents, not unlike the pope announcing urbi ed orbi his message od good will on New Year's.Citizenfour, a last minute addition, kicked off the 2014 New York International Film Festival, as a character study of Edward Snowden, that Festival director called "icily chilling." For Stewart Klawans, Citizenfour is a "character necessary character study," to counter the campaign "to distract people from the substance of Snowden's revelations that predictably, entailed an effort to disparage him as a person."And the film has become the object of attacking a person's character or motivations rather than a reasoned argument that Poitras' film presents. Simply look no further than Citizenfour's cast of characters?Snowden, Greenwald, Poitras, William Binney, Julian Assange, Jeremy Scahill and Macaskill and The Guardian?all whistle blowers who have not shied away from exposing government and private industry deceptions and corruption.So far, it looks as though Citizenfour is a strong contender for an Oscar in the best documentary category. Still, the spotlight is not on Snowden but MacArthur genius winner, George Polk and Pulitzer Prize recipient Poitras.Her talent is obvious, so the coverage has hardly a hint of faint praise. Nonetheless, critics on Slate and Daily Beast see the chinks in her cinematic armor, and even The New Yorker's George Packer remains skeptical of what they see as Poitras' "advocacy journalism," riddled with simplification and broad generalizations.She has become the handy scapegoat since Snowden is out of government's harm's way, living in perfect domesticity in Moscow, with his longtime companion, whom he thought he lost forever.Although she like Greenwald and nameless millions if not billions will forever be under permanent US surveillance, Citizenfour is a strong antidote to our government's campaign to besmirch Snowden, Poitras and company who performed the daring act, in the case of unfettered US spying to say "the emperor is wearing no clothes." The strength of Poitras documentary lies in honesty and her sense of moderation and fair play: moral goodness that the talking heads will continue to attack and demean. And try as they might, thanks to Snowden the cat is out of the bag on the NSA. And yet, alas, the spying goes on., without a vigorous citizen countervailing force to blunt our government's abuse of power and rendering democracy a hollow shell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Laura Poitras has made an interesting and eye opening documentary called "Citizenfour" which showcases the story and the actual interviews in Hong Kong of whistle blower Edward Snowden. Everyone remembers in the news the story of the NSA scandal it became clear to everyone that the federal government was doing privacy invasion on nearly all citizens of the united states. I know you feel the same way it's clear that a lot of times you hear your phone and cell calls monitored and true at work, when you shop, or go to the bank or even drive thru a traffic red light your on camera! Simple no one has privacy in the world, true as mentioned in the film 911 changed a lot of things still the NSA in my opinion has took it to far with their worldwide programs with the spying on emails and the data collection that is sold to other agency types it's like the feds know where you go everything you do and who you see! It's sad that we as citizens have to give up our privacy because of terror of other nations. Still it's an ever lasting issue really see this documentary it's revealing, provocative, educational, and blunt as it proves we as citizens don't have any privacy when it comes to freedom as your calls, emails, viewing choices, travels, and data is all looked at and matched it's time we had more people like Edward Snowden as a whistle blower can be a hero.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really appreciate what Snowden did and this film only raises my level of gratitude because it shows the man as well as the information he disclosed. Given this and the risk a filmmaker takes when recording a sensitive subject like this, I do think that the makers of Citizenfour should be praised.However, once you start watching it you realize that it is made from the same mold that other revelatory, controversial or conspiracist documentaries are made from. The Oscar is not for the quality of the film as it is for the subject. And, assuming that you are informed about the case - I still get the shivers when I see that most people I meet don't even know who Snowden is, you might find it difficult to understand why this movie is better than others, cinematically speaking.Also, I feel that the film was way too focused on the journalistic process and too little on the actual meaning of the information or the aftermath of the disclosures. It is, actually, a human angle story more than a documentary about the biggest intelligence reveal of the last century. While not a bad thing, it is ironically what Snowden repeatedly said he does not want: to be the center of the story.One gets to feel the alienation and pervasive angst that Snowden felt, even if this is sometimes done through cheap soundtrack tricks. One sees a smiling 29 year old become burdened more and more as time goes by. Less smiling, more dark patches under the eyes, more bewildered looks. And this while staying in hotels and having communication with people that relay his information and while being protected by a nation state. It is unimaginable what a normal person, without this safety net, would feel.Bottom line: certainly worth watching, not so sure about the Oscar thing, but as long as that raises awareness of the subject matter, it is also worthy.</fullReview>

Its probably the same half who believe that the US spying apparatus exists to keep America safe. Has it ever worked? Yes? Where was it on 9/11 &amp; Boston? If Snowden is a traitor, he's a traitor to the corrupt elite!_____ How America Competes _____ They cheat! The global spying network 'Spynet' is a plaything of the elite! Their thinking is, why not, what's the use of power if you don't abuse it! Greenwald makes it patently clear to a Brazilian audience that their leaders are being spied upon by America to gain a competitive advantage. This is standard US policy against every competing country, economy, key politician, senior diplomat, and wealthy corporation! _____ Spynet is Control _____ Snowden makes the case that Spynet exists as a 'method of control', to force people to self-censor. At the start we see how Spynet can be used to quell protesters and activists, or any group that would dare challenge authority._____ Terrorists vs. Politicians _____ Will the real fanatics please stand up? We're America, we're the best, we only sing one song: terrorism, terrorism terrorism. After hearing this for a while it starts to sound like a mantra, almost like a fanatical religious mantra, by power-hungry elites obsessed with control and worshiping at the Temple-of-Technology. Its nearly as fanatical as the terrorists they 'claim' to be hunting. But both groups are more alike than they realize, because they care little for their own people! They harm the vulnerable and ignore real issues like poverty and lack of education!_____ Spynet &amp; Fighting Crime _____ What is America doing to reduce crime in local cities? Is more spent on the Military Industrial Complex or on educational programs for the poor? It costs a lot to run Spynet. If those in power cared, I mean really cared about the lives of ordinary Americans, wouldn't they spend NSA / Military cost-center billions on making America's cities safer? _____ How America Cares About Its Sheeple _____ Ask yourself how many Americans die in shootings every year versus how many die at the hands of terrorists? Then ask, how much does it cost to fight terrorism? ... Do the numbers stack up? You'll never see this mentioned on TV, because big media is complicit in the debate. After years of consolidation of the industry, and ownership by defense contractors, expect nothing more than more Monday-Night football. _____ The Americans America Really Cares About _____ If we ever needed more proof that the American elite care little for ordinary Americans, look at how their attention is always focused on boosting the balance sheets of defense corporations, military contractors and big energy companies. Perhaps it was always like this, maybe its just more obvious now, with lobbyists everywhere and corporations buying votes and politicians in public. _____ A handful of people changed the world _____ The thing to take away from the documentary is how a handful of brave people worked together to shaft the political elite for a brief moment. Has anything changed since? The 'five eyes' continue to steamroll over our privacy as before. The only ones hurting a little are the complicit Cloud corporations like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo etc._____ Humans &amp; the Internet of Things (IoT) _____ Snowden helped, but the real change must come from us. There's a word to describe all the devices connected to the internet i.e. Smartphones, TV's. Fridges, Smoke Alarms, Home camera security systems. Its called the internet of Things (IoT). Its trivial to use the data gleaned from IoT to spy on all of us. But the funny thing is, its not the devices themselves that are the Internet of Things, its us, the people, that are voluntarily hooking ourselves into Spynet. Drop Facebook. Use DuckDuckGo, not Google! Next time you buy a TV, buy a basic model with a classy screen, not a Smart-TV! Disable Location Services on your Smartphone, and watch what apps you use!_____ America, the home of the brave _____ The worst part about America is that this system of monitoring will never be questioned. It takes real heroes for that. If this was Iceland they'd have jailed the corrupt elite for illegal spying, just as they did with their crooked bankers!... Why were they the only brave &amp; free country?_____ Snowden is doubly cool _____ How Snowden kept his cool during the early days while also keeping his ego in check is astonishing. He appears to have the calmness of a bomb disposal expert like the character in 'The Hurt Locker'! He's more than an American hero, he's a world hero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Man Without a Country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is recommended.Traitor or hero? Idealist or cynic? Whistleblower or pawn? No matter one's opinions, Edward Snowden remains a fascinating person and this documentary analyzes his actions and motives. The filmmakers met him at the outset of his controversial decision to leak pertinent and highly classified information to the world about the underhanded dealings of the National Security Agency under the guise of homeland protection.Laura Poitras, who was directly contacted with some encrypted e-mails from Edward Snowden, under the alias of citizenfour, directs this documentary as it follows his rise and fall as those stolen NSA documents are leaked to the public. These copies expose the international spying of thousands of American citizens and other foreign nationals. Filmed in Hong Kong, prior to his exile to Russia, Citizenfour documents Snowden as he becomes a man without a country. Articulate and appearing sincere, one senses his moralistic stance and his principles, but also his naivety when dealing with ruthless and powerful forces.Poitras' film is a series of perfectly timed moments of news-in-the-making as she captures historic footage of the beginnings of a political bombshell that will escalate into an international scandal of epic proportions. The filmmaker develops a rapport and admiration with Snowden, which tends to bias her documentary, as she takes aim at the governmental spin to discredit him.Nevertheless, what gives Citizenfour its real impact is its behind-the-scenes look at the misconduct and cover-ups of a nation, involving espionage wrongdoing by the American government and the unethical invasion of privacy of its people, via their phone and internet connections.The film is extremely well made but lacking in innovative editing or artful photography. It's purely interview after interview, one talking head-shot after the next. The lengthy interviews between Snowden and Glenn Greenwald, the investigative reporter who broke the story, make up most of the film. But these sections are in need of some judicious editing as they go on far too long, even if they are historically significance moments in time. Citizenfour is an important film about important issues. Its subject matter deals with larger issues of sacrifice, patriotism, and paranoia. A flip of the coin and one can see the film as sheer propaganda, intense political thriller, or a passionate film about our basic civil rights. It raises questions about our essential loss of freedom and our need for bigger and better surveillance tactics to fight terrorism and preserve homeland security at any costs. Citizenfour remains a thought-provoking treatise on our politics post 9/11 and the fallout of one man's actions to make a change.

		<shortDescription>Snowden, the man who cried wolf? Hero or...something else?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amidst the ho-hum rhythm of the big holiday blockbusters endlessly marching to the drumbeat of massive audiences (myself included)sits this year's most important movie, and I daresay of many, many years...that movie is "Citizenfour"(it being Edward Snowden's on-line alias).Though the analogy to George Orwell's bone-chilling novel, his piece de resistance on oppression and authoritarianism, "1984", has already been made ad nauseam, I would not exaggerate that after seeing this movie, you might just end up feeling as if you already inhabit the dreadful world soo vividly and painstakingly depicted by Orwell, miserable by miserable detail. I know I did once I walked out of the movie theatre. That was until my brain and sense of self was once again taken prisoner and atrophied by the banalities of daily life, which consume soo much of our personal existence these days. Mea culpa. While, given its quite widespread effect and reach, the story and name of Edward Snowden are familiar or even well known to the public at large (or so we think), "Citizenfour" tells the tense and uneasy story of Edward Snowden from his point of view and in his own words, as captured and related by filmmaker Laura Poitras, over the span of a few fascinating days spent in a hotel room in Hong Kong in 2013. Ms. Poitras, who herself felt the heat of being associated with this project, in fact becomes the eye through which we view this entire film unfolding.While Poitras paints the cinematic portrait of Snowden, journalist Glenn Greenwald (also personally affected by his association with Snowden) who also features quite prominently in the movie, became the go-to person who gave form and shape to Snowden's quest, and for all intents and purposes was his voice, the one who amplified the entirety of Snowden's revelations.To say that this movie is relevant and important, would do a disservice to this movie and all the parties involved. It is not only that, beyond the shadow of a doubt, but it is also supremely urgent and needed for all of us as a cautionary tale for ourselves, a highlighted message towards our own sense of self, our identities and the sum parts which combine to form us as individual human beings worthy of a dignified existence punctuated by liberty and freedom.In this Age Of Information of ours, it is mind boggling how nonchalant we seem to be going on about our privacy and our self-worth as fully thinking rational beings, and how easily we surrender our essence, our identity be it flesh-and-bone or digital, to the vague powers that be reigning over us, powers whom we seldomly recognize, define or have an input on the control and influence they exercise over our lives. Be it the NSA, the CIA, the military-industrial complex, or whatever other format you may want to consider, make no mistake the bogeyman is real, not some imagined threat in a science-fiction movie, more akin to a fully realized nightmare.The movie plays out as heartbreaking and sad as it does relevant, scary and vividly engrossing. It shows a man, his beliefs, warts and all, shortcomings and positives, pluses and minuses and how his actions have played out in our increasingly cluttered and messy world, one where we can barely recognize ourselves and our self-worth.While Snowden's narrative has been largely dictated, made-up and written up by countless incarnations of the media, pundits, official mouthpieces, bloggers and so-called experts, I would urge people to go and see this movie for themselves, and make up their own minds as to whether they think Edward Snowden is a hero or a villain, a brave soul or a miserable coward. Think for yourselves, make up your own minds and don't let others dictate what you should think or do.Do not lose yourselves, which I think in the end is the point this documentary is trying to make.Personally I think that Snowden is and will be an unsung hero. I think that many years from now, the generations who will come after us will look back upon the moment when he rang the alarm bell on what was happening to our world, but we were too busy, too deaf and too self-absorbed to pay any real attention..."Is there something different here in the very nature of reality? Or is it that something violently new is about to happen..." William Gibson - "Idoru"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete the news story by adding depth to the main character SNOWDEN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doesn't disappoint, but I did come out of the cinema with a heavy heart. Contrary to popular expectations, the documentary does not elaborate on the illegal surveillance acts, but focuses on Edward Snowden the person. (Quite ironic as Snowden repeatedly said in the movie that he is "not the story") Based on his well-articulated presentation and some candid camera-work by the director, Snowden's selfless motive is on clear display throughout the movie. The film also captures some tense moments during the days when Snowden was stuck in HK, which we have not seen on news interviews before. The dialogue between him and Glenn Greenward when he decided that he wasn't "fucking hiding" from the government was revelating.One has to think about how governments around the world continue to take away our privacy in the name of security. To manage by fear is nothing new. One has to decide whether we should willingly give up our, what I call, "freedom of contemplation" so easily over some exaggerated risks. Not to mention, as it turns out, most of the surveillance were used for state or commercial espionage.And even if it is done genuinely for security reason, the governments should follow the rule of law, or engage the public to change the law, instead of blatantly breaking the law and lie to the people. Having a so called "noble intention" is not good enough to break the law - no one has the right to decide what is good and what is not for others.For details on the illegal surveillance acts, watch the documentary made by the PBS back in May.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surveillance Creep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Laws written by cats have a way of adapting when the mice figure out a workaround. Sneak cameras into factory farms and you may get public outrage, grass-roots momentum or the passage of more humane laws. Then again, you might get laws that outlaw undercover journalism or redefine it as 'domestic terrorism'. Only mice have to obey the law. The cats? They can take it or leave it." - Peter WattsA documentary by Laura Poitras, "Citizenfour" revolves around Edward Snowden, a former CIA system's administrator who blew the lid on a global spy-network run primarily by the United States' National Security Agency. Designed for global surveillance, this clandestine network intercepts mountains of data, recording most global internet and telecommunications traffic, as well as international traffic flowing via undersea fibre optic cables. All superpowers throughout history have spied on their populaces and neighbours, but none were able to cook up anything as insidious as the NSA. Email records, telephone conversations, shopping records, medical records, banking records, internet records, text messages, digital profiles...virtually everything with a digital or electromagnetic footprint is automatically gobbled up by this network. Capable of simultaneously recording and storing every phone-call occurring within entire continents, this network extends across the planet, gathering data and meta-data on millions of ordinary people around the world. It also tracks cellphone locations, can hack cellphone conversations, and is capable of hacking its way into most encrypted consumer products. Such data mining occurs thanks to NSA alliances with major companies (Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Youtube, AOL, Skype etc) and major countries (Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and Israel). The NSA also spies on and collects data stored within the data centres of major corporations, giving it access to the daily habits, thoughts, words and actions of billions. Currently this spy-network has numerous ancillary branches (PRISM, Tempora, Stellar Wind, Dishfire, MUSCULAR, Project 6, Stateroom, ECHELON, CO-TRAVELER), most of which have changed their names or expanded further since Snowden's 2013 revelations. Thus far, such acts of "warrantless surveillance" have not been legally challenged or meaningfully reformed. Indeed, this spy-network has only gotten larger. The NSA has defended its networks, stating that it "stops terrorists", but revelation after revelation has shown that they have no impact on terrorism, and are primarily used to spy on civilians, political activists, diplomats, commercial entities, environmental groups, corporations and global policy makers. The NSA, in short, is in the business of economic espionage, protecting Western mega-corporate, mega-trade and mega-banking interests. "The police are the right arm of corporate power," Jack London wrote in 1902; the NSA now functions the same way. Consider, for example, project OLYMPIA, which exclusively spies on Brazil's ministry of mining and energy. Even when NSA intel is used in "warzones" to kill "terrorists" ("We kill people based on meta-data." - Michael Hayden, NSA director), such extra-legal killings are "validated" via "inference" not "proof".Stylistically, "Citizenfour" recalls the paranoid, conspiracy thrillers of the 1970s. It's also unique in the way it captures history, the documentary simply watching as Snowden locks himself in a hotel room and begins leaking information to journalists. These scenes are quiet, intimate, and creepily banal, like being in Gandhi's bedroom the day he decided to take on the largest Empire in the world. Elsewhere director Laura Poitras captures Snowden's naivety, intelligence, strength and fragility, as well as the faint traces of doubt that periodically wash across his face. Today, nobody cares that global surveillance has effectively inverted the law (everyone is now assumed to be guilty). Populaces have reached a state of impotency, apathy and disinterest. "If you're not doing anything wrong, why should you worry?" is itself the prevailing attitude of world leaders, their words echoing the words Hermann Goring used to defend Nazi surveillance policies half a century earlier ("little fish have nothing to fear"). But anyone familiar with history should be worried. For most of the last century, US intelligence has been at war with civil rights activists, minorities, workers and student activists, killing, destroying careers, ruining innocent lives and manipulating both the media and political process. These networks cause worse damage abroad, responsible - directly and indirectly - for countless millions of deaths. Sadly, the last time NSA spying programs (the SHAMROCK and MINARET leaks of the 1970s) were revealed, the political reforms that followed turned out to be far worse than what we had before (the secret FISA courts). Will history repeat itself?"We are building the largest weapon for the oppression of mankind," Snowden says in "Citizenfour", before hinting that these networks should be feared primarily because they allow for the controlling of information. Historically, all social progress has been made by the ability to talk, think, hide, break the law and oppose the ruling ideology. But the NSA's networks allow for the policing of thought, information and the pinpoint crushing of dissent (already the US military is running thousands of sock-puppets on internet forums, so as to steer conversations); keep the masses distracted, on script and consuming. Unsurprisingly, Snowden leaked his material to the Guardian newspaper, the last mainstream left-wing newspaper in the United Kingdom, and a woman (Laura Poitras) with radical credentials. Also present is journalist Glenn Greenwald, who is revealed to be homosexual. Greenwald's presence recalls, not only transgender whistle-blower Bradley Manning, but the many whistleblowers/defectors of the 1970s, whom the CIA and NSA attempted to slander with the label of "homosexual" (they were all heterosexual). Proudly seeing itself as a giant cauldron of masculinity, the US military has long deemed everything opposing it to be "soft", "impure" and "feminine". Today, in our more politically correct world, the US military has changed its stance. Orwell writ large, Western warriors are now "feminine", "caring", "soft" and "compassionate", killing you gently in the name of love. How can you oppose monsters so enlightened? 8.9/10 ? See "The War You Don't See" (2011).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This documentary has it all. The narrative is compelling, but honest to the reality it portrays. The work on the documentary began before the Snowden files started leaking, and it gives you an unprecedented look into how it all came about. It gives you an understanding of who Edward Snowden is and why he did what he did. He was not just some guy who stumbled over something he realized that someone else might find useful. He knew exactly what he had, and what to do about it.And not only this: The documentary manages to convey the significance of the leak. What power the information held, and just how bad the NSA is.The only negative thing I can say about it is that it opens a bit slow, and the technical aspects of it might scare of some viewers.It's amazing that this is the world we live in.

		<shortDescription>Well-executed and revealing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's one documentary that breathes an air of importance you can feel from the poster. It'll probably win the Oscar on that basis. That film is Laura Poitras' Citizenfour, a film that documents Edward Snowden's leaks before he became a familiar face. He relays his point here, he doesn't want to be the story. He knows that's a matter of when and not if (his nickname of choice Citizenfour refers to how he's the fourth whistleblower for the NSA). Now that he is the story, here comes the perfect behind the scenes companion. I never knew much about Snowden, but this film humanizes him in a stripped down and honest if not a raw way. There's a brilliant moment early on with the first reveal of Snowden after Poitras mislead us with a female actor dictating his emails. You get a sense of this moment's significance - and then it blossoms all the way to President Obama. Sequences such as a fire alarm going off every minute keep you on edge, always aware of the paranoia in today's society. It operates on an interesting irony with how they're filming yet aware of surveillance. The documentary has a very matter-of-fact approach to its events but that's all it needs, and Poitras and her team get out of the way despite opening the film in an autobiographical way. Citizenfour puts faces on the controversy, remaining intelligent without being too dry to swallow. I may prefer other documentaries this year, including similarly themed The Internet's Own Boy, but it deserves the acclaim and attention. Very well-executed and revealing without being overly scare-mongering.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting real time account, and a MUST WATCH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bold film by Laura Poitras, CITIZENFOUR is a riveting first-person look at a the NSA whistle-blowing by Edward Snowden, captured in real-time.Approached by CITIZENFOUR, journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill along with documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras fly to Hong Kong in the summer of 2013 to meet with the man who ended up being Edward Snowden to discuss and divulge secret information regarding covert surveillance programs run by the NSA and other intelligence programs of American and international citizens.The documentary is a thrilling and terrifying account of the actions that transpired before, during and after the groundbreaking reports were leaked and the turn of events by the American government. This review of CITIZENFOUR is not going to be a debate regarding the right or wrong of whistle-blowing or the government collection of data. That discussion can be saved for when someone mentions that they have seen CITIZENFOUR and an debate-like argument will indubitably ensue. This review will try to focus, as much as it can, on the scope of its impact and effectiveness of the film as a documentary.By now, the leaks, news reports and information released by Edward Snowden is somewhat known by most of the world's population. The extent of this information is dependent upon one's own desire to seek out said information, the types of news sources one chooses to read and the country in which one resides.CITIZENFOUR looks deeply at the scope of the impact that releasing this information has on the world, in real time, as the journalists themselves are brought up to speed on the extent of intelligence agencies' data collection. It looks at the motivation for Snowden releasing this information and the intellectual discussion between Snowden with the journalists about what this data collection means. Included in the documentary is a dialogue between Snowden and the journalists about: the means through which the government was able to collect this information, the extent and growth of the state's power versus the people's ability to meaningfully oppose said power, the issues regarding the safeguarding measures of collecting and controlling this information, the harm to people or methods of releasing legitimately classified documents, and the inevitable consequences for Snowden in being the catalyst for releasing the information.The effectiveness of CITIZENFOUR as a documentary hinges upon its timeframe, in that all of the video used in the film was caught in real time. This in-the-moment view removed any creative bias, caused by the ultimate outcome of Snowden and impact of this dissemination of information to the world public, that may have been inflicted upon the documentary. Poitras's choice of creative direction allows viewers of CITIZENFOUR to not only feel a part of this groundbreaking moment of journalism but to also feel the fear all those involved felt and feel as the events transpire. The information documented in the film also ends up not feeling edited or embellished, which only goes on to further amplify the factual effectiveness of CITIZENFOUR as a documentary.There are startlingly terrifying and unnerving moments within CITIZENFOUR, not from a cultivation or magnification of emotion from the cinematography, but in the real-time effects of releasing this information once the news articles go public in The Guardian and the direct repercussions this has on Edward Snowden. Thanks to the direction of Poitras, the audience can immediately reference Snowden's own predictions of how the government would act, and then we the viewers get to see these exact actions occurring which yields a sobering and depressing humor to these unfolding moments.CITIZENFOUR is a documentary that should be watched and released everywhere, and its lack of distribution, especially in the United States, is further proof of the necessity for transparency and awareness.Please check out our WEBSITE for full REVIEWS of all the awards nominees and recent film releases.</fullReview>

It tells us part of the raw truth for where this world is going and I think there's a reason why this has gotten so small media attention. I stumbled upon to this film through LP's other documentaries, if that wouldn't happen it would be less than likely I would've seen this - very important and informative - documentary ever. Todays we live in the world of ignorance, where governments do what they do - without any transparency - and we just accept silently everything what is happening everywhere, in every country.The governmental transparency globally is going to evolve to the way of secrecy and meanwhile our personal privacy is being invaded systematically and we can't do anything about if we wanna live normal life.

		<shortDescription>Not Even Le Carr or Ludlum Could have Imagined This Unbelievably Mesmerising Thrill Ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once in a while a film comes along that is so unbelievably gripping and thought provoking that you can't help but be stunned by the knowledge and changed by the experience. Add in to that, a true story whereby the events unfold in real time and with accurate precognition, and you have yourself one hell of a documentary. Titled after the pseudonym used by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, CITIZENFOUR is that story and it's all that and more. So much more.Documented around the eight days political filmmaker Laura Poitras (MY COUNTRY, MY COUNTRY) spent filming Snowden's June 2013 interviews with journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, CITIZENFOUR is a front row seat to the NSA's cat-and-mouse hunt for Snowden after he divulges evidence of the NSA's covert global surveillance programs in his Hong Kong hotel.Poitras was already working on the third instalment of her post 9/11 documentaries when she was emailed anonymously in January 2013 by a whistleblower known as CitizenFour who wished to provide her with documented evidence of the NSA's secret mass data surveillance programs that circumvented citizenry civil liberties. 'You asked why I picked you? I didn't. You did', CitizenFour told Poitras.With the NSA as an adversary, CitizenFour maintained encrypted online communication with Poitras and Greenwald (a political and legal journalist who had come on board after being contacted by both CitizenFour and Poitras around the same time), until it was safe to meet face-to-face. Although Greenwald had yet experienced the unlimited reach of the NSA, Poitras was no stranger to harassment, intimidation and privacy invasion by the US government (approximately 40 times since 2006) and documents an example of this experience in the film's opening montage sequence.In her Cinma vrit style, the documentary centres itself as an observer to the meetings between CitizenFour, Greenwald, and MacAskill, as they discuss how to disclose to the public the NSA's metadata collection programs and its invasion of citizens' civil liberties veiled under the guise of national security. It is these meetings, held intimately in Snowden's Mira hotel room, that are so unbelievably mesmerising to watch that you feel as if you are an integral part of this thrillingly dangerous enterprise against a powerful enemy with infinite reach. What is also striking (and humbling to see) is how poised Edward Snowden is throughout the film. Thoughtful and articulate, he knows exactly what he has done and that his actions may not lead to any consequences or outcome for the NSA and other intelligence organisations such as the GCHQ. He willingly accepts the risks and consequences of his actions stating 'I am more willing to risk imprisonment, or any other negative outcome personally, than I am to risk the curtailment of my intellectual freedom and that of those around me, whom I care for equally as I do for myself'. His one regret, which you can't help but feel and empathise with from his words and tone, is the fact that his partner of ten years, Lindsay Mills, was completely unaware of Snowden's actions or whereabouts and that she would face government interrogation and intimidation alone when the NSA inevitably arrives (which occurs when Mills interrupts a HR representative and police officer from the NSA trying to gain access to their home). As the first story brakes regarding the NSA's program PRISM (a court approved program that gives front door access to all users' accounts communications from Google and Yahoo) in The Guardian and The Washington Post two days after their initial meeting on 3rd June 2014, the US government immediately goes on the defensive as media outlets around the globe gain traction and mediate the revelations. From 'urging' outlets to not disclose companies involved in their programs to secret felony charges filed against Snowden on 14th June 2014 (including two under the Espionage Act of 1917) and Snowden's allusion on the 21st July 2014 that he received communications stating that the US government has told other nations to seek out people working with him and to use any pressure necessary to get to him, the US government wanted the revelations suppressed. What is amazing about the ensuing events that occur as Snowden makes preparations for political asylum is that each event unravels just as Snowden predicted on screen, giving credence to the heroisms of his motivations and actions.As the story comes to its temporary conclusion (Snowden's revelations are still unravelling even today) on screen, the viewer is included in a final intimate hotel room moment with Greenwald and Snowden (this time in Moscow), as Greenwald reveals in hand written notes, that another whistleblower has come forward. And they're ready to blow the lid with explosive evidence that names names all the way to the top. The President of the United States (POTUS) top.This is a must see film absolutely worthy of your time. Not even Le Carr or Ludlum can compare to this thrill ride!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional film, one that makes you very angry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to confess that before watching this film, I was only moderately aware of the Edward Snowden leaks. I also naively believed it was predominantly something that affected the USA, and that here in Britain we were safe from the evils of the NSA etc. I couldn't have been more wrong. Snowden in fact states that GCHQ is even worse, and had unlimited, unwarranted, and unregulated access to British citizens communications. Whilst it was big news here in the UK, it did not make most people as angry as it should have done. Indeed, I would be surprised if anyone who watched this film isn't livid by the end. It is also thought-provoking, well shot, and a fascinating insight into the human-side of Snowden.This is one of the few documentaries that doesn't actually feel like a documentary. There is nothing worse than watching people talk about an event in retrospect, with a series of unbelievable footage supposed to represent the topic. This is completely the opposite. It is all shot in real-time, with Snowden, two journalists from the Guardian and Washington post, and of course the filmmaker Laura Poitras, holed up inside a hotel room in Hong Kong, with very little idea of their fate. It is extremely tense, and consequently feels like a real-life thriller. This is probably the best documentary I've seen for years. It is the type of documentary that every single person in the affected areas (which is most of the world) should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Citizenfour is easily the best documentary I have ever watched. Admittedly, I haven't watched Poitras' earlier works and there I may be missing a point. But even if her other films are stronger than this one, it only proves the point that she is a great documentary- maker with an authoritative voice combined with an exceptional dramatic talent.Poitras develops such a suspense throughout the movie at such a solid pace that the documentary draws you in like a thriller and has you hold your breath until the moment that the final titles appear on the screen. And she achieves this while telling a story that we all know about and we have all heard or read all its minute details. The brilliantly executed opening of the film sets the heavy mood that is then sustained until the end with carefully selected music and misfocusing/hand-held amateur-looking shots. Just excellent work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snowden is smart, eloquent, humble and surprisingly well glued together for a man who is about to become the most wanted man in the world by the American government!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Citizenfour' is a documentary by Laura Poitras about the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) systems administrator Edward Snowden, who exposed possibly the greatest intelligence leak of modern times with revelations that the U.S. government blatantly and illegally violated civil liberties by spying and gathering data on all of us.In 2013 when the leaks were exposed by the Guardian newspaper, Snowden had his movements filmed by Poitras. She came to the attention of the Department of Homeland Security with 'My Country, My Country', about life under US occupation in Iraq, and 'The Oath' which was filmed in Yemen and Guantnamo. Snowden confided in the Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, and the three met up in Hong Kong to film Snowden's leak.Snowden's leaks became the news story of this decade, even eclipsing Julian Assange's Wikileaks. Verizon, AT&amp;T, and other telecoms companies opened hundreds of millions of phone records to the NSA, who in turn tapped into the data of Yahoo, Google and others. The NSA's PRISM surveillance program collected emails, texts, voicemails, and video chats of U.S. and global citizens. Their Stellar Wind programme was an enormous metadata-mining system, stealth operations called Dishfire, XKeyscore, and Tempora allowed the U.S. and other members of the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance (the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) access to our daily communications. They even hacked the UN's video conferencing system, tapping German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone calls seemed a trifling matter in comparison to the immense surveillance operations taking place.Snowden is smart, eloquent, humble and surprisingly well glued together for a man who is about to become the most wanted man in the world by the American government. Considering the magnitude of this story, everyone remains incredibly calm, not least Snowden! Its interesting to watch him, always reaffirming that the story is not about him when in reality it is, to begin with. He didn't tell anyone, not even his partner of over a decade, who he knew would be placed in danger if he had. Under so much pressure, he seems so well-balanced, there's no histrionics, and he certainly doesn't play up to the camera.You can see that Snowden doesn't want to be in this position, he knew his life will change for the worse, but he knows the world needs to see what is going on in front of us. The magnitude of the surveillance was immense, near the end of the film we see the scared and paranoid Snowden and Greenwald exchanging written notes confirming revelations from a new source. They show us that 1.2 million Americans are under some stage of "watch", Snowden was flabbergasted, someone you wouldn't think could be surprised any more than he has been!The sad fact is that its cinematic release, a year after the revelations were aired, raises the question of what's really changed? We still know so little, and it seems the status quo pervades. We don't really even know if the NSA, GCHQ and many others have stopped surveillance operations, so whoever you're calling or texting, or what websites or apps you're viewing, your privacy is probably being scrutinised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Philosophy this man stood up to well worth propagating, CitizenFour follows the Story of the now famous NSA whistleblower Edaward Snowden. From the time he he traveled to Hong Kong, the documentary follows actual footage that was taken of him and the collaborating Journalists meeting and talking about the extent of the Espionage and violation of privacy that NSA and GCHQ was undertaking. In truth the true Hero here is Edward Snowden not any of the other Journalists, it took courage to give up your comfortable life to live a life on the run. To be frank of all the leaked information leaked to the the media outlet Guardian, only a biased selected documents was published about, in my opinion insulting the efforts and ideals of what Edward Snowden stood for.If even one of these privacy violations are on going and and you let it pass, remember you are the sheep being slowly led to the slaughter. Speak out now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In January 2013, Laura Poitras started receiving anonymous encrypted e-mails from "CITIZENFOUR," who claimed to have evidence of illegal covert surveillance programs run by the NSA in collaboration with other intelligence agencies worldwide. Five months later, she and reporters Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill flew to Hong Kong for the first of many meetings with the man who turned out to be Edward Snowden. She brought her camera with her. The resulting film is history unfolding before our eyes.The method of telling this unveiling of a disastrous governmental blemish is so well paced that its two hour length speeds by. The cast is all the characters who were involved - Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Willliam Binney, Ewen MacAskill, Jeremy Scahill, Jacob Applebaum, Kevin Bankston, Jonathan Man etc. Their screen presence is searingly on target. Kudos to Laura Poitras who directed and filmed this very important revelation. It is a must see film and one that hopefully will alter the way our individual privacy is respected in the future - if it is not too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could call it me sleeping under a rock or something, but yeah, I didn't really know anything about this NSA scandal or Edward Snowden. Actually, his name seemed familiar so I'm sure I had heard some passing comments, but I didn't know the real and full story. The documentary's take on him, and on what is happening as it is being shot, gives it a real tension that so many docs just aren't able to have. I haven't seen 2 of the 5 nominees for the Oscar, but from the other two I have, this is better and would make a deserving winner. In many ways it functions as a thriller even if it's very low-key and very quiet in its execution. It's a great film, one that's sure to be ingrained in many people's minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking documentary that feels more like a spy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We are building the biggest weapon for oppression in the history of mankind."I'm afraid that as I write down this quote from Laura Poitras thrilling documentary I will be added to the NSA's surveillance list. That is how paranoid this documentary may make you feel after the two hour nail biting experience. Citizenfour feels more like a spy thriller than an actual documentary because it was being documented in real time as history was being made. I'm no computer wiz and my knowledge is rather limited, but the way things are explained in this documentary makes it easier to follow the story. There are several things that stand out here and despite that slow opening 15 minutes, once Edward Snowden shows up for the first time the documentary begins to take form and the thrills kick in as we realize that we are becoming a witness to the events that occurred in 2013 surrounding the US government involvement in surveillance. Whatever personal opinion we may have about Edward Snowden's actions, this film gives us the opportunity to understand why he did them. Perhaps the greatest thing about Citizenfour is that it ends up being a rather interesting and fascinating character study of a man who we've read a lot about over the past year and a half despite not really knowing who he was. As opposed to Assange, Snowden really didn't want to take center stage and he believed the story was more important for the public than his personal life. This inner conflict is captured during the intense Hong Kong meetings between himself, Poitras, and reporter Glenn Greenwald who was the man responsible for breaking the story in The Guardian. I found this documentary fascinating despite not really having cared much for the story when it first broke out. I guess I simply didn't care about being under surveillance considering there isn't anything I have to hide, but I understand now the importance of Snowden's actions and its implications. The risk that he along with Poitras and Greenwald took is heightened in this documentary with the eerie underlying score. Citizenfour is a groundbreaking and thrilling documentary that is worth checking out no matter how you feel about the matter.What stands out in Citizenfour is the sense of immediacy surrounding the events that have taken place over the past year. We also get a sense of who and why Snowden did what he did. Snowden, Greenwald, and Poitras aren't just concerned about the loss of privacy, but the loss of freedom it implicates because the public will be fearful of sharing their personal opinions. The documentary works like an authentic spy thriller because you get a sense of the persecution and secrecy surrounding their actions while filming and developing the story. Citizenfour is the frontrunner to win Best Documentary in the Academy Awards and deservedly so because it is an intense and gripping documentary that is relevant in today's world. People who were obsessed with their private information being divulged in Facebook will have a lot more to worry about after this (cellphone, emails, google searches, and so on).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow it's hard to overstate the brilliance of Citizenfour. As someone who has held clearances an worked for the DoD, I always felt Snowden was a traitor. Not any more. To me the Snowden story was an ethical dilemma: "do the ends justify the means?" Mr. Snowden you swore an oath and you broke that oath: go to jail, It seemed as simple as that. But what if you swear an oath supporting an organization sworn to protect and defend the Consstitution, and you find that said organization is systematically shredding the Constitution? In my book: the organization broke their promise which premised *your* promise: so all bets are off. Onto the characters. Edward Snowden. What a set of brass ones! He could have easily have been murdered by the CIA but he eluded them. Laura Poitrous,Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill: thank you for risking your own personal well being and freedom and showing what real journalism is all about.The emotion conveyed here is unreal. Like watching a horror film in slow motion where the killer is constantly in the room: only it's non fiction. The fear and paranoia are palpable. Then at times it was laugh out loud funny. By the end the viewer is left thinking: "I've lost track of how many kinds of wrong this is." The look on Snowden's face when he himself learns the traitor Barrack Obama (as much as Bush was) is systematically murdering Americans via remote control drone strike without the Right of due process ... is priceless.To the Director of the film you will change hearts and minds here, and in the process perhaps save freedom itself. Hard to imagine what you'll do for an encore. Must see amazing film: *the* defining documentary of the decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.7/5 starsPart real-life thriller, part sobering examination of 21st century civil liberties, "Citizenfour" transcends an earnest ideology to offer riveting, must-see cinema. Designed with taste, this is a front row seat for camera-shy Edward Snowden's bombshell ? as educational and insightful as it's nerve-racking and thought- provoking.In January 2013, Laura Poitras (recipient of the 2012 MacArthur Genius Fellowship and co-recipient of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service) was several years into making a film about surveillance in the post-9/11 era when she started receiving encrypted emails from someone identifying himself as "citizen four", who was ready to blow the whistle on the massive covert surveillance programs run by the NSA and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, she and journalist Glenn Greenwald flew to Hong Kong for the first of many meetings with the man who turned out to be Edward Snowden. She brought her camera with her. The film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely sui generis in the history of cinema: a 100% real-life thriller unfolding minute by minute before our eyes.Filmmaker Laura Poitras paints a frankly terrifying picture of the loss of liberty through widespread government intrusion and gathering of communication done by ordinary folk on a daily basis. The film leaves no doubt that the methodical mining of everyday communication from people the government has no reason to suspect of terrorism actually exists. And, thanks to Poitras and Snowden, we are thrust into the moment where it would become impossibly naive to believe otherwise. The message of the movie is as clear as Siberian ice: Whether you're a Tea Partier, an Occupier or just an average Joe, you might be the next citizen who's stranded in limbo.Much of the film consists of footage of Snowden explaining the range and depth of American data-mining to an increasingly horrified Glenn Greenwald - the journalist who firmly stood with Snowden and had the gumption to publish all of the U.S. government's myriad dirty secrets. This interaction between the two also offers an absorbing character study of Snowden. There's something both chilling and interesting about the man - though articulate and charming to a certain extent, he carries about as much gravitas as a character in "The Big Bang Theory", but there can be no doubt that his role in history is important and remarkable. Here's a truly courageous individual that put his credibility, identity, flourishing career, financial stability, social standing, and even his own life and family at risk to reveal a dark, carefully-guarded secret to the world."Citizenfour" is an alarming and terrifying expose that works as both a tense, real-life espionage thriller and as a thoroughly engrossing documentary. It all sounds like prophecy now, given the way things turned out. Yet, despite all its paranoia, the movie does offer a glimmer of optimism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of Snowden himself, just some of what he knew...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and given the constraints they were operating under, maybe that much could not be revealed.The first 20 minutes or so are of Ed, who isn't even known to the world yet, talking to a couple of journalists he has invited to his Hong Kong hotel room where he is hiding out from a system that doesn't even know he is missing yet. In a way, I'm surprised they came because about ten minutes into the conversation one says "What is your name again?", so maybe they had no idea what they were getting into, maybe at first they thought they were dealing with a crackpot, etc.Some people have said it is boring, and I don't know why. Although you never get any real specifics about what Snowden did have on the NSA, you get an idea from him just sitting on his bed in his tee shirt talking to these journalists that he has seen stuff that has made him hyper vigilant. He puts a red hood over him when he types in a password to his laptop in case there is visual surveillance, he unplugs the phone because it contains ICs that can be used as a "hot mike", and he is highly suspicious when the fire alarms go off just as he is talking about what he knows. His fear is real.I think this preliminary footage may have just been a way to show a human side of Ed. I mean, a lot of the documentary (on top of revealing more details of the secrets he leaked) is meant to show to the world that he's not crazy bob in his trailer in Nevada. He's a young, very smart, very articulate, very normal individual. Showing him simply struggling with his hair (something I'm sure most of us have dealt with at one point or another) demonstrates to us that he's not a mysterious conspiracy theorist to be dismissed; he's just like you and I. And the human quality makes us trust what he has to say a lot more. It's easy to ignore someone you think is crazy. It's not so easy to ignore someone in whom you see a little bit of yourself.As for Glenn Greenwald of UK's The Guardian, he's shown as an articulate spokesman and advocate. He goes to Brazil and explains to them that all of this surveillance is just not about fighting terrorism. He brings his case home to them by saying if they were bidding on a contract in the US, then all of the details of their negotiations and plans to get that contract are now in the hands of the US government, and could be put in the hands of any American competitor.The negatives? There is a part at the end that is not clearly explained. It is a conversation between Greenwald and Snowden about there being another contact in Germany that is ready to talk about what he knows about NSA surveillance. Some extremely unclear pictures are drawn and Snowden looks somewhat horrified saying stuff like "This is very risky. Does this guy know what he is doing, etc." He is really scared for the new contact, but it is never clear what is going on. The only other negative I have is, did the print explaining the transition between scenes HAVE to be so small? I had to pause the DVD and get up close to the screen to see what was being said.I'd highly recommend this documentary just based on the fact that it pulls together some of the information that has now been scrubbed from public sources, shows Snowden as a human being, shows the bravery of both himself and Glenn Greenwald, and brings up that pesky question - is giving up such privacy - which as the documentary mentions is pretty much a synonym for liberty - worth it for increased security. Benjamin Franklin seemed to think that was not so. Watch it with an open mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a fact, these days, that revealing the Truth about most anything in this company/country is a Crime- Truthcrime, for lack of a better (or more appropriate) word; and to bring to light the nefarious Peeping Tom practices of the Military Industrial Government is the biggest offense of all. With the obvious exceptions of FREE SPEECH TV and LINK TV, denizens of this Dumbocracy are pretty much in the dark- which is exactly where They want us. Assange, Snowden, Greenwald and Poitras all dared pull back the curtain to reveal what was really going on behind the tapestry, and have been mercilessly hounded as a result. Without people like them risking it all to make the Unknown KNOWN, we wouldn't know, for instance, that cell phones cause brain tumors or that Teflon in frying pans can cause pancreatic cancer or that the elements in laptops can trigger testicular cancer (which happened to someone I know) or any one of a thousand other facts that have come to light thanks to the risks of whistleblowers. With the lunatic libertarians literally paying the Republican Reich to do their dirty work for them- even as the Environment they themselves have poisoned dies gasping-, it behooves people who really care about what's coming around the bend to look to politicians who aren't part of the problem- like Bernie Sanders, the Independent from Vermont. Critical thinking is CRITICAL. "I'M not the story here," Snowden points out in CITIZENFOUR: "It's not science fiction. This stuff is happening." If not for Snowden (and Assange, and the others), we'd all still be in the dark. Maybe it's like Greenwald said when he received the Sofie Schol award: "Courage is contagious." Let's HOPE so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biased and doesn't tell all the facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a one sided documentary that paints Edward Snowdon as a heroic whistle blower. It only focuses on the fact that he exposed the US governments' far reaching surveillance programs and never mentions the fact that he stole millions of top secret files which he indiscriminately turned over to a handful of journalists. So does this make him a whistle blower or a traitor? Well, he exposed how the US spies on people on it's own soil. I'd say that makes him a whistle blower. But he also revealed which nations the US spies on, how we do it, which nations spy on each other, how they do it and which of those nations are passing that info on to us. By doing so he also told every terrorist and criminal who's spying on them, how they're doing it and how to avoid detection. I'd say that makes him a traitor. This documentary also suffers from some other problems. More than once people talk about what "they" did but never explain who "they" are. It's full of vague techno jargon and acronyms. No one explains what any of it means, so the audience is left to figure things out for themselves. I also have to take off points for several excessively long scenes of Edward Snowdon doing mundane things - staring at his laptop, looking out the window, fixing his hair. I think they were meant to convey his isolation, but they just made me feel bored. So, bottom line - this is a biased documentary that leaves out facts, throws around vague techno babble perpetrated by "they" and portrays Edward Snowdon as a hero/victim who's only crime is telling the truth.</fullReview>

Supposedly, it was one of the biggest things in last 3 years or something? Now, I want to watch it even more! 6 minutes ? so, before I have started watching it, I have talked with a friend a little more and I have found that indeed, it is something about government; monitoring our lives, to be more precise. Well, I am really not shocked about it and to be honest, I am kind of surprised that it was something new for most people? Obvious things are not obvious for everyone I guess? I really like the music and after short search, I have confirmed my suspicion; the author is Trent Reznor of Ninch Inch Nails ? no wonder I like it.47 minutes ? it's really really interesting and it reminds me of Matrix or any other cyberpunk flick where government, corporations or whatever are taking over the world? the best (or not) thing in all this is, it's not a sci-fi film, it is a documentary? Oh well, I've always loved dirty future cyberpunk, I just wish we would have more neons, some cyborgs and flying cars? 57 minutes ? I watch it and can't stop thinking about Agents in black suits bashing into a room and capturing poor NEO, I mean Edward Snowden.This film feels like a sequel to Enemy of the State (1998), and I am not joking here! Disabling payments, surveillance in front of a house, damn? 1h 25minutes ? now, except for being extremely interesting, it's scary too! 1h 35minutes ? it hurts me to see Mr Edward Snowden is position he currently is? for something so great what he has done, now he has to deal with lying sacks of s**t politicians and can't even live in his own country? 1h 43minutes ? unbelievably good! Much better that I have expected it to be! Secret agents, assets, spies, double agents, USA pulling the strings all over the world? shocking and breathtaking (in the disgusting way)! It almost feels like the governments are ruled by some kind of evil breed of aliens punishing everyone who is brave enough to stand up and face them and their abusive power? and you know what is the most scary in all this? After few years, nobody will remember about it and the tyranny will continue? as I've said, it feels like they are controled by some aliens, to keep rest of the population in their hands, hiding behind human faces? Maybe my theory is not so far from the truth after all? If you haven't seen the film: They Live (1988), I strongly recommend it, you will get the clear idea of what I am talking about.Would you believe me if I said that, some Americans think he is a traitor? I had to stop reading the IMDb boards because, I had a great anger growing inside of me? just meh? sheeps will be sheeps?It is even hard to rate this one? How can you rate a real life?

		<fullReview>It certainly is mine though I would not recommend anyone see it in a theater; it's much better recorded or on DVD. There are just too many things a serious viewer will want to stop and read carefully. (Not just the documents but also the closed captions which you should use to catch the many acronyms and code names.)In a lot of ways this is almost too improbable a record of how Snowden first disclosed his revelations of massive surveillance to journalists who would then inform the world at large. No, there's no dramatization of his working at his desk and then sneaking out his thumb drive if that's even how he did it. The story instead picks up with his first contacts with some of the best of the press. Someone had the bright idea to film much of the early drama. It's not clear from the movie who though it was probably Snowden himself. That may seem a bit narcissistic but it was actually a brilliant move. This film record does more to vindicate him while simultaneously damning our government than a roomful of suddenly intelligent judges.If you see only one documentary this year, make it this one and clear out enough time to do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Human Face of Bravery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald have been receiving encrypted emails for nearly 4 months from someone called Citizenfour; the content of these emails allude to a disturbing level of surveillance committed by the American NSA and the British GHCQ. The contact wants to meet Laura and Glenn and show them everything, they agree, they meet in a hotel in Hong Kong. An inconspicuous young man named Edward Snowden greets them, and he is about to leak to them the worse surveillance crimes ever committed, and Edward is scared.The atmosphere of the film immediately establishes the feeling of paranoia, justified paranoia, felt by all those involved. Poitras uses clear visual language to establish that what they are doing flies in the face of many powerful people. She uses archaic typeface and computer screens to establish a hacker vibe, and a tone of dissent, she cuts back and forth to mainstream media and to the three of them hid away in Hong Kong, and she intermingles interviews with William Binney to show how far the government will go to stop information about their intrusive programs from leaking.Poitras also does something incredibly important; she humanizes Edward Snowden. Mainstream media and the government have tried incessantly to cast discursions about the character of Snowden; "martyr complex" " narcissist" "computer weirdo" have been some of the slanders used to diminish his achievements. Poitras makes Snowden seem reasonable and somewhat nice; even when he has thrown a blanket over his head to stop the NSA from visually identifying his password, he jokes about and tries to use this moment to connect to Greenwald. Also some of the candid admissions that Poitras manages to extract from Snowden shows the strength of Poitras' interviewing style. The admission by Snowden about how he realises his life is going to be from now onwards; about leaving his loved ones behind and the fear he felt throughout, makes him come across as incredibly brave. "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear." (Nelson Mandela)Citizenfour last act is a summary of how the release of these documents have affected the lives of all those involved. It's depressing to see that those who stand up for what is right have been harassed and followed by the British and American government figures. Poitras tries to end the film on high note with Edward and his partner living together again, cooking and cleaning in an apartment in Moscow. Poitras however battles against the Hollywood ending, and shows the frustration of fighting the good fight, and leaves us reflecting upon the drone program. Poitras is saying not to rest on the achievements of her, Greenwald and Snowden, but forces her audience to continue discussing the terrifying reach of the American government.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It ain't no use to sit and wonder why Babe...It doesn't matter anyhow"...Bob DylanOr at Least that's what "They" Want You to ThinkThis is a Bare Bones Documentary, an account of Whistleblower Edward Snowden's contact, meeting, and subsequent Revelations to Documentarian Laura Poitras that, in Simplistic Terms, the NSA was Collecting Data on Everything and Everybody and storing it in a Digital Data Dump to be Mined if and when "They" Determined it was Necessary.There is so much Wrong and so much to Think About in this Scenario that it Boggles the Bean and can cause an Overload of Critical Thinking that can Short Out the most insulated of Enquiring Thought.We are told by Preachers that there is an Omnipresent, All Knowing God that Records everything You do and every Thought You ever had. This God will hold You Accountable and if You have done Nothing Wrong, in Regard to God's Law, You have Nothing to Fear. Sound Familiar.This Documentary Isn't about God or Religion, Or is it?. If the Almighty powers that Control the Data Dumb decide that, for some Reason, any Reason They Deem Fit, You need to be Reigned In or Intimidated or Blackmailed, all Your Information is there, at Their Disposal. If You did something Wrong, Sometime, or even Something that is Unarguably Not Wrong or Illegal, but is Embarrassing, You are Putty in Their Hands. That's the Danger. With the Knowledge (that is Power), the Control becomes Obvious. J. Edgar Hoover with Super Powers.As a Film, this is Nothing Fancy. Very Little is done with the Footage to Spice it up or make it "Entertaining" and Easy viewing. It Is what it is. Considered Boring by some and the Detractors of this Oscar Winner point to the Blandness and the befuddling Jargon and Computerese that can put People who don't give a Hoot about that kind of Thing to Sleep and cause Comatose Catatonia may be Correct. But as a Documentation, in Real Time, it is Important and a Record of a Real Life event that Shook the World. At First, At Least...Now It seems the News Cycle is over and this is Old Stuff and Everybody has Moved on to "More Important" Things. Really.Maybe so, but that makes this all the more Important, Because this is here, if You Care and can Access the Story anytime, anywhere, at Least until "They" decide it is "Subversive, Evil, Unpatriotic, Etc." and Forbid it. But that kind of Stuff Never Happens, So..."Don't Think Twice, It's Alright".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling documentary that will make you think twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-8/10CITIZENFOUR is a movie documentary that explores in depth what the US government is doing to ordinary citizens. It's eye opening the whole way through and thrilling in a slightly odd kind of way but all in all is important as documentaries go. It's secretive nature is well done and as the story breaks you really feel a sense of not only thrill, but also of a kind of emotion toward Snowden and very much thinking how he must be feeling right then.Laura Poitras creates this in a way that although can be slightly dull especially at the beginning, still manages to be rewarding by the end and your mind will or should be buzzing like crazy as the credits slowly roll. Everyone involved on this is magnificent from the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewan Macaskill to Julien Assange, this really encapsulates how much raw emotion can be felt by real life events and how they unravel. One point about those involved is then the scale of people who keep coming, we start with two and by the end there seems to be so many people helping Snowden it seems unbelievable such a quiet conversation in a Hong Kong hotel room could create such a storm.Look I mean this is one documentary that many many people will enjoy as I did, but I couldn't help feel although the overriding message is an interesting one and everything that happens, computing system jargon is fairly dull to those of us who are less learned and so some scenes end up just a little too confusing at points. It does however as previously mentioned have it's moments of brilliance and even in slow moving scenes you still remain enthralled and thrilled at everything that is going on.I really feel this is a must see documentary and for US or UK or any country where surveillance was gathered citizens, this is important viewing. You may feel at the start that it isn't that great but just leave it on and you'll see why so many critics love it and also why it gained the Oscar for best Documentary of 2014, truly complex in it's own kind of way. Edward Snowden is not your typical hero and although his voice is heard in this, you still can't help feel bad for him even if he knew what was coming, with all the news reports heard in the background we really see Snowden's true reaction to what he has done. A warning I will give to film watchers who want to see chases or truly chilling tales, well this isn't going to get your spine tingling, well maybe in a kind of way but truth is this is one documentary for listening intently, not watching only. Overall I gave it a 8/10 and felt it to be a safe 8, it is firmly very good and one documentary I couldn't recommended more, I even expected more and still found it very good. Give it a go and it has the power to blow your mind, if you see this you may just see the true scale of what the people who control your national interests, do to the people who elected them in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a very thick line of difference between how should we review a documentary and how should we review a movie, but both of them have one thing in common, both of them should have the tenacity to hold the test of time to be called a great feat. In movies it is achieved through a storyline that does not fade away with the passing of time, in documentary it is achieved by its core material, and how much it affects the world at present and in distant future. Keeping all these aspects in mind if we trudge on the path of analyzing how much "CITIZENFOUR" fared, it should not be very difficult to say that it will go down in the golden books of documentary films. Any attempt in describing the effects this movie would make in its viewers mind, will be undermining it, and I can assure you that I, in any way, am not exaggerating. This movie is just not an attempt to bring out to the people the story of Edward Snowden, rather it is an observance, observance of the slowly disintegrating constitution, the disintegration of the line between right/wrong, an observance of how our freedoms are being put to trial in the name of well-being and under the veil of protection. It is an observance of how our world has succumbed to the state of a "Ruler and Ruled" rather than "Elected and Electorate" state. In its heart it still remains a story of Edward Snowden, the man who single-handedly shook NSA and foiled its long going party. And as I was saying earlier, an excellent documentary is one which has the capacity to affect both present and future, Citizenfour is surely one of them. It affects every part of our lives.See it to believe it, but all I can say is that Don't Miss It. Simply because of the fact that this is a story that everyone needs to know and have an opinion about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poitras' Citizenfour is an exploration of not only the espionage undertaken by the NSA, but more specifically the way in which the whistle-blower deals with his actions. The debate is still ongoing about whether or not Snowden's actions were legitimate, whether the data collection itself was warranted etc. However after watching this film, two things will hopefully be settled in the viewers mind. First, that Edward Snowden is a profoundly courageous man, and, second, that he is an exceptionally intelligent man as well.Incredibly, Laura captured the first moments that Glen Greenwald and Edward Snowden met in person, in Hong Kong, on camera and she continued to film until Edward was forced to leave for Moscow in a hurry. This unique look at the situation is portrayed by Poitras in an incredibly tense and suspenseful way and she succeeds in giving the documentary a quasi-thriller feel, which is further compounded by the astute choice of Trent Reznor's goose-bump-inducing music as the soundtrack. The gems of the film occur in between the leaks we know (hopefully) very well.These include the interspersed philosophical musings by Snowden on such things ranging from his inability to think further than a day or two into the future to the empathy he feels towards his partner, or the fear expressed by the editors of the guardian closely followed by their destruction of the source material, which they literally attack with a hacksaw and drills, or the international nature of the leaks as the film travels to Brazil, Germany, Moscow, Hong Kong, or finally, the extreme paranoia understandably experienced by Snowden and the way he deals with it (at times placing a sheet over his head to make sure the camera doesn't capture any details of his typing, or plugging out the hotel phone for fear of it being bugged.) Unfortunately, the film dragged on for 30 minutes too long and reinforced, almost to the point of simply repeating word for word, the same points over and over again. However this allowed a thoughtful audience the chance to re-digest what we had assumed before and to perhaps rethink some of our a priori judgments on the issue and on the person(s).Ultimately, the film is valuable if only for the fact that we as the audience get to experience the divulging of the NSA leaks again, as if for the first time, and, as a result of the proximity and intimacy the film creates with Snowden himself and the journalists he uses, with almost as much intensity and surprise. We need to continue to talk about these issues, and as is repeated throughout the film, we must not allow ourselves to become blas in regards to mass surveillance. This film deserves the Oscar simply because it took incredible courage to make on the part of all parties and undeniably plays a role in keeping the Snowden leaks in the collective unconscious for as long as they need to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could have been riveting, should have at least been interesting, but was absolutely boring. The positive reviews that I have seen seem to be reviewing the story behind this film and not the film itself. I can sum up this film in ten words: Two hours of a guy sitting in a hotel room. In reality, it was only roughly 75% Snowden in a hotel room, but the other 25% of the film was just as boring.This film could have achieved its potential by providing some interpretation of the information it was providing. Snowden say's a lot of technical things about computers and information that the film just leaves hanging in the air.I don't think that this film can be spoiled, as it was awful, but I don't want to get blacklisted, so the following paragraphs MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.There was one scene during one of the early meetings between Snowden and Greenwald in which Snowden felt compelled to put a towel over his head and his laptop while he was doing something on the laptop. It was unclear why he was doing this and from whom he was trying to shield the information. I don't see why he would be shielding what he was doing from the people in the room, and I don't see how this measure would safeguard him from anybody outside the room. Some form of explanation might have been useful. This scene just made Snowden look like a paranoid crank who might just as well have been wearing a tinfoil hat.A later scene showed some vertical video (Side-rant: video is a horizontal medium people; please stop shooting phone videos vertically), presumably shot with a phone, that depicted some guys in a workshop. One clip is of a guy using a drill on something, and the other is of a guy using a grinder on something. What were these guys tooling on? What was the significance?Later in the film, Greenwald addresses some Brazilian politicians in Portuguese. This was one of the few explanatory bits in the film, and it's in a foreign language with subtitles. There was no cinematic value to letting the whole thing play in Portuguese. A few seconds of that situation would have established that he had addresses the Portuguese politicians, then it would have been better for clarity and impact to have him say it in English later.Then there was the big pay-off! A scene of Snowden and Greenwald sitting in a room together with Greenwald speaking introductory phrases punctuated by the visual comma of him leaning over a table and scribbling the rest of his sentence on a piece of paper, which he hands to Snowden who reads it in astonishment. What do these notes say? They show one of them, which says that 1,200,000 people are under surveillance by the NSA, which Snowden reads in astonishment. Isn't that what the whole film has been telling us? That the NSA is spying on American Citizens.My first reaction to this big payoff was, "The NSA is only spying on 1.2 million of the 300+ million living in America?" And that is a prime example of why this film is a huge failure: It misses every opportunity to have an impact. The big revelation is not that the NSA is only spying on 1.2 million people. The NSA is collecting information about all of us, and that is bad enough. However, the NSA is ACTIVELY SURVEILLING 1.2 million people. That's the big revelation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good documentary for people living outside of USA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This documentary came out of nowhere to me. It was quite captivating from the beginning. I have always been interested in NSA and its activities and quite fascinated by stories about NSA be it real or fictitious from good reads in Dan Brown's books to real documentaries such as Citizen Four. Now even though people living in the USA are well aware and quite up to speed with what happened in the cases of Snowden and Assange, people living in smaller countries like us do not get a lot of information on the media unless we pursue it crazily on the internet. But this documentary is a real eye opener for even a foreign national who is not in the thick of things, why? Because we use their software, their portals, their data exchanges, their email and their tunnels to communicate and browse the internet. Our whole personal lives on line are drifting through US servers. Right now it might be irrelevant. But some day when our countries are of use or are in the midst of some political agenda of US or one of its giant opponents, rest assured all those hidden away data will be mined for each and every bit of information that they can gather on us. We have no control over it and no choice. But my belief is that it is always better to be paranoid than not when you are on line. I'm no cameramen but those were some beautiful and genius camera angles matching little broken down contexts of the story as well. This documentary provoked the above thought stream in my head and certainly created some respect for the man who sacrificed his own freedom and went out of his way just to break the corrupt system. To say that humanity still comes first always.</fullReview>

But I must inform you that your pun surveillance has been activated, you have no more pun privacy. All your puns will now be recorded by the Punited States of America's NSA. OK, maybe not. But Director Laura Poitras' poignant documentary "Citizenfour" unveils NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelation of the NSA and its alleged invasion of privacy to citizens' technological interactions. Much of "Citizenfour" is played out in a Hong Kong hotel room as Snowden provides the information to journalists including Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian. Poitras portraits Snowden as the real deal with his infamous revelations, since it is an objective documentary. "Citizenfour" does drag at times and I would not toot my whistle entirely on it, but it is still a very important documentary on an important true event that changed the surveillance landscape of this country. *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizenfour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this documentary film because it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, then I recognised the subject it focused on, including the Children of Mitchell Brook Primary School is Neasden acting it out on Big Fat Quiz of the Year, so I was looking forward to finding out more about the real story. Basically documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras had worked for many years on a film about monitoring programs in the U.S. that resulted in the 9/11 attacks, then she received an encrypted email from someone calling themselves "Citizenfour". In it was information about illegal wiretapping practices, classified documents providing evidence of mass incriminate and illegal invasions of privacy by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and other intelligence agencies. With investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald and The Guardian intelligence reporter Ewen MacAskill, Poitras travels to Hong Kong to meet the stranger in person, he reveals himself as Edward Snowden, a computer professional, former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former contractor for the U.S. Government. After four days of interviews, at his request, Snowden's identity is made public, he relocates to avoid phone calls, and knowing he may face extradition and prosecution he meets with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to apply for refugee status, Poitras believes she is being followed and leaves. The U.S. government request the Hong Kong government to extradite Snowden, his passport is cancelled before he can reach Havana, he is stranded in Russia but granted a year of asylum, meanwhile Greenwald speaks out about the United States using NSA programs for foreign surveillance. After many more interviews, including NSA intelligence official William Binney speaking about the surveillance programs and testifying against them, the film ends with Greenwald, Snowden and Poitras meeting in Russia, they discuss new emerging details on US intelligence programs, careful only to write down and not speak critical pieces of information, Greenwald tears the documents, and removes the scraps from the table. Snowden was easy to approach and sincere, he was the whistleblower to gross abuses of power used by his organisation, this really is revealing inconvenient truth, the revelations caused high impact to everyone in America, and the world, obviously danger would follow, and this film really does remind you of the very real threat that those in power can pose to the citizens they have sworn to protect, you have to concentrate while watching, but it is a very interesting and worthwhile thriller-like documentary. It won the Oscar and BAFTA for Best Documentary. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Horror Movie of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CitizenfourI used to think the scariest moment in cinematography was the infamous scene in The Exorcist when the girl turns her head around all the way and walks like a deformed crab. Then I witnessed Citizenfour. Now that's scary! Laura Poitras directed what is unquestionably the scariest production of all time, not because of the fictional creatures it creates, but the real world horrors it depicts. Citizenfour is a documentary filmed during the Edward Snowden leaks that were famous for the exposure of NSA surveillance. The documentary begins with Snowden reaching out to the director inviting her to rendezvous in Hong Kong. From there the documentary covers the information Snowden looked toward disclosing, the process he took to get the information out and the political actions that were taken in response. The information that was discussed was absolutely stunning. I was especially blown away by the capability of the world surveillance systems, especially the British system, which is apparently capable of analyzing over 1 billion phone calls and emails at a time. The film finishes with the director and one of the lead reporters working with Snowden in his new place of refuge in Moscow and discussing how the NSA watch list now includes 1.2 million Americans. I really enjoyed how the movie did not focus solely on American surveillance system but, also on European intelligence agencies.Citizenfour was probably the best documentary I've ever seen. The film did a great job of presenting the conspiracy in an interesting yet informative manner. The film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time even as it went through legal proceedings and technology that goes into surveillance systems. The documentary did an especially good job of building up to Edward Snowden's Reveal and the level of secrecy he maintained. The one quality of Citizenfour I didn't enjoy were the discussions that took place in foreign languages, without any subtitles. I'm aware the director was likely attempting to make the film more artsy but all this choice really did was add confusion. The one choice I really appreciated from the director was to end the documentary in such a inconclusive manner, because domestic surveillance is a struggle that is constantly being shared.In conclusion I really enjoyed Citizenfour. I think it was a Great way to explore the controversial subject of government surveillance which was more frightening than any 80's demon film. Overall I would give this documentary a 9.5/10 as its flaws were few and its quality immense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>-Citizenfour is a 2014 documentary film directed by Laura Poitras, concerning Edward Snowden and the NSA spying scandal. The film had its U.S. premiere on October 10, 2014 at the New York Film Festival and its UK premiere on October 17, 2014 at the BFI London Film Festival. The film features Glenn Greenwald and was co-produced by Poitras, Mathilde Bonnefoy, and Dirk Wilutzky, with Steven Soderbergh and others serving as executive producers. Citizenfour won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature at the 2015 Oscars.--Reception:-Citizenfour received widespread critical acclaim. It has a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 129 critics, with an average score of 8.3/10. Metacritic gave the film an 88 out of 100 based on a normalized rating of 38 reviews. -Ronnie Scheib of Variety wrote "No amount of familiarity with whistleblower Edward Snowden and his shocking revelations of the U.S. government's wholesale spying on its own citizens can prepare one for the impact of Laura Poitras's extraordinary documentary Citizenfour... far from reconstructing or analyzing a fait accompli, the film tersely records the deed in real time, as Poitras and fellow journalist Glenn Greenwald meet Snowden over an eight-day period in a Hong Kong hotel room to plot how and when they will unleash the bombshell that shook the world. Adapting the cold language of data encryption to recount a dramatic saga of abuse of power and justified paranoia, Poitras brilliantly demonstrates that information is a weapon that cuts both ways." -Spencer Ackerman writes in The Guardian: "Citizenfour must have been a maddening documentary to film. Its subject is pervasive global surveillance, an enveloping digital act that spreads without visibility, so its scenes unfold in courtrooms, hearing chambers and hotels. Yet the virtuosity of Laura Poitras, its director and architect, makes its 114 minutes crackle with the nervous energy of revelation." -Time magazine rated the film #8 out of its top 10 movies of 2014 and called the film "This Halloween's Scariest Chiller". Vanity Fair rated it #4 out of its top 10 and Grantland rated it #3 of its top 10. Writing for the Chicago Tribune, former Defense Department intelligence analyst Alex Lyda penned a negative review, calling Snowden "more narcissist than patriot". David Edelstein reviewed the film mostly favorably, and jocularly advised viewers "don't buy your ticket online or with a credit card". -The film site Fandor has published an extensive survey of other articles and reviews about Citizenfour, updated through December 25, 2014. --Lawsuit:-In December 2014, retired naval officer and oil executive Horace Edwards of Kansas filed suit against the film's producers "on behalf of the American people" for aiding and abetting Snowden's leaks. The Hollywood Reporter provided some legal analysis, noting observers opining that Edwards may not have legal standing to pursue the lawsuit. Edwards also challenged the film's Oscar eligibility on the grounds that Poitras' 2013 short film showing Greenwald interviewing Snowden constituted a previous release of Citizenfour, rendering it ineligible under Oscar rules. The Academy rejected the claim, noting that "the Guardian interview appears in less than two minutes of the documentary", and ruled that Citizenfour was eligible for Oscar consideration. -In February 2015, the filmmakers asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas to dismiss the lawsuit on standing and jurisdictional grounds, and on First Amendment grounds citing Bartnicki v. Vopper. The plaintiff officially dropped the case on April 3, 2015.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what Snowden did is indisputably courageous, but also, as a whistle-blower, he is not "the chosen one"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The timing couldn't be more appropriate to watch this Oscar-winning fact-based documentary about the exclusive coverage of the man behind "PRISM Door", Edward Snowden and the repercussions afterwards, simply because under the present background of rampant terrorist attacks globally, whether or not each individual's privacy can be collectively sacrificed in exchange for a possible safeguard of personal safety?It is really self-evident to see the controversy of the situation, the bare bones of the debate is principle Vs. exigency, which is all based on one presumption that we permit our governments to put surveillance on our daily activities of all the citizens, then all the terrorism can be maximally forestalled. If it is the case, how many of us is willing to do so, to forswear the civil liberty? There is a big question mark for this, since it is glaringly against the canon of democracy where all the Western countries are built upon. If we allow that to happen, it will become a huge setback in human history, more pointedly, surveillance may not be a fail-safe manoeuvre to counter terrorism at all, while its collateral damage would include many unimaginable infringements of each individual's personal interests, if all the data can be easily at a wrongdoer's disposal.So, that's why we should stand on the same page with director Laura Poitras and her allies in the film, particularly at a time when the dark cloud of probable danger is hovering above everyone's head, we cannot lose our ground of the nitty-gritty. Largely intriguing human's innate proclivity of inquisitiveness, CITIZENFOUR cunningly proffers the first-hand expos of Snowden when he hid in Hong Kong and contacted with journalist Glenn Greenwald and The Guardian reporter Ewen MacAskill to go through the scandalous disclosure, meanwhile simultaneously a camera is recording by Poitras on the spot. Now, since all the sensational hullabaloo has dissipated, one can be in a more poised state to watch this film, not just the big picture, we can get a preview of what's inside a man like Snowden, his entire process of "coming out". Poitras selectively and disinterestedly lays out a quite frank introduction of him, what he did is indisputably courageous, but also, as a whistle-blower, he is not "the chosen one", if it were not him, as a matter of time, sooner or later there would be another conscience-aware insider to speak out, the scheme of NSA (USA National Security Agency) is simply too massive to cover, thus more crucially, we should turn our target to them and fish out how that plan can be engineered through all the bureaucracy, yet, this is far from a perfect world, at least for now, the answer is moot.After Snowden left Hong Kong, Poitras' camera can no longer focus on him but on Greenwald and others, whom she has approach to film, what happens doesn't register the same intensity, since anyone who has a healthy common-sense knows which side we should lean on. There is a final reel of watching Snowden's life with his girlfriend in Moscow, no close-up, but medium-shot, soon the film also brings down its curtain, savours of a tad dissatisfaction.As one interviewee mentions, Snowden's whole adventure sounds like a John le Carr novel, so surreal but it is indeed a cast-iron fact, Poitras' documentary serves best as an awareness- agitating gateway to invite us to inspect our own government and resist the temptation of a pipe dream - there is no deus ex machina in solving a deep-rooted social problem. With regard to cinephiles, this film might as well serve as an inviting amuse-gueule for the upcoming Oliver Stone's adaptation, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, let's wish it will be at least remotely le Carr- esque in light of Stone's recent patchy productions.</fullReview>

Snowden repeats like 10 times he does not want it to be about him but it actually kinda is. You get almost no info over what beans he is actually spilling. Most scenes are him sitting around in the hotel with the journalists saying mostly nothing useful. What this docu does is put a face on one of the mayor Leakers in the world and now Snowden is now as well known as Julian Assange (who has a cameo in the docu). If you want to know more about what whistles Snowden actually blew then go and do some reading on the internet. It will be a better investment of your time then watching this nonsense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Winner of this year's Best Documentary feature at the Academy Awards, Citizenfour is an insightful and rare glimpse into the politically charged revelations of former NSA sub-contractor Edward Snowden that has seen him become a Julian Assange like figure of the modern world and one of the wanted men on America's most hated list.Before Oliver Stone's high profile Joseph Gordon Levitt retelling of the Snowden story hits our screens sometime next year, Citizenfour offers us the best chance to get to know Snowden the "person" not the news headline and also get background as to why this clearly smart and sophisticated young man choose to unleash the National Security Agency's real dealings to the world through his touch base with the Guardian newspaper and documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras.Citizenfour (Snowden's code name in email contact with reporters and filmmakers) is not a documentary worth seeing for any other reason other than the fact it's an incredibly intimate and unflattering look at the week in the life of Snowden when the news was being prepped for the world at just what was going on behind closed doors. Snowden allowed filmmaker Poitras access to his hotel room as he carried out meetings with the Guardian's reporters Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill and while watching we feel like a fly on the wall as this world changing news is gathered and the dots are joined together. In these close-nit meetings Snowden comes across as a likable and thoughtful persona that cares not for his own goals, rather the lives of his fellow citizens both at home and abroad.Snowden's recollections of what lay at the fingertips of the NSA are both revealing and frightening and he displays a clear understanding of just why this information can't be left behind closed doors. After watching Snowden talk, you'll be hard pressed to look at your phone or computer in the same way as before.With Steven Soderbergh's presence here as a producer, Citizenfour has a polished feel but really as a film making piece there's nothing to ride home about here and the true star of the show is Snowden himself. Perhaps a slightly strange choice for a Best Documentary win at the Oscars considering the film mainly consists of a camera planted solely around Snowden, Citzenfour is none the less an intriguing and honest look into one of the modern eras most explosive information leaks.3 ? tension riddled fire alarm tests out of 5</fullReview>

For some, he is a hero, for others a traitor. What guided him, intrigues not only the whole world but also the director. Careful observation of a person with paranoia, who knows the ins and outs of the world's surveillance. CitizenFour with "My Land" and "The Oath" by Laura Poitras may be included in the political trilogy, presenting the US post 9/11 events. The first two films related to the war in Iraq. In a broader aspect, these films are a contribution to a commentary about the trauma of terrorism. Citizenfour is a documentary immortalizing eight Hong Kong's days in Edward Snowden's life. The movie was shot during journalist disclosure from The Guardian: Gleen Greene and Ewen MacAskill from The Washington Post, on US bugging systems. In January 2013 years, Laura Poitras began to receive emails from the user nicknamed"citizen four". Letters contented spokes of possession, evidence for the existence of the NSA surveillance program and were able to demonstrate the relationship between state agencies and private companies. Big Internet corporations like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Youtube were involved. They depended on the surveillance network and also stretched to a telecommunications company collects information used social networking sites, email accounts, VoIP gateway. What's more, the information also exposed the phone -hacking worldwide cooperation. In a face of those facts, she the director could not pass by. Contact was kept in a secret from the world, the price for recklessly was too high. After five months, Laura and journalists meet in Honk Kong. From that moment on, camera wanders, keeps an eye on them, record everything that happens around Edward, clings to the form. Most of the events take place at the hotel. Claustrophobic, cramped room, which becomes a metaphor for paranoia, in which Edward lives. The creators draw the viewer into a world of internal events. The interview is interrupted several times by telephone from the outside. Someone has information that in the hotel is a whistle blower and he wants to talk to him. Snowden full of suspicion lies the lady from reception drawls information all in defense of his life. In the end, they move to another room, where no one will bother them. We are in the center of events, don't know whom to trust and who not. We know when the characters disappear when hiding from the establishment. There is a threat. You feel the thrill and suspicion. Paranoia effectively granted heroes and spectators. CitizenFour focuses on the activist, what drove him, how he thinks, how behaves? It turns out that in the whirlpool of scandal, shocking information and facts is the man who had the civil courage to sacrifice his well-being, for larger, more important cause. The director creates a very private image of Edward. Locked in a small room, weighing his words, covers the notebook camera, hiding from technology. In the film, Edward is a balanced man, calm and aware of consequences. His common looks are significant, here is the boy who was brought up in the spirit of the American democratic consciousness. The logic of his statements and control what he says, how he thinks attracts the viewer. Will not find in him the desire of fame, the hero himself says explicitly that does not want to conceal the problem, about which informs. It is easy to oppose his character to Julian Assange. The Australian is determined hacktivist, uncompromising and anti-establishment. At all costs, he wants to share gained information. His data leading awareness, on the consequences in human life (disclosure of the names of agents on foreign territory) is distant to the American.Snowden opts for other solutions.Protagonists are accompanied by an aura of mystery and danger. These treatments reflect the circumstances of the world, which we will live in. Always in hiding, paranoia, network eavesdropping and constant uncertainty. There's no denying that the director turns up the atmosphere of threat. Citizenfour is an example of a film touching the interesting topic. This film is interesting not because of the form, but what undertakes.Read more on visualandwriting.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great documentary with one big flaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent documentary and important viewing for anyone who wants to have a more informed perspective on the extent to which we are being monitored in post-9/11 America. My only complaint has to do with the extensive text which sometimes appears on-screen. Many of these sentences convey information that is critical to the story, and yet the production team decided to use a font that is so small that it's virtually impossible to read on a television. In those passages there is no voice-over, so there's no way to get the information but to read it off the screen. I had to get up from my seat and stand right in front of the screen to read it. Given that the majority of the people who see this film will see it on TV, in my opinion the producers made a bad mistake by making the font so small.Still one of the better documentaries I've ever seen.</fullReview>

At the beginning I thought it is an ordinary boring movie that just talks about hackers, but when I saw the rating, I decided to just go and watch it. After watching this movie, you will feel shocked and fooled. I thank all of the movie creators and participants for being under a great risk in order to show us the truth of the global governments, and to show us that freedom is just a lie. This movie made me think about throwing away my electronic devices away. I do not want to write any spoilers, so go and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some aspects could have been tighter, but it is history unfolding and although the focus is Snowden, we also are shown why he was important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite interesting to read some of the discussions here around this film ? or rather some of the diatribes, since mostly minds seem to be made up and a lot of comments really focus on Snowden before and above anything else ? whereas those on the other side of the argument would rather not classify Snowden's actions but rather talk about what his release of information told us about the world we now live in. As with many arguments, the truth tends to lie in a grey area in the middle of the two opinions, and personally I think it is as clear that Snowden betrayed his Government as it is clear that it was important he did so.The film gets that balance pretty well because it isn't really looking back at the image of Snowden retrospectively, but rather it is him as things unfolded in that fateful week. This is important because in providing this access, we see a more honest version of him ? a slightly nerdy, na?ve, and paranoid man who is brave enough to make a step he cannot come back from, but at the same time probably not really aware of what he really is about to be in. The candid footage also reveals a certain amount of self-importance in Snowden too, so although he is sincere when he talks of avoiding being the story, there is a certain amount of him wanting to be of note within it too. Where the film does allow him this space is understandable and forgivable, mainly because ultimately it is history being made and recorded, not a dramatic recreation.It is also for this reason that the film can be forgiven for spending too long in the hotel room, and for including longer silent sequences of Snowden typing. However Poitras does do well with her film to keep us in mind as to why what Snowden did was of value ? whether you agree with him doing it or not. We are shown the nature of the Government's deception, and a bit of understanding of the scale of the domestic and international surveillance and data mining; I think the film could have done more on this, but regardless, it balances this reasonably well so that it is about Snowden at that time, but also presented in context.As a 2-hour documentary, there are aspects/sections that could have been tightened up and, conversely, bits that could have been expanded upon, however it does well to frame the significance of the Snowden leak, while also keeping the majority of the film on actual history being made. It is an imperfect film in some ways, but yet fascinating in its factuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CITIZENFOUR is the documentary that was being shot when US whistleblower Edward Snowden decided to go public with his story of America's NSA spying on its own citizens as well as the rest of the world. It's a vivid, paranoid tale told in a thoroughly compelling way, no matter what you think of the protagonist and his motives.The documentary kicks off by explaining the background to the situation to its viewers before holing up with Snowden in a Hong Kong hotel, where things begin to play out in real time. And from this point in it becomes unmissable, a story of paranoia and spying in a digital age. It's frightening how much this has in common with the likes of the supposedly fictional Bourne movies.There's an element of tragedy here, a la THE INTERNET'S OWN BOY, which told how Aaron Swartz was persecuted in a similar (but even less deserving) way, but in the end I found this to be a story of hope: how a team of dedicated journalists can outwit even one of the most powerful agencies in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone needs to watch this especially if you are a US citizen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't watched too many documentaries, but I doubt many are as tied into key historical events as Citizenfour is. Unlike most documentary film makers, director/producer Laura Poitras didn't simply think that Snowden was a cool subject and decide to interview him, she was asked by him to be a witness to and to help him blow the whistle on the NSA. This film is sort of like if Woodward and Bernstein had videotaped all of their conversations with Deep Throat and made a documentary with that footage. Unlike your typical Michael Moore style documentary that simply seeks to argue one side of a policy issue, this film is documenting a key player's moral qualms with the actions that he did and the system he was a part of in real time, which is much more valuable. You may think Snowden is a traitor and disagree with his stance on the US government's actions, but that doesn't mean that these issues of Rights vs. Security shouldn't be heavily debated by US citizens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated propaganda.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since films first starting being produced, many of them have had a political agenda, whether it be subtle or Leni Riefenstahl levels of obvious. However, that aspect alone shouldn't affect your judgment of the film overall, as you are reviewing the film, not the viewpoint it represents. Take Citizenfour for example, the documentary about Edward Snowden. Despite the prejudice I personally have for Snowden, I still had an open mind to the film. However, it is a badly made and boring film which lacks any structure, making it one of the most overrated films in quite some time. The documentary focuses on Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower who leaked NSA's surveillance activities to the world. Here, we see his leaking of the story to The Guardian and him hiding out around the world in order not to be caught by the US government. On top of this, there is also footage of NSA building surveillance sites and worldwide governments trying to stop the NSA's spying. While it sounds compelling, the film is anything but. One main reason for this is that a lot of the film takes place inside Snowden's Hong Kong hotel room, without much happening, outside of Snowden watching TV and getting dressed. Whoopee. It also doesn't help that the film is poorly structured. Besides the initial boredom you'll experience from watching Edward Snowden in his hotel room, the film also randomly puts in the aforementioned footage of the NSA building these sites and of the foreign governments without much context besides the film's obvious message (government surveillance is bad). It's put together in a very sloppy manner, and while I understand the circumstances behind this (director Laura Poitras had the pressure of the authorities finding her), it demonstrates the lack of experience Poitras has. It just makes you wish she would have handed the footage to someone with more skill, as it would have made the film more coherent. Another problem is how overly one-sided this film is. I understand that many documentaries are biased towards a certain view, but at least they often consider the other side of the debate. For example, a good documentary like The Times Of Harvey Milk may portray people like Milk's assassin Dan White and John Briggs (of the controversial Briggs Initiative) as morally bankrupt, but also tries to explain their actions and humanise them to an extent. Not here though. Not only does the film ignore the other viewpoint, but portrays it as completely dangerous and volatile. So as you can imagine, there's no mention as to why the system was set up (in order to prevent disasters like 9/11 from repeating themselves), why the authorities are after Snowden (as he threatened national security) or the negative consequences of Snowden's actions (potentially giving terrorists a loophole to go through in order to harm innocent lives - the fact that the Boston marathon bombers are mentioned at one point makes this factor more important).It also portrays Snowden in an overtly perfect manner, almost saintly, for his exposure, as if he was a kind young man wanting to protect the American people. So factors like how he didn't even read all of the documents he leaked or how thanks to him, Al-Qaeda are now changing their communication methods in order not to get caught by the NSA don't enter the conversation. Even some things that are mentioned in the film unintentionally work against him, mainly how he has put his own family at risk, and doesn't even try to protect them. On top of this, you can't help but feel that some of the criticisms of the NSA's actions in the film are filled with hypocrisy, mainly that of the Brazilian government, a country with higher internet censorship than the United States. I wouldn't mind the politics as much if the film was good, as I have enjoyed films in the past but don't necessarily agree with their ideology. Citizenfour however is extremely dull and boring, making the questionable politics even more problematic.In conclusion, Citizenfour is a very bad documentary which is poorly structured, tedious and sloppily handled, and is a blatant Leni Riefenstahl-esque propaganda piece for Snowden, that not only glorifies one side and ignores the other, but demonizes that same side as well. It is also notable for something that is becoming a major problem in our culture as a whole: the glorification of criminals in the media. There's no problem if you think Snowden was in the right, but all too often, people are praised and martyred in the media through their behaviour, despite being dangers to society, leading to the silencing of those who criticise them, regardless of their legitimate points. Usually this applies to traitors like Snowden who are treated as heroes as well as terrorists like the IRA and many Jihadists being excused as martyrs, both of which undermine the serious consequences of their actions. On top of this, we see gangsters like the Kray Twins being made out as folk heroes and common thugs like Mark Duggan &amp; Michael Brown being seen as innocent victims. All of this shows how criminals are portrayed as heroes, which encourages both the infliction and support of illegal behaviour through their media endorsement, meanwhile we see the constant lynching of groups like the police and the NSA for protecting a free society. This not only divides people to antagonize one another but also makes people forget who the real bad guys are, leading to a society based on lies and deceit, rather than truth and honesty. This film (along with its undeserved media acclaim and Oscar win) are a testament to this, showing that society is confused as to where our priorities lie and who are the bad guys truly are. Because of this, I suggest that you skip Citizenfour, as not only is it cruddy agitprop, but as it glorifies a potential traitor, makes it rotten to the core.</fullReview>

Many U.S. residents may ask, "What's so bad about that?" since they've been raised as Neo-fascists with no regard for human rights. But, as Snowden (with his legal and journalist colleagues) say here in CITIZENFOUR, the Obama Administration has cleverly substituted the word "privacy" for the references to "Freedom" and "Liberty" in our Declaration of Independence, knowing that the majority of brain-washed, Neo-fascist Americans will respond, "If you're not doing anything wrong, you don't NEED any privacy." This movie would not be running in large multiplex theaters (where I saw it today) IF it had further explicated all the outrages against humanity perpetrated by the weasels currently claiming to be our government with our best interests at heart. They do give a chilling example, early on. ANY government critic, whistle-blower, or out-spoken IMDb reviewer is "purged" in such a fashion that your death is reported as being from an "accident" or "natural causes." Snowden's group gives the example of the National Security Agency (NSA) thugs coordinating your credit card information with your subway pass usage, so that you can be mysteriously pushed to your doom in front of an on-coming train by an "unknown stranger" (something that is making the news more and more often nowadays). Another 2014 film, KILL THE MESSENGER, dealt with the fatal car "accident" which claimed the life of another whistle-blower. All in all, CITIZENFOUR makes Germany's WWII-era Gestapo secret police look like small potatoes or "Keystone Kops" in comparison to the Cybergoons and their henchmen of the Obama Administration.</fullReview>

This would have been a wonderful long forme article in the New Yorker, Atlantic or Vanity Fair where copy editors knock it into shape to make every word count. Thankfully there is no print equivalent of out of focus camera work, visual padding with no commentary, white noise background sound (prevalent at the start of the film) or sloppy filming of three men, in a Hong Kong hotel, discussing how to leak secrets. It could all have been summed up in a few thousand words and two or three photos in a magazine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate fly-on-the-wall documentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of Edward Snowden is one of the most fascinating events in modern history. The sacrifices he has made to do what he thinks is right, are almost beyond comprehension. You can't help but wonder: who is Snowden, and why did he do what he did? Those two questions are, almost literally, asked in 'Citizenfour'. And the answers are so crystal clear that it's almost chilling. Snowden is an ordinary guy, and he is willing to risk imprisonment in order to warn mankind against the massive privacy infringements that are being carried out. Even the cool, almost calculated way he expresses these thoughts, is breathtaking. Citizenfour is the ultimate fly-on-the-wall documentary. A large part consists of footage from inside the hotel room in Hong Kong where two journalists meet Snowden and help him release the explosive information he possesses. These are fascinating images, filmed with a simple hand-held camera and hardly any cinematographic intervention. Director Poitras, one of the two journalists, combined this footage with news programmes about Snowden's revelations, additional material from before and after the Hongkong episode, and e-mails between the protagonists. The result is a film with a lot of conversation, sometimes about less interesting subjects such as the safety protocols used by the intelligence agencies, and by Snowden himself for his communication with the journalists. At certain moments, some effort is needed to remain concentrated and focused. From a cinematographic point of view, the film is not so interesting. If the subject wouldn't have been Snowden, this would have been an average movie. In this respect, it's an open question how politically motivated the Oscar for this film was. It's the incredible story behind it that makes this film fascinating, not the cinematographic achievements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Important Films You Will Ever See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who's ever read George Orwell's dystopian masterpiece "1984" probably hoped that the day when it all becomes real would never happen. Unfortunately folks, it appears that day may very well be on the horizon, if it isn't already here now. In 2013, the world learned that not only was the National Security Agency collecting millions of phone records without the consent and knowledge of the American people, but that it was also monitoring their email, banking, and pretty much any electronic communication. We learned all this because of one man: Edward Snowden. An employee at a contractor for the NSA, Snowden became concerned about the sheer amount of information the NSA was collecting on a daily basis after 9/11, information that had absolutely nothing to do with terrorism. So, in an effort to divulge what he knew, he contacted the director of the film, Laura Poitras, and reporter Glenn Greenwald. This film is that story. In the beginning, we see shots of a long dark tunnel passing the camera by and then we are treated to narration of emails that detail the first contact between the director and a mysterious source known as Citizenfour. It isn't long before they meet in a Hong Kong hotel room and we are introduced to the source himself, Edward Snowden. His story is surprising and shocking, even to an experienced reporter like Greenwald. From him, we learn that the NSA is collecting more data now than it ever has in its entire history and he has the files to prove it. Phone records, emails, text messages, bank records, every electronic transaction or action you do is being monitored by the federal government. And it's not just Americans: The government is also monitoring foreign countries, be it Brazil or Germany! In the course of all this, we get a little insight into the man who choose to reveal it all. Right from the start, Snowden makes it clear he doesn't want this to be about him; he knew the risks of what he was doing when he first took them and accepts whatever comes next. And the film does follow what happens next, be it Snowden's attempt to get asylum in Hong Kong to visiting him in his ultimate and current destination at the time of this writing, Russia. The film also explores the question what happens to a democracy when there is no privacy anymore and what does it mean to liberty in general? The film brilliantly explores all this with simple but effective tools, such as allowing us to get to know Snowden the man as well as the use of actual emails between Snowden and the reporters as a means of narration. All of this, plus testimony of NSA and intelligence officials lying through their teeth mixed in, helps create a dark and oppressive mood throughout the film. In addition to Snowden, we also treated to interviews with former NSA employee William Binney, who had similar concerns about the NSA's spying program that was implemented after 9/11. In the end, it doesn't matter whether you think Snowden is a traitor or a whistle-blower. The film is able to transcend Snowden and make you examine the issue itself. Right now, as I write this review, I am probably being watched. As you read this review, YOU are probably being watched, and it's the same if you make a call, shoot a text, or send an email and that should really bother you. For if you harbor a political thought or belief that is unpopular to the state, what's there to prevent the state from cracking down on dissent sometime in the future? And for those who say, 'Well, I've got nothing to hide', I say this: "Everyone has something to hide. And if they couldn't hide it, the world would be in a lot worse mess than it is." Those words were written by Richard Matheson and they as true today as they were then. Our rights are being systematically violated on a grand scale everyday and if you don't think that's a big deal, I would invite you to read about the history of dictatorships like Hitler or Stalin to know where that leads to. Remember, folks, every dictatorship from the beginning of time has told its subjects it was doing what it did for the greater good. It has never been more important to question authority than it is now. For in the end, folks, if America is becoming just another banana republic, what's the point in being proud of the red, white, and blue? And on that note, watch "Citizenfour" and a second time and remember,"Always love your country, but never trust your government!" - Robert Novak</fullReview>

This is a documentary that everyone has to see, share and discuss. We are literally walking right into George Orwell's fabled 1984. People like Snowden have given us the opportunity to discuss this reality and, at the very least, be somewhat aware of the lies and propaganda. It's not Snowden who should be on trial, but all of our so called 'elected' leaders. In a documentary littered with important quotes, one that comes quickly back to mind is when Snowden explains his reasons for coming forwards as a need - "to speak out against a system that he felt was no longer based on the principles of the elected and the electorate, but of the ruler and the ruled."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's not a film about me. It's a film about us."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I begin my review with Edward Snowden's message, and it is a powerful one addressed to the viewers of "Citizen Four". Laura Poitras was *chosen* to take on what is considered one of the most successful documentaries of the last decade, and it is such a big responsibility to cover up a topic that, not only is considered a treason-like, but also a threat, to local and international mass- surveillance corporations/Big-Brothers.The bravery and integrity of the document is highly striking, and the truth of what is being filmed is too blatant that is might be confused with a highly crafted fiction. In a world where lies and tricks are well disguised, standing out *artistically* for the truth of this heavy weight is indeed an act of true heroism.Although the documentary features Snowden, it just does not put him at the center of interest, rather, it centers the "ideals" of individual privacy via the mass virtual exchange, at stake, to question and criticize. Why are we being spied on, if we are not doing anything wrong!?There are no answers to the dilemma of mass surveillance privacy infringement, that is not what this documentary is about; therefore, try to seek and draw solutions is just a waste of time. Nevertheless, the documentary strongly invites viewers to think for themselves about their individual freedom to use technology.The film is a thought-provoking and eye-opener piece of art to what surrounds our use of technology and how we are (or maybe not) aware that we are being watched-over. It also questions the future of Internet, the future of the extent to which we are going to be exposed, and for what purpose.I highly recommend this documentary, and it is to be watched several times, not because of its heavy material or dialogs, but for the insights it brings to the surface as you go on watching real-life events, with real people interacting without scenarios and most of all, with the clumsiest ending one can ever think of, as there are just no answers, thus, no ending.And I end my review the way I started it, this is a movie about us; ordinary individuals using technology for daily life purposes. Think about that..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'CITIZENFOUR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 'Best Documentary' Oscar front-runner, at the upcoming 87th Academy Awards, is this feature about the recent NSA spying scandal. It was directed by Laura Poitras and features multiple interviews with whistleblower Edward Snowden. The film also features Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill; the journalist and reporter who interviewed Snowden. The movie received near unanimous critical praise and is widely considered one of the most important films of the year. I agree.The film begins in January 2013, when director Laura Poitras first started receiving encrypted emails from someone calling themselves 'CITIZENFOUR'. She had already been working on her next documentary film, for multiple years, about domestic surveillance; as a result of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks (the film was intended to be the third part of her 9/11 trilogy). In the emails, 'CITIZENFOUR' claimed to have evidence of illegal wiretapping; performed by the NSA and other intelligence agencies, around the world. Five months later, Poitras (along with Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill) flew to Hong Kong to meet the unanimous stranger, who then identified himself as Edward Snowden. The interviews Poitras filmed there, became the makings of this film.The movie starts out a little slow, but once it gets going it never lets up! It feels more like a political thriller than a documentary feature, at times, and it's also completely enthralling and informative. A lot of the information, revealed in the film, was already public knowledge (prior to the movie's release) but to see it as it was happening, in intimate detail, is pretty emotional and involving. Viewers really get a feel for what kind of a person Snowden is; he's not only one of the bravest and biggest political heroes, in recent times, but he's also a funny and very compassionate human being (just like a lot of people). The film is not only one of the most important movies of the year but it's also one of the most entertaining; it's about as good as documentaries get. Since 'LIFE ITSELF' was snubbed this year (for an Oscar nomination), I definitely think this deserves to win the Academy Award (for Best Documentary Feature)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/8N2akEQThTU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great suspense play resulted from reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well The movie itself contains the great weight of the suspense due to people has already knew who Edaward Snowden is. This risks the movie to be very predictable and thus be boring in the final product. Moreover, the editing and the footage choice also completes the movie in having a nice additional suspense thriller element to it. There are moments where it feels like forced dramatization like what we see on supposedly real TV reality shows, but overall instead the great editing of the movie that makes it great. We can feel the tension building when we hear the news overage on the TV the day after the story is published. The filmmakers did very well in completing the movie with strong supporting footage from almost all around the globe.</fullReview>

You'll be better off watching PBS Documentary Series "Nova" on Cyberwar, which features Edward Snowden but also gives you MORE information about the reach of this surveillance program, interviews with other people related to the system, as well as analysis and conclusions on the subject, on the other hand "Citizenfour" is all about Edward Snowden in his Hong Kong hotel room, so we get a lot of long shots of him doing his hair, sleeping, and kinda just "hanging out", with very little information and analysis about the actual capabilities of the data gathering program... 0 Stars!!</fullReview>

Along with journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, Poitras goes to Hong Kong to meet the informant who turns out to be an NSA employee: Edward Snowden.As his identity is leaked to the media, Poitras is there to capture the epic fallout first-hand.While its predominantly shots of talking heads and redacted files, it's the content concerning the loss of privacy that makes Citizenfour the most important documentary in American history.Incidentally, the only thing the government learned from spying on citizens was they lie on their online dating profiles.

		<fullReview>Nothing is more heroic and more courageous than a simple person's decision to brave a much stronger world to do what he believes to be the right thing. He must face his own nervousness, instability, and fears, and he still does it unblinkingly. Here is what this documentary feature shows us through a portion of life of the 29-year-old Edward Snowden, whose revelation of the US domination in the world is only thunderous and earth-shattering. We look at the innocent and childlike face and personality of Mr. Snowden and we start to have difficulty breathing as we see extreme dangers awaiting him at every exit. The film shows us how he decides to turn his back on his job as a commissioned security specialist of the US government, determines to go public with what he knows and has in possession, and works with two veteran reporters to explain his viewpoint and action calmly and patiently, until we the viewer understand the philosophy behind his action. The film successfully protects Mr. Snowden from being demonized beyond recognition from the powers that be, who want Mr. Snowden to appear treacherous, unpatriotic, and mentally ill, in order to discredit his revelation and probably his entire life and existence. Still, Mr. Snowden, at times in tear and stressful, looks at his dangerous task in the eye. He realizes that death for him is not impossible, and he continues to assure us that others will step in and succeed him, if the succession is indeed a must. Quite serenely, the film ends in Mr. Snowden's own country. A place called uncharted territory. Thank you, Mr. Snowden, for distinguishing us human from animals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has got to be one of the most well directed documentary I have every seen. Everything about this movie is just smoothly and articulately done. The editing for this movie when it comes to the sources and interviews is integrated very well into this documentary. Despite it being a documentary it almost felt like a political movie with reporter characters delving into a government conspiracy. But what might really intrigue and interest most of the audiences is how this is a documentary and what really went down. I didn't really know much about Edward Snowden, just the basics of what he did as a whistleblower. But it was a somewhat of a impactful movie showing one of the ways the government can barge into and not abide by what is basic human rights and civil liberties. The human rights of privacy, which is something that can effect a lot of Americans. This documentary really showed how human beings would give away their civil liberties for what they deem as protection. Seeing how most people just didn't care. Overall this is a thought-provoking and solid documentary that anyone who like or at least appreciate documentaries should check out.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that needs to be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2014 was a big year for important documentaries that define where we are as a modern society. A little while ago I reviewed The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz, a film that dealt with the freedom of information and the power of the internet and media to universally share that information. Citizenfour serves as a great companion film. It details the Edward Snowden controversy that went down last summer when Snowden, a server administrator for the National Security Agency, left the country with thousands upon thousands of files exposing the NSA's tracking and logging of information about the American public shadily gained through phone and internet monitoring. The film begins before the events take place, as Snowden actually contacted the director about documenting this major information leak he was about to facilitate. Citizenfour unfolds in real time, sitting with Snowden in his Hong Kong hotel room as he dumps his information onto two journalists, who in turn expose the information to the masses. Real life drama unfolds right there on the screen as a drama that rivals most fictional political thrillers. Unless you were living in a doomsday prepper underground bunker last June, you probably heard all about the Edward Snowden fiasco that completely shook up the state of our national security. In this time a lot of information was released, a lot of it getting muddled and skewed as new developments transpired every day for about a week. The media obviously had a difficult time handling so massive an information leak and the story behind it all that dealt with Mr. Snowden. Citizenfour fills any holes from the original story as it happened. These exact events unfold in real time and the gravity of the information and its effect on the American people, their government, and Snowden is all on display. It paints a clear as day picture of what exactly happened, but also serves as a harsh reminder of how quickly we all forgot about something so major, and how we continue to choose to forget about the countless ways in which our privacy is compromised by our own government. And that right there is what makes Citizenfour so important. It details events that everyone needs to know about, no one should forget about, and everyone should be very concerned about. It's imperative that everybody knows the full Edward Snowden story, and this is what gives Citizenfour its significance. But beyond that it is also just an incredibly gripping film that turns these events into riveting political drama that bares the weight of a sledgehammer due to its importance to our modern political system. But what I love most about this film is that it is as much about the NSA and the information leak as it is about Snowden himself. Citizenfour is the alias that Snowden used while covertly corresponding with the film's director, and when you see this film that is an intimately introspective look into this courageous hero disguised as an American traitor you see the significance of calling the film Citizenfour. We get a look into the mind and attitude of a man who knows a terrifying amount of what goes on behind the closed doors of the NSA. His genuine paranoia says everything that needs to be said about the significance of what is going on with the NSA. Seeing how much concern and paranoia a hotel fire alarm test puts on Snowden should tell you exactly how serious this whole issue is. I'm positive that there can't be a more visceral and hard-hitting documentary about the issue of government spying than Citizenfour. It of course has the advantage of Snowden in the flesh to make it as impactful as it is, but this is what sets it apart from any third- hand editorial on the topic. Citizenfour is a real time documentation of an event that should have so much more attention put on it than it actually has had. This is a documentary that needs to be seen by as many people as possible, as it is one of the few things that could raise awareness about something free Americans should be more than a little concerned about. It reminds us why we can't just accept that this spying takes place and then move on with our day. It emphasizes how much something needs to be done, and uses Snowden as a prime example of actions that should be taken. Citizenfour is as frustrating as it is compelling, and you're doing a disservice to you and your country if you don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most relevant documentaries of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The importance of Citizenfour to our current society cannot be overrated. In truth, it is a wake-up call to everyone. Unless we take action to restore a proper balance in our governance, where the people control the government whom they elect, and not the reverse, we are going see a continued erosion of our liberties and our privacy under the guise of "national security". Behind the scenes, which Citizenfour only touches at, there is a tremendous sense of entitlement which certain agencies of the United States government, the British government, and probably others too, all feel they are entitled to use and as a consequence, are not accountable for the crimes they commit. To see President Obama declaring that "it would be better if Snowden had brought the matter to "them" for an open dialogue" (paraphrase) is like the lion inviting the sheep into its den for dinner. Such arrogant, dismissive and disingenuous behavior displayed by a man who is supposed to protect democracy is quite deplorable. Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras and Julian Assange are actually modern day heroes. They probably don't see it that way, because, as Snowden said, the story is not about him, the story is about restoring the balance of power (paraphrase). This should be shown as required viewing in school curricula - but of course, that would require a level of transparency and honesty which certain governments are far from possessing. Watch it! It's a wake-up call folks.</fullReview>

Now I have something to cheer for at the 'Best Documentary Feature' section. -The story, as controversial as some may find it, is incredibly compelling and true. -The biggest thing I have to complain about is the pace. This film is slow. Like really slow. Nothing much happens. -The acting is- Well the entire cast is composed of the actual people during the actual interviews, so yeah. Realistic acting. -Ditto characters. -The music is alittle repetitive and I can't really remember it. -That's like it. It's a documentary, so there is not a lot to judge. I will say that seeing both sides of the conspiracy was pretty intriguing. -It is surprisingly rated-R for a few F-words in one scene. They really could not have avoided it though, because it was real footage. -So if you like conspiracy movies or really well-done and real documentaries, Citzenfour is worth the time! However I found it slow and still uneventful, so I would say it is totally worth buying in a $5 bin.</fullReview>

I would have loved to see all the places where Snowdon did his secret stealing of information. No looking at the interiors of buildings that speak to the imagination like the Pentagon or the Edgar J. Hoover Building or whatever. None of that. The Oscar is mainly an unfair sneer at the Obama administration. But let me ask you, would any administration have done digital security in a different way? No, and certainly not a republican administration. After 9/11 global surveillance is a fact, and everybody knew that. The people who are against surveillance are also the first to cry blue murder in case of a terrorist attack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only feasible explanation for the near universal plaudits being garnered on Citizenfour is that people are recording their approbation of Edward Snowden's actions, not the film itself. Laura Poitras's doco is an execrable piece of film-making with no saving grace. The greatest proportion of the film takes place in a Hong Kong hotel room as 'Call me Ed' relates fragments of his reasoning and rationale to two journalists from The Guardian - when he's not seen gelling his hair or musing what length his stubble should be. He is far from articulate and there were no insights or revelations to capture any interest. We don't see his asylum flight to Russia as the director had hot-footed it back to Berlin after believing that she was being followed. Snowden came across as something of a narcissistic dreamer with a Year 10 mentality. Like the British Cambridge spies before him, he's probably now doomed to see out his days in alcoholic Moscow isolation when those who currently laud him lose interest when the next specious hash tag campaign comes along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best way that the Academy Award nominated documentary "Citizenfour" (and likely winner with the Ebert documentary not even nominated) can best described is a real life thriller. The material is basically a good script for a great thriller as well. It was even said at one part in the film that it could come right out of a John Le Carr novel. It is the newest film by Academy Award nominated director Laura Poitras and it was an interesting watch from start to finish with only very few exceptions. Here and there the film became too technical (internet science) or too difficult in terms of the law to understand for broad audiences. But it's not too often luckily. The best parts of these almost two hours where the scenes where we see Snowden live in Hongkong while television reports about the events that he started. Edge-of-seat stuff. The weakest part is probably the ending. The whole "this is not the end by far" part with the paper snippets and everything and Snowden acting like "wow this is so dangerous" felt truly cringeworthy to me sadly. Like taken from a bad thriller movie.Another positive mention goes to the fire alarm scene. I don't know if this was staged or real, but it had some comedic weirdness and danger to it. Nicely done. The film includes some sequences where we see chat communication between the protagonists which had already been done in the Wikileaks documentary from a year ago. That's not a criticism though. It worked well. Also, talking about Wikileaks, there is also one interview with Julien Assange about Snowden. As a whole, this is a good documentary with lots of contemporary importance. I am not sure if it is good enough to win the Oscar or if I would call it the best documentary film of the year, probably not, but its worth a watch and it is also certainly better than last year's very forgettable winner "20 Feet from Stardom". And it also offers some nice ground for discussion afterward about how it is acceptable to trade personal privacy for more protection from terrorist attacks. Anyway, nice to see Snowden stand up and tell people about the uncountable criminal activities of the Obama administration, especially in the light of people treating him as the new messiah after the Bush presidency. Boy did he disappoint in the last 6 years, not only in terms of his global surveillance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward Snowden, Superstar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to evaluate a documentary like this -- and that's what it is, a documentary. Snowden and Greewald play themselves. The reason it's hard to evaluate is that it's so well done, but on the other hand it plays so eagerly and smoothly into the prevailing paranoia.We hear Snowden explain how he was offended by the NSA's spying system. (The word "spying" is used as often as the more neutral "surveillance.") And, with ominous music in the background, we watch government representatives apparently lie to congress. They're clearly defined as the enemy, like Big Tobacco was. The names of Obama and Pelosi are brought up in a context suggesting hypocrisy. It's a government program that covers all Americans, not just suspects.Snowden himself comes across as intelligent, well spoken, and earnest. He's humanized. We learn where he was born, where he grew up, and how he came to have access to the information he absconded with.And that's about all we get -- an idealistic Snowden and Greenwald sacrificing themselves because of their opposition to what they call "the surveillance state." No one gets to present any other point of view.In statistics this is called the problem of truncated range. What's going on outside the box you're privileged to look at? There are clearly lots of problems with the program. The FISA court, which is supposed to issue warrants when surveillance of Americans is justified, has given the NSA a blank check, having refused only nine out of several thousand requests -- as of about a year before this is being written.What's ignored is the history behind the NSA's surveillance program. As presented, it sounds like a plan to root out enemies of a given administration, in this case Obama's. But the plan was begun in 2003, a lesson learned from the unanticipated attacks of 9/11. The secret program was called "data mining" at the time. The NY Times had the story for a year and sat on it, waiting for a response from the White House. None was forthcoming so the Times published it. Bush was publicly miffed, justifiably, I thought. A secret means of identifying suspected terrorists doesn't work very well when the terrorist's know about it. The plan was originally not the idea of the Obama administration, although the program makes it sound exactly like that.I won't go on with this critique, but the absence of this kind of information in a documentary turns it, not into an objective analysis of a complex problem involving a balance between privacy and national security, but into a skillfully done polemic.My final impression is that Greenwald is an ambitious reporter who saw an opportunity to amaze the world and made the most of it. Snowden, I have little respect for. Smooth, articulate, innocent looking, yes, but his personal history isn't one to inspire confidence in his character, which resembles that of a very clever psychopath. I mean the word "psychopath" to include its clinical meaning. He's record is spotty and he seems to enjoy his celebrity more than might be expected. Each time his name and photo begin to fade from the news, he makes some quasi-dramatic announcement that brings them back.And what has he done, really? I'm happy that NSA "overreach" was finally made public. It was pro bono publico. But Snowden himself, the vehicle for this revelation, violated two oaths to his country, stole secret data, hustled off and spilled the beans to the Chinese from a four-star Hong Kong hotel; then he rushed off to the former Soviet Union and spilled more beans.This will all feed into the national paranoia and some of us will swallow the documentary not simply as the truth, but as the whole truth. I wonder if the protection from NSA surveillance that may follow his actions is more than the damage he has done to national security.I don't think so. Everyone wants to avoid a systemic version of J. Edgar Hoover, but is this the way to go about it -- a self-obsessed part of the bureaucracy versus a renegade self-promoter? Some people will certainly feel differently than I do but that's okay. Our first amendment rights are still intact, after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enamoured?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Illuminating to see how everything unraveled. But director/producer/writer Laura Poirier was far too enamored with her subject to be considered a great documentarian. In her eyes, Snowden could do no wrong. He says he knows nothing about media, and yet he invites her along to document the entire unfolding &amp; conveyance to his media-scoop team. There are tons of vanity shots, where we get to see Snowden shave and style his hair with gel. There are hotel window-view beauty shots. There's a caper: how to get from one hotel room to the other without getting intercepted! There's romance: emails with the g/f. There's mystery: news notes are the new love notes. Never was there any discussion as to whether it was a prudent decision for Snowden to spill the beans, or whether Snowden used good judgment in releasing his trove. Not once did Snowden consider (verbally, at least) repercussions like loss of life to affected victims. In fact, his chief reason was b/c he wanted the internet to go back to his golden years of when you could chat about something w/someone across the globe. That sounded like a wish from a spoiled brat reared on internet milk; who never knew how life functioned pre-internet.In fact the whole thing was a big fat two-hour Ed Snowden blowjob.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Four: A Snow job.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that this movie is compelling filmmaking, that director Laura Poitras really brought the story of Edward Snowden to life. Trust me, it is not compelling viewing, it is run of the mill interviewing, and Snowden gets into a lot of technical jargon that the average viewer wouldn't understand or care about. The film is quite boring most of the time, and unintentionally funny at other times with Glenn Greenwald speaking horrible Portuguese with a thick American accent. The subject is compelling, but the movie is not. Laura Poitras has been detained, before ever making this movie, so she is hardly objective. As to why this movie received an Academy Award, I bet half the academy voters didn't even see the movie. They read a synopsis, and voted.The movie did remind me that Snowden wasn't even the original NSA leaker. The original leaker was William Binney, who resigned from the NSA in 2001, and leaked documents to the New York Times. The resulting Times story in 2005 was met with a collective yawn and people went on with their lives. This time, the perpetual Obama haters were joined by the handwringing liberals, who never liked the idea of government spying, and that gave the story legs for a while, but in the end nothing changed. If people give government vast power in the times of a national crisis, it's very hard to take that power away, and as long as people want to be constantly connected, texting and tweeting and facebooking, and blogging, the NSA will be listening. Get used to it. I object to the NSA listening programs for two fundamental reasons, it's a violation of privacy, and if the NSA is listening to my phone calls and reading my emails, they are wasting the country's time and money. But I have resigned myself to the fact that there is nothing I can do to change it. Enjoy my blog, NSA.My objections to the NSA program notwithstanding, I don't like Edward Snowden. He is no hero. He is a smug, sanctimonious megalomaniac. But instead of namecalling, let me tell you what would have made him a hero in my eyes. If Edward Snowden had released all that material to Greenwald and did not run away, first to Hong Kong, and then to Russia, and went to jail in the US, he would have been a hero, but instead, he is a coward. Snowden said many times in the film that he left clues to get caught, so what happens when he lets his identity be known, he runs away. Martin Luther King went to jail for his beliefs, Civil Rights laws were eventually passed, Gandhi went to jail for fighting British colonialism, the British ultimately left India. But Snowden, going to Russia, and feeding Putin our sources and methods, and being Putin's 'useful idiot' does not help the cause of ending the NSA spying on its own citizens, in fact it hurts it. Snowden should ask Boris Nemstov how tolerant Putin is of opposing views. I guess he can't do that now. Civil disobedience requires bravery, and Snowden has none. I'm sure the irony of living in a police state like Russia, with no freedom of speech or press, hasn't been lost on Snowden. He deserves his fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its "politcal significance, " Citizenfour is sadly a bore!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wikipedia tells us that in "January 2013, Laura Poitras received an encrypted e-mail from a stranger who called himself Citizen Four. In it, he offered her inside information about illegal wiretapping practices of the NSA and other intelligence agencies." That stranger was of course, Edward Snowden, and Citizenfour is Potras' documentary about the time in June 2013 when Snowden blew the whistle on the NSA from a hotel in Hong Kong, aided by Poitras and the investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald and The Guardian intelligence reporter Ewen MacAskill.George Packer writing in "The New Yorker," summarizes the structure of Citizenfour: ""Citizenfour" is a political thriller in three acts. In the first, a stranger approaches Poitras electronically, with a promise of dramatic disclosures. We meet critics of surveillance?Greenwald, Binney, Appelbaum?who warn of dark implications for American democracy. The second act begins with a shot of the black tunnel and the flashing overhead lights?a repetition of the opening credits, but this time the camera emerges into daytime Hong Kong. The rest of the act proceeds chronologically through the eight days in the hotel room, taking up a full hour of the hundred-and-thirteen-minute film." Indeed, the bulk of the documentary focuses on Snowden as he's interviewed as well as ruminates in his Hong Kong hotel over an eight day period. Packer argues that, "Even when the pace slows to the verge of boredom, the footage is mesmerizing, because we are watching a private encounter of great political significance unfold." I beg to differ with Mr. Packer. Simply because the documentary is "politically significant" doesn't mean it's a good documentary. Indeed, Mr. Packer is correct when he observes that the pace "slows to the verge of boredom."Why is it boring? Because Snowden has little to say beyond revealing that the NSA lied about their wiretapping activities. For Snowden and Poitras it's the principle of the invasion of privacy that really irks them. But as Michael Cohen, writing in the "The Daily Beast," points out, Snowden and company can't point to one specific person that was damaged by NSA activities: "In Citizenfour truth is nothing if not a moving target. Early on Poitras features a presentation by Jacob Appelbaum, a so-called "hacktivist," to a meeting of Occupy activists where he explains how metadata, like phone records or location information can be manipulated to provide an accurate description of one's life. The clear and unstated implication is that this capability not only can but also will be used to violate the privacy rights of ordinary Americans. None of this is proved by the documents Snowden stole. Indeed, 16 months after the initial leak, one is still hard-pressed to point to a single American who's been harmed by the NSA's domestic surveillance. This is a point even acknowledged by Greenwald who conceded this year in an NPR interview that there is no evidence the NSA "followed through on ? plans" to use "online activities to blackmail people or ruin their reputations, or otherwise coerce and threaten them." Of course had Snowden cited just one example of a person who was harmed by the NSA or other intelligence agency, his case would have been a thousand times stronger. But Snowden is no social worker?again, it's merely a theoretical principle that he's upset about.Even more damning is the fact that Snowden did not vet documents that could have harmed operatives in the field. Fred Kaplan, writing in Slate Magazine, grasps this point and writes cogently about it: "At one very interesting point in the film, Snowden tells Poitras and Greenwald, "Some of these documents are legitimately classified," and their release "could do great harm" to intelligence sources and methods. He adds, "I trust you'll be responsible" in handling them. This is what most baffles me about the whole Snowden case. What kind of whistleblower hands over a digital library of extremely classified documents on a vast range of topics, shrugs his shoulders, and says, I'll let you decide what to publish? He tells the two journalists that he's "too biased" to pick and choose himself. What does that mean? These are esoteric, in some cases highly technical documents; he's in a better position to know their implications than Poitras and Greenwald; certainly he could warn them, "Oops, I shouldn't have included this one. It's really sensitive." Despite its "political significance," one has a vague feeling that the "Citizenfour" story is "old news." Had Snowden made a convincing argument that US citizens were harmed as a result of NSA surveillance, than perhaps I would have been more sympathetic to his cause. But the fact that he irresponsibly leaked documents that could have led to reprisals against operatives in the field, that's unforgivable. Hence, I'm of the opinion that he should come home and "face the music." Poitras' "Citizenfour" is more a news item than a great work of art. I can understand that some may be impressed by its "political significance," but as a "work of art," it's sadly a bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No fresh perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's undeniably engaging to be a fly on the wall in Edward Snowden's hotel room during his historic whistle-blowing of the NSA, the film offers little more than a linear chronology of his actions, providing no fresh perspective. Its one provocative point - that the US government was spying on its own citizens without sufficient cause - is made over and over again without adding any dramatic weight or insight.Anyone familiar with the story will likely find it interesting to watch Snowden take his journey into very dangerous terrain to follow his principles. But then again, anyone already familiar with the story isn't going to learn anything new from seeing the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe I stayed up to watch this. This was just a journalistic circle jerk. Low on detail and just a bunch of journalists bigging themselves up.I worked in telephony back in the 90s. It was common knowledge that phone calls were monitored in the UK. All source and destination phone numbers are recorded for every call and always have been in digital telephony. It is called an itemised bill! Also how do you think engineers fix issues? They interrogate call logs and details!The bit that really made me laugh was the shaky photography of the Bude listening station. You can walk within metres past the station on the coastal path and take much better photos as I did a couple of years OK when we stayed in a little cottage in Morwenstow.This was just a program to raise their profile nothing has really changed, they haven't stopped anything. All they've done is alert stupid terrorists and pushed the security services into taking more severe measures to gather intel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Part legitimate, part trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SO this little film is based around U.S. whistle blowers in regards to the NSA's information gathering programs. I will say that overall it is interesting and a decent film. There are some parts of this that are absolutely legitimate, and another part that is ridiculous. It also features Ed Snowden. The NSA data collection is a bit of a tricky subject. The NSA collecting data on U.S. citizens is something I think is absolutely wrong and an invasion of privacy. Snowden, in my opinion should not be treated as a hero. I do, however think exposing the domestic spying program was a noble thing and I have no problem with him for that. This is something that should not be done, especially when they lied to Congress in hearings over this. This has been going on for years and I am almost baffled on why people did not know about this before Snowden because PBS did a documentary on this years earlier. That and the questions of privacy are legit.Now let's get into the weeds a bit. Snowden did not expose JUST the domestic spying program He also exposed operations outside the United States on foreigners and other nations. Why are people upset over that? The NSA is a spying organization. God forbid they actually spy... It also represents a double standard. After 9/11 intel agencies had to shoulder a lot of blame with a lot of people thinking they should have known about 9/11. A lot of people blame intel agencies for having bad intel when it comes to Iraq. Well, what do you want? They are not doing enough if something happens, but they are doing too much when nothing happens and we are safe. I understand foreign countries getting angry that we spied on them. Then again every country spies on others. It's part of securing your own country and when another world leader acts shocked, it is faux shock. Although I a do not condone this gathering of U.S. citizen data, non U.S. citizens in foreign nations are not subject to the U.S. constitution and to get out raged about spying abroad is just plain idiotic. Another part of this is an overblowing of what is going on. I agree personal communications should be off limits (when done on U.S. citizens) but the meta data collection pales in comparison to the amount of that can be gathered legally from things like social media. When you post something on social media you are pitting it out to the world. It is very easy for someone to just send a friend request and a lot of people play the "Lets see how many friends I can get," and will approve any and all requests. This makes a lot of things very public. Most sites you join come with disclosures that no one reads. So the NSA has no problem gathering info on us without invading your privacy. The going after reporters thing is also wrong. We have freedom of the press and the press isn't going to turn down leaks. Publishing is simply what they do and should do. In defense of the NSA though, the existence of these data gathering programs are a genie you cannot put back into the bottle. They exist and because they exist and have the potential to stop some violent acts, the government will do with the tools they have at their disposal. Given what we have seen with the Boston Marathon bombing, two men who the Russian government actually warned us to keep an eye on, it's likely that this is not as big of a threat at this time in comparison to the reach and abilities that Snowden has attributed to it. I will also say that Snowden comes off as paranoid, somewhat delusional and reeks of a young idealist who was intent on trying to make a name for himself in these disclosures. Don't sit and tell me the merits of what you exposed when you expose things other than domestic spying. Especially when it has national security implications. Every U.S. ctizen should have zero problem with a spy agency keeping an eye out on other countries unless you take for granted the relative safety we enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst documentary I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not understand why their direction of being watched by the government holds any meaning, at all. Yes, we are being tracked. Yes, if the government wants to get into my e-mail, or listen in on my phone calls, or know my financial information, they can. Who cares?This movie, in my opinion, was senselessly dull. Every scene was either showing how the government is watching out through electronic systems, or Edward Snowden asking about things like how much he should shave this morning. Nearly the whole thing takes place in a single hotel room, where he just keeps on jabbering on about useless information. He doesn't bring it down to any single force, he does not show any real form of horror coming about through the systems he's talking about, he's just showing off how paranoid and delusional he is about the government systems.Which makes the overall point of this movie very sad. If you are truly impacted emotionally or mentally about these goings on, then stop worrying about it, and just live your life. Don't give up your 2 hours of time to watch such a drab documentary, do something that will make you feel better. Go for a walk or do something with your family.Stop being paranoid about a system that can help in stopping illegal activities before they happen. Don't worry about what you say on the phone or in text, and don't plan out any acts of terrorism on your country. I can't believe I even have to say all of this, but seeing the praise that this documentary is getting shows me that you people have to take a step back.Quit worrying, and just enjoy your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the light. This is a romantic comedy western about a man named Ed who ventures into the land of snowden and wages war against hordes of orcs and zebras. Along the way he makes sex with Olivia Wilde and pre-plastic Renee Zellwegger, played by Daniel Day Lewis in character as Abraham Lincoln. Meanwhile the evil lord Nsa turns the citizens of district four to stone before escaping into the ninth dimension where it is believed Johnny Depp goes when he is in his happy place. It's a pulse pounding, riveting, and sexually arousing tale that boasts competent directing, decent writing, and an unbelievably confusing narrative. In other words, it was the best book I've ever read. Live long and prosper and may the odds be ever in your favor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No substance, nothing but boring hotel room conversation, 1/5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this movie and was interested from the start. I waited for a long time to see this movie. It showed up at two theaters in the area that are pretty grungy, so I waited and waited for it to show up at a nice more comfortable theater. So, I saw it today. I was incredibly disappointed, this movie had virtually nothing in it of any interest. It was long drawn out boring and unexplained sequences of Snowden, Greenwald and some others in motel room talk about how to talk about the information, but there was maybe one or two minutes of actual discussion of the information in the movie. I simply could not believe this. This was a total rip-off and waste of times and I hope everyone finds out and misses it. Minutes and minutes of Snowden talking about his shaver, trying to style his hair, mugging for the camera. Ugh ... this was really bad. In retrospect, what did I expect really since this is a mass market movie in the US about the excesses of the US government. Basically, what you could glean from the movie is just what we all already know. First, Snowden is skinny, has blonde hair, stubble, wears black glasses ... whoopee! Second, the NSA is collecting data and they can search it tying things together in the different ways database analysts have learned to do with other data. He talked a little about how the files he got were arranged, but did not show them, or say where they can be had. We know Greenwald has them, I guess he does, and some others, but like Wikileaks before it, the information from these documents is stopped, frozen and nothing is really coming out that is more detailed or specific. This could mean any number of things, but trying to imply data from a movie just means the movie is bad. Avoid this at all costs. 1/5. Useless unless you want to know what Snowden looks like and how fast he can type.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have been much more interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see this documentary and went down to the IFC yesterday in NYC. I was intrigued by the story because I don't really follow the news or news shows and only knew the general information about the Snowden saga. The documentary was filmed very nicely as documentaries go. Unfortunately, I felt that the editing was paced far too slow-- (i.e. Holding an establishing shot of the outside of a hotel for 10+ seconds when 4 to 5 secs would have been ample). The whole film was drawn out like this for no apparent good reason. I ended up bored for most of the first half. Tighter editing would have helped the pace AND make the dramatic tension of the unfolding story better. Also, I don't think any ground breaking information is brought to light in this documentary. The film is somewhat informative and somewhat interesting.</fullReview>
