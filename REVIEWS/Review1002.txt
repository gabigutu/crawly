		<shortDescription>Board this train!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one fantastic train ride. I love the creative ideas and the economical character setups. No need for too much heavy top-down moralization. This is a straight-up disaster flick with zombies coming in swarms from all directions. So we already know the archetypal characters - the coward, the brave one, the pregnant one, the youth in love, the heroic one and so on. The fun is in seeing which one will die first and who will live. This train is loaded with some colorful characters. Putting 80% of the action on a bullet train didn't constraint the wealth of inventive ideas one bit as the commuters escape the crazy zombies from car to car. The momentum is terrific and I kept marveling at all creative problem-solving; some I have never seen before. The character arc of the main actor from narcissistic anti-hero to titular hero is very potent and what injects the narrative with much forward power. Love the subtext of class and government hypocrisy, class division, vileness of human nature and the dreaded herd mentality. Ya ya ya, I know the movie never delves too deep into them. Because that would rob the movie of its relentless momentum. I think Paul Greengrass who made Jason Bourne needs to study the cinematography here. You don't need to do split-second cuts and shake the camera to make the audience feel in-the-moment. The action set-pieces are so well choreographed that I understand and see everything. Straits Times (my local papers) said the last act is disappointing with the train derailing, crashing into some cliché-obstacles and careening through melodramatic territory. Hello? This is Korean cinema - melodrama is expected and in this case welcomed with open arms. IMHO the first two acts are so explosively fun and rollicking thrilling that it practically earned its melodramatic ending. Heck! I was nearly tearing up. This is one of the most entertaining and unpretentious zombie movies I have seen in a while. This is one train you need to board.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies on a train!? Boss!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're leaving (leaving) on that Zombie Train to Busan (leaving on the undead train).Use to seeing Korean horror films about ghost, but Zombies!? This was refreshing.So this neglectful dad tries to make amends with his daughter by riding with her on the train (which she wanted to go by herself) to take her back to his ex-wife. Lucky for both of them as a zombie outbreak happens while their on the train. Now, their only hope for survival is to make it to the Busan stop.You really can't go wrong with a Zombie movie. It's rare that I've have seen one that I did not like. Train to Busan is definitely a good one too. Its filled with interesting characters. Other than the father daughter team, the train is also occupied by a pregnant women and her Macho and humorous husband, a school girl and her baseball playing boyfriend and some homeless wonderer who saw the outbreak first hand, just to name a few. The social commentary speaks on what you are made of as an individual and as a society with the best and the worse coming out of everyone during this crisis.I loved how relentless and aggressive the Zombies were. More like 28 days later than Romero. The special effects do get a little cartoony with zombies that seem to come form nowhere piling over one another like poring cereal into a bowl or something, but it does give you that man, these guys are screwed feel. Train to Busan focus on the idea that the walking dead sense you through sight and sound. If they can not see you or hear you they have no way of knowing your living flesh is a foot away from their hunger. It made for some cleaver obstacles when a group of passengers have to maneuver through train cars filled with zombie passengers (Sounds like the next game in the Resident Evil franchise).Also found it interesting that no zombies were shot in this picture. I don't know how Korean gun control laws work, but I can assume it's strict enough that the story would make no sense if someone on the train just happen to have one for zombie killing (unlike an American movie in which the unborn child having a gun would be fine so long as it moved along the story). Definitely a rarity in a Zombie picture and it worked.It's Action packed, it's humorless, with incredible looking zombies and a cast of characters so lively you give a crap what happens to them in the end. http://cinemagardens.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adds a lot of spark to the zombie genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This lively South Korean zombie flick arrives in Oz with a limited release, which is a pity as it's a riotous adventure filled to the brim with action, gore and damn interesting story beats. Like all good films within this subgenre, the narrative is rife with metaphors about modern day issues (parent-child connections, corporate greed, human interaction, etc) but it also provides a compelling survival plot when taken at face value. The core relationship between Yoo Gong's self-centred businessman and his quiet, emotionally-neglected 9-year-old daughter (Soo-an Kim ? a tour de force) is riveting as it gets put through the wringer, never feeling anything less than authentic. There are spurts of melodrama, however, that induce the odd unintentional chuckle, whilst a select few from the supporting cast play up their stereotypes ? love-struck school girl, despicable scaremonger, muttering homeless man ? a little too much. Sang-ho Yeon directs with unabashed gusto, pumping up tension and thrills though a string of adrenaline-pumping set pieces, an amazing train-station sequence that turns from hopeful to deadly being a particular high point. The undead are suitably grotesque and enjoyably expendable, their physical movements a mix between the 28 Days Later mode of rapid flesh-eaters and the herky-jerky twitches of J-horror ghosts, although the rules for how quickly someone becomes "infected" seems to vary depending on plot requirement. It doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the zombie genre, but with a bunch of exhilarating set pieces and a willingness to kill off anyone at anytime, Train to Busan certainly adds a whole lot of spark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best zombie movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best zombie film I have ever seen (outside of the comedy Shaun of the Dead). Such a great film. It starts exactly like a train ride gathering momentum and gaining speed. The only difference with this train ride is I didn't want it to stop. It has a brilliant script, fantastic effects plus a very good choice of cast and acting. It also has a 'credible' plot (as credible as you can get with the zombie genre). Many of the scenes will stay with me for a long time. I hear that Hollywood want to do a remake of it. It will be interesting if it will be done as well as this. I thoroughly recommend this very refreshing and fast paced film. Get a ticket and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

Those monsters are very fast (like in "28 days later") and very very aggressiveKorean director are very good in making thrillers film. Now you can count on them for horror adventure and zombies stories.You can also see "Seoul station" from the same director. A very nice animation from the same director and from witch "Busanhaeng" is the sequel.2 hours of pure anxietyNice images of train crash</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenge of Korean blockbuster, and it succeeded quite well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making zombie blockbuster movies outside of Hollywood is not an easy task. Money is the biggest problem, of course. Since it takes a lot of money, success should be guaranteed before making a movie is decided. However, because there are no other precedents, you can't tell whether it's going to succeed or not. This bad cycle kept Korean directors from making zombie blockbusters. This tells how bold movement it was to make 'Train to Busan'. This movie was destined to be 'hit' or 'flop' and it turns out to be 'hit'. Then, this gives a food for thought. What made this Korean zombie blockbuster movie which is definitely unfamiliar to Korean people successful? Ironically, the secret lies in familiarity. Let's take a look at this movie. Yes, it has zombies, but is this movie all about them? No. Unlike 28 days later or resident evil, this movie actually doesn't care about zombies that much. Zombies are not explained much. Their origin, their ability, cure for zombies?These are the things that are not being handled well in the movie. In this movie, zombies are just tools to represent 'threats'. The main theme of this movie is about how people react to threats. Selfishness, altruism, violence, love and much more are being depicted in this movie. And Korean people are quite accustomed to these elements. When directors mix these elements well, then the movie becomes a hit, just like this one. However, this movie still has some downsides too. Acting of Jin-hee is quite unbearably bad and the character Yong-suk (who keeps trying to sacrifice others to save himself) had gone way too far. Yes, I can get mad at bad guys but I don't want to get annoyed at them. Also, getting annoyed gets worse when it is not properly resolved as this movie does. Overall, this is a quite well-made movie, though it still has some bad moments. I believe this movie will be a new beginning for Korean blockbusters. And I recommend you to watch this movie to stay alert for rise of Korean movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie up to the last 30 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such a high presence in both TV and film, zombies are becoming over used. Our fascination with them seems to quickly be coming to a close, so it takes something special to stand out. First time live action director, Sang-ho Yeon, has managed to craft a unique take on the undead by placing them on a train and adding a few things to their mythology. Despite underdeveloped characters and an overly sentimental final act, Train to Busan delivers a fresh take on the zombie movement that contains some extremely memorable set pieces. The story revolves around a father who is taking his daughter to see his ex-wife. Yoo Gong plays the typical father who is more concerned with work than with family and does not always put people as his top priority. His daughter is the typical kid who knows how important other people are and always tries to do the right thing. This is where the film really falters. The characters fit perfectly into stereotypical roles and never feel like anything other than placeholders. There is the typical villain who never seems to die, the typical female characters who must rely on the men, and the group of people who blindly follow orders. There is one excretion however. During the train ride, the father and daughter encounter a couple with a child on the way. The man in this relationship is charismatic, charming, and above all, badass. When everything is about to go down, he is quick to suit up and prepare for a fight. This is the one character in the entire film that stands out and quickly becomes the reason you root for the characters to make it out. There is also an incredibly emotional scene involving this character that really hits hard. The build up to the scene works well and because we are so attached to him, anytime he is at risk the stakes are raised. The scene is effective and almost brought tears to my eyes. This scene should have been the emotional climax of the film. Unfortunately the film goes on for about 30 more minutes and involves another emotional moment with the main character. This second scene however is not effective at all. Through flashbacks and an awkward script, the scene becomes cheesy and at a certain point comical. It didn't work and really took away from the previous emotional climax. Typical of the zombie genre, the film does contain a social critique. Similar to Snowpiercer, the film uses its setting to comment on the class system and the social order we fall into. The businessman is ultimately the boss as he is superior in pedigree and it is up to everyone else to follow him or be cast aside. Additionally his character perfectly aligns with the dog eat dog world we live in today as he uses others for his own advantage. As he throws people to the wayside, literally to be devoured by those around them, it is clear the point that is being made. Also borrowing from another film, the zombies here are fast. Just like in World War Z, they act like swarms of insects as they barrel through doorways and windows creating a sense of urgency slower zombies often fail to establish. They also look great. There are a few moments when they all swarm together, where it is clear CGI was used, but for the most part they used practical effects. The zombies move with disjointed, quick movements that make them very terrifying. It is almost painful to watch them contort their bodies as they converge on their victims. The real unique characteristic though is that they cannot see well in the dark. This trait provides the basis for a number of intense set pieces as characters use sounds to mislead the zombies and navigate the claustrophobic setting from train car to train car. Another great set piece involves the characters getting off the train. It appears as though they have reached a safe zone, but once they realize that they are mistaken, it becomes a race to get back on the train. Characters are killed, people are injured, and bonds are formed as people realize how much they need each other to survive. It is a nice diversion from what we have seen so far and gives the audience something different, yet equally intense, so the action doesn't get repetitive. In the end however, the film does fail to keep us engaged. In the last 30 minutes, the film really starts to drag. The action is not as effective and then builds up to the disappointing emotional climax mentioned earlier. At this point, I just wanted our characters to reach safety, or die already. The very last scene however does work well. In a film filled with brutal action, it was nice to end on a heart-warming moment.Train to Busan (2016) Directed by: Sang-ho Yeon Screenplay by: Sang-ho Yeon Starring: Yoo Gong, Dong-seok Ma, and Woo-sik Choi Run Time: 1 hour 58 minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best modern zombies movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello,We can argue whether a zombies should be fast or not ?In the movie, they are fast, deadly and merciless?. It is more believable than those zombies can take over a city or a country within a day.The movie succeed where Fear The walking dead failed miserably, to explain how the pandemic starts and how it has been spread so fast.Most of the movie take place in a train, very claustrophobic place if you are chased by a herd of undead, but it worked for me, I felt the tension, the drama, the crazy survival instinct of ones and the resignation of the others.Walking dead made the zombie apocalypse almost cool, with guns and sex and love story, In train to busan nothing is cool, you do not have gun, your family and pretty much everyone you know are dead, there is no escape and nobody will come to save you ..I spent 2 marvelous hours watching a movie about zombies, I despite the fact I watched hundred movies about zombies, I have been surprised and scared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most realistic zombie movie I have ever seen. I could imagine myself experience everything that happened there. Great and quite original plot, that keeps your attention for the whole two hours. We get a very good acting, especially from the little girl. The soundtrack was also perfect. Unlike any American happy ending story, this Korean film doesn't try to show any mercy to it's heroes. I had only one remark: in the train they discovered that zombies couldn't see in the dark. So why did they escape the train straight away, if they could wait there for the night to come? I highly recommend this movie to everyone, 10/10.</fullReview>
