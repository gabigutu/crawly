		<shortDescription>An American Tragedy, on film, becomes an American masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bringing Theodore Dreiser's sprawling novel An American Tragedy to the screen must have been a daunting task, made harder by the constraints Paramount imposed on director George Stevens. The studio had lost big on a version made 20 years earlier, under Josef von Sternberg, and had little faith in a remake. So, hobbled by a tight budget, Stevens scaled back his ambitious plans but delivered, perhaps even to his own surprise, a superbly crafted and and powerfully sustained work of movie art.He was lucky that Paramount, edgy about the story, gave him a cast that would guarantee not only good box office but solid performances as well. Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelly Winters take the principal roles, with, in the last third of the movie, extra oomph courtesy of Raymond Burr (in a role that may have nabbed him the Perry Mason franchise).The jaws of the vise Clift finds himself squeezed into are class and sex. Barely educated, raised by stern members of a religious sect, he luckily (or not) happens to be the shirt-tail nephew of a prosperous entrepreneur who casually offers him work in his factory. Awkward and lonesome, Clift escapes the drudgery of his job by taking up with a mousy co-worker (Winters, toned way down from her platinum-bombshell image at the time). But his nose-to-the-grindstone ways attract the attention of his uncle, who rewards him with a promotion and an invitation up to the manor.There he meets Taylor and launches an obsession about her, reinforced by a neon sign visible from his window that blazes her surname through his restless nights (she's another child of an industrial fortune, raised in wealth and privilege). Somehow, she falls for him ? and, need it be added, he for her ? despite his coming from the wrong side of the tracks (she hasn't the faintest notion that for people like him, life may not be the blithe affair it is for her). Only one inconvenient fact keeps Clift from taking his rightful place in the sun: He's left Winters pregnant. The two worlds he occupies are destined to collide, and crash they do when Winters phones him, in the midst of a Hawaiian-themed luau at Taylor's summer place on the lake, to issue her ultimatum: Marry her or she'll spill their sordid secret. He leaves abruptly to meet Winters, desperately trying to assemble the plan which will seal three fates.Stevens sustains an overwhelming, ominous momentum, unbroken by even a hint of levity (not even a single bit player is allowed to lapse into shtik). Languorous dissolves and superimposed images heighten the sense of inevitability as each scene, each event glides seamlessly into the next. Maybe he wasn't able to pile on the exhaustive social commentary that bulked up Dreiser's novel, but everywhere there's sharp detail that he adroitly leaves to be noticed. When Clift shows up hours late at his intimate birthday party in Winter's cramped room, with the tiny table pushed up against her marble washstand, the ice cream has warmed to lumpy syrup (a self-homage to a similar scene in Steven's Alice Adams?). With an island combo playing merrily on, Clift sports a lei and eats pineapple out of its shell when Winters calls to break the spell ? and this South-Seas reverie is offered up not as Veblenesque excess, but merely as the way Taylor's crowd spend their days and evenings and nights in an endless round of heedless gaiety.The apex of the film's crescendo is handled with tight, quiet assurance ? the reckoning in a rowboat upon a deserted lake. Dusk gathers among the pines like fog, the loons call back and forth, and the rippling waves reflect a demented flash into Clift's eye as he wrestles with his conscience. Winters natters nervously about the dreary life they'll spend together while his head swims with luminous visions of Taylor. Then, destiny catches.... Romantic but unsentimental, serious but without pretension, gripping without stooping to the manipulative, A Place in the Sun ranks as a masterpiece of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clift, Taylor, Stevens and a spellbinding American tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time does extraordinary things with greatness. If nothing else it confirms it. "A Place in the Sun" is a remarkable example of that theory. I rushed to buy a DVD after watching a BBC documentary on ELizabeth Taylor to celebrate her 75th birthday! In "A Place on the Sun" an Elizabeth Taylor barely out of her teens is paired with Montgomery Clift. She had been raised at MGM and groomed for movie stardom from day one. He was a method actor, complex, introspective and their coupling produced something that I'm tempted to call, unrepeatable. The actors own personal stories, their friendship, mutual love and respect made it possible for their communion to be so transcendental. To make things even more perfect, the film seems a love letter from director George Stevens to his stars and vice versa. Look at the opening credits and tell me if you've ever seen a more startling introduction to a character/star. The story of doomed love and descend into darkness is, without question, one of the best ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Isn't IMDb great? As well as reading the detailed and thoughtful criticisms from contributors about a film like this, you can browse through all sorts of IMDb trivia, discovering interesting stuff all the time. My latest favourite activity on the site is checking out films that won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. Needless to say A Place in the Sun won this award for William C. Mellor. Much has already been said of the beauty and precision of the images. I'd like to add a comment about one shot where Clift is coerced into a speedboat ride with Taylor and her rich pals. The static camera is on the jetty with a portable radio in close-up. The speedboat pulling away and doing a spin in the bay occupies our middle vision, while hills and boats lie in the distance. All of them are in wonderful pin-sharp deep focus, a skill that seems all but lost in today's productions. The radio announces the discovery of the girl's body while the boat speeds past, completing the dramatic reason for the shot.A funny thing I've noticed about these great cinematographers is they all seemed to live a good long life, usually working right up the end of their lives. I don't know why, I just thought I'd mention it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a Film, This is Haunting, Tragic Romanticism...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Stevens' A PLACE IN THE SUN is a poetic film, filled with tender moments, sadness, and pending doom. Having not read the book, I had the pleasure of seeing the material for the first time, which is preferable if you see a film based on a "classic" novel. Montgomery Clift is his usual mysterious self as he has a scandalous relationship with the homely Shelly Winters and falls instantly in love with a spellbindingly beautiful Liz Taylor, who was only 19 when the picture was made. She glows with energy and a sense of optimism about life, a stark contrast to Clift, whom Taylor has also fallen for. Rumor has it they had an actual affair while making the movie. This is not for all tastes, for it is slow, and Clift is not all that appealing. The idea of dropping a lesser life (with Winters) and pursuing the good life with Taylor is what makes it work and the lengths to which Clift will go are staggering.George Stevens has a gift for "painting" a movie on-screen. Just see GIANT, also with Taylor, or SHANE, the other two parts of his "American Trilogy". The scenes on the lake and the way the mood of the movie is painted is quite simply amazing. He also uses slow dissolves that leave a ghostly image on-screen between scenes. This all adds to the atmospheric touch of tragedy that will ensue. Poor Shelly Winters. She always gets a raw deal in films. There are times when you almost sympathize with Clift. Imagine living the life of a socialite with the girl of your dreams and a good job with your family. A life with Winters would be dismal according to Clift and us. What's right is right, however. An unnecessary court room saga closes the picture to ensure the viewer's sense of justice. This must've been pretty controversial stuff back in the early-50'sA PLACE IN THE SUN truly is an American tragedy, a portrait of young lives gone wrong with post-WWII optimism as a backdrop. Clift and Taylor shine together, and provide film fans with a romance never to be forgotten. The finale is emotionally draining during Taylor's expression of undying love. Unfortunately, Clift cannot have it all. A beautiful piece of classical Hollywood film-making with a mix of method acting (Clift) and a love story we wish could work.RATING: 8 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about George Eastman (Clift), a young, gentle laborer without social standing who longs for the better things in life?He is swept off his feet after a chance encounter with wealth, success and upper-class snobbery? George is introduced to a stunning socialite Angela Vickers (Liz Taylor?never so beautiful) full of sensual delight and threatened by an unattractive factory girl (Alice) he's already made pregnant? Angela and George fall deeply in love, but Alice Tripp (Winters) presses and chases George until he agrees to marry her? He has a desperate decision, but hesitates? Finding they can't get married over the Labor Day weekend, George takes Alice boating? Shelley Winters was extraordinary as the distressed co-worker? She made the wronged employee an understandable reaction to human dimensions? As she sits in the rowboat, unconsciously torturing Clift with her thoughts of their future together, Winters is both pathetic and annoying?a special candidate to get rid of? The impact of the film depends absolutely on a moral climate that has now less impact on our society? Pre-marital sex is no longer disapproved and abortions are easier to obtain? But the film's power resided in its exceptionally convincing depiction of the points and questions created by these situations? "A Place in the Sun" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, and won six?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece, by George Stevens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The young and poor George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) leaves his religious mother and Chicago and arrives in California expecting to find a better job in the business of his wealthy uncle Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes). His cousin Earl Eastman (Keefe Brasselle) advises him that there are many women in the factory and the basic rule is that he must not hang around with any of them.George meets the worker of the assembly line Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters) in the movie theater and they date. Meanwhile, the outcast George is promoted and he meets the gorgeous Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) in a party at his uncle's house. Angela introduces him to the local high society and they fall in love with each other. However, Alice is pregnant and she wants to get married with George. During a dinner party at Angela's lake house with parents, relatives and friends, Alice calls George from the bus station and gives thirty minutes to him to meet her; otherwise she will crash the party and tells what has happened. George is pressed by the situation that ends in a tragedy."A Place in the Sun" is an unforgettable masterpiece by George Stevens and one of the best love stories ever made, with the perfect development of characters and situations. I watched this film for the first time on 14 June 2001 on cable television and yesterday I saw it again on a Paramount DVD with Extras telling details about the difficulties that George Stevens faced to bring Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy" to a motion picture and casting. He had to sue Paramount to carry out the signed contract and get the agreed budget. Another interesting point is Shelley Winters, who was a sex symbol at that time, telling how she got the role of Alice Tripp. Elizabeth Taylor also tells funny things about her relationship with Montgomery Cliff. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Um Lugar Ao Sol" ("A Place in the Sun")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Place in Movie History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standout film which was a remake of An American Tragedy with the late Sylvia Sidney.The film was remade in 1951 with Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters. The culture of rich vs. poor is explored in this film. Lonely drifter Clift meets Ms. Winters first and then in a chance meeting, meets the wealthy Ms. Taylor. Her wealth and position in society is what most affects Clift.Eager to leave Shelley, he soon discovers that she is pregnant. This part, as the impoverished pregnant girl with nowhere to go, was the best part and performance by Miss Winters. We feel for her as she tries to maintain a grip on the Clift character. She brings to the part a nervousness rarely seen in motion pictures. Had she been nominated for best supporting actress, she would have possessed 3 Oscars in that category. Instead, she was nominated for lead actress and lost to Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire.Clift is perfect as the drifter;he was Oscar nominated for it. His scenes in the court, where he maintains that the drowning of Miss Winters was an accident, are real and leave a vivid reminder in the minds of the viewers.The film also marked a breakout performance for Miss Taylor. Up until then, possibly with the exception of 1949's Elephant Walk, her roles were mostly childish in non-dramatic films. The viewer is put in the moral dilemma of whether or not Clift made an attempt to save the drowning Ms. Winters. Capital punishment becomes a question as always.Anne Revere is effective in an all too brief role as Clift's bible-reading mother.All emotional stops are put out in the final scene when Taylor visits a condemned Clift in prison.****. A superb production.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Truth Has A Way Of Sneaking Up On You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1950s melodrama was an interesting, involving story. It's part film-noir, too, which I liked. I say that because the last third of the film featured an expectation of some dreaded act about to be committed, giving it a film noir feel.One thing for sure, whatever you label the movie: it's well-acted, well-directed and well-photographed. Regarding the latter, this really looks good on DVD. No surprise it's directed well since George Stevens was the director. His resume speaks for itself.Obviously Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor are the "big names" in this film, but I found Shelly Winters and the character she played to be the most intriguing. She wasn't really appealing yet one could certainly identify with her feelings of insecurity with Taylor as her competition. "Liz" was in in her prime, looks-wise, with an absolutely classic face.Anyway, watching the character studies of the antsy Winters and the troublesome Clift were interesting. Clift, as is the case with most of us, causes his own problems and things slowly unravel for him. The story is another example of what can happen when one tries to cover up the truth. It comes back to bite you, big-time!I really found it refreshing, however, to see Clift's attitude at the end. It's the exact opposite of what you hear today. He actually takes responsibility for his actions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Social Worlds Collide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poor and uneducated George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) unwittingly sets a trap for himself when he takes an entry-level job at his rich uncle's factory, which has a prohibition on male employees dating female employees. He just can't resist one of the girls in his department, the pitiful and whiny Alice Tripp (wonderfully played by Shelley Winters). Eventually, George gets a promotion and is invited into the upper echelon of his uncle's social world, where he meets wealthy and beautiful Angela Vickers (a breathless Elizabeth Taylor). Naturally, he falls in love with Angela. But a complication with Alice leaves him unable to break off his relationship with her.That's the setup for this George Stevens-directed film that plays rather like a modern Greek tragedy. Everything about "A Place In The Sun" is high quality: the production design, the lavish Edith Head costumes, the wonderful editing, and that great B&amp;W cinematography with those marvelous close-up shots, and overlapping dissolves that cleverly advance the plot.All three principal actors do a splendid job. And they get solid support from a top notch secondary cast that includes Raymond Burr and the interesting Anne Revere.The story clearly plays up social class differences, with the haughty rich looking down their noses at common workers. The film's tone varies from romantic, to sad, to suspenseful. At mysterious Loon Lake where significant events occur, the cinematic atmosphere is heavy with anticipation. It's like something out of a Hitchcock thriller.I've never cared much for sad love stories, and the film does seem a tad dated. Still, it's so well made it can be appreciated by most everyone but the terminally shallow. It has a powerful ending, one that accentuates the acting accomplishments of Clift and especially of Taylor. "A Place In The Sun" was nominated for nine academy awards, and winner of six. I'd say this is one time when Oscar voters got it right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clift at his peak! Taylor gorgeous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor shine in this adapted Theodore Dreiser novel AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY. Clift does his finest work in this film showing his sensitivity and incredible good looks, making the role of George Easton brilliant. He is thorough throughout the movie. His quiet honesty as an actor comes off superbly. He must had affected Liz Taylor for she gives her most honest work in her career. Usually the glamour gal, but now with substance and simplicity as Angela Vickers the pretty rich girl. Add to this Shelley Winters in a different kind of role. Departing from her typical wise dame acting, Shelley, as Alice Tripp, a simple plain girl of poor class, comes off wonderfully in a very difficult role. I hear she had to audition for the director to prove she could act the part. Of course, years later, she and Liz both won several Oscars for thir work. Monty, although nominated many times, and for this film, never won the coveted award. George Stevens directs this romantic tragedy, bringing out the excellent work of his actors. I liked the way he used the camera. (The close up of Clift and Taylor's first kiss, on the balcony at a dance, was worth the price of admission) To see the two most beautiful eyes, in Movieland. in a close up as they come together, was breathtaking. Add to that the haunting score by Victor Young or Franz Waxman or both and you have avery beautiful film, well acted and directed. Stevens' use of fading from one scene to another, often having a double exposure shot of both scenes at the same time, was brilliant and often reminded you of the pending tragedy that was unfolding. Quick synopsis: George, from a poor background, leaves home and his mother, a sort of Salvation Army sufferer (played by that austere and stone-faced Anne Revere) comes to work for his uncle in a swim suit factory. He starts at the bottom as a box sorter and meets along the way a girl who also works at the plant, Alice Tripp. Eventually he gets her in the sack. He finally gets invited to the boss's house to a dance and meets the rich and pretty Angela. He falls for her and she for him. Upon returning to Alice he learns she's pregnant, a fact that is tabboo at the plant. What to do! Easy .. eliminate Alice by drowning her in a lake. In a tense and well played scene in the boat on the lake, George changes heart and begins to row back when Alice in an attempt to be near George tips the boat and drowns anyway. Was it on purpose or was it an accident? That's the big question that is challenged in George's trial after he is acccused of murder. Of course, not until the trial did Angela have any knowledge of George and Alice. George is convicted and sentenced to the electric chair. There's a wonderful quiet scene between Monty and Liz in the prison cell. Only down fall, to me, was Raymound Burr's over-the-hill acting as the prosecuting attorney. He should have done some of his Perry Mason work, but that hadn't happened yet. This early 50s film still holds up on VHS and Classic TV viewing. To add to this review, about two weeks after the film opened, I met Clift in a bar on Third Avenue in NYC with friends and had a wonderful evening in conversation with him. He talked about Taylor and the movie and his up and coming film, THE HEIRESS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dreiser novel becomes a disappointing film. Clift, Taylor, and Winters give interesting if uneven performances. Winters is made out to be so overly dowdy that it is hard to believe Clift would fall for her. It is a travesty that this is one of few films which received Best Director Oscar but not Best Picture, as Stevens' direction is overwrought and disjointed. Vincente Minnelli was robbed. Burr, who would play cripple Ironside and lawyer Perry Mason on TV, here plays a crippled lawyer and provides unintentional comic relief with his over-the-top performance. Everything in this film is overdone, including a ridiculous proposition about what constitutes guilt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To Hell with the book! That's the old cliche about ANY movie...if you've read the author's version and have your own mind's eye scenario firmly in place, almost NO movie will ever compete. However, movies are made to bring the mass audience to a (sometimes) great literary work that would otherwise be relegated to obscurity. "Loved the book...hated the movie...yadda, yadda, yadda". In any case, George Stevens' adaptation of this novel is a magnificent piece of filmmaking. The sheer "beauty" of Clift and Taylor in their prime, doomed to an unachievable fruition of their romance due to the difference in "class" and Clift's apparently deliberate failure to save the life of his frumpy little girlfriend (Shelley Winters in a thankless role)is heartwrenching.....star-crossed lovers in the Romeo and Juliet vein. The sub-title of the book "An American Tragedy" is certainly appropriate. I agree the movie takes a rather LONG time to get to it's denoument, and Raymond Burr is WAY over the top as the film-ending prosecutor. However, you will NEVER see two young actors as tragic and beautiful as Montgomery and Elizabeth...when she says "Tell mamma...tell momma all" and Monty clutches her towards him and almost brutally clamps a big kiss while the camera circles...oh my!! Of course, the REAL tragedy was that, off screen, Elizabeth was MAD for Monty and was even prepared to put up with his bisexuality. Wouldn't they have made a great looking couple at film openings, the Oscars, etc.? But I digress...the stark black and white photography, great background music and fabulous acting (particularly by the stage-trained and film-cautious Monty in a fish-out-of-water role)adds up to a memorable viewing experience. If this one doesn't tear your heart out, you HAVE no heart!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Eastman takes up friendly offer from his uncle to go work in the highly prosperous Eastman bathing-suit factory. Formerly a bell hop at a hotel, and born out of a relatively poor, but religiously devout home, George is spellbound by how the upper crust live. As he starts to climb the social ladder he becomes besotted with his cousin's beautiful partner, Angela Vickers. While at the same time neglecting his girlfriend and mother of his unborn child, Alice Tripp. The outcome of George's confused emotions will have devastating effects on everyone involved...A Place In The Sun is one of those revered, yet seemingly divisive classic pictures that I believe deserves every bit of praise heaped upon it. Based on the Theodore Dreiser novel, An American Tragedy {and the Patrick Kearney play}, it's a slow simmering piece that boasts technical greatness and a class division script that is intriguingly shrouded by a real life sad story. The book and subsequent film versions {Josef von Sternberg filmed an adaptation in 1931} are working from the real case of Chester Gillette and his girlfriend, Grace Brown. To expand further would result in major spoilers but it's a case that is readily available to anyone with internet access. Here with this adaptation, director George Stevens {sublime direction} has gathered all the things available to him and crafted a Gothic, almost dreamy, classic amongst classics. The source, and Sternberg's take on the novel may well be more stark and grimly oppressive, but this has such high cinema values it positively begs you to invest your very being with it.The story behind the scenes is itself worthy of a movie, Stevens clashing constantly with Montgomery Clift {Eastman} and Shelley Winters {Tripp}, Clift because he would only take motivation from his personal coach, Mira Rostova, and Winters because Stevens had never wanted her cast in the first place! Then there is the Elizabeth Taylor {Angela Vickers} factor, blissfully unaware of Clift's burgeoning homosexuality, she reciprocated Clift's adoration of her by falling for him big time, the results, all captured by Stevens, are akin to being put under a spell that you simply can't turn away from. Montgomery Clift was one of the best actors of his generation, here in spite of a secretly confused emotional state, the sparks that ping off Taylor and himself are the kind that few lauded chemistry couples in movie history have ever gotten close too. Monty Clift is worth every penny or cent that is spent to watch him perform, here is yet another performance of emotional oomph to only confirm his standing as a true giant of American actors.Academy Awards went to Best Director, Best Screenplay {Michael Wilson &amp; Harry Brown}, Best Cinematography {William Mellor}, Best Costume Design {Edith Head}, Best Editing {William Hornbeck} and Best Score {Franx Waxman}, all of them deserved, with Waxman's score one of the true greats of 50s cinema, a character in itself and something to totally lose yourself in. Clift &amp; Winters were both nominated in the Best actor/Actress categories respectively, and really in any other year they surely would have won, while the film itself was also nominated for Best Film. Ultimately it's the story itself that makes A Place In The Sun such a beguiling viewing, it's love divided by classes, no middle ground here, it's the rich and beautiful on one side, on the other is the plain and poor, the result is a majestic piece of cinema. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Elizabeth Taylor was never better on the eyes than she was in this incredibly overrated film. Monty Clift, like Taylor, doesn't act too well; he was better in (and personally more suited for) "Suddenly, Last Summer." If a film is truly classic then it does not age like Dorian Gray's painting, it's "controversial" scenes are not embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious today, (Raymond Burr's courtroom antics had me laughing as if I were watching "Duck Soup,") the background score is not overdone and deafening at times and above all, the story doesn't just pep right along at a clip akin to "The Sorrow And The Pity." Sorry, this is shallow tripe from a very good director. I said "very good," George Stevens was NOT "great!" This director's much earlier "Alice Adams," despite aging horribly as most Stevens films do, is superior to this later, much more expensive waste of celluloid. One star.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excruciatingly ironic...though Liz and Monty are still swoon-worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy" turned into a glossy, slick, surface-pretty though still effective melodrama about troubled young people. Montgomery Clift is the poor ex-bellhop who gets a job working in his rich uncle's factory; he has eyes for a smoky society beauty obviously out of his league, courting instead a plain-Jane working girl who ends up pregnant. The story has been pushed up from the 1930s to the film's modern era, leaving some portions of the plot seeming antiquated (when Shelley Winters goes to a doctor for help with her condition, he acts more like a minister than a medico). Director George Stevens painstakingly mounts this plot (in all its unfairness) with the surge of a romantic epic, turning Clift's character into an anti-hero (he's more like a coward, an extremely polite rebel--alternating his leather jacket with suits and ties). Elizabeth Taylor plays her country club princess with a mix of naughty spirit and maternal instinct (intriguing if not quite believable), while Winters goes from shy and subdued to vindictive in no time flat (does Stevens mean her to be the villain of the piece?). The theme of a have-not skirting the world of the haves is certainly brought off with pomp and style (and some steamy clinches), but the courtroom theatrics in the third act are laid on with a trowel. It might have played as a morality tale at one time, but today it looks more like an overheated soaper. Stevens stacks the deck against his protagonist with needling precision, right up until the jaw-droppingly 'tough' conclusion. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As previously stated, this truly is an excellent film. There's no need for me to write about how good the actors/director/pretty much everything is, others have stated it before (and far more eloquently than I could.) The one thing I do wish to comment on is the scene in the doctor's office. Shelley Winters portrayal of a frightened young woman, desperately trying to keep control of herself in front of the doctor, was wonderfully done. When the doctor stiffly informs her 'Well, you'll make a very healthy mother,' (or words to that effect,) it was absolutely heartbreaking. In a film full of 'stand out' scenes, for some reason this was the one that stayed with me for days afterwards.More and more these days I find myself seeking out old classics like this one. Maybe films really were better made then. Maybe I'm just getting old. Maybe both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had everything going for it: great source material, great director, great leading man, great supporting lady, great supporting man (Raymond Burr), but it suffers from what I call the "ET Factor". Yes, I realize that Elizabeth Taylor is supposed to represent the unattainable female beauty that drives George (Clift) over the edge, but most times that vacuous, adorable head just delivers her lines in that same wooden manner that makes me wish that anyone but ET had been cast in the role of Angela Vickers! Sure, she's a beauty, but the lady can barely act. The movie itself is interesting enough with its dark desperation and tormented protagonist, but when ET's on screen, the loon calls. Oh, what might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A George Stevens Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this film, Giant was my favorite George Stevens production. A Place in the Sun is now a favorite of mine too. I never knew how beautiful Liz Taylor was until I watched the close-up shots of her dancing with Montgomery Clift. But the real greatness of this film is the way Stevens brings peoples real emotion right on to the screen. I really can feel the desperation Alice feels , the disappointment George Eastman's mother feels that her son will not return to work at her mission and the anger Raymond Burr feels toward George while confronting him on the witness stand. As with many a movie, the music soundtrack also helps to bring out the emotion too. For the scenes on Brides Lake and Loon Lake, Stevens could have not picked a more beautiful spot than Lake Tahoe in early fall. There is nothing phony about this movie. It's all about emotion,love and guilt and they are some of the most basic things about life. 8 out of 10 for a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Being offered a study job by his wealthy uncle Charles Eastman, Herbert Hayes, the founder of the world famous Eastman Clothing Company young George Eastman, Mongomery Clift, hitch hikes his way to the Eastman Estate and clothing outlet in Chmeron Indiana. George hopes to find the type of employment that can support himself and his mother Hannah, Anna Revere, who runs a charity mission for the homeless in Kansas City Mo.Almost at once the shy but at the same time likable George is accepted by the Eastman family an given a job by his Uncle Charles in the clothing factory, as a packer of women's clothes. Being young handsome and most of all an Eastman the young girls that work at the factory immediately have their eyes on young George.Told by Uncle Charles not to mix with the women working at the plant George can't help noticing mosey, but sweet and pretty, clothes packer Alice Trip, Shelly Winters. Going against what his uncle told him, not to get involved with any of the young women working at the plant, George makes a play for her and within weeks is having a affair with Alice that leads to her getting pregnant.George is in love with Alice at first but things start to get very complicated for him when he's spotted at an Eastman dinner by the beautiful and blue-blooded, as well as coming from a very rich family, Angela Vickers ,Elizabeth Taylor. Angela earlier in the movie at a party at Uncle Charles mansion didn't even give the jaw-dropping George, he couldn't get over how beautiful Angela was, a second or even first glance.Angela was fascinated by George, feeling alone at the party and playing pool by himself. George putting a cue ball in the corner pocket with just one well-placed shot! I wondered how many takes it took to get that incredible sporting feat on film. George who had promised to marry Alice and together move to another state to start a new life and raise a family. With George now in danger of losing Angela if Uncle Charles, as well as Angela's parents, find out about his affair with Alice and even worse Alice feeling rejected and being discarded by George threatens George with exposer of their affair, and her being pregnant, to the media that would cost him everything. His job his social standing and his future marriage to Angela.Tortured and feeling he has no way out of the mess that he created for himself George agrees to marry Alice but the place where their to be married at the Warsaw County Courtroom is closed for the Labor Day weekend. George starts to devise a plan to put the pesky Alice out of his life forever before he's forced to marry her and it's that plan that he'll soon put into action. Even though later in the movie George swore on the Holy Bible that he didn't mean to do it what that plan will sent him straight into the state of Indiana's electric chair. Heart-wrenching movie that has you feeling sorry, to the point of being in tears, for the tragic Alice Trip as well as a guilt-ridden George Eastman in a love triangle that drove poor and desperate George almost insane. Even though he truly and honestly felt that he was innocent in Alice's drowning at the dark and deserted Lake Loon.The movie " A Place in the Sun" has among other things some of the most tender and touching love scenes ever filmed. The scenes of George and Angela kissing and sweetly talking to each other were done in such a beautifully soft yet out of focus style that you felt hypnotized and a bit woozy watching them.All the evidence in Alice's death pointed to George and with the Warsaw county Dist. Atty, R. Frank Marlow, Raymond Burr,getting George to break down on the stand his conviction by the jury was a forgone conclusion.Waiting to be executed George says goodbye to his mother and Angela as the clock ticked away for his last walk, or mile, to the death row execution chamber as George made peace with God and himself. As he walks the last mile George now knows that if he only followed what he was thought by his mother Hannah Eastman as a boy, growing up helping the poor and destitute back in Kansas City, he wouldn't have ended up in the terrible situation that he finds himself in now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy as Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was probably inevitable that "An American Tragedy," in its evolution to screen, would become more about the doomed love affair of Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor than the moral and ethical dilemmas that really form the foundation of Theodore Dreiser's novel. After all, doomed love is a bigger sell, especially when you have the romantic faces of Clift and Taylor swooning together in extreme close-up. I'm not a fan of doing book to movie comparisons. I figure that film and literature are two different art forms, so I shouldn't compare their rendering of the story anymore than I would compare the same story as presented in a painting as opposed to a ballet. So I tried to take the film on its own merits (admittedly difficult to do, since I watched the movie on the same day I finished the book), but even at that, I think the movie falls short.Clift plays George Eastman, poor nephew to a rich, socially elite family in a small New York state factory town. He's been invited by his uncle to come and work in the Eastman factory, giving him an entre into a world of luxury that has always been out of his grasp due to his family's humble position (they run a mission and preach on the streets). George strikes up a love affair with Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), a girl who works with him in the factory, but his attentions for her quickly fade when he becomes interested in Angela Vickers, another member of the rich set, played by Liz Taylor. Complications ensue, and George finds himself and his situation spiraling drastically out of control, with an ending more tragic than he ever thought possible.George Stevens directs the film with a sure hand, and there are some breathtaking displays of directorial skill. For example, one that stands out in my mind comes when the camera focuses on a radio reporting a possible murder, while the young, rich kids with whom George has struck up a friendship goof off in the water in the background. There are also some great uses of dissolve editing, though the technique is somewhat overused.But there are many problems with the film, notably its pacing. Much time is spent on George's love triangle with Alice and Angela, while the script races through the trial and George's ultimate fate, as if the screenwriter realized he only had two hours to tell his story when he'd already wasted an hour and a half on front-end material. Rushing through the end blunts much of the story's original intent and power, as that is where the majority of moral questions arise.Also, the character Shelley Winters plays is so drab and mousy, that one doesn't understand why George would entangle himself with her in the first place. But Clift does a great job with the lead role, delivering a performance of raw nerve.It befuddles me somewhat as to why this movie is quite so acclaimed. I can only imagine that its reception has to do with cultural moods at the time it was released and that it just hasn't aged well. It came out in 1951, a big year for literary adaptations ("A Streetcar Named Desire" and "Death of a Salesman" were both given big-screen treatments that year), and you only need to compare "Sun" to "Streetcar" to see how short it falls at capturing the essence of a true literary classic.Grade: B-</fullReview>

Called the Greatest Movie of all time by the World Champion Movie Goer, George Raborn, he wasn't far from the truth....at least for me.

		<shortDescription>GEORGE STEVENS CLASSIC RECEIVES OUTSTANDING DVD PRESENTATION!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Stevens' classic 1951 film, "A PLACE IN THE SUN" has recevied an excellent transfer onto DVD. The beauty of the Oscar winning cinematography and the power of Stevens Oscar winning direction, come alive on this release. The big bonus on this DVD is the "EXTRA" material included. There is a commentary track featuring George Stevens Jr. and associate producer, Ivan Moffat that is interesting. BUT that is just the start of the "goodies" on this disc! There is a fine documentary, "RETROSPECTIVE CAST &amp; CREW INTERVIEWS" that is very informative. This includes some fine insights by Elizabeth Taylor on how this film helped her learn the difference from being a "movie star" and becoming an "actress". Also excellent thoughts from Shelley Winters, Ivan Moffat, and son, George Stevens Jr. The most exciting "Extra" comes from unused material shot by Stevens son for the documentary of: "GEORGE STEVENS: FILMMAKERS JOURNEY". This includes thoughts from 12 filmmakers on their impressions of George Stevens as a director and as a human being. Fascinating material! One of those interviewed is the great Frank Capra, who along with director William Wyler and Stevens, formed the independent Liberty Films after World War II. (Capra made his "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE" under this banner.) Capra shares something very touching -- and it is great to have this captured on film -- Here is a portion of his comments: "When I die and I happen to be anywhere near that place that's supposed to be the place to go -- I'm certainly going to look George up -- and I'm going to look a couple of other people up -- and we're going to go on from where we left off. I think we'll start another Liberty Films up there. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could make pictures in heaven and we could send them down here! -- I want to do it with George Stevens..." If you love this film as I do, you will get your money's worth on this DVD! Thanks Paramount --- and a special thanks to George Stevens Jr.!!! P.S. The outstanding George Stevens Jr. material has also been used for the excellent, "HE WALKS IN BEAUTY" Documentary that is included on the DVD for George Stevens "THE GREATEST STORY EVERY TOLD".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Still a Moving and Amazing Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had mixed feelings going into "A Place in the Sun." I knew ahead of time it was ranked on the AFI's 100 Greatest Films of All Time List (#93), but Leonard Maltin said that much of the film was dated. I was surprised that after a leisurely-paced opening, the film took a surprising turn for the better and never let go. George Stevens' technical mastery is clearly evident, but he also knows when to just let his actors go. The lake scene is almost painfully suspenseful thanks in part to the two venerable actors, Franz Waxman's score, and Stevens' wonderful execution. Montgomery Clift gives an amazingly brilliant performance that I never expected; he is truly one of film's unsung heroes. So even if you are hesitant about checking this one out, I seriously recommend it. Only Raymond Burr's ridiculous courtroom scene is dated; the rest is quintessential Geroge Stevens filmmaking and breathtaking entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the eddies and wakes of a boat on Big Moose Lake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1906 there resided in upstate New York a young man named Chester Gillette. Mr. Gillette was good looking and ambitious, and hoped to better his social and financial situation by family connections and a socially advantageous marriage to a wealthy young woman. But Gillette had been dating Grace Brown, a farmer's daughter, and Brown found out she was pregnant. She insisted that Gillette marry her, or she would reveal what he did to her. Gillette arranged for her to meet him at a resort at Big Moose Lake in the Adirondacks, but they were to go there separately, and he made sure they were not seen together too much. Actually they were seen many times together - like many schemers Gillette thought he had accomplished his intentions but actually had failed to do so.He took Grace out on a boat, supposedly to enjoy the quiet pleasures of the lake. Something occurred in that boat - we will never know for certain. The majority of us feel certain that Chester hit Grace with either an oar or a tennis racket, knocking her unconscious into the water, so that she drowned. However, he always maintained she hit her head after upsetting the boat, on the overturned boat. We just don't know. Chester's behavior after the accident was that of a skulking coward, not revealing himself to the authorities or seeking assistance, but trying to get back to his room at a local hotel to get his luggage. He was arrested within a few days, and a trial took place that became nationally prominent. At the end of the trial, Chester Gillette was convicted of first degree murder. After an appeal failed, Chester was electrocuted in 1908.Roughly seventeen years later, Theodore Dreiser was considering his next literary project. Dreiser's social views were left of center, and he wanted to write a novel that tore open the materialist center of American social values. It was to be based on a famous homicide case that was based on misguided attempts at social advancement. Dreiser looked at several cases (another one was a notorious 1911 case, the murder of Avis Linnell in Massachusetts, by Reverend Charles Richeson - the Reverend poisoned Miss Linnell who stood in his way to an advantageous marriage). Dreiser decided the story of Chester Gillette fit the bill. It was to tell (in fictional form, of course) the background of the case, the social pressures that lead to the main event, and the trial of the hero as well as his condemnation and execution. Changing the name of the hero to Clyde Griffiths (note the same initials as Chester's), published the novel as an attack on the misguided social clawing and status seeking in our capitalist society. As such it was entitled "An American Tragedy".The novel was a success (perhaps Dreiser's masterpiece). He helped dramatize it in the late 1920s, and in 1931 it was filmed for the first time as by Joseph Von Sternberg. But much was cut out of that version, and Dreiser was so upset he sued Paramount and Von Sternberg (and lost the case). That film version, with Phillips Holmes as Clyde, and Sylvia Sidney as the doomed girl, was actually quite good on its own merits.In 1947 Dreiser died. In 1951 George Stevens assembled the production staff and cast, including Monty Cliff, Shelley Winters, Elizabeth Taylor, Raymond Burr, Fred Clark, and Keefe Brazzell. It is a wonderfully rich and good film, showing the shocking underside of the American dream (just as Dreiser would have hoped). The central figure is no longer Clyde Griffiths but George Eastman, but Monty Cliff shows how a basically hard working young man is destroyed pursuing his dream of success. And again, the film properly leaves the central issue - did Chester/Clyde/George kill his girlfriend, and try to make it look like an accident, or did he change his mind, but there was an accident, or did he panic when in the water, and fail to save her. Was it a moral crime rather than a factual one? Raymond Burr's performance, in the part of the local district attorney, is one of the two movie roles (the other is Lars Thorwald in REAR WINDOW) that people recall if not thinking of his great television career. As the District Attorney, Burr (usually typecast as villains) actually is a heavy, but one with a moral mission. He is certain that this was murder, pure and simple, and he is going to avenge poor Shelley Winters. His performance when cross examining Cliff is a marvel, particularly the moment he bares down on the spot Winters was sitting at with an oar and smashes it. It has been called over the top, but it is deservedly over the top. And I suspect it was also important for Burr's future career as well. It was a great way for him to demonstrate his strength appearing as a courtroom gladiator. I am certain that when casting for the Perry Mason series occurred a few years later, the producers recalled what a splendid job Burr did here when considering hiring him. The rest was television history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A place in the sun is one of the most Romantic films ever produced and the beauty of Elizabeth Taylor is just beyond belief. I remember seeing the film when I was very young and without remembering the title remembered only ET's beauty. M Clift is beautiful as well and presumably Shelley Winters is made to look especially ugly, notably when she calls Eastman from the bus station and "orders" him to come and collect her or she will reveal all. Plastically very beautiful the film is also an interesting study on the notion of "guilt" . Eastman sets out to kill Tripp, does everything including lying to get her out on the boat and then "can't go through" with it. The boat turns over and we don't really see what becomes of Tripp, nor do we see Eastman trying to save her. The way events are presented in the trial, even if we are supposed to assume that Eastman "didn't want to go through with it" makes the guilt fall squarely on Eastman's shoulders to a point that even he has difficulty admitting he is innocent. The final scenes with his mother and the minister in the prison cell are very hard to take. Both these personnages seem to consider him guilty and at the end of the film, one is left wondering whether he is guilty or not. It's his intention to murder tripp, rather than the fact that he actually bumped her off which takes him to the electric chair. One therefore poses the question " Is the intention to kill as bad as killing itself"?? Where do you draw the line, when trying to determine the level of guilt, between intention and reality ? Let's face it we don't really see precisely what happens in the boat during those last fateful seconds. Ambiguity is the key word here and Eastman's behaviour and lying obviously lead the jury to condemn him. Away from the sombre side of the story, we have E Taylor's stunning beauty and love for Eastman whatever the cost and whatever he has done. Does love like that really exist. I don't believe so for one single minute, but this is a film and films must make us dream!! And dreaming at least helps to offset the crude reality of life. One last thing, the music of the film is beautiful. I'm sure many people know the music without knowing it's title and where it comes from. Years ago, it was the theme music for a program on French TV called Cin-cinemas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's greatest film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.'A Place in the Sun' is, for my quids, the greatest movie ever made in Hollywood. The film is a reworking of Dreiser's novel 'An American Tragedy' (filmed previously), which in turn is based on a real murder case. In 1905, a young man named Chester Gillette, a supervisor in a skirt factory in upstate New York, began an affair with Grace Brown, an ill-paid employee in the factory. The affair led to Brown becoming pregnant, presumably by Gillette. He strung her along for a while, assuring her that he intended to marry her but insisting that she not tell anyone else. In the summer of 1906, Gillette lured Brown to a remote lake, where he killed her. Overwhelming evidence showed that the murder was premeditated and planned in detail. Gillette was convicted and executed.Although the real-life case is well-known, chroniclers continue to get it wrong by turning the ill-fated relationship into a triangle. Dreiser's novel introduced a wealthy society girl who became attracted to the Gillette character: seeing a chance to enter high society by marrying her, Gillette supposedly perceived Grace Brown as an obstacle to his entree to wealth. This is simply not true; there was no 'other woman' in the original case, although tabloid reporters tried to link Gillette romantically with several local debutantes.Montgomery Clift gives the best performance of his career as the Griffiths character, here named George. Shelley Winters, whom I usually dislike, is deeply impressive and sympathetic here as Alice, the simple working girl who's been seduced and traduced. Winters has a deeply moving scene when the pregnant Alice desperately asks a doctor to help her 'take care of' (abort) her unborn child.Less impressive is Angela the society girl, played by Elizabeth Taylor. We're meant to like her, yet she behaves irresponsibly. When a highway cop gives Angela the latest in a long series of speeding tickets, she laughingly declares that her rich daddy will pay the fine, as usual. I can't respect anybody with that attitude. While this film was in production, Taylor was married to Nicky Hilton, her first husband and the frivolous playboy scion of the Hilton hotel fortune. There's now (as I write this) another frivolous Hilton heir who's making headlines for irresponsible behaviour, and I don't see why I'm supposed to admire people whose bank balances exceed their IQs.Another thing that baffles me about 'A Place in the Sun' is Taylor's famous line to Clift: 'Tell mama. Tell mama all.' For some reason, this keeps showing up on lists of all-time great movie lines. Yet the line doesn't excite me, and the camera isn't even on Taylor's face for most of the line.But, ah, that camera! Director George Stevens and his brilliant cinematographer William C. Mellor use multiple lap dissolves here. How many films can you name in which a shot begins AND finishes with two separate lap dissolves? How many films can you name in which this effect WORKS, rather than just being an attention-getting device? The photography is excellent throughout, aided by Bill Hornbeck's taut editing. I was deeply impressed by an overhead shot of a marsh bird, during the murder sequence.There are many great things in 'A Place in the Sun', but the greatest is its moral complexity. At the climax, George lures Alice to the remote lake; we know he's intending to kill her. But now, unexpectedly, he tells her his intentions and declares he's changed his mind. (This was also done in the previous film version.) What's happening here? Has George really reclaimed his conscience, or has he merely lost his nerve? We never learn which it is. And now the boat capsizes, and Alice drowns ... exactly as if George had murdered her deliberately.The courtroom sequences are harrowing. Ted de Corsia, who usually played coarse thugs, is a brave casting choice as the judge. Also an interesting choice is Fred Clark -- an actor usually associated with comedy roles -- as the defence attorney.The moral complexity comes home to roost in a quiet, powerful scene between convicted murderer George and the prison chaplain. (Another surprising casting choice: the chaplain is played by Paul Frees, best known for voicing cartoon characters.) Reverend Morrison asks George what his emotions were at the moment when Alice died, then explains the situation. If George felt *relief* at Alice's death, or any positive reaction, then -- from a moral standpoint -- he is just as guilty of murdering her as if he had actually done the deed.Wow! It's not often that Hollywood movies address the morality of a situation, especially one as complex as murder. In a typical Hollywood movie, the nearest they get to a moral debate is a gunfight. The last scene, with George walking to his execution, is deeply haunting ... although I was sceptical that, in 1951, an American murderer would be on an all-white Death Row. What a powerful film. I'll rate 'A Place in the Sun' 10 out of 10, only because the scale doesn't go any higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Eastman, the poor relation of a wealthy family, goes from rags to riches after meeting his rich uncle in Chicago, where he was working as a bellhop. George, with his dark good looks, starts working in his uncle's garment factory, but he has ambitions about how to be part of the wealthy family. We watch him as he goes from the packing area into a more important position. It's his ambition that proves to be his undoing.Theodore Dreiser, the great American writer, wrote "An American Tragedy" which was published in 1925. The book was a social commentary on the country during those years. Mr. Dreiser was above all, a social reformer; his book dealt with a reality that doesn't appear in the movie. By the way, the book was first adapted as a stage play by Patrick Kearney. When the time came to turn this classic for the screen, the task fell on Josef Von Sternberg to direct the film treatment in 1931.The book finally got the interest of George Stevens, a Hollywood film director, who up to that point, didn't have great dramatic credentials behind him. Mr. Stevens was a cinematographer first, who later on took to directing. The screen play by Michael Wilson and Harry Brown was typical of the Hollywood of those years. There was so much that could be shown on the screen at the time without arousing the Hays Code people into action."A Place in the Sun" was an ambitious project for the film makers. The casting of Montgomery Clift, one of the best actors of that era, proved to be a coup for Mr. Stevens and his team. The young Elizabeth Taylor, in one of her first dramatic roles, added sexual allure to the production, as it's clear the camera adored her as much as it loved Montgomery Clift. Both actors, made them a romantic couple that lured viewers to the theaters. Shelley Winters, was cast as the plain Alice Tripp, who is the pivotal figure in the novel, as well as in the film.George Eastman, is said to be modeled after Hamlet. It makes perfect sense, as he is an indecisive man whose loneliness, when he first arrives in the town, makes him crave to belong to the social circle of his uncle. When he starts working in the factory, George seeks Alice Tripp for his own pleasure without taking into consideration the terrible consequences of his actions. When Angela, the beautiful, rich, and sophisticated girl, appears, George figures he has to ditch Alice, who is a peasant girl, after all. This turn of events make George hate the loving Alice.Theodore Dreiser wanted to make a statement about George. How this young man was a victim of the materialistic society he wanted to belong to, as well as pointing to George as a monster that falls prey to his desire to belong to that same society that looked down on him when he first enters it. George learns his lesson too late and he can't escape his fate."A Place in the Sun", although superficial, still shows some aspects of the novel. The best thing in the film is Montgomery Clift playing George Eastman. He brought his own brand of intensity into the character and he is at his best in his scenes with Elizabeth Taylor. Shelley Winters did what she could with a role that had limitations. In supporting roles we see Raymond Burr, Keefe Brasselle, Fred Clark, Shepperd Strudwick, and Herbert Heyes, among others.The other interesting aspect of the film is the great music score by Franz Waxman that blends easily into the background. William Mellor's cinematography, especially the lake sequence, adds luster to the film. George Stevens was lucky in getting all this talent involved in the movie, and although it doesn't say much about what Theodore Dreiser intended to, as an entertainment, it has its merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Miss Taylor before the....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>booze, before the drugs, before the countless tragedies and health scares. What I enjoyed most about this movie was not only Elizabeth Taylor's extraordinary beauty, (as well as that of the Lake Tahoe, California area), but also seeing Elizabeth when her way of speaking was still pleasant and easy on the ear. Before she got that kind of hard edge probably brought about from substance abuse. She has always been a gorgeous woman on the outside, but here you see her when she seems to absolutely glow from inner beauty, as well. I could have gone on watching forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The brilliance of George Stevens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place in the Sun first caught my attention in an article I had read about Montgomery Clift. Even though the article went into no great depth about explaining the plot or story-line of the film, what was written about it was rather favourable. I decided to have a look at some reviews and even some viewer comments on the IMDb to get a better idea of what the film was about, and to see what other people thought of it. Based on what I found written about it I decided that I might be interested in looking at it, even though it sounded suspiciously like another Hollywood love story.The film turned out to be one of the best dramas I have ever seen, in fact it was so good that not even Elizabeth Taylor's mediocre talent could ruin it. The characterizations and story line were outstanding, far surpassing those of George Steven's other masterpieces, Shane and Giant. This was one of those rare movies, another being 'Dead Man Walking' where I found myself not knowing whether or not to feel sympathy for the main character, which I imagine was exactly the audience impartiality that Stevens was aiming for.There is more than one theme prevalent in this movie which makes it so good, the main one centering on love breaking through social barriers, not an uncommon theme, but well executed. There is also an underlying theme of betrayal which is offsets the former theme and is what makes this movie such a success.Even though the movie is centred on the characters of Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor, it is Shelley Winters that steals the show. Winters performance is flawless, successfully gaining sympathy for her character, which in turn is what creates a confliction of feelings for the audience towards the main character. An absolute must see</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Montgomery Clift shines in the best role of the movie. He plays a George Eastman, going to work at his uncle's bathing suit factory. Their, he meets Alice Tripp, and they fall in love. Meanwhile, Eastman sees, and falls in love with Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor, who is absolutely gorgeous).  The title of the book was An American Tragedy, which is true. The close-ups of Clift and Taylor on the dance floor are amazing, and the use of Franz Waxman's music is incredible. Taylor and Shelley Winters give great performances, but it's Clift's the holds this together. He was nominated as Best Actor, the only one who stood a chance at beating Marlon Brando in Streetcar named Desire. Interestingly enough, they both lost to Humphrey Bogart. The only flaw would Raymond Burr's performance as the prosecutor, and the court room scene. It has so many mistakes, and oddities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Place in the Sun to Find Refuge.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place in the Sun (1951): Dir: George Stevens / Cast: Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters, Raymond Burr, Herbert Heyes: Compelling yet depressing classic with a title that symbolizes the need for grace after an attempt to conceal sin. Montgomery Clift plays George Eastman who arrives in town to work for his wealthy uncle. Central plot regards his forbidden relationship with a female working there played by Shelley Winters whom he gets pregnant. Elizabeth Taylor plays Angela Vickers, a society girl who Eastman also gets involved with. When Winters pushes for marriage thus threatening his job he plots her death. This happens by accident but with his path uncovered he is sought after as a murderer. Raymond Burr makes an effective appearance as a prosecutor out to see Eastman go to the electric chair. Herbert Heyes plays the wealthy uncle disturbed at the news, which began when Eastman and Vickers began courting each other. Director George Stevens weaves a fine line between what begins as an innocent romantic flick to becoming a dark conquest full of consequences. The locations are flaring with life as the upper class that Eastman has become accustom to attend dances in mansions and relax at resorts while Winters is positioned outside depressed and trying to figure out how to reel Eastman in. We reap what we sow and Eastman with his place in the sun exposing his sin. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Closer Look at Two Key Themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding example of Hollywood craftsmanship, attention to detail, and sheer romanticism. The film takes up two key themes in American life?class and morality, treating each with uncommon care. Consider the opening scene of the indigent George (Clift) standing roadside while cars whiz past, much as life seems to be brushing him aside. Mocking him at the same time is a billboard with a provocative girl advertising the Good Life. No wonder he rushes to his rich uncle Eastman's mansion where he hopes to join the fast cars and the beautiful girl, if he dare to hope so.That scene of his entering the mansion's huge reception room is to me one of the movie's best. In his cheap, wrong color suit, George couldn't be more self-conscious. How will the rich Eastmans' receive him, in their fancy party clothes ready for a night on the town. In fact, they are oh, so, polite, while keeping a social distance. After all, he does come from the poor family branch, his mother giving her life over to religious pursuits instead of money. For his brief visit, at least he gets a job on an Eastman assembly line. The scene itself is beautifully staged and performed, while Clift is simply terrific here as the uncertain, poor relation, all deference and submission.For awhile it looks like the cars will continue to whiz by as he repeats the same deadening moves on the assembly line. But at least he has someone now to share time with. Alice (Winters) is a dowdy working girl across from him. Lonely, they soon get together. But now life gets complicated for George. Suddenly, one day, he's promoted to administration; at the same time, he's invited to a party at the mansion. Eagerly, he attends, this time dressed appropriately and ready to please, but he's still bypassed by other guests. Then, in another memorable scene, lightning again strikes in the form of the beauteous Angela (note the classy name), who suddenly enters his solitary billiards room where he has retreated, friendless. Can it be, as they banter, that she's taking a real fancy to him with all her upper class ways. An unmistakable glow begins to emerge on screen, and it's a tribute to both Taylor and Clift that their chemistry is both vivid and compelling in this key scene that sets the stage for what follows. Now, it seems, a whizzing car has stopped for him and all he has to do is get in. But back at the rooming house waiting for him is Alice. Not just a reminder of the roadside life he'd like to leave, she's pregnant and insisting on marriage. So, on one hand, he's got the frumpy, working class Alice, alone and pregnant, and on the other, a budding romance with the glitzy, upper class Angela, who's opened the door to the billboard life he could only dream of. What's George to do. Then, in a gutsy scene for the repressed 1950's, Alice is sent to a doctor (Wolfe) for what, by inference only, is an abortion. The writers do a clever job getting her purpose across without violating the Production Code's prohibition on such frank talk. Nonetheless, the doctor firmly refuses, leaving both George and Alice in a real pickle.With his religious background, George still has a conscience even if he's deeply in love with Angela and drawn to her materialistic world. Thus, the question is which direction he will go in?will he do the morally right thing and marry Alice or will he succumb to the pull of a glamorous life with Angela. In short, which is stronger: moral duty or romantic love. In a moment of moral weakness, George plans to relieve his dilemma by drowning Alice in a lake, seemingly the only recourse left open to a life with Angela. But fate (the call of the loon) intervenes and Alice accidentally tips over the small boat they're in. Importantly, the camera withdraws at that point to a distance shot so that we cannot see exactly what happens next. But Alice ends up dead by drowning, just as George had planned when giving false names to the boat rental. However, having escaped, George is now torn by a sense of guilt even as he and Angela plan to marry, the whizzing car door now open wide. But, it's at that fateful point, the cops put various clues together and arrest George for murder. But is he really guilty. We can't be sure since we never saw the exact events. It seems not even George is sure. If nothing else, at this point George is trying to come to grips with what his intention was vs. what actually happened in the water. Could he have saved her as the DA contends at George's trial. She couldn't have been far away, then why didn't he. George seems unclear himself. In a melodramatic moment, the DA (Burr) claims George struck Alice with a paddle, thereby insuring her death. But that is clearly wrong since we know what happened in the boat. But the jury apparently buys it, otherwise how could they sentence him to first-degree murder. The question is?what is George really guilty of. Is it just the intention but not the act itself. Or is it the act in some ill-defined sense. The movie settles for being guilty of a wrong thought at a crucial moment. That may be blameworthy in some metaphysical sense, but certainly doesn't justify his execution. As things stand George's sentence stands as a miscarriage of justice. In that sense the movie turns out to be a tragedy, particularly for Alice whose only crime is being poor and frumpy. The moral, I guess, is that what may seem an up spiral may actually be its ironical opposite.Anyway, it's a brilliantly sensitive movie, that's also thought provoking, and deserving of its many awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Mix of Romance and Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place in the Sun (1951) **** (out of 4) Oscar-winning tale of a poor boy (Montgomery Clift) who goes to work for his uncle hoping to one day be rich like him. He falls in love with a small time woman (Shelley Winters) but soon gets a taste of the society life with a beauty (Elizabeth Taylor) and this is the start of his downfall. A PLACE IN THE SUN went home with six Oscars including Best Director for George Stevens and it's easy to see why he took home the award because there's so much going on in this picture yet he holds it together perfectly. The film is part melodrama, part message film, part romance and part suspense and Stevens really brings all of it together so perfectly that you can't help but get drawn into the story and feel every bit of pain that the characters do. The most amazing thing for me, and I'm not sure if it was meant to happen this way, but I really felt a lot of sympathy for the Clift character. Again, I'm not sure if this was the filmmakers intent but no matter how much I disagreed with what he was doing at the same time I never once hated him and even to the end I was hoping things would turn his way. I think some of this credit should be given to Clift who once again turns in a remarkable performance. I thought the shyness early on, the romance with Taylor and the hatred that someone is going to take away his dreams are all things that Clift perfectly nailed. The sequence on the boat towards the end is something masterfully performed by the actor. Taylor is also extremely good in her part even though of all the main characters I think hers is the most underwritten. Winters is also very good in her role of the woman who finds herself being left behind for someone better. I thought all the scenes between her and Clift, be it romantic or fighting, were full of wonderful chemistry. Anne Revere is a standout as Clift's mother and Raymond Burr is good in his few scenes. Again, a lot of credit has to go to Stevens because every aspect of the film works. The early love story between Clift and Shelley works. The love story between Clift and Taylor works. The downright suspense on the boat at night works. Even the ending manages to work. A PLACE IN THE SUN deserves its place as an all-time classic.</fullReview>

I thought the trio of Monty Clift, Elizabeth Taylor (who has never looked prettier), and Shelley Winters were amazing in their performances. Plus the direction of George Stevens (who won the directing Oscar) really sets the mood for this film and really gets the actors to act their hearts out!! I gotta say I really got emotionally drawn into this romantic/tragic triangle. I definitely recommend this film. I thought it was as good as Hitch's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN from that same year. Plus the film has some really great scene transitions/dissolves and amazing close-ups of Liz Taylor's gorgeous face!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A world of grown-up problems"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic cinema of Hollywood often elicits emotion, be that joy, exhilaration or the poignancy of a tearjerker. However there is a far rarer emotional experience in movies, one that has only had one that has only really been done justice in a small number of pictures, and that is the feeling of despair. Different to mere sadness ? not bittersweet; just pure, harrowing bleakness. This is not easy to get right on the screen.Director George Stevens was among the most competent and tasteful of Hollywood's emotional manipulators. Stevens would shoot a scene from numerous angles to give himself maximum coverage for the editing process ? he himself likened it to a sculptor starting with a block of stone and whittling it down to a work of art. This is not to say that A Place in the Sun features a lot of cutting. In fact some of the picture's most powerful moments are in extremely long takes, such as Shelley Winters telling the doctor she is not married, often with movement on screen but not of the camera, such as when we focus on the radio while the speedboats rush past in the background. It's set-ups like this that instil that feeling of helplessness. Often the right choice of angle, seemingly incidental, can have a devastating impact, such as the shot at the trial with Montgomery Clift's face on the right and a woman in the jury looking accusingly at him dead-centre of the screen. There is often a slightly voyeuristic feel, as if we are watching the lives of others across a crowded room. This is often enhanced by the long, wordless sequences. Perhaps most important of these is the one which opens the picture, of an easygoing Clift receiving a lift from a cheerful trucker, which looks deceptively upbeat, especially under the strains of the warm and tender Franz Waxman score.A Place in the Sun also happens to be blessed with a cast that is note-perfect down to the smallest roles. The principle players are all of the newest generation of lead actors who had only emerged in the post-war period (well, Elizabeth Taylor had been on screen during the war but only as a child actress). Not only are Clift, Taylor and Shelley Winters appropriately youthful, but they have that capacity for realism and understatement that that generation championed. Clift handles the tough job of making his character, a fairly chequered chappie even if he is technically innocent of his crime, someone we can sympathise with. Winters is particularly good too, playing a somewhat melodramatic individual, but playing her in a way that is not in itself overstated. But it's not just the youngsters that shine. Each of the more experienced players is absolutely spot-on as well. Oscar-winner Anne Revere in the comparatively small role of Clift's mother is a real stroke of casting genius.There aren't many things wrong with A Place in the Sun, although I do wish they had kept the title of the Theodore Dreiser source novel (An American Tragedy) as it is an excellent title and one that conjures up both the tone and the context of this particular adaptation perfectly. It's interesting how this picture comes from the film noir's heyday, and at least on paper it fulfils the criteria of being a film noir ? and yet it doesn't feel like one. I think this is because film noir, with its private investigators, femme fatales and wisecracking dialogue, is for the most part a stylised, comic-book genre. A Place in the Sun on the other hand is devastatingly real in its characters and their depictions. We become drawn in, first by the familiarity of the situations, and then by the absolute horror of how they unfold. A picture like A Place in the Sun does not make for comfortable viewing, but it is the sort of experience we should subject ourselves in once in a while, if only to keep us in touch with the darker side of reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intimate Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late 1940s George Stevens, the California-born director known for his perfectionist attitude, got the rights to adapt the cult 1925 novel by Theodore Dreiser "An American Tragedy." When his tedious work on shooting and editing began, few people probably thought of the movie becoming more powerful than the literary source itself. Indeed, few novel adaptations can stand on their own so extensively and seldom do serious liberties taken occur more captivating, thought provoking, charming, eloquent and historic as here. A PLACE IN THE SUN is no remake, no adaptation, no clich whatsoever but a fabulous experience that is not 'in the same boat with any other movie.' Every scene is meaningful, every detail reasonably included, every camera shot effective. Can we, in that case, talk of perfection? The technical factor is undeniably perfect. The creative use of 'observing camera' that intentionally leads viewers to become 'observers' of the events in a way; the deliberate choice for the black and white rather than the three strip Technicolor format popular at the time; the clarity of every single detail; heartbeat of musical motifs---it all gives the bonus credits to the editors and the director himself, George Stevens characterized by three features: "honour, talent, courtesy" (Rouben Mamoulian about Stevens). At the face of smashing success, nobody cared about Josef Von Sternberg's original yet unsuccessful 1931 adaptation of Dreiser's novel; nobody remembered the attempts by Sergei Eisenstein; what had been before was of no importance any longer in 1951. A PLACE IN THE SUN became one of the best films ever made...and still is... Why? Because George Stevens went beyond any down-to-earth considerations that would only equal with complex limitations. But there is something much more important than merely the technical point and the box office success that make A PLACE IN THE SUN truly an intimate masterpiece. Technical miracles have developed tremendously since 1951, nobody cares about the box office of that time; yet, the film is still described as significant. A PLACE IN THE SUN adapts the novel's content to the post-WWII reality but, most importantly, tells a story deeply rooted in the American dream of freedom, of self esteem, of personal success that goes with effort and hard work (going up the ladder like the biblical Jacob in his dream), of a beautiful woman at the side, simply a dream of such a personal place in the society. Yes, it deals with American reality but it also addresses every young person. The story of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) appears to manifest that point. He is an ambiguous character, a humane outsider. His acts are not reasonably justified because he is a changeable creature that may do some silly, wicked, unpredictable things that lead to tragedy....Does he commit them within the search for happiness? Or within the selfish desire to be free? Whether guilty or not...whether a thought of murder or an act of murder, who cares at the face of the stone cold law? Although he moves up in the professional life, his intoxicating danger is double life before two women who see themselves differently in his arms.. The 'society girl' Angela (Elizabeth Taylor) who constitutes the top of the ladder, a dreamlike woman for George and poor factory worker Alice (Shelley Winters) who reminds him of the hard beginnings...they beautifully manifest two worlds. They are both beautiful but in a different way; they both want something for themselves but something apart; they both are childish to some extent; yet their dreams make them mature. While Al is dazzled by George, she is naive. While George is dazzled by Angela, he finds a goal. While Angela falls in love with George, it is too late...and it is just time to say goodbye... A bird enters his life... a loon as peace and tranquility, generous and giving nature. However, before he realizes that, there is another bird awaiting him; the one of an unknown world...Viewers are excellent interpreters of the characters thanks to the observing camera. Characters in distance and some close-ups considerably change their perceptions and emotions. We can read their minds when they are closer, we keep distance when they are further. The famous close-up of Angela-George's long kiss is an excellent example of how the camera-work effects us in the movie. But the necessary aspect to analyze are the performances. 17 year-old Elizabeth Taylor shines in her role (her first serious role) as a beautiful young woman, as a glamorous symbol in the male mind, as a fresh and still inexperienced actress who achieves incredible charm, humor, flexibility and vitality in this role. This is one of her very best roles. Ms Winters nicely emphasizes her character's determination, sophistication and pitiful sadness. She is best in the famous scene at the doctor's. Montgomery Clift, who nicely cooperated with Liz Taylor, achieves a unique portrayal of ambiguity. His acts are cruel, selfish at certain moments, yet, viewers understand him. That is an incredible achievement to fill the wickedness with a certain amount of sympathy. The supporting role of Anne Revere as George's mother is worth attention too. She portrays a woman 'active in religious work,' a strict but a caring mother.The mood of the picture is expressed by lovely locations. Lake Tahoe (called Loon Lake in the movie) with the lovely combination of idyllic and mysterious views very well fits to the turning point of the movie with the striking similarity to Murnau's silent masterpiece SUNRISE. Among the most memorable scenes, you should call attention to the court sequence that accurately avoids all clichs.When you see A PLACE IN THE SUN, you will perhaps agree with me that it is an intimate masterpiece. 'Intimate' thanks to the cast (particularly Liz and Monty), thanks to the director and the ambiguous manifestation of human nature. Since it "deals with human conditions" (Mamoulian), the movie universally finds a place in viewers' minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A view of the separation between classes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A melodramatic view of the separation of upper and lower classes, starring a 19 year old Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift, Shelley Winters, &amp; Raymond Burr. Based on Theodore Dreiser's book, "An American Tragedy." It won 6 Oscars (none for performances or best picture).A nephew (Clift) of a rich, upper class manufacturer/owner works as a bellhop in the hotel in which that owner stayed briefly. When he's offered a job in that owner's plant, he hitch-hikes to California to take advantage of it.He begins work in a low level job and soon forms a romantic relationship with a coworker, Shelley Winters. But as he moves up in the company, he gets invited to attend functions with his uncle's family and becomes more involved in their high society life. In doing this, he meets a beautiful debutante (Elizabeth Taylor) and they fall in love.But that creates a problem with his already established relation with Winters. The remainder of the film deals with resolving that problem.It gives a good feel for the existing social class structures and mors of the 1940s and '50s with (IMO) a seeming warning to not try to aspire too high, to stay within your own social class. I give it high marks for never clearly resolving what actually happened (a tragedy), or who was responsible for what.Raymond Burr's role in this looks like an audition for (or trial run of) his later TV series as Perry Mason.I'll rate it as 7.5 of 10 stars; it's of most interest to see Taylor, Clift, Winters, &amp; Burr in their earlier days and society's (this film's) prevailing views of class mixing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elizabeth transcendent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I avoided watching this movie for many years, and I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was because I felt, somehow, it might emotionally overwhelm me, which in fact it came close to doing when, after Elizabeth Taylor's passing, I was finally moved to see it. Most people I've read seem to concentrate on Clift's performance, while stressing Miss Taylor's beauty, but I think, now that she is gone, a new evaluation of her acting is needed. What lifts both of them in their scenes together is the palpable sense we get that we are witnessing an eruption of feeling between two people who are more than actors: it's a 'felt' performance in its most transcendent form, i.e., it brings us, the audience, into the presence and under the spell existing between the actors, and in so doing lifts it, and them, beyond the realm of acting altogether. Which is why it's such an electrifying moment when Angela breaks out of the trance she-and we-are in while dancing with George, turns in fright to the camera, and staring at us with round naked eyes says, "Are they watching us?" I didn't, but I felt for an instant the impulse to turn my eyes from the screen. It's this serious attention to the emotional truth, and the brave giving of it, that not just Clift, but Taylor as well, bring to every scene. And yes, she's beautiful too.The film, as someone else mentioned, is a romance without sentimentality, but its dimensions are tragic, almost classically so. George, who thinks he can play with the gods on Olympus, aka the American Ruling Class, overreaches and upsets the equipoise of the world, and must pay the consequences. Stevens' long dissolves are less dreamlike than they are Greek-chorus like, as if the voice of Fate was shipped to the splices in Bill Hornbeck's Moviola. And what of the last moments between George and Angela? Isn't it her tragedy too? Awakened by love to feeling for the first time in her life, she leaves seared and chastened by the experience, just as we're told the Greeks did leaving their amphitheaters. Anyway, whether you buy the Greek analogy or not--a great film, and a great performance by Elizabeth Taylor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but not one of the best films ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fairly uninteresting classic, which I think is the last film I hadn't seen that was on the original AFI 100. Montgomery Clift plays a creepy-seeming guy who starts to work for an uncle who barely knows him. He gets thrown into the uncle's bathing suit factory, doing an unflattering job. He courts a fellow line worker (Shelly Winters), but later gets moved up by his uncle. He leaves Winters behind and falls for the more upperclass Elizabeth Taylor (that's a Hell of a trade-up!). Unfortunately, he also leaves Winters pregnant. I have to compliment the film for being a bit ahead of its time. At least it acknowledges that sex exists. It even acknowledges abortion for half a second. It wants to acknowledge justice. (I'm assuming everyone else has seen this movie, but, if not, SPOILERS follow). Clift considers murder, and comes close to going through with it. He might have even done it, eventually, but Winters (in an incredibly forced scene) falls into a lake on her own and dies. Because of Clift's suspicious activities surrounding the event, he is arrested for murder. The last part of the film has to do with his trial, where Raymond Burr plays the D.A. Of course, this being 1951, the punishment is death. The film wants to get me to think, and, I have to admit, the only thing I could really think about is how unfair capital punishment is in this case. Plus, who doesn't want to kill Shelly Winters? She's the kind of gal you'd wake up next to the next day and then immediately consider murder, and maybe suicide. The film is mostly well made, but is not especially memorable. Acting-wise, I only liked Taylor. Clift overacts, in my estimation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Die For - Part One Of The American Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters - I had always thought that actor Montgomery Clift was just another empty-headed, Hollywood "pretty-boy", and, basically, nothing more than that. But his portrayal in A Place In The Sun (APITS, for short) proved to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he was really quite a gifted performer.In my opinion, it was definitely Clift's heartfelt portrayal as the tragic George Eastman character who gave APITS's story of social snobbery and murder its depth and its meaning. I'd say that it was Clift, alone, who carried this film over its many flaws and clichs to its riveting, melodramatic conclusion.Yes. Of course, it certainly did help APITS's overall success that the gorgeous, 19-year-old Elizabeth Taylor was cast as Angela Vickers, the sole focus of George's hopes, his dreams and his burning desire.Once poor George became hopelessly involved with pretty, young Angela, this viewer could easily understand what heady and emotional turmoil drove him at first to contemplate and then commit the ultimate "crime of passion".If you ask me, I think that even today, 65 years later, this depiction of the "American Tragedy" holds up surprisingly well. It's a film that has somehow managed to avoid that inevitable "dated" feeling which seems to plague so many pictures from that particular era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't beat Clift in his prime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When A PLACE IN THE SUN was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress forty years after its initial release, their motivation read that the film provides "cultural, historical or aesthetic significance." It's pointless to argue that all of these three terms are relevant in the case of this film, particularly whereas the last one is concerned; from a technical point of view, this is George Stevens's most interesting film, to my knowledge. Although it is not really true (contrary to what has sometimes been reported) that this is the first instance where a director made considerable use of slowly-fading camera-shots towards the end of a scene, Stevens arguably extended the expected boundaries of the technique up to that time. The Academy Awards may have taken notice on this, as the film earned Stevens his first "Oscar" as best director. Also the cinematography remains delicate and interesting six decades later, and definitely appears to be another major reason why the film is still held in such high regard.In other ways, however, A PLACE IN THE SUN has been visibly affected by the inevitability of age. Every now and then the dialogue appears too theatrical; the adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel has not been entirely successful in this regard. It is notable how George Stevens here, as with his later, perhaps more widely known film GIANT, managed to rise above the soap-opera-like tendencies in the script and turn out a film which still appears relatively modern, its time of making taken into consideration. Just as with GIANT, however, this accomplishment must also in A PLACE IN THE SUN be equally attributed to a remarkable cast; in this case, Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and, to some degree, Shelley Winters. I find it hard to call Clift's performance as George Eastman his crowning achievement, simply because he was so good in nearly everything he did throughout his career, but I may say so much as that his interpretation of the troubled individual provides me with one of these rare, rare instances where I am left wanting to grasp every single gesture and delivery of a line, obsessed with a desire to understand what this person really is about. Is he a villain or a victim of circumstance, or both? I was not sure the first time I watched the film several years ago, and if anything, I feel even less able to give a definitive answer now; reading the novel has helped me to understand what the author originally had in mind, but Clift's interpretation of the character is so acutely subtle, seemingly contradictory that it deserves to be analyzed also out of context with its origins.Also Elizabeth Taylor is given more to do than "just being beautiful" in her first starring role as an adult; the edgy unpredictability which would coin most of her performances in the future is very much present here, and the chemistry between her and Clift is dazzling (as every movie-buff will know, this was partly a result of their off-screen relationship). Winters plays, here for the first time, the type of character she would forever be associated with pretty much for the rest of her career, notably in THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and LOLITA; a desperate, forsaken woman. Although less iconic than Clift and Taylor, she, too, is perfect for her role, and it made her first Academy Award-nomination. Clift, on his part, was nominated for a second time, and the fact that he (or Marlon Brando) did not win may be viewed as proof that the Academy Awards should, perhaps, not be taken so seriously after all (which is not meant as an insult to Humphrey Bogart, who did win that year). Everyone's free to disagree, of course. But either way one cannot deny that Clift's performance stands as perhaps the foremost reason why A PLACE IN THE SUN remains so watchable to this day, along with the accomplishments of his co-stars and Stevens's directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where The Sex Comes In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place In The Sun provided one of those rare occasions when a remake not only betters the original, but proves to become a classic. If you will an essential that Alec Baldwin and Robert Osborne can present on TCM. Only the third and last remake of The Maltese Falcon comes immediately to mind in that category.This film had been done by Paramount under its original title, An American Tragedy. Based on the Theodore Dreiser novel that film starred Phillips Holmes, Sylvia Sydney and Frances Dee back in 1931. It gained great critical reviews, but didn't do so well at the box office. I've never seen the film, but I understand it was filled with a lot of working class polemics which weren't presented in an entertaining way.But as was argued in Sullivan's Travels you've got to present these kinds of films with a little sex. So when George Stevens did this version he laid the sex on aplenty.The story concerns Montgomery Clift who drifts into town as the poor relation of the town's biggest employer, a factory owner. He shows no favoritism to his relation and Clift gets a low paying job at the factory. While there he drifts also into an affair with another of the employees Shelley Winters.But then Clift meets the girl of his dreams in Elizabeth Taylor. This is where the sex comes in. It's all in the name Elizabeth Taylor. But not only is she gorgeous beyond belief, but dad's wealthy enough for a dozen. The problem is Shelley and a little something Clift left behind. Shelley's not going away and not considering abortion of which references had to be tiptoed around as per the ruling Code. It all comes to a head in a lake where Winters and Clift go on a rowboat ride and Winters doesn't come back.This version of An American Tragedy was better received. Not only to rave critical reviews, but glorious box office receipts and several Academy Awards, chiefly Best Director for George Stevens. This was a breakthrough performance for both Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters. Taylor had always been a pretty ingnue over at MGM, but this was where she first showed some acting chops. Sad to say she went right back to pretty heroines in films of varying quality until Giant in 1956 which was another loan out.As for Winters she had been playing brassy dames also in some films of varying quality until she got this part. The little mousy factory worker was so different than anything she ever did before, people also stood up and took notice of her. Winters and Clift were nominated as Best Actress and Actor for 1951, but lost to Vivien Leigh in A Streetcar Named Desire and Humphrey Bogart for The African Queen respectively. A Place In The Sun also lost for Best Picture to A Streetcar Named Desire.Other than that A Place In The Sun cleaned up at the Oscar ceremonies. It got awards for Best Screenplay, Best Music Score, Best Black and White Cinematography, Best Black and White Costume Design and Best Film Editing. It was and is a screen classic, a romantic one to be sure if not a polemical one.I can't leave without mentioning Montgomery Clift who was a person of incredible talent and one who chose meticulously for the most part the films he was involved in. He did a couple of average ones, but in a career of decidedly limited output for the approximately 20 years he was a star, Clift was involved in a great number of classic films. Monty was coming off the rather ordinary The Big Lift, but before that he had starred in The Search, Red River, and The Heiress. And all of those parts and The Big Lift and A Place In The Sun show an astounding range of characters.A Place In The Sun is a must see film on so many levels, for fans of the stars, for a great story brilliantly executed and directed by George Stevens and his great cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic, Troubling &amp; Touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Place In The Sun" is a dark tragedy in which one man's pursuit of success and romance leads to an incident which ultimately has a devastating effect on the lives of all three of the story's main characters. The screenplay by Harry Brown and Michael Wilson was based on Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy" and is set in a period in which society's rules and attitudes were very much different from those which prevail today.George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) is the poor nephew of a wealthy factory owner and travels from Chicago to L.A. to take up the offer of employment in his uncle's business which manufactures bathing suits. George is hardworking and makes a good impression but during this period is not entirely comfortable with the other Eastmans because, in their company, he's sharply aware of his humble background. His consequent loneliness is soon relieved, however, when he embarks on a secret relationship with Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters) who works with him on the factory production line.George's good work is rewarded when he's promoted and invited to a party at his uncle's house. He accepts the invitation even though it clashes with an arrangement he'd previously made to celebrate his birthday with Alice. At the Eastmans' party he retires alone to the billiard room where he's later joined by Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) who's a bright and pretty society girl. They chat and dance together but later George leaves to return to Alice's place where she gets annoyed at his late arrival and tells him that she's pregnant and he comforts her.When Angela invites George to a party at her parents' house, the couple enjoy being together and declare their love for each other. Angela has plans to spend the summer at her parents' vacation home by Loon Lake and George subsequently accepts Angela's invitation to spend some time there after telling Alice that he'll be with his uncle and is likely to be offered a bonus which will benefit them both. Alice soon recognises what's going on however, when she sees a newspaper photograph of Angela and George having fun together at the lake. Alice responds by threatening to expose the truth about their relationship unless George agrees to marry her without delay. The way in which he deals with this ultimatum leads to an incident on the lake and to him eventually being arrested on a murder charge.The events in "A Place In The Sun" happen at a time when being pregnant and unmarried was considered to be shameful, legal abortion was not available and anyone in Alice's predicament could find themselves cruelly stigmatised for years. With the stakes so high it's understandable why she became so fearful and angry at George's uncertainty and reluctant agreement to getting married.In a society in which respect and success mostly seem to be measured in direct proportion to the level of a person's wealth, it's also understandable how George, an unskilled and poorly educated young man who came from an impoverished background would instinctively reach for the best of everything that was made available to him. He was ambitious but not ruthless and this combination of qualities makes him react to his problems in a more complex, confused and interesting way than might otherwise be expected.Angela Vickers had enjoyed a privileged upbringing during which her life had been very uncomplicated and frivolous. Her relationship with George had also developed at a time when she was unaware of his involvement with Alice and she was therefore, not at all well equipped emotionally to come to terms with what happened to him.Elizabeth Taylor is scintillating and self confident in her role and Shelley Winters is convincing and skilled in how well she portrays Alice's transformation from an ordinary working class girl into someone who becomes very scared, angry and needy. Montgomery Clift is incredibly powerful in the way in which he conveys all the turmoil, confusion and anxiety that his character goes through as he tries to come to terms with the conflicts that arise when the pursuit of his ambitions becomes incompatible with the responsibility that he has to Alice. Similarly, the soul searching that he goes through towards the end of the movie is also depicted in a very sensitive and haunting way.Appropriately, for such a tragic and troubling tale, the mood of the film is often sombre with the use of effective close-ups heightening the intensity of what's happening on screen. The use of shadows is also impressive in many scenes such as the one where Alice gets into a car with George after visiting the doctor. At a time when she's feeling trapped and desperate, the area around her face is visible but the remainder of the screen is symbolically totally engulfed in shadow."A Place In The Sun" is an absorbing and touching film which has clearly deserved all the popularity and critical success that it's achieved over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigamy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film. The cast is a whose who of the 1950's with stirring performances by Montegomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, &amp; Shelly Winters. There is excellent support provided by a lot of others headed by a fine performance by Raymond Burr playing a DA who makes sure of a conviction.Clift plays a young man who falls in love with 2 women. As this is still an immoral activity in our society (until some judge makes a decision that infidelity is a form of discrimination &amp; not a valid grounds for a divorce), his character is torn apart within himself as the story unfolds. Clift is super in this role.He is poor young George Eastman who comes to a big city where his Uncle owns the biggest company in town Eastman Industries. When he gets a job with the company, everyone assumes George is going places because of his Uncle. He starts on an assembly line and falls in love with a co-worker (Shelly Winters)which is a forbidden relationship per his Uncles rules. They keep the secret from almost everyone.Then his Uncle spots him &amp; decides it is time for him to go where everyone expects. He meets the lovely Angela(Taylor) at his Uncles big party &amp; falls in love too. Clift's portrayal of loving 2 women &amp; being torn between them is what makes this film excellent.He leads the double life until Winters tells him she is going to have his child &amp; that he has to "do the right thing" by her and marry her. (Note this value changed in our society starting with the legalization of abortion). From here, he becomes less &amp; less stable as he is torn between the women.He pictures a way to kill Winters character, then when he attempts to carry it out, realizes he can't really do it, but then carries it out by accident. Raymond Burr's DA then takes the circumstantial evidence &amp; makes it stick &amp; Clifts character gets the electric chair.The irony of this film is that Clift wants it all, 2 women &amp; the American Dream. That leads to his downfall. Our modern society has changed now to the point that everybody today wants it all. This is not a safe path for our society now &amp; this film illustrates that point when it goes terrible wrong. Everybody wanting it all is going to lead us to our own death &amp; destruction which makes all of us now parallel with Clifts character.His destruction symbolizes where we are all headed, &amp; it is a scary place, with terrorism &amp; all that comes with it. Don't forget, there are people with the view that counters this plot, that a man having only one woman (wife) just isn't civilized. We have someone running for President who supported bigamy by looking the other way(several times), so next why not a judge? Fine work by George Stevens producing a thought provoking drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love ill-conceived , untrustworthy and tragic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The makings of a classic...undisciplined director George Stevens, the up-and-coming and moody Montgomery Clift and the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor. George Eastman(Clift)arrives at the door of his accomplished uncle Charles(Herbert Heyes)with the promise of a factory job. Against company rules a young worker Alice Tripp(Shelley Winters)falls in love with the quiet and solemn young Eastman. George is infatuated at first sight of the gorgeous dbutante Angela Vickers(Taylor). The love stricken Alice finds herself 'with child' and pressures George into getting married. The problem seems to be solved with a boating accident, until said accident ends in a murder charge.Clift is excellent. Taylor is seductive, ravishing and flawless. Winters is noticeable in spite of being cast quite homely and pathetic. In supporting roles: Raymond Burr, Shepperd Strudwick, Keefe Brasselle, Anne Revere and Fred Clark.My favorite scene is the rowboat sequence with Clift sweating bullets and grasping for enough courage to drown Winters. A PLACE IN THE SUN is worth watching over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That kiss Monty and Liz shared in the balcony made me realize it was the best I've seen in film history!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK picture a man looking for a new start. Picture him on a highway hitching a ride. Picture him entering a house that happens to be the destination he is going to come to an end with and land him on a new pair of feet, and of course an new beginning like he wanted. Picture him fall in love with one of his cohorts. Picture him have a secret obsession for another woman who happens to be the daughter of a wealthy establishment. Picture him knocking up the poor girl, only to have an secret affair with the wealthy yuppie girl(mind you he isn't married yet, but let's just say still playing the field and scoping out his horizons).OK picture all that and you have a soap, and most black and white movies back then when you viewed them made one feel as if life outside and inside the tube was a basic soap. All the elements of this movie was a soap, but I loved it. I loved Elizabeth Taylor, and after watching this movie I secretly gave her letters in the mail revealing my affection, I mean could you imagine her, if and a small if, she opened them and read them!!! But to be honest, I never sent her one letter, but I did wish I was born around 1930 so I could be closer to her age, but even then I still wouldn't have a chance.One of my favorite pinnacle moments occurs a little later in this film when Raymond Burr(hmmm or should we call him a handicapped Perry Mason?)demonstrates how Monty had killed poor Shelly in the boat that unfateful night. Putting the camera to Monty in the next second was smart by the director because it poured out the emotion from Monty looking up as if he had imagined the whole thing or discovered the errors of it, but nonetheless the face of Monty was essential in movie history because you could or want to feel sorry for the guy, even if he did do it, you wanted to walk in the screen and just hold the guy for a minute or two(even if he was bisexual, I would hold him just for a minute or two, come on now).The movie summed up to me when Monty was talking to Liz's father about his background, about being in a religious sect and not getting any education purposes and dropping out when he was 13 and so on and so on, and I could look into Monty and see the character insides intentions of why he did what he did, but to be honest I don't think Monty killed Winters(or Alice, I have a habit of calling the characters by their screen Hollywood signatures), I think as he described to Burr later in the film exactly what happened, that he intended , but then later got sick and ill conceived and wasn't prepared to tackle the mission of killing her so he wouldn't have to worry about living in poverty again and reliving that nightmare that he did throughout his whole entire childhood....he wanted the prosperity sort of life now, he was tired of being shackled and chain to not having much and scraping for what he did get and Elizabeth Taylor seemed like the perfect dream, the perfect escape and brought him into her world of never having a dull moment and worrying about anything again. And as we all find out, he was easily seducted into that world of hers and wanted to hide Winters character and not look back and as the guy in the jail cell said he had murder in his heart, which made him reluctantly not hesitate even thinking about rescuing Winters and letting her just disappear and fade underneath the water.This movie was a piece of cinema I wont easily forget and has the beautiful scene of Liz and Monty kissing on the balcony that was so realistic and passionate, I for one, who has never kissed Liz, thought I had and made me dream of diamonds for some reason...hmmmmm!!! I think Monty at the end realized Taylor, from first sight was what he wanted in an woman, and he had it, but didn't know how to get rid of the woman that he had impregnated and was like a fly that circled and buzzed around you endlessly throughout the day or night.But you watch it and see for yourself of what you believe....10/10!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a timeless quality to this movie. Perhaps because we can relate to the characters in more ways than one. Who hasn't felt attracted to unattainable beauty or trapped in our self made prison cells? This is perhaps George Steven's most important work, capturing the gorgeous mountains and lakes around Lake Tahoe to the equally gorgeous close ups of Liz and Monty, two equally impressive natural wonders. Just because something or someone may be beautiful, it can also be deadly. The lake is beautiful during the day but becomes deadly at night. George is certainly handsome but it's his actions that actually kill Alice (and his baby) in the boat. A glimpse of a better life by way of Angela, puts all of these events in motion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Essential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theodore Drieser was among America's earliest realistic authors, and his massive 1925 AN American TRAGEDY, loosely based on real events, was a best-selling shocker filled with premarital sex, abortion issues, and social failures. The novel was filmed in 1931--and Drieser was so outraged that he successfully sued Paramount to force reshoots and a new edit. The result did not please Drieser, Paramount, or the movie-going public, and when censorship began to rear its head both the novel and movie were quietly shelved.By the late 1940s, however, censorship began to relax, and A PLACE IN THE SUN was among the first films to take advantage of the fact. Unlike the 1931 film, producers did not attempt to film the whole of the novel; they instead focused on the second half. The result was singularly powerful.George Eastman (Montgomery Cliff) is the poor relation of a wealthy family--and when seeks aid from them he is given a menial job in the factory, where he becomes intimate with factory worker Alice (Shelly Winters.) But when George is suddenly promoted he begins to enter the world of his dreams--and it includes glamorous socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor.) And now only the commonplace and unexpectedly pregnant Alice stands between him and all that he has ever desired.The script veers toward excess more than once, but director George Stevens and his extraordinary cast carry the film to unexpectedly powerful effect. Previously known as a sex-bomb, Shelly Winters fought hard for the role of Alice and with it gives the first in the series of truly brilliant performances for which she would become so well known. Elizabeth Taylor was one of the leading beauties of the screen, and her acting chops had been in clear evidence for some time before A PLACE IN THE SUN went before the cameras, but it here that she first truly showed what she could do with serious drama; she is flawless. And then there is Montgomery Cliff.Although Marlon Brando and James Dean made "Method Acting" a household term, Cliff was very much of the same school, and he broke new ground in film several years before either Brando or Dean made the screen. And A PLACE IN THE SUN shows Cliff at his finest, offering a truly amazing, powerful performance as the highly-driven but morally weak George Eastman, stumbling over ever trip-wire society can place in his path. It is a truly devastating performance, gut-wrenchingly painful in honesty, offered without a trace of artifice in evidence.As the film progresses the moral issues evolve in several very unexpected ways, most particularly as they reference degrees of guilt, premeditation, and at what point intent becomes the same as fact. In the process A PLACE IN THE SUN develops a highly disconcerting "there but for the grace of God go I" quality. I think this particularly true for those among us who can look back upon what might best be called "youthful indiscretions;" we are left to wonder what choices we might have faced if things had been only very slightly different in our lives.The DVD print is not remastered, but it is pristine, and it comes with a slight but interesting bonus package that includes interviews with the surviving stars. Strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Place in the Sun" tells the story of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift), a poor relation who goes to work in his rich uncle's factory. He starts at the bottom level, working the production line, and gets involved romantically and sexually with co-worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), all the while yearning for the unattainable - the gorgeous Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). However, by the time he is able to finally be with Angela, his relationship with Alice interferes with his plans. The film is based on the novel "An American Tragedy", written by Theodore Dreiser in 1925. Elizabeth Taylor, who was only 17 at the time, was cast as Angela Vickers, the beautiful and rich love interest of George Eastman (Montgomery Clift). Shelley Winters is Alice Tripp, the woman who becomes a burden to Eastman, an obstacle to his love for Angela and her way of life. Stevens was reticent at first to cast Winters in the dowdy role; at the time she was known for portraying glamorous types or sexpots. She convinced Stevens to cast her by showing up in his office for her appointment with him dressed for the part, sitting silently when he came out and didn't recognize her for several minutes as he glanced around his outer office at the actresses waiting to see him. Raymond Burr, best known for his TV role as Perry Mason, plays a Perry Mason of sorts in the film: the prosecuting attorney, Frank Marlowe.This was the first of three films that Taylor and Clift made together; and they became instant friends upon meeting for the first time for the making of "A Place in the Sun". The chemistry between the two is evident, although Clift was in real life homosexual. They remained close friends until his death in 1966, at age 45, from a heart attack. Taylor has remarked that her first kiss with Clift in the film was the second time she had ever been actually kissed - the first time was two weeks before filming started.Director Stevens decided to take the story and set it in post-war times instead of in the 1920's, when the novel takes place, to take the atmosphere of wartime out of the feel of the story. The lushly filmed lake scenes have the look of an Ansel Adams photograph. Color would have been superfluous. The masterful use of shadows is evident throughout, and Stevens' several excruciatingly tight closeups of Taylor and Clift together serve to highlight her beauty and the chemistry between the two lead actors, heightening the sense of danger and romance. "A Place in the Sun" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, winning six, including Best Director for George Stevens. Note: Dreiser's novel was based on an actual murder case of 1906 - the case of Chester Gillette.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood glamor at its most refined.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't yet taken the time to read all of the comments submitted to IMDb on this one, so highly lauded and multi-awarded in its year of release, but I shall set aside some time to do so. The Comments Index leads me to suspect that there are some highly divergent opinions about what was, no doubt, designed to impress more than just the young audiences of the day, lured to the box office by the inspired casting of the gorgeous Miss Taylor, in the first flower of her womanly beauty, emoting with her new-found friend, the oh-so-sensitive "Monty" Clift.I saw this at a special screening during my college days, attended by the director, George Stevens (then deep in his elaborate preparations for his next-to-last film, the monumental "The Greatest Story Ever Told"), who consented to a question-and-answer session after the final fadeout. I recall being annoyed by the seemingly eternal lap dissolves employed by Stevens but was, overall, entertained, if a bit enervatingly so. I did find the trial scenes not up to the better-scripted opening sequences and some elements toward the end to be typical Hollywood claptrap (especially that clergyman and his odious maneuvering of Mr. Clift's character into an admission of "guilt.") I think it was Pauline Kael who once opined that causing the demise of the ultra-drab nag played by Shelley Winters was quite justifiable as a case of mercy killing! (Ms. Winters fared somewhat better, come Oscar time, under Stevens' direction in his "The Diary of Anne Frank" though she again was deglamorized to an alarming degree.)My opinion of the film, after a TV showing very recently, has, however, been at least revised to the extent that I find the editing style infinitely preferable to that employed by so many of today's directors who cater all to subserviently to the perverted tastes of those weaned on MTV and music videos. One can imagine how they'd squirm and fidget if, by some chance, they were required to sit through the full length of this much more refined example of cinematic art. By the way, what's with all the uncredited collaborators of the film's music scorer, Franz Waxman? Another thought I had when viewing the film the other day was that some of the musical choices seemed rather odd, even jarring at times, somewhat unusual for the ordinarily tasteful Mr. Waxman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As someone who DID read the book first...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only say that George Stevens' version of Theodore Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" is not what I envisioned when I read the book. Therefore, I came away disappointed at the screen treatment with Liz Taylor (beautiful but shallow), Montgomery Clift (beautiful but shallow) and poor Shelley Winters looking like a drab little wren. An air of artificiality hangs over every scene, every slow-moving scene, and only increases by the time the story arrives at the courtroom climax where an unrestrained Raymond Burr is allowed to chew the scenery. This is NOT the great picture everyone always says it is. It's one of those films that dates badly. Evidently, fans of Liz Taylor and Monty Clift are starry-eyed about their favorite actors and refuse to see the weaknesses in the plodding story and the thinly sketched characters. Elizabeth Taylor had much better roles in her future career (Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, Giant) and Montgomery Clift would make an unforgettable Morris Townsend in The Heiress. Their acting here is as self-conscious as the arty camerawork that frames them in huge romantic close-ups.The novel had much more depth and meaning than this watered down version of the story. Read it and you will wonder what all the fuss was about when "A Place in the Sun" was released. Vastly overrated and noteworthy only for the sincere performance of Shelley Winters and Franz Waxman's interesting background score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film probably 5 or 6 times, but only lately discovered that it was based on a novel by Theodore Dreiser, based on a true life murder case in 1906.Basically, it's about a social climber who has gotten a girlfriend pregnant and comes under the charms of a wealthy, beautiful young woman and needs to free himself.I have always been riveted by Clift, and in this movie he does his best to be the man who is torn between two women. I really have to hand it Shelley Winters as the woman that is desperate to be married and truly loves the Clift character. Usually I see her in movies where she is dominant and demanding, but in this movie she is weak and desperate. I never regarded her as a sensitive actress, but she does very well in this role, It's amazing to me.As others have said, Elizabeth Taylor has never looked so good, she absolutely glows in this movie, she has never hooked so beautiful!! An absolute goddess, you really can't get enough of her beauty.I would recommend this to fans of romance and film-noir. A very involving and tense but enjoyable movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Stevens directed and won an Oscar for the great job he did in this famous and impressive film.Filmed in late 1949 to early 1950- the film uses luminous black and white photography (which won it an Oscar) Stevens used huge closeups of Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor that where mind blowing- Taylor and Clift where two of the most beautiful Lovers captured on film.Most of The films power is derived from Clift's brilliant performance. His hesitations, awkward mannerisms and air of vulnerability where huge breakthroughs in a male leading man for the time. One must not overlook Shelly Winters Great performance either.Franz Waxman's haunting score won an Oscar for best soundtrack for a dramatic film. The film also won for best screenplay, best film editing, and best costumes (Edith Head).Clift and Winters nominated for best actor and actress respectively failed to win academy awards for their performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder at Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alert: This review may contain spoilers.This film is based on Theodore Dreiser's classic novel, "An American Tragedy", so don't expect a comedy. Dreiser was inspired by the true 1906 murder of Grace Brown by Chester Gillette at Big Moose Lake in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York. Chester was employed at his family's woman's apparel factory in the town of Cortland, and the trial occurred in the nearby town of Herkimer, New York. Although the film was shot at three different lakes in California, including Tahoe, there is no reason to believe that director George Stevens intended to change the locale of the novel from two small, industrial mill towns in upstate New York to California as several reviewers here believe to be the case. According to my research, California never had an electric chair but New York did.As the beginning of the massive 800 page novel is missing from the movie, some essential information is omitted, possibly by design, that exposes very early the central character's very weak moral foundation, a highly ironic circumstance when we consider that his parents had devoted their entire lives to saving lost souls in their urban American religious mission. As a result, the viewers are forced to judge George's moral character on their own as events unfold before them, and this, at times, can be a true mental challenge.Like the real-life Chester Gillette, George Eastman (Montgomery Clift), of poor and humble background, is hired on the assembly line of his family's apparel factory and, defying strict company policy, becomes sexually involved with a co- worker, the plain, dowdy, whining, and downright annoying Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), impregnating her somewhere along the way. In the meantime, George is promoted to an office position and gains entry to the aristocratic social circles of his wealthy, industrialist relatives, where he meets the beautiful, outgoing, and sophisticated Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). From the start, George and Angela are strongly attracted to each other and director Stevens, who deservedly won an Oscar for this film, highlights the passionate intensity of their relationship by the use of extreme close-up and a dreamlike musical accompaniment that becomes their mystifying, other worldly theme song for the rest of the picture. Well done, George Stevens!Now carrying his child, frumpy and irritating Alice threatens to expose him instantly to his newly gained, elite society unless he immediately marries her. Instead, George decides to row her out to an isolated section of Loon Lake where he plans to drown her. In the rowboat, Alice becomes agitated and accidentally capsizes the boat on her own. The viewers never witness George deliberately acting to harm her, and we never see him exerting any effort to save her either.Instead of coming clean with the authorities about the incident, as he should have, George flees from the scene and attempts to hide his involvement but is soon caught and implicated in her death. The District Attorney (Perry Mason--oh sorry, Raymond Burr!) is determined not only to convict George of murder but to send him to the electric chair (NY, folks, not CA!). Unfortunately for George, the DA's ruthless obsession, the mounting circumstantial evidence, the prevailing working class sentiments of the town, and his own testimony on the stand combine to persuade the jury against him.Ms. Winters, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role here, so successfully creates Alice as a walking stick of chalk screeching across a slate blackboard that she even tests the moral fiber of the viewer during George's decision making process of what the heck to do with her. In the rowboat, the prospect of spending his life with Alice rather than Angela is absolutely excruciating torture. I felt this intensely, but I still would have come clean about the incident with the authorities rather than running away, as George did. Would I have tried to find Alice under the water? Maybe for a few minutes. The role of Alice Tripp was only the start of a long and very successful string of somewhat unsympathetic, disagreeable characters for Shelley Winters, including those of "Lolita", "Diary of Anne Frank" (Oscar winning), and "Patch of Blue" (Oscar winning), only to mention a few. In this film, she found her true calling as an actor. Good for you, Shelley.If George didn't decide to break strict company rules, a very small and seemingly insignificant act, his life might have turned out very differently, but he was somehow fated for this end. Regardless of the specific turn of events, I was led to believe that he would have ended up in the very same place. How about you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With the exception of the killing, Clift plays pretty close to the same role as he did in The Heiress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of those highly regarded ones of its time. Even to this day it gets high marks. It's a good film...but not a great one.I really liked this film but I had a feeling I saw a similar performance by Montgomery Clift in some other film I saw...Then it came to me...The Heiress. In The Heiress he plays a guy trying to get his way to the top via social climbing via a female of a wealthy man. This is not much different. In this he plays a uneducated nephew of a To Do family whom they invite to come and get a job in their factory. When he arrives he is obviously a very timid and harmless guy but in comes Elizabeth Taylor and he's transfixed. He knows he doesn't stand a chance with her so he starts to secretly date a girl from the factory. One rule they state to him is to never date girls from the factory. To this turn he gets his girl pregnant. At the same time, or shortly thereafter, Elizabeth Taylor gives him some attention and they fall in love. What's a guy to do.The crux of the film is what he'll do when Shirley Winters (his girlfriend) turns the screws to him about getting married because of the baby. He decides the only solution is to drown her. Fast forward to the ending and we have a court case in which Raymond Burr puts on a masterful prosecution. Clift testifies in his own defense that she actually fell in without his assistance as he did the same. With some of you out there you'll have to pay close attention to him cause if you don't, you'll believe he is kinda innocent. The problem with this is that he isn't. Pay close attention to when he finally gets back to the cottage where his girl is. They all proceed to get on a boat and whilst they leave, a radio on the dock comes to life with news of the death of the girl in the lake and it looks like murder cause she has bruising on her face and head and also her arms. In his trial testimony, he says he thinks the boat flipped over and hit her in the head. OK, let's say this did happen George, how about the bruises all over her arms and face? Where'd they come from? Might they come from a guy who purposely was holding this girl down below the water so she would drown? hmmmmmm Ultimately he gets the chair but even if he thinks he's innocent of killing her, he knows he's guilty of not trying to save her from drowning...in his own mind.A well put together film but don't be too surprised if Clift's performance looks familiar. He seemed to do a lot of these type of roles. The nice guy goes wrong roles where you feel sorry for him. Regardless of that, this is a fine film and most certainly worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy or Stupidity?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A poor boy (Montgomery Clift) gets a job working for his rich uncle and ends up falling in love with two women (Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters).I have never really cared for Elizabeth Taylor, but found her to be a class act in this film. Likewise, I have had a strong respect for Montgomery Clift ever since seeing "I Confess". But he was not nearly as spectacular here. So, for me, this film was full of dashed expectations -- some goo, some less good.I found the plot as a whole to be lacking in that I could feel no sympathy for the lead character. His tragedy is loving two women? I feel no pity for that -- pick one. And pick correctly. If your biggest problem in life is that you cannot decide which woman to pursue, you have it pretty easy... at least until you screw it up for yourself (but I shall not ruin the plot by elaborating).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since Elizabeth Taylor died earlier this year, I've been watching some of her movies. "A Place in the Sun" casts her as a socialite who falls for the poor nephew (Montgomery Clift) of an industrialist. The only thing is, this man has been with another woman (Shelley Winters), meaning that an unavoidable situation is going to arise.It seems that, even though this movie is based on a novel that was inspired by a true story, it reflects what was likely a struggle for people returning from WWII, with trying to find a job and start a family (or maybe that's just my conjecture). Obviously, attitudes towards premarital sex and abortion have changed in the past sixty years, so the movie serves as a reminder of past mores (and of getting oneself into an inescapable situation).All in all, it was a pretty good movie. George Stevens later cast Elizabeth Taylor in "Giant".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early '50s Oscar bait</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theodore Dreiser might not have recognized his novel 'An American Tragedy' after its Hollywood facelift in 1951. Attitudes change, and a generation after the book was published what finally reached the screen was little more than an impeccably produced soap opera. Today the romantic melodrama is still more vivid than the sociological pretensions, which in truth never stood a chance against such an onslaught of Tinsel Town glamour. Credit for the enduring appeal of the film belongs to its two stars: Montgomery Clift, playing a poor young opportunist climbing up the social ladder, and Elizabeth Taylor as the wealthy dbutante with whom he falls in love. Too late, however: shop girl Shelley Winters is already pregnant and demanding a wedding, leading the desperate Clift into an entirely accidental but all-too convenient crime of passion. The film doesn't really go anywhere afterward (except to a ludicrous courtroom climax), but disregarding the slack pacing it survives as a textbook example of Hollywood pop iconography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a HUGE Montgomery Clift fan this was on my must see list. I travel a lot for a living so sitting down to watch a movie is a treat. But I'm sure glad I found time to sit and watch this one. Montgomery sadly seems to be the actor forgotten. But his performance in this movie is anything but forgettable. You really feel for him, as he starts to be torn between the two then by his emotions. Though I don't think that he physically harmed Alice when the boat tipped the fact he didn't try to save her when he could have says that to a degree he did go through with his plan to drown her. Great acting job to Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters as well. Everyone held their own and did a beautiful job in this very good movie. Though I will say Montgomery was robbed of the Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/opinion/19wed4.html?th&amp;emc=thTheodore Dreiser wrote An American Tragedy based on real events 100 years ago, and then wrote the screenplay for this movie adaptation. Both are classics. Although the characters' names are different in book/movies, the plot is the same, the people are the same. In the movie, plain Alice is portrayed just a little over the edge by Shelly Winters (and yes, she was a bombshell--at one time she rivaled Marilyn Monroe--just think of what SHE'd look like now, so there!)! I just got chills thinking of the scene in the little boat on the sad dark lake. No, I don't think he meant to kill her, he was a good boy deep down, raised with values that he remembered at the last second, but it was too late for Alice. After all, what kind of movie would we have had, if she hadn't drowned, had married George, and Angela would have...married some other guy. Oh wait, that's the plot lines for every nighttime soap opera we've ever had, eh? Read An American Tragedy--not only will you "look smart", but you'll be impressed by how well this movie reflects a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a place in the sun-may contain spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun, based on Theodore Dreiser's `An American Tragedy' creates a movie version of the novel which is directed by George Stevens in 1951. A Place in the Sun, has many A-list stars, included the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor as the wealthy love interest of Montgomery Clift. Steven's wonderful rendition of `An American Tragedy', addresses the issue of abortion, social status, and the death penalty to name a few. Therefore, A Place in the Sun becomes a powerful social drama released in 1951. The screenplay is based on a young man moving out east to work for is wealthy uncle, Mr. Eastman whom he has had little contact with his whole life. Shortly after settling in, Montgomery meets a woman of a lower social class who works in the factory along with him. A Place in the Sun, addresses the issue of social class early on in the movie, which you are able to see by the elegance of Mr. Eastman's house, and well dressed family members which is juxtaposed with the unmaterialistic lifestyle of Shelley Winters, in which she wears plain clothes and lives in a small one bedroom apartment with an elderly lady. This issue of social stratification is a prominent element throughout the movie, which eventually drives Montgomery to kill Shelly Winters in hopes achieving the epitome of an American dream. Another issue addressed in A Place in the Sun is that of premarital sex. This issue is one that is not only addressed by the plot and characters in the movie, but also by the lighting and placement of the characters during the act, and the repercussions that follow. In conjunction with the plot and the lighting a viewer may be lead to believe that premarital sex is a bad thing. One may think that because when Montgomery and Shelly engage in the act of sex, the audience is not able to see their faces, only the outline of their bodies; as if a shadow. This becomes a recurrent theme throughout the rest of the movie as one watches the consequence of the two characters sexual act produce a baby, and finally, when Montgomery and Shelly are sitting on the boat in the lake about to drown.Therefore, A place in the Sun takes on the task of filling a movie with multiple issues that plague modern day today. George Stevens addresses the attitude of how far one will go to find love and money in America. Stevens does this by showing how happy one is when blessed with money and power, by showing a strict social barrier between the rich and the poor, and ones strife for a better life; even at the cost of murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mix of a thriller and melo-drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Majority of films can be classified quite easily from different instances in the plot to either place a movie as thriller, comedy, musical or mello-drams. Yet, there are films that cross the boundaries to form a more complex genre. These films cause the viewer to think more and to consider all the social and political implications as it ( the film) attempts to reach a more diverse and complex audience. A perfect example of the more complex film genre is A Place in the Sun (Stevens 1951). The format of this particular film is a mix of the thriller and the mello-drama. Through its interpretation of class structure, social responsibility, the complexity of relationships between man and woman, and the moral decisions that plague the common man all levels of society are expected as the proper viewing audience. As the film unfolds, there is a noticeable distinction between the two socio-economic classes that make up the American society. There is the upper class in which time and money is spent more on parties, clothes, and cars. At the same time there is a lower class of individuals that make up the working blue collar class. The idea of the differences can be seen from the entrance of George into the Eastman house. His tweed suit, which in turn was expensive to him, was not of the same standards of suits that his rich family counterparts wore. The theme of desire to jump socio-economic classes due to the lack of material possessions is carried through out the film as George's main motivation for all actions that he takes.George is employed by his uncle to work on the packaging line in the Eastman plant; there he encounters a woman that he physically desires. Going against policy, he decides to begin a love affair even though he has no true feelings for his co-worker. George, being the stronger and more confident male figure, convinced her of his love and forced his way into her house and life. During this time they take part in premarital relations and a `trouble' or a child is the result of the affair. Yet, the audience must infer that such things have taken place due to all deviate action or conversations take place in complete darkness or off screen.Soon George meets the woman of his dreams at one of the family functions that he attends at the large estate of his family. When she shows interest in him there can be no controlling of his desire to be accepted and wanted in this prosperous world. The use of multiple soft fade in to Elizabeth Taylor's character's face show a more glorified or dream quality to her existence. They also depict when George is dreaming and fantasizing about his new love and new idealistic life. Now George is faced with a decision and the mistakes of his past. He knows that he cant change his future without be riding his life of his first girl friend and their illegitimate child. Slowly he develops the plan of isolating the woman on a boat so her death can be considered accidental, but he can not commit the act due to his moral and faith filled up bringing ( his mother's influence affects his life path). There is an altercation an her death is the result. George is then tried and sentenced for the death of a woman that he manipulated. Elizabeth Taylor's character continues to love George to the very end and George continues to dream of the idealistic life and woman to the very end. The film is to be one of love and loss but takes on a more informative role, one to show the viewer that the past is important to one's future. That all actions have consequences and that thoughts or dreams can motivate or carry a man through life. The use of multiple fade in and overlay of images shows such themes in a way that no narrative could capture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quest for a better life ends in tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen negative reviews of this film which call its social commentary outdated. I don't agree. This story is an all-too familiar and common one to be outdated, along with its social commentary. The quest for a better life, the quest for acknowledgment and social climbing, establishing yourself from common and modest origins as a social "lion". Those things are never easy and can take a piece of one's soul. And this is in part what this film is about.The hero or protagonist of this film is a young man who was raised in a religious home by his mother, George Eastman, played wonderfully by Montgomery Clift. Clift has always been one of my favorite actors and one of the few who possessed both great talent and great looks, really few. Despite being related to a wealthy family, he is not really treated as one of them, since they don't consider him their equal. He gets away from his mother and his home city Chicago to go to California where his uncle owns a factory. Despite being willing to give him a job, it's just an entry job and George is forbidden to socialize with any women who work there. He breaks the rules, unfortunately, and starts dating another poor girl, Alice, played by the excellent Shirley Winters. However, he soon finds himself promoted to a higher position in the factory and then meets a beautiful society girl Angela Vickers, played by Elizabeth Taylor at her most appealing. The two click instantly and fall in love and for the first time in his life, George is truly happy. No longer the outsider, he can now enjoy a rich social life with the cream of the crop. However, Alice finds out she is pregnant and threatens to ruin George's newfound idyll with Angela.Lets note that Taylor's character is called Angela. I think she represents a sort of angel of George's, who wants to lead him to a better life. Alice is her exact opposite, a rather shabby and not too good looking poor girl who has nothing to offer George but her love. And he doesn't want it, for she only reminds him of his poor and difficult past. Angela is the bright future, the ray of sunshine he needs. His place in the sun is therefore by her side. Alice is the darkness and gloom, if he goes back to her he will never be happy again. And here we start to question George's character: does he really love Angela for herself only or also because of her wealth and social status? Well, this is indeed meant to be the moral dilemma here and as such it helps to make the film more compelling and powerful.The ultimate tragic ending only makes it a film to be taken seriously as a drama, not just a melodrama. Its dramatic strength and the performances of its three stars is what really holds up A Place in the Sun and makes it a worthwhile experience to watch it. Its theme of quest for a better life, love, unwanted ties and ultimately tragedy is something that we can identify ourselves with even today. The message? The higher you climb, the harder you fall, perhaps. But I also like to look at it as just a tragic story of an unlucky man who tried to get himself a place under the sun and failed. It is also what I really like about it. There are no villains here, only victims.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) leaves his religious mother hitchhike from Chicago to California and his uncle wealthy Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes). His uncle offers him an entry job at the factory and the rest of his family are dismissive of his poor nephew. Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) is an upper class friend of the son. George starts to date fellow line worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). Then he gets involved with Angela. Alice gets pregnant after that first night and fears losing George.This is melodrama of the highest or the lowest order depending on your taste. The directions are pretty stiff and it slows down the movie. The scenes are long, uncut and not that interesting. I want to say that the acting is good but I think the personas of the actors are what's on display. I notice that Shelley Winters isn't even shown her face as she tearfully tells George about getting in 'trouble'. Taylor is her glamorous self. Clift is the ultra sensitive and somewhat pathetic guy. In the end, I don't like George and I don't see anything romantic about him. I also don't like the trial which is anti-climatic. The three main actors do an admirable job and keeps this from being pedestrian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very powerful and brilliantly played film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The amount of talent involved promised a great deal and A Place in the Sun lived up to it and more. The production values have such a sumptuous and haunting quality that perfectly match the romantic, tragic and darker tones A Place in the Sun has. Every frame is beautifully composed and every transition is as smooth as silk. George Stevens does a remarkable job directing, and very like with Giant he was wholly deserving of his Best Director Oscar, especially good is the very telling scene when George and Angela meet for the first time. Franz Waxman's score is lush and hauntingly beautiful in a way that is undoubtedly Waxman's style as soon as you hear it. A Place in the Sun is intelligently written with parts that are suspenseful and emotionally gut-wrenching. Equally so is the story, which personally didn't come across as dated, it is a dark and quite complex story powerfully told and quite ahead of its time too, the romantic parts are classily done and the tragedy is depicted movingly as well. The characters are compellingly real, not easy to sympathise for(apart from Alice) but that wasn't intended I don't think. The cast was a great one on paper and even greater on film, Montgomery Clift has rarely been more tortured and he does so in an enigmatic and affecting way, Elizabeth Taylor is at her most luminous(even outdoing Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, The Last Time I Saw You in Paris and Giant on that front) and gives one of her best performances and Shelley Winters is every bit as brilliant. A Place in the Sun may not be as solidly paced in the second half and Raymond Burr badly overdoes it as the attorney especially in the cross-examination with the breaking of the oar, but even they aren't quite enough to ruin a powerful and brilliantly made and played film that is among the best of the 50s. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant drama. Was going to say "crime-drama" but it is much more than that. Starts out as a romance and general relationship drama and then evolves into something more and a whole letter better. Retains its sense of romance until the end, but throws in many topical issues along the way (validity, or otherwise, of the death penalty being one of them).Excellent plot. The way the movie evolves from a small town human drama to a crime drama and courtroom drama is incredible, and totally unpredictable. Even in the final scene you don't know how things are going to work out.Superb directing from George Stevens. Hitchcockian in some of his uses of camera angles, and Billy Wilder-like in his presentation of human lives and tragedy.The movie will be mostly remembered for the magnetic, sensitive performance from Montgomery Clift. Known for portraying deep, emotional characters, Clift doesn't disappoint here. Plus, here he shows a darker side too. Well deserved his Best Actor Oscar nomination and unlucky not to win.Shelley Winters also deserved her Best Actress nomination for her portrayal of Alice. Played the shy, sweet, unassuming, unpretentious character to perfection.No nomination for Elizabeth Taylor but she lights up the screen in every scene she is in. Stunningly beautiful.Interesting to see Raymond Burr as the District Attorney. Good work by him.A classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful, Epic Singular Work from Director Stevens, with Alround Fine Acting and Career Defining job by Montgomery Clift.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Lloyd titled an early autobiography, "An American Comedy." Though it was first published in '20's, it was reprinted as a paperback in 1971. At first glance, the title didn't mean much; that is until we learned about the book, and later movie, 'An American Tragedy." Then it made perfect sense, it was merely a play on words; a sort of literary pun.As we know, A PLACE IN THE SUN (Paramount, 1951) is a remake of the movie that was an adaptation of the novel by Theodore Dreiser. And as with so many successful book titles; it is based on a real life occurrence. It is fictional, but not strict fiction.OUR STORY???Estranged nephew of wealthy industrialist, Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes) is seen hitchhiking along a busy highway. The nephew, George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) is modestly dressed in slacks and leather jacket. He carries an old, well-used suitcase; that, doubtless, contains all his worldly possessions.While he's thumbing along, he is passed by one beautiful new convertible, being driven by an equally beautiful, Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). He really notices her, but she seems oblivious to him. An old truck eventually picks him up and delivers him to his desired destination.A meeting with the Tycoon Uncle, he receives an entry level job in the manufacturing end of the business. As an introductory exercise, the manufacturing job would also serve as a training period for his gradual, but certain ascent to the top levels of the corporate world.While supervising assembly line work, he meets up with Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), to whom he is attracted. Although he has been warned about an Eastman Family rule that prohibits the fraternizing with company employees, he and she start up a clandestine, but torrid affair.At a social function at the Unk's place, he meets up with Angela and is instantly smitten with her. The feeling is mutual and the two become an item. All the while, he is living with Alice and justifying his time away from her as being family politics, strictly related to insuring his career's continued success.While vacationing with the Vickers family at the lake, he is contacted by Alice via the telephone. She has news for him, as they are going to be parents. Alice demands that they marry; but George and Angela are now into it, head over heels. Hysterical and overbearing, Alice goes to the Lake Resort area and threatens to spill it all to the both the Vickers and the Eastman families.A radio news flash of a boating accident plants the idea that he could kill her on the lake and dispose of her body by casting it from the boat. While on a boat ride, the thought keeps running through his tormented mind; but he resists, only to have Alice cause the boat to capsize. In the dark wooded area of the lake, he eventually makes shore, but not Alice.He is eventually arrested and charged with First Degree Murder by The District Attorney, R. Frank Marlowe (a pre-Perry Masonic Raymond Burr). The uncle provides funds for his Defense Team; provided that Angela Vickers name is kept out of everything. That means that George faces a hostile gentry in the town, a lot of circumstantial evidence and an over zealous Prosecutor. Well, that's enough of that.The film is a masterful example of the heights that the motion picture industry can reach. The mood that is created right from the very beginning is not a happy one, but rather one of an unsure future and a sad past. Director George Stevens has masterfully mixed the various shades and hues of emotion on his pallet and brought out something altogether different. He got out every iota of talent from the whole cast, top to bottom. And all this is emphatically underscored by Franz Waxman's masterful original Score, both in the opening theme/overture and all the incidental music throughout.And one element that we have saved for the last is the criticism of the Male Lead, Mr. Montgomery Clift. From his first appearance on the screen, right up to the last scene, he presents us with a George Eastman who is definitely operating on a different wavelength. He has a different speed for life than the others, especially the Eastmans, the Vickers and their whole set. He has an indiscernible and very powerful way of conveying the image of a perpetual melancholy which hangs over him, regardless of the occasion. It was this ability of Mr. Clift's that led the way in this most unique and thoughtfully constructed film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!As an adaptation of the Dreiser novel "An American Tragedy," this is really just half-hearted...as a self-standing movie, it's pretty much a masterpiece. Director George Stevens takes the second half of the Dreiser novel and has made a brilliant showcase for the talents of Montgomery Clift. Clift plays a poor opportunist who ingratiates himself into the lives of his wealthy distant relatives and soon finds himself torn between factory worker Shelley Winters and dbutante Elizabeth Taylor. He makes some tragic decisions. Clift is excellent in a role that really captures his enigmatic personality. Winters equals him as a frump (at a time, ironically, when she was quite the fox) and Taylor is not bad in a very early "adult" role. The power in Clift's ironic predicament is dulled by the fact that Stevens leaves out the novels first half, where Dreiser explicated the reasons for the Clift character's desperation. Still, it's a great movie with many potent scenes: Clift contemplating Winters' death in a rowboat; Clift and Taylor meeting in a billiard room; Clift's woefully awkward introduction to his rich relatives. The great Anne Revere has a brief role as Clift's bible-thumping mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film contains many remarkable scenes, among them the moment George Eastman is caught, by the grizzled man he stumbles across in his feverish, hopeless attempt to flee. George Stevens back-lit the fellow, and let the smoke escaping from his mouth speak volumes. Then follows one of the greatest pauses in film history, like a held breath, until the man asks quietly and impersonally "Are you George Eastman?" Also remarkable in my view is the chemistry between Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift, because in real life they were the best of friends, and screen lovers who do not also connect on a deeper, more human level do not come across as lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always an interesting experience to read the comments of fellow IMDb reviewers. I especially appreciate the care that many take in presenting their evaluations. Sometimes, however, there is inaccuracy of information provided in the comments. Admittedly, most people submitting their comments are not professional movie critics, but it would be helpful for any of us submitting comments to make an attempt to stick to the facts when writing more than just our opinions. For example, reading all the reviews for A Place in the Sun, I encountered incorrect ages for Elizabeth Taylor. If one is going to mention the age of an actor in part of their review, the person should be certain of the facts. To the best of my knowledge, Montgomery Clift was born in 1920 and Elizabeth Taylor was born in 1932. The movie was released in 1951, but I believe the movie was filmed in 1949 according to facts provided in special features on the DVD. So, Montgomery Clift was 29 and Elizabeth Taylor was 17 at the time the movie was being made. There are also times when a character's name is incorrectly given. Several reviews referred to the Montgomery Clift character as George Easton instead of George Eastman. This kind of inaccuracy detracts from the review as a whole. Finally, every person is entitled to his or her opinion. Reviews in which disparaging comments are made about anyone who happens to like or dislike the film in question only detract and distract from whatever constructive comments may have been made in the course of the review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A half end of the novel "An American Tragedy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based in the novel of the nearly forgotten but outstanding writer Theodore Dreiser, who has several other interesting novels to be brought to the big screen. However, only this one, "Jennie Gerhardt" (1933) and "Carrie" (1952) have been shown in films. The present film may be considered as a remake of 1931 version directed by Josef von Sternberg. It is a kind of featured version of the second half of the novel "An American Tragedy", where part of the tragedy of young George Eastman is presented. Eastman's origin is from a very religious and poor family, he lost his father and had to do everything possible to sustain his mother and himself. In fact when he decided to get a job from his rich uncle (the father's brother) he was also running away from justice of the place where he lived, something not shown in the film. The rest is more or less based on the novel. Although Monty Clift and Liz Taylor were the main actor/actress of the film, one should acknowledge the excellent acting of Shelley Winters. The end of the film although tragic was also changed from its original novel's version. In the novel Angela Vickers (Liz Taylor) was never allowed to visit Eastman (Clift) when he was sitting in jail waiting for his execution nor the rest of the Eastman's family.</fullReview>

If you're looking for some interesting connections regarding class struggles, be sure to check out and compare it to another book of the same year (1925) "The Great Gatsby." As for the film, it is simply great. The love scenes between Clift and Taylor are some of the most sexually charged scenes ever filmed. Although the argument has been made that the film is "dated," I would ask you to remember that such issues as abortion, murder, and "new money" vs. "old money" still exist in America today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stevens's timeless classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe a lot of people, when they think of George Stevens, they think of movies such as "Shane", "Giant", "The diary of Anne Frank". One of the reasons for this fact is that "Shane" and "Giant" were better ranked than "A place in the sun" on AFI's top 100 list. But they aren't as good as "A place in the sun". This IS a true classic with great performances, great directing, and a great cast. For those of you who have read my critic, you'll notice that I said that it was adapted from Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American tragedy". I was wrong. It was adapted from a novel by Edna Ferber. However, if you read it, you will see that I said that it was the third in Stevens's trilogy which it is. Well "A place in the sun" is the first of the trilogy and is by far the best. George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) goes to work for his uncle who owns a very big company which he named Eastman. George is very poor and begins to work as a packer for the company. At work, he falls in love with an employee (Shelley Winters). But the company refuses to have men and women in the company seeing one another. Playing with fire, the young couple dates for a long time until George's birthday. On that day, his uncle tells him to come by his house and get a promotion into the administration bureau. Upon hearing the news, his girlfriend tells him that she had planned her own little party for George. So George tells her that he will go to her house right after he leaves his uncle's reception. However, at the reception, George meets the beautiful Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) and falls hopelessly in love with her. So after having fallen in love with Angela, George's life gets incredibly complicated because he can't tell Angela that he already has a girlfriend because he prefers Angela to his other girlfriend and he can't tell his girlfriend that he is seeing Angela because not only would it break her heart, but she would probably tell his uncle that they have been dating while they both worked for the same company and they would both get fired and George would then be completely lost for the rest of his life.  The rest of the movie is so masterfully directed that I don't want to tell you what happens. But I can tell you this. Montgomery Clift and Shelley Winters deliver very strong performances and I don't understand how come neither of them got a nomination for it. As for Elizabeth Taylor, well she delivers an excellent performance too, which isn't unusual, and she is as beautiful as ever in "A place in the sun". Also, her eyes were so blue that in this movie, the whole thing is in black and white except for the scenes where we see Elizabeth Taylor because you can practically see her blue eyes in the film. It's definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taylor and Clift are at the height of their stunning physical beauty in this tale of greed and lust, based upon Dreiser's 1931 "An American Tragedy". A Place in the Sun deals with a darker element of humanity - the power of money, the position it can bestow, along with the consequences of loneliness and sexual need. Franz Waxman's beautiful score can be a bit intrusive at times, but the heady, noir-ish quality of the film as it drags you deeper into George's complicated web of deceit is well worth the visit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where too much exposure can only result in self-destruction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was only when I watched this film recently that I realized I'd seen it when I was boy: certain scenes rekindled memories that I'd long since tucked away into early neural paths in my brain. I can't recall, though, what I thought of the story then, but now I can more readily appreciate the fine work of Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters and, of course, the director George Stevens ? perhaps more well-known for Gunga Din (1939) and the definitive western, Shane (1953).The subtitle for this story is 'An American Tragedy', a tag line that, after seeing the movie and thinking about the story, seems to be fitting: poor cousin, George (Clift), of the rich Eastman family comes to the big city to make his fortune, meets an attractive worker, Alice (Winters) in his uncle's factory and gets her pregnant, despite a no-fraternization company policy. At the same time, poor George meets socialite Angel Vickers (Taylor) and they fall truly, madly, deeply in love with each other.Alice demands George's attention, however, and marriage, something to which George is unwilling to do and, while George holidays at his uncle's country mansion, Alice arrives to achieve her demands. Poor George wants to be rid of her and hatches a plan to drown her in the nearby lake but, at the crucial moment, appears to waver. So does the rowboat that pitches about as they argue, and the boat upturns: Alice drowns, George swims ashore. He's eventually arrested and tried, pleading that, yes, he initially had the intent to murder, but relented ? and Alice's death was an accident, just an unfortunate accident. Is George convicted? For those who haven't seen this great movie, I'll stop right here.The film went on to win six Oscars, and richly deserved them; Monty Clift, who was nominated for best actor, lost out to Bogie for his role in The African Queen (1951). The direction, sound, cinematography, editing etc are all superb and there are so many delightfully constructed scenes, I'd soon exceed my word limit here. So, regardless of awards, this is one of Hollywood's best examples of film-making and must be seen by anyone who professes to be a cinephile.From a classical perspective, the story is very close to a true example of a tragedy. Certainly, there is heavy irony as George's predicament just gets worse by his own doing, leading to the loss of the one thing he desires the most. And George, like most people, is neither truly good nor truly bad, thus qualifying as a potentially tragic figure. Crucially, however, George is well aware of all that he is doing, and not unaware of the consequences of his actions. In other words, there is no distinctive revelation or epiphany for George at the end of the story.Significantly, however, the tag line ? An American Tragedy ? reveals the true nature of this story: The American Dream, for most people, is just that, and nothing more. The rich get richer behind closed doors; and those doors are forever a social and economic barrier to all those who aspire to move beyond their station in life and into those heights of ecstasy. That was as much true then as it is today, and that is the real tragedy of America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best soap opera I ever did see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story sounds too soapy to be any good. If it weren't for its players, it may have never gotten any recognition. But with George Stevens, Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and Shelley Winters along for the ride it was a success; and more than that, it is a very good movie.Montgomery Clift plays George Eastman, a man with nothing much to his name except an uncle who owns a factory. That uncle gives him a job working on the assembly line where he meets Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), and the two of them begin to see each other even though it is against the rules. Soon George moves up in the ranks of the factory and meets Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), a wealthy and vivacious young woman. Angela's wealth and status offer George luxury and security, and he must make a heavy decision regarding Alice.The subtlety of this movie is remarkable. George spends much of the movie proclaiming his love for Alice and Angela, but is he ever really in love with either of them? Or are they just objects of his desire? The film never answers the question and that is as it should be. We also never see exactly what happens at the two moments that change George's life forever. We never know fully what decisions he makes. All we see are the ramifications.Montgomery Clift and Shelley Winters are remarkable. Clift especially creates a full portrait; we never quite know what he's thinking and we get the feeling he is not sure either. I suppose that could be construed as bad acting, but I think it is quite the opposite. George was meant to be a waffling character, untrustworthy and deceitful, and Clift's infuses him with uncertainty mixed with impassioned desire. Elizabeth Taylor is good, but she is not given much to do.This is the first movie I have seen of George Stevens's. It is an intense and suspenseful commentary on greed and the caste system inherent in our society in the early 20th century. Is it relevant to today? Well?does it matter? It has great performances and the plot was good enough to hold my attention for 2 hours. If you like classic movies, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually surprised to some degree at the verdict at the end of the movie, but then I could accept it after thinking over the entire movie. It was a gripping movie I found fascinating and it most certainly kept me glued to my seat. It did tickle me to see that Raymond Burr again portrayed a legal beagle...I think he must have had a desire to be an attorney had he not become an actor. It is conceivable that much thought went into the cast of this movie. Elizabeth Taylor actually did a fine job for her young age. My overall view of the story and plot is that this movie was outstanding, but disappointing in terms of the ending. I would have liked to seen an alternate ending. Unfortunately, the film industry didn't have the concept of alternate endings in the 40s and 50s. Can you imagine? I would say that is the reason for Remakes, but that, too, doesn't always make for a better movie, but with few exceptions some have been improved. I hope to encounter another movie as exciting and suspenseful as this one was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamy and Poetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a dreamy and poetic adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, and in the eyes of many it has not worn the years well. It was an odd film even in its day, saved commercially by the star power of its lead players, Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor. As the tale of a poor boy from the West, with remote ties to eastern money, who climbs the social ladder of upper New York state society, it is unique in setting and subject matter. It is far more a romance than an analysis of the class system, and that it shows up the limitations of such a closed society as it depicts, and finds romance at all in such a world, is in itself remarkable, making the film, whatever its purported subject matter, an exercise in aestheticism of a singular and highly personal kind, as its two main character defy the demands of the real world by simply making up and inhabiting a world of their own.George Stevens directs the film with exquisite sensitivity, giving his material the full-throttle Bronte treatment, hypnotizing the viewer with continual emphasis on beauty, of the human and pastoral variety, with occasional darkling moments,--a bird call, a shadow--that hint at the tragedy to come. With its emphasis on beautiful faces, gestures and landscapes, A Place In the Sun evokes films of the silent era, and while it has much dialogue and music, they serve the images on the screen, rather than the other way around, as if the director were hankering to make his film without sound at all, which here serves mostly as interruption, which, as the film has a good deal of interruption of one kind or other, may well serve as its theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreiser Morphed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe part of the problem that commentators are having in coming to an agreement about the quality of this film is that, really, we're dealing with two stories instead of one. The first, Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" is really quite different from Stevens' "A Place in the Sun." The first is gritty and naturalistic; the second glossy and romantic. And regardless of the merits of either, they bear only a kind of family resemblance to one another. Dreiser was an odd bird, addicted to onanism and God knows what all; he was a good story teller and had a keen eye for realistic detail.We can learn a lot about what jail houses looked like in his day from reading the novel. But he was a particularly graceless writer. ("She wore ruby ear rings in her ears.") But, whatever his literary skills, his observations were grounded in locales and customs that he seemed very familiar with. In the novel the Clift character is named Clyde, for one thing. How's that for a romantic name -- makes you teary eyed right from the start, doesn't it? The setting is upstate New York and rather nicely conveyed. You pretty much get to know where Fonda is. (It's named after Jane, Henry, Peter, and Bridget's ancestors, and some of their family are still buried there.) The Taylor character is a total airhead who speaks mostly in a kind of revolting baby talk which I guess was passing popular at the time, but today is icky-poo. She is whisked away by a protective family as soon as her lover doll gets into hot water and never sees him again. Clyde's social ambitions are much more prominent in the novel. In the film, on the other hand, we have a three-handkerchief love story about love between two lovely people who love one another lovingly: the brooding, shy, latent heterosexual George Eastman, and the impulsive, passionate, and ultimately steadfast and brave Angela Vickers of the large and liquid eyes. Between the prematurely frumpy Alice Tripp and the criminally beautiful Angela, there is no contest.This film is about a romantic triangle, not about upward social mobility. George doesn't seem to plot a course towards the top of the pecking order; rather he's drawn to it, absorbed into it, through his attraction to Angela.There was another change from the novel, too, that pricked my curiosity: Clyde's last name now becomes Eastman which, in upstate New York, like around Rochester, is a name to conjure with. It doesn't seem to me that the film has dated all that much. Stevens had developed his own style by this time -- his dissolves last about as long as the Pleistocene -- but it was distinctly his own. The issues it deals with -- fornication, abortion, the distinction between social classes, and the ethics behind ambition -- are of course less potent now. But -- so? Are we so locked into the present that we are unable to sense any resonance between the conflicts these characters faced and those we face in our own time? If so, we'd be missing out on a lot of good literature, and would be stuck watching only films less than six months old, mostly about exploding vehicles. It's easier to look at the novel and the film as two related but still distinct entities instead of arguing that one is no more than a perversion of the other. Dreiser and Stevens had two separate goals in mind and if neither goal was achieved with perfection, well -- what is perfection?</fullReview>

The best scene in the movie comes at the end when Taylor's face reveals the true conflict of feelings she has for Clift.I still can't get past the story and the emphasis on certain aspects of it - such as the abortion doctor's scene, which was done so poorly that Winters looks like she doesn't know what she's doing.

		<fullReview>An amusingly dated story based on Theodore Dreiser's novel "An American Tragedy." It has all the elements of great tragedy, although the fact that it has aged so poorly keeps it from being truly classic.Mongomery Clift is George Eastman, a drifter shirt tail relative of a wealthy family who offers him a chance at the brass ring. They place him on the fast track at the family factory, and he has every opportunity to make good. Enter mousey little Alice Tripp(Shelley Winters) who gets in "trouble, bad trouble" with Monty just as his star begins to rise. To make matters worse, gorgeous socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) falls head over heels for young George.Here's the tragedy part. Alice, afraid of the life she'll have as a girl in trouble, demands that George make an honest woman of her. George decides that it would be better to kill her than marry her, and hopes that he can thus live happily ever after with the lovely, rich Angela. Alas, the key to all good tragedy is inevitability, and so everything slides almost comicly toward it inevitable tragic conclusion.Clift and Taylor are perhaps the two most beautiful people of the century, at least. That alone makes this worth the watch. The dilemma at the center of the plot wouldn't even raise an eyebrow today, but these two luminaries glide like two exotic swans high above the almost hideously common generations that would follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine acting/powerful drama ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Place in the Sun" (Paramount, 1951) is the second screen adaptation to Theodore Dreiser's novel, "An American Tragedy." Previously filmed by Paramount as "An American Tragedy" in 1931 starring Phillips Holmes (1907-1942), Sylvia Sidney and Frances Dee in the Clift, Shelley Winters and Elizabeth Taylor roles, directed by Josef Von Sternberg, the plot deals with a young but restless man with poverty upbringing who wants to rise above it all. He first comes across a poor working girl, but decides he could do a whole lot better when he meets a beautiful rich gal instead, but he later finds that he cannot get rid of Girl # 1 because she is pregnant with his child. What to do? He puts her to permanent rest so he be free to marry society girl. Was it all worth it? No, because young man gets nothing in return except an arrest, trial and prison sentence for his trouble. I've been fortunate to have seen both screen versions to the Dreiser story on TV and find director George Stevens' 1951 remake an improvement, in fact, an excellent movie. In the original movie, Sylvia Sidney was, to me, more believable and better suited for her role as the poor doomed girl than Shelley Winters in the remake mainly because Sidney appeared more fragile and naive. As for Holmes, he was just not leading man material, which explains why he didn't succeed as one in the 1930s. Within a few years, Holmes would gradually get smaller parts, and after he appeared in some lackluster productions, his career came to an end by 1938. Montgomery Clift (1920-1966), however, proved to be a better suited for this particular part, and like Holmes, death came too soon. The character names here have been changed from the book and original movie. The courtroom scene, with Raymond Burr as the lawyer, is overacted at best but at the same time quite tense. This was probably Burr's run through performance before he would score in the "Perry Mason" TV series for nine years on CBS. While this production may not be a "happy" movie, "A Place in the Sun," running a little over two hours, does not disappoint. This is the first Clift and Taylor teaming, and the young but thin Shelley Winters' performance is not to be overlooked here either. Look for Anne Revere (1903-1990) as Clift's mother. Sadly, her scenes were severely cut due to her being blacklisted during those black days of the McCarthy-Communist scare. If anyone wants to see how good an actress Revere can be, watch her Academy Award winning supporting role in "National Velvet" (MGM, 1944), also featuring Liz Taylor. (****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A major film in its day that has not--in my opinion-- held up very well over the years---- stodgy, stagy and more than a little ponderous---and the trial near the end of the picture must have seemed ludicrous even to contemporary audiences. But, watch the breathtaking scenes between a stunningly beautiful 18 year old Elizabeth Taylor (before all the marriages and scandals) and an equally ravishing Montgomery Clift and see if you can resist its attraction regardless of your gender, sexual orientation or critical preferences. Although the film--as I have said---has aged poorly---watch the scene where Taylor runs into Clift for the first time shooting pool by himself in the billiard room of his rich uncle's house; watch the famous dance scene at a swank party and the record breaking in length kiss that follows---director George Steven's camera hovering as close to the actors as it can get without entering a bodily orifice--- and you can feel the heat shimmering off the screen. If you want--read a plot synopsis of the film so you will have an idea about what is going on and then fast forward through everything except when Liz and Monty come into view. You won't be disappointed. After writing this review I think it's time for me to take a cold shower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Place in the Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a shame when it was announced the British actress, one of the last remaining actresses from the "golden age" of cinema, had died, I was certainly looking forward to seeing her young and beautiful in this film, listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane). Basically poor young man George Eastman (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Montgomery Clift) arrives in a Chicago town, and while working in a hotel as a bellboy has a chance encounter with his wealthy industrialist uncle Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes), he allows his nephew to visit whenever he is around, and despite the other Eastman family members seeing him as a bit on an outsider George is given a job in Charles's factory. George hopes to impress his uncle working hard, and while there he also starts dating poor and inexperienced fellow worker Alice Tripp (Golden Globe nominated Shelley Winters), she is dazed by him and doesn't really realise his family name being significant, and he does go up the corporate ladder, which include him allowed to suggest improvements to production, and his uncle impressed invites him to the family home for a social gathering. Since he arrived in town, George has been admired by "society girl" Angela Vickers (Dame Elizabeth Taylor), they finally meet at the party, and quickly fall in love, and escorting her propels him into the intoxicating and carefree high society lifestyle he had always been denied, and he stays with her even after Alice announces she is pregnant and expecting him to marry her, he even arranges an abortion which she does not go ahead with. George and Angela go to Loon Lake to seclude themselves and spend time together, he hears a tale of how a drowning occurred and a man's body was ever found, so he concocts a plan to get rid of Alice so he marry Angela, Alice meanwhile threatens to expose him and the pregnancy he caused while at a business event, so he leaves the family so he can deal with the situation. The next morning George and Alice try to get married at City Hall, but it is closed due to Labor Day, so he suggests they spend the day rowing on the lake, she has no suspicions of his plan, he acts visibly nervous before getting the boat, on the water Alice talks about dreams she has had of them being happy together with the child, he changes his mind about any murder plan, but she realises something is wrong, and standing up causes the boat to capsize, and she drowns while he swims to shore. Returning the Vickers lodge he is feeling tense and does not speak to anyone about what has happened, Alice's body is discovered in the water, her death is suspected as murder due to witness statements and abundant evidence, George is arrested just as he is granted permission to marry Angela by her father, although the drowning was accidental George's actions before and after the death condemn him. The District Attorney R. Frank Marlowe (Raymond Burr) acting as prosecution really grills him, and his denials are useless, in the end he is found guilty and sentenced to execution in the electric chair, George confesses he deserves it, as he wanted to kill her, so that makes just as guilty as much as if he had actually committed the crime. Also starring Anne Revere as Hannah Eastman, Keefe Brasselle as Earl Eastman, Lois Chartrand as Marsha, Fred Clark as Bellows, Shepperd Strudwick as Anthony 'Tony' Vickers and Frieda Inescort as Mrs. Ann Vickers. Clift as the young man rising in society, falling in love but brought back down again by an accident is really good, Winters is brilliant as the innocent and sympathetic other woman the leading man formerly had a relationship but unknowingly gets in his way, and young Taylor of course with lovely eyes, dark hair and big lips has never looked more beautiful, and is likable being the glamorous love interest. I don't know the origin of the film title, but the story is based on a novel called An American Tragedy, this is called one of the finest dramatic films of the 1950's, and that is definitely a suitable recommendations, it has impeccable imagery for a black and white picture, the acting and writing is great, I agree it may seem a little dated with it's love story ideas and being a little too drawn out, but it undoubtedly a gripping and splendid classic drama. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Franz Waxman, and it was nominated for Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, she was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icon, she was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, she was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, she was number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and she was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, the film was number 92 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 53 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Dream ..... Yet Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A PLACE IN THE SUN starts off as a social drama but turns into a courtroom thriller towards the end. A poor and uneducated young man (MONTGOMERY CLIFT) takes up a menial job in his uncles company. over there, he falls in love with a homely and nagging coworker (SHELLY WINTERS). But the young man slowly rises up in the firm and becomes romantically involved with a rich high flying socialite (ELIZABETH TAYLOR). His ordinary girlfriend becomes a burden and he would do anything to throw her out of his life.I am not a big fan of CLIFT but i'm not surprised that people like De Niro and Pacino look up to him. CLIFT reigns himself in through most of the film. But he sprinkles his understated performance with short outbursts (like the one during the scene in the boat with WINTERS). SHELLY WINTERS is initially desirable as the working class woman who later turns into a nag. ELIZABETH TAYLOR looked gorgeous. I guess she did not have to act much.There is some foreshadowing and foregrounding in the film which sort of underscores its theme of determinism. The beautiful outdoor visuals convey the opulent and idyllic lifestyles of the rich. The directors endeavor to make the film a thrilling courtroom drama towards the end does take away the opportunity to reflect on the actions of the main character. The courtroom scenes do leave a bit to be desired. Some of it was unremarkable while one of the actors who played the prosecuting lawyer was too over the top.But overall, A PLACE IN THE SUN is a very engaging drama filled with easily identifiable characters. I have not read the novel by THEODORE DRESIER on which the film is based. but this is another film about the emptiness of the American dream. The spiritual poverty of the main character is underlined when the priest tells him that if he thought about committing the crime, then he is guilty.In the end, when the main character walks towards his death, the screen is filled with images of his romantic dreams and longing. It was all so near yet so far. But an individual cannot expect to do the right thing and also fulfill his dreams.Jeez! Why do/did American writers and filmmakers have such a negative view about their culture and civilization?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Life Tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Stevens directed this drama based on the real life account of George Eastman(played by Montgomery Clift) who is a poor man who comes to California to work for his rich uncle in his factory. While there, he becomes involved with Alice Tripp(played by Shelley Winters) which he will regret later when he meets beautiful high society woman Angela Vickers(played by Elizabeth Taylor). They fall in love, but Alice returns into his life with most unwelcome news:she's pregnant with his child! Of course, George wants no part of this, so instead invites her on a fateful rowboat trip... Though well directed and acted, anyone familiar with the true story will be disturbed by the most unjust portrayal of Alice Tripp, whose real name was Grace, and not at all shrewish(was a most interesting segment on "Unsolved Mysteries" called 'Grace's Ghost') Granted, this was based on a play loosely based on the truth, but still! Marginal film will test viewer identification, since George deserved his ultimate fate; a tragedy for Angela and(especially) Alice the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George's choice between Shelly Winters and Elizabeth Taylor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSI think many people miss the whole point of this film, or at least the intent of the central character. Was George (Monty) an evil murderer? The answer is no; he was a normal male. He was faced with a choice--marry a pregnant Shelly Winters or marry a 19-year-old Elizabeth Taylor...hmmmm. We know that just before the accident (yes accident!) he reluctantly accepts the former. Now as far as being a murderer, did he commit murder? NO, he didn't! He was convicted because the jury believed the prosecution's (Raymond Burr's) conjecture that he slammed Alice (Shelly) on the head with the paddle. However we see exactly what happened; it was an accident a la Chappaquiddick--an accident--one he tried to cover up yes-but 1st degree murder?The main issue I have with this film is how he could have been attracted to Alice (Shelly) in the first place? I mean it's believable to be attracted to Liz, but Shirley? We know now Monty's orientation, but even so his scenes with Liz I think were believable, and with Shirley, not. And at he end his acceptance of his fate and "guilt", which the priest prompts him to do, was a cop out ending I believe, because it was like he deserved the chair, when it's obvious to me he didn't--- jail time for trying to cover up the accident, maybe. SPOILERS AHEAD---I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "you're overlooking the fact that George plotted the murder at least in his mind and began to act on it". Yes, true to a certain extent. It's not, or at least should not, be illegal to contemplate anything. But exactly what did he do to act on it? He pretended to run out of gas, rented a boat (it's not his fault they didn't have life vests--the boat renter is responsible for that), and then after realizing he could NOT act on this half-baked notion, the accident occurred. That is the most half-hearted half-baked, half-a--ed murder plot in history. Yes, he gave a fake name to the renter...however he showed his face...unless he wanted to get caught and IDed, is that a murder plot? So to me he's guilty of covering up after the fact...nothing more.And the question at the end is the ultimate copout. It's not against the law to fail to save someone, however the Priest used that as justification of capital punishment. Overall a great film, though very widely misinterpreted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Place In The Sun Is Worth The View</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place in the Sun is a film based on the novel An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser and the play, also titled An American Tragedy, which was adapted by Patrick Kearney from the novel. It stars stars Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Winters together with Anne Revere and Raymond Burr.The film was directed by George Stevens from a screenplay by Harry Brown and Michael Wilson.The story is about George Eastman, a handsome and charming but basically aimless young man who goes to work in a factory run by a distant, wealthy relative. Feeling lonely one evening, he has a brief rendezvous with assembly-line worker Alice Tripp, but he forgets all about her when he falls for dazzling socialite Angela Vickers. Alice can't forget about him because she is pregnant with his child. Just when George's personal and professional futures seem assured, Alice demands that he marry her or she'll expose him to his society friends. This predicament sets in motion a chain of events that will ultimately include George's arrest and numerous other tragedies, including a vicious cross-examination by a the District Attorney and the death of Alice.This could probably be already considered a dark film in the 50's.Aside from that,it also involves themes about the rich and the poor,a love story between different classes and different backgrounds and a tragedy in the end. The performances of Clift,Taylor and Winters are great and worthy of praise.I find Elizabeth Taylor extremely attractive and at her most beautiful as compared to the other film I have seen her.Many consider this a classic as it won 6 Academy Awards.But personally,I consider it only a classic in the decade of its release.The movie was slow and it wasn't compelling and powerful.Aside from that,it was also slow at the development of the story.Nevertheless,it still a good movie worth the view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I close in on completing my reviews of AFI's original Top 100 Movies of All Time (1997), I'm getting around to some great cinema classics I've never seen before. This one surprised me with it's compelling story line and superb direction by George Stevens. I'll also throw in a plug for cinematographer William C. Mellor, who's overlapping fades and images lend an effective dreamlike quality to the scenes where they're employed. But it's the acting that takes center stage, with Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and Shelley Winters driving an intense story line that ultimately ends in tragedy for each of it's principal characters.The picture takes a turn for the dark side when George Eastman (Clift) for the first time considers that murder may be his way out of an uncomfortable relationship with Alice Tripp (Winters), one that's complicated by an unwanted pregnancy and the sudden awareness by Angela Vickers (Taylor) that Eastman may be a desirable catch. Clift's method acting technique is given a serious workout in virtually every scene, as the brooding young man attempts to balance the consequences and outcomes of his conflicted life choices. Watching Clift walk that tightrope between desire and responsibility is one of the film's primary achievements.When the critical moment of the picture arrives, one wonders whether George will have the conviction to follow through on his deadly mission. For a brief period, I had the same reaction to the drowning scene as I did for the finale of "Angels With Dirty Faces". It was left up to the viewer to decide in that film whether Rocky Sullivan dies a yellow rat or a hero for Father Jerry's boys. Similarly, the movie here allows room for doubt as the viewer is offered the possibility of an accidental drowning or pre-meditated murder. That conflict takes center stage at the trial, and even though the verdict was guilty, the argument is not put to rest until Eastman's confessor wrangles the truth from him with a silent response about his thoughts at the precise moment of Alice's drowning. Powerfully done.For all of it's attention to details like these though, I was surprised that an important element following the accident was overlooked by the principals involved. When George stumbles into the Boy Scout camp, his clothes are completely dry and his hair is neatly combed. That bothered me enough that I had to shake the idea from my mind to continue the picture, it was that obvious and distracting.Well, not to quibble over a minor point. I'll offer one more observation that I thought was rather masterful. When Angela Vickers contemplates her life left in ruin by George's deceit and the fatal accident, a newspaper photo of George is seen in the fireplace about to be engulfed by fire. In a symbolic way, director Stevens effectively suggests that Angela's life is about to literally go up in flames. It's that kind of creative touch that makes the picture an enduring yet haunting classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtaking, classic American tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, having seen Elizabeth Taylor from some clips of movies she was in in the '50s, I thought to myself I hadn't seen many more beautiful women than that. I didn't know how great an actress she was. I figured there must be some reason she was so highly regarded apart from her charity work. I had always intended to watch some of her early work in order to educate myself as to how the legend of Liz Taylor came to be, and with her recent passing, I decided to check out one of the first films in which she was allowed to show off the full-range of her acting abilities, "A Place In The Sun". I'd already seen Montgomery Clift in a couple of films including "Who Shot Liberty Valance?" and found him a very evocative actor, my opinion of which was not changed by his performance in this role.The story is about George Eastman (Clift), the poorer relative of a blue-blood family. He comes to their town where his uncle, family patriarch Charles Eastman (Herbert Heyes) sets him up with a lower-level job as a favor to his sister Hannah (Anna Revere, very steely and stiff-upper-lipped as a Salvation Army worker in the Midwest). George works hard and becomes involved in a relationship with his fellow factory worker Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). All seems to be going on quite normally in his life until he meets local luminary Alice Vickers (Taylor). Vickers is wealthy but her demeanor does not demean. She is warm and open and Eastman falls hard for her. This sets about a series of events which build the film gradually to a boil, as would a pot left over a roaring fire.As mentioned, the acting, by Taylor and Clift, but also by Winters, is excellent. The movie is apparently based on quite a famous novel and reading some comments, the general conclusion is that it is quite an impressive adaptation. Since I am not familiar with the novel, I will have to defer to the opinions of those wiser on the topic than myself. I found the plot and the progression of the story to be very compelling and if the novel is as compelling as other commenters indicate, surely the screenplay must be very good. Liz Taylor was 17 when she filmed this. There are not many other young actresses who could aspire to this level of acting sophistication at that age-Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and actresses such as the star of "Kickass" and Keisha Castle-Hughes of "Whale Rider" possibly spring to mind, but Taylor shows herself to be a natural and probably much better than the alluded actresses in this film. Clift is incredibly evocative. The comparisons to James Dean are not unwarranted and they are not demeaning either. Clift can depict an incredible amount of emotion simply with an arch of his eyebrows. He can steal scenes when he does not say a line. His presence is magnetic.The screenplay by Michael Wilson and Harry Brown, from a Theodore Dreiser novel, is, as mentioned, to the point and disciplined, very focused and growing in tension as the film reaches its heart-stopping conclusion. This really is one not to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging movie-making from George Stevens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Place in the Sun" is George Stevens' adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's classic novel "An American Tragedy". Montgomery Clift stars as George Eastman, a blue collar worker who is taken under the wing of his rich uncle. He soon meets and falls in love with beautiful socialite Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor) but not before impregnating another woman (Shelley Winters). As George's worlds threaten to collide he is tempted to take drastic measures in order to secure his 'place in the sun'.One of the film's half dozen Oscars went to the screenwriters, Michael Wilson &amp; Harry Brown. I haven't read the novel so I can't say how faithful their adaptation is but the story is a compelling one. The romantic component may seem at odds with the film's darker side but it nevertheless creates a fascinating mix. The story really does have the feel of an American tragedy and contains a touch of ambiguity to make it all the more intriguing.Montgomery Clift stars in the film's pivotal role and he delivers an impressive, Oscar-nominated performance. Shelley Winters also garnered an Oscar nomination for her strong performance and Elizabeth Taylor looks exquisite. The solid supporting cast includes Raymond Burr and Anne Revere, among others.George Stevens won his first Oscar for his work here in the director's chair. He put a unique stamp on the visuals and made good use of some stylish (Oscar-winning) editing from William Hornbeck. The film's black-and-white cinematography also landed an Oscar, as did Edith Head's gorgeous costumes &amp; Franz Waxman's moving score.In the end, "A Place in the Sun" lost the Best Picture Oscar to "An American in Paris" but it is still fondly remembered today as a classic romantic drama. Personally, I enjoyed it enough to become interested in reading the source material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Eastman (Montgomery Clift), a poor nephew of a rich factory owner, gets a job in his uncle's factory. Despite the instructions to not form intimate relationships with fellow workers, he and his shy colleague Alice (Shelley Winters) soon develop feeling for each other. At his uncle's high society party George also meets a carefree rich girl Angela (Elizabeth Taylor) who welcomes his feelings too. When the expected happens with Alice and marriage is brought up, George is put between a rock and a hard place with dramatic consequences.A triangle drama may sound like a worn-out premise for a romance film, but here the pieces fall into place formidably. George Stevens' dynamic direction and camera-work are enjoyable throughout and support the story well: tight close-ups of the characters' faces often partly covered by other characters, somewhat long takes and allowing people to converse with their back to the camera all help to create a feel of presence on the screen. Particularly George and Alice's dramatic scenes at the lake are worth praise; the sense of tension on Montgomery Clift's face contrasted with the calm, beautifully photographed scenery all around them creates a highly memorable and suspenseful moment in the film, reminiscent of F.W. Murnau's silent classic Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927).Besides the excellent Clift, the beautiful ladies Winters and Taylor also handle their respective roles with talent. It's easy to feel sorry for the poor Alice, while the bubbly Angela gets to have fun at first but later comes to suffer too. George Eastman's ordeal before and after the tragic incident comes to life on Clift's face, and it's easy to feel for him too. The part when the carefree upper class vacationers go motor boating while a radio is left on the pier to broadcast a news report about Alice is especially telling of the injustice regarding the unlucky girl.There are some things I didn't like as much, such the overly melodramatic music and the lengthy courtroom scenes at the end, but they are only minor complaints in an otherwise enjoyable story. From the hopeful beginning to the powerful ending, A Place in the Sun provides a fascinating tale where the fear of scandals and public shame is just as debilitating as the guilt of contemplating wrongdoing to loved ones. All in all, the film deserves a place among the best screen romances of the 1950s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of THE most BEAUTIFUL films of ALL time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the romances I've seen, and I've seen Casablanca, Camille, Titanic, Breakfast At Tiffany's, Love Story, Atonement...None of them come close to A Place In The Sun. Visually it is a work of art. Originally meant to be in colour, George Stevens changed to black &amp; white to fit with the tragic ending. And thank god he did choose black and white, for it makes the film seem like a dream, the dream romance between Angela(Liz Taylor) and George (Montgomery Clift), and we are a part of that dream. From the first time George sees/ falls in love with Angela, to the first time their eyes meet, to their final goodbye, we can feel that immediate attraction, that chemistry, that bond. I think the theme of this film is love at first sight, and almost makes you believe that love at first sight IS real. Liz Taylor, for me, is at her most beautiful, never did anyone look more beautiful. We are captivated and spellbound by her beauty just like Monty is. That perfect face, ( she was only 17 at the time!!) has the same breathless effect that Vivien Leigh had in Gone With The Wind, and that Ava Gardner had in The Killers. In the film Liz plays Angela, who is the cream of American high society, she is the American dream, the girl of every man's dreams, ( much like Claudia Cardinale in 8 &amp; A Half), and she has a heart of gold to match. Monty is equally as gorgeous, his face like a carved statue, and eyes that reveal his inner most thoughts. Both Liz &amp; Monty act superbly, with a warmth and unity that would make you think they were a real life couple. They were in fact the best of friends, and Liz was very maternal to Monty, much like in the film where she famously tells him " Tell Mama all", and they kiss in the revolutionary up-close shot of a kiss. A beautiful moment in cinema history. Another beautiful aspect of the film are the costumes, with Edith Head designing some of the most stunning gowns/ outfits in film. There are some gorgeous day-to-day outfits worn by tailor which really show she's a rich girl and can afford the finest. However, the show- stopper has got to be the white, daisy bust, tulle evening gown. An absolute vision, particularly with Liz wearing it, the daisy bodice with the enormous white tulle is a stunning dress, and was copied by many department stores for proms that year. The music was revolutionary as well, for it was the first time in cinema that a score consisting of mainly a saxophone playing solo was used. Previously scores had been made up and led by strings, but the melancholy sax creates again this romantic illusion that enchants us throughout the film.Like the great romances, Titanic &amp; Casablanca, what makes this film even more romantic is the fact it ends tragically. The star-crossed lovers are destined to be together, and yet they are simultaneously torn apart!! The final words Liz says to Monty before he dies in the electric chair are, "Seems we spend the best of our times saying goodbye", which is so heartbreaking, as the beautiful young woman leaves the love of her life knowing that he will be dead within minutes. All in all, this is a must-see, the best of the romances, and a landmark in film. It will leave your eyes stinging with tears, but with a wonderful memory of these two beautiful people on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it amazing how people either ignore the fact that Montgomery Clift was gay, he wasn't bisexual people, he was gay!or just pretend to not to comment on how he was crucified by Hollywood. The fact that he never won an Academy Award especially for this performance, I mean William Holden won for Stalig 17? Everyone knew he was a Homosexual, including the Academy which voted. This is one of the great injustices of Academy history. Elizabeth Taylor has commented repeatedly on how he was tormented in Hollywood, this was normal for someone who was known to be Homosexual, in Hollywood, in schools, everywhere it was and still is pernicious , but not as much as it was before. How can anyone watch a movie with Monty in it w/out, commenting on his lifelong addiction to achohol, and drugs, that eventually killed him? Still Monty is a hero to me, cause he had more courage, and integrity than most gay actors who today live in the closet, and are fearful of the repercussions to their career if they were exposed. Monty was one of the greatest actors , and was an A-list star at this time, and they knew he was gay.Look at what he accomplished. Look at Hollywood today, and recognize his achievement, it is actually quite sad, how closeted it still is...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterful Illustration of George Stevens's Gift For Empathy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The powers involved in the creation and crafting of this socially, historically and artistically important masterpiece have a deep perception of social evils, human emotions, temptation, and the thin lines that divide good and evil, perceptions the power of which we would hardly be conscious without watching a film like this. One of the most brilliantly crafted works of drama I have ever seen, A Place In the Sun is a captivating examination of the American class system and how it shapes one shy and unassuming young man who makes some terrible decisions, but the inevitable question is, Who can't at any rate identify with and have compassion for his aspirations?A Place In the Sun is an affecting film that generates as much gray uncertainty in us as the protagonist feels over his actions. He is affable on top of gravely faulty by his circumstance. Shelly Winters is also a perfectly lovable, timid and humble young girl, but clearly incomplete in her idea of the world. Liz Taylor is overpoweringly sexy, but not as honest and wholesome as Shelly Winters. Considering the story and the protagonist's hopes, let alone his beginnings, what would you do? If you answer this one in your mind as you watch the film, it is likely to be the same answer that Montgomery Clift resolves to himself shortly thereof.Director George Stevens has fashioned a persuasive, disquieting film with realistic production design and a quintessential example of the nature and purpose of black and white cinematography. He prolongs an engulfing, boding thrust, never interrupted by even a breath of lightheartedness. Lethargic, unhurried dissolves and their overlaid images intensify the feeling of unavoidability as each scene slithers like a dream into the next. Yet, Stevens leaves many of Theodore Dreiser's characters' outlooks and ways of thinking implicit, giving the actors room to act, to emote. Montgomery Clift and Liz Taylor's own personal histories, closeness as friends away from the camera, shared love and shared admiration fueled the passion internalized in their own characters' respective ways that makes us long for their unity. The film gives the impression of an ode from Stevens to his stars, who reciprocate his admiration for them. Most emotionally gripping is Shelley Winters, playing a homely, underprivileged girl whose wholesomeness, too, has its limits, her progression to those limits flooding a well of sympathy for her.The film is a masterful illustration of Stevens's gift for empathy. We all know that accusations of classism frequently cause a lot of squabble, usually over personal history or issues of discernment of circumstances. People who commonly have a tendency to find accusations of classism against less privileged people to be groundless or unjustly severe time and again distinguish the supposed bias as signifying "class envy." Those who claim classism is exceptionally persistent or deep-seated in America often equate classism as the manifestation of organized economic manipulation by the upper classes, and may associate it with plain class warfare. It is also perceived that classism is widely held with bitter lower classes, looking for an antagonist as to their disadvantaged means. Stevens grasps Dreiser's story with a moving understanding of class struggle. No one twists anyone's arm to do any of the things they do in this film, nor do they find people who understand what they do. A Place In the Sun knows that the vital impetus for having this effect is by sparing us nothing, by not being afraid to let us down. And it uses that wisdom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating story about social classes and the desire to find a place in the sun, George Steven's masterpiece is timeless in the way it portrays young people simply trying to make their lives better but end up creating havoc and tragedy. The film is a mix of romance, sadness, and tragic events that make up the lives we live. From the beginning, you know that this cannot end in a happy way, and yet we continue to side with George Eastman and feel sympathy towards him for his unfortunate status. This is due in large part to the acting of Montgomery Clift, who is absolutely riveting as the poor, insecure, and awkward young man trying to improve his lifestyle. He gets Alice, a coworker, pregnant, but then falls in love with Angela Vickers, the socialite girl played beautifully by Elizabeth Taylor. Their scenes together are stunning; absolutely marvelous to look at. They have great chemistry together and make some of the most memorable love scenes in film history. This film is a tragedy, but we always feel sorrow of Clift's character and continue to hope he ends up living happily ever after. It doesn't happen. For George Stevens, this film portrays life as it actually is; a series of tragic events that link us with destiny. Our destiny is in our own hands and the choices we make affect all. Beautifully filmed, marvelously acted, and poignantly effective, A Place in the Sun is a film for all time and a masterpiece of the Golden Age of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ill fated character, Monty Clift...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as George Eastman, a young man who grew up impoverished, and spent his passion yearning and obsessing about the American dream. A trite and somewhat archaic concept today. But in 1951, it was still bright and shiny, a new reason to wake up with ambition and ruthlessness.George Eastman acquires a position in his wealthy uncle's factory and works his way up. He also encounters the beautiful Angela Vickers, ( well- portrayed by a very young Elizabeth Taylor), socialite and social butterfly desired by all.Shelley Winters adds the human touch to this story, a simple factory girl who falls for Eastman, and becomes pregnant. Some of the scenes where she and Clift are on the lake, the loneliness over Labor Day weekend, the sound of the loon. Very visual and sad.I have not yet read the Dreiser novel, and now am intrigued to do so. While some have mentioned that the film is dated, it is nevertheless an interesting timepiece, Taylor certainly beautiful and vibrant as Angela Vickers. And Montgomery Clift, young and tragic. A conflicted, complex character.One is reminded of the tragic story "The Great Gatsby". Fitzgerald and Dreiser indeed addressed similar themes: the tragedy of acquiring everything you want, at the expense of all else. Be careful what you wish for, as you will surely get it. The theme which seems to overshadow Clift's role in this film, and in his real life as well. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comparison to start</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could be considered, in a fashion, the inverse of Murnau's "Sunrise." The two major features are roughly the same, the attempted drowning that doesn't happen and the accidental one that does. However, the story and the style that go around it are almost complete opposites."Sunrise" is about a lower class man tempted by a "spider woman" from the city, whereas "A Place in the Sun" has the man not tempted but actually appealed to the upper class woman. The former is, in its way, a criticism of the modern city and represents the idyllic farmer as the hero, whereas this movie twists the American Dream by almost giving it to the hero before removing everything from underneath him. "Sunrise" is a silent film, and "A Place in the Sun" does a lot of expressionist work with sound. Both "Sunrise" and "A Place in the Sun" juxtapose cheery and light framings with dark and moody chiaroscuro. However it is in the use of these juxtaposed "moods" that "A Place in the Sun" shows itself as a better movie.The problem with "Sunrise" is that it takes great effort to show the evil temptations of the city-scape, and then sets the city as the place where love is rekindled. In "A Place in the Sun", however, the relationship between entrapment and freedom are kept to their separate realms. Shelly Winters' room is a dark and brooding place, she wears grays and heavy coats, everything about her is hunkered down and weighted. Elizabeth Taylor lives in a world of whites and light, and even though Angela is technically the more shallow character, the direction absolutely refuses to let the audience not fall in love with her. It is in that stark contrast that we relate to Montgomery Clift's brooding George Eastman, who doesn't really mean to create problems but due to his own insecurities and humility thinks that the Dream is impossible and that he must settle for what's left--until he suddenly finds himself within reach of all he's ever wanted."A Place in the Sun" certainly succeeds in being an "American Tragedy," and what's more, it works in a very logical way, especially with the trial scene. Put yourself in the jury's shoes: would you have convicted him? This tragedy is both a result of a character's flaw and irrefutable circumstance, a strange alignment of fate and floundering, and it works really well.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a thought provoking movie about the American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe you've seen it all regarding the chase for the 'American Dream'. Not until you've seen this first! Montgomery Clift is perfect as the wannabe (in the nicest possible way). He plays his character with so much pathos, it's almost heartbreaking and he's perfectly 'in character' with his counterpart from Dreisers's novel. Elizabeth Taylor's character is also beautifully and understatedly acted- not to mention the designer clothes which , of course, she wears so well. Shelley Winters is perfect for the role as Montgomery Clift's 'unfortunate mistake' in life, which comes back to haunt him. This is a movie which leaves you thinking long after the movie has ended. Definitely worth your while to view, when you've plenty of time to really sit, think and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place in the Sun really is a beautiful movie - but modern audiences must remember when watching it that it's also a film of its time, and as a consequence it does seem rather dated both in the way it looks and also the attitudes and values of its characters. If you can accept and appreciate this, you'll probably enjoy watching A Place in the Sun, even though it does plod a little through some of the story and at times the script isn't fantastic.The plot is pretty simple - the protagonist, George Eastman (sensitively played by Montgomery Clift), is given a job in his wealthy uncle's factory, with a view to him becoming part of the family business. Although he is ambitious and hardworking and desperate to make a good impression on his affluent relatives, he breaks the rules and starts dating one of the factory girls, Alice Tripp (brilliantly played by Shelley Winters) and gets her into, as she puts it, 'trouble'. At the same time, he is being introduced to the upper social class his uncle belongs to and he meets the stunning Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor in one of her few truly great roles) and falls deeply in love with her. George's dilemma is beautifully shown by director George Stevens - he knows that the decent thing would be to stick by Alice and support her and their child, but he is magnetically drawn to Angela by her beauty, wealth and social standing, and the fact that it is her, and not Alice, that he really loves. When Alice's humdrum life, frumpy style and drab, downtrodden character are compared with Angela's ravishing beauty, fancy clothes and opulent surroundings, there really is no comparison to be made.The audiences' sympathies are torn just as George's are - you feel sorry for poor Alice, but Clift and Taylor are so irresistible as a young couple in love that you want them to end up together. The soft-focus close ups in their love scenes are breathtaking as they heighten the emotion and dream-like qualities of the film, and the rest of the cinematography is just as effective, especially with the gorgeous scenery of California's Lake Tahoe as a backdrop. Nothing is lost visually by the fact that the movie was shot in black and white - it simply gives it a certain subtlety and an almost film-noirish style that couldn't have been achieved as easily if the film had been shot in glorious Technicolour.Inevitably, George's dilemma reaches a tragic conclusion and there's an absolutely heart-wrenching scene when he and Angela say goodbye for the last time. Both Clift and Taylor are superb in their roles, as is Shelley Winters, and they are backed up by a good supporting cast, especially Anne Revere, who gives an understated and moving performance in her small role as George's mother.If you like classic old movies, A Place In The Sun is perfect to watch on a rainy afternoon, curled up on the couch with a box of chocolates and - if you cry easily at movies - a pile of tissues!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SPOILER&amp;***********BE AWARE SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`A Place in the Sun' is film that is full of desire, hatred, love, and death. A story that begins with a man coming to see his rich uncle looking for a job; it ends with the same man George Easton in walking to the electric chair. This film entails a love triangle that has so many loops and swirls. Through the course of the film George finds himself stuck in a relationship with a woman (Alice Trip) who is going to have his baby and wishes him to marry her, and the relationship he desires with another woman. Through his relationship with Alice it always appears that when George and her are together it is very dark around them, or not a very delightful place they are at. For example, when the had their first kiss you could hardly even see it. However, when George was with the other woman it was easy to see and very bright. This symbolizes that Alice is not the one for George, but he gets himself in trouble by getting her pregnant. Especially since employees of Mr. Easton are not suppose to have relationships with one another. So Alice threatens to expose the entire thing, and George does not want this because he knows that his chances with the other woman with a good life ahead of her will be over. This leads George mad to the point he wishes to kill Alice, but at the last moment it appears he changes his mind, but she ends up dying from drowning anyway. Through the course of the whole plot George's personality changes a lot. He starts the film so nice and quite, and turns into a major jerk and lies to everyone. Loves, Desire, hate are all emotions that people have to deal with everyday day. George made a terrible mistake, and he didn't know what to do about it. Are we suppose to feel sorry for him, that they convicted of Alice's crime even though he didn't do it. I truly don't know, because there are examples in both directions to make me feel sorry for him, and not at the same time. I feel sorry for him because when he arrived to get his job for his uncle he seemed to be a very respectful, and caring man, and through the course of the film he had some bad luck. If Alice hadn't gotten pregnant there would have been no problem at all. The reason I don't feel sorry for him is because the night they had sex that got her pregnant he was totally trying to get her to do it with him, so it is his fault. If she were trying to get him to have sex it then it would be a different story. The obvious social issue in this film is pregnancy from sex before marriage. It is a very potent topic probably now almost as much as back then. However, it brings up major dilemmas in peoples lives when they get pregnant before marriage. As in this film it caused Alice to use it against George, and it made George go crazy. As we said in class, this would be a good film to show to young people because it might give them an idea of how bad pregnancy before marriage can affect two peoples lives. In this film it was bad for both the man and the woman. They both died because of this baby that was never born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>many social issues involved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert Social structure, wealth, beauty, love, and desire are just some of the social issues being depicted in A Place in the Sun. The largest issue was social class, and how there is a difference in treatment the higher you are in the social structure. When Mr. Eastman arrives first at the factory the guard pays little attention to him. This all changes when the guard receives the card that Mr. Eastman received from his uncle. With this card the guard seems like he will do anything for Mr. Eastman. The same situation is seen with the receptionist who said the boss is home giving no additional help until she finds out that the boy is an Eastman. The most obvious of the class difference is made by the wife of Mr. Eastman's uncle. As soon as she finds out about her nephew coming over, the first question is what we are going to do with Mr. Eastman socially. The wife knows that Mr. Eastman has little education and for that reason does not want to claim him. The Eastmans are family, but because of the social differences in their social levels Mr. Eastman is not even asked to stay with his uncle, even though his house is sure to have at least one open room. The wife instead gives the suggestion for Mr. Eastman to go and say in a boarding house which she heard about from her secretary who stayed there once. It was also made apparent by Mr. Eastman's cousin that even though he is not the same social level as the other Eastmans. Mr. Eastman is still an Eastman and should act right. Acting right meant following the rule that any male employee can not date a female employee. As the movie progresses Mr. Eastman falls victim to natural human behavior. If someone asks you to not do something you instinctively want to do what you can not. Mr. Eastman then has a secret love affair with one of the girls working in his department. As time progresses Mr. Eastman's uncle starts to like Mr. Eastman and he gets promoted. With this promotion Mr. Eastman is no longer at the bottom of the social structure. Mr. Eastman starts to encounter some of the joys of high society, and falls in love with the girl he has always been dreaming of, the girl that upon her sight stops Mr. Eastman in his tracks and thoughts of all others. Mr. Eastman always wanted her but never thought he could have a chance that is why he settled with the girl from his department just to keep from being lonely. An example of this is in the movie theater Mr. Eastman is there sitting alone after he walks from the party he was not uninvited to which Mr. Eastman's dream girl was at. The movie shows that Mr. Eastman is not truly in love with the assembly line girl by the use of darkness. In the scene when they are getting rained on in front of her place when the two kiss they are completely dark. Unlike when ever Mr. Eastman kisses the other girl it is very well lit. Also when Mr. Eastman enters the house it is hard to see him because it is so dark. The director has to be doing this for two reasons the false love and to represent the `bad' immoral thing that the two are about to engage in. The act which is so totally against the motion pictures rules that it can only be shown by the passage of time as the camera is focused on the radio. As the movie progresses Mr. Eastman's dream of having the model fall in love with him happens. Mr. Eastman also gets asked up to the lake and starts to gain the approval of her parents. Everything that Mr. Eastman has ever dreamed came true except for getting the poor girl from the assembly line pregnant. This infuriates Mr. Eastman knows she has the power to ruin it all. Then the solution to Mr. Eastman problem happens to present itself a little too conveniently for me in the form of the radio report and the conversation on the beach about drowning. Mr. Eastman then takes steps to get rid of the only thing holding him from high society and the woman he wants. In the end the department girl drowns and Mr. Eastman gets the electric chair, but I ask myself how could it all been avoided. The answer could come from the elimination of the social norms which drove him to secrecy and despair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Place in the Sun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert George Steven's 1951 A Place in the Sun, starring Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor as the twisted lovers, is a classic movie of its time. George Eastman (Clift) hitchhikes into town to get a job from his Uncle, packing bathing suits and fighting his loneliness. While he is waiting for a ride Angela Vickers (Taylor) drives right by him. Battling his loneliness, George gets involved with one of is coworkers Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters). After he is presented with a promotion, he gets invited to a party at the Vickers home, an all around wealthy family of the 50's. Quickly falling in love with Angela, a twisted love triangle is started and the two of them continue to stay together and George is also forced to continue his relationship with Alice. This film opens with George standing along side the road trying to hitch a ride. As he turns and looks over at a billboard the camera pans in on his face. The panning of the camera is important through out the film. It reflects emotions and gives the audience a sense of what is going to happen and what appears to be important. The opening of George trying to catch a ride is also important because it is a symbol of the fifties. It sets the mood of its time. Along with the panning of the camera, soft focus and fade-ins are also important in this film. Soft focus was used in many of the kissing scenes to help deliver a more emotional feeling. When George and Angela were dancing we see a fade-in of Angela's face. The fade-ins give meaning to the scene and also show the memories that the person is having. At the end of the movie when George is sitting in his jail cell a fade-up is used to display a memory of Angela that he is thinking about. The use of soft focus and fade-in/outs are all-important aspect that made this movie successful. They help explore the characters feelings and set moods to engage the audience with excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Narrative Techniques</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler What this film indicates is that love can become a troubling thing even when it's in the best of intentions. In this film, a man named George Eastman comes to work for his highly appreciated and high status uncle in a factory made up of mostly women. Although George was told not to get involved with the women workers, he does and he gets her pregnant. With the time period of the film abortions are illegal, so she decides that they should get married, but George has fallen in love with another woman who is of higher status. Now George has to find a way to get rid of his ex-love and the only way he believes that he can do this is by killing her, but he ends up killing himself, although not literally, because of love. Throughout this film, there were many narrative techniques which enlightened the audience of what was going to happen next in the film. When George first starts working at the factory, he happens to glance over and see a charming young woman looking at him and he smiles. She turns away with that shyness look in which right away you know that the two are going to get together sometime in the film. The director is leading us into the film. This also happens later in the film when George is thinking of a way to get rid of his ex-love. He hears on the radio about how all these individuals are dying by drowning and he gets this weird look on his face. The director reinforces this later when George and his new lover are at a lake and she tells him a story of how a couple drowned there and the guy's body was never found. George again gets the same look on his face and this sparks the audience's eye that George will kill his ex-love by drowning her. It also helps with the plot that the ex-love doesn't know how to swim. These were three insights that the director gave the audience to help with discovering what was going to happen in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Dreiser's novel, Stevens's movie dates badly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several people here have seen this movie as very '40s. Actually, it is an awkward mixing of that era and Dreiser's 1900s. Dreiser was one of several writers who tried to bring the naturalism of European writers like Emile Zola to America. His story was intended to be the antithesis of the Horatio Alger story, where a poor boy with pluck and ambition could always make good.Stevens was careful to keep Dreiser's indictment of the American dream intact but for some reason decided to update the book to his own time. Thus we have the wide gap between the arrogant, overbearing rich and the meek but honest poor facing a hopeless struggle. You would never guess the changes brought about by two World Wars, Prohibition and the Depression from this film. The only changes from Dreiser's time seem to be more cars, radio and clothing styles.To Stevens' credit, he remained as neutral about his characters as Dreiser was, though by 1951 it was no longer the height of realism. Elizabeth Taylor had her first opportunity to show sexuality, and her performance still effective. Montgomery Clift's method acting is not so lucky while Shelley Winters does the best she can with a pathetic character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some superior directing and editing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thing about this movie that really caught my interest while watching, was how the movie got edited together. There are some quite 'new' techniques used in this movie and it's stuff that you would normally expect so see in an early Akira Kurosawa movie.But there is of course much more to this movie. You also have to give credit for the movie its directing, by George Stevens, that keeps the story flowing and going. And even though quite a lot is happening, the movie manages to tell the story in just over 2 hours, without ever feeling rushed at any points, or as if the movie skipped a few beats that were in the novel perhaps.The movie obviously had some great source material to work with. It got based on a novel called "An American Tragedy", written by Theodore Dreiser and its later stage-play, by Patrick Kearney. It's a story about a far from perfect or successful man. When finally things start to go right for him and he gets a good job, thanks to being the nephew of a successful business man who owns a big factory, he makes the mistake for falling for two totally different girls. Ready to leave the one for the other he soon finds himself in a tight spot when the girl he no longer is in love with or wants to be with turns out to be pregnant by him. The story gets told in such a way that everything becomes highly convincing, in the way that this could basically happen to every average person in real-life as well.There is plenty of well written drama in this movie, without ever becoming a melodramatic genre piece. Therefore this movie is more recommendable to just everyone, even when you just aren't too into older movies.It was also great seeing so many great actors playing their parts in this movie. Montgomery Clift, who at first seems like just another pretty Hollywood face, is real convincing as this average person who gets himself into some real trouble and has to life a sort of a two lives, due to the circumstances. And no matter how weird and odd Elizabeth Taylor looks and seems these days, back in her prime she was simply stunning and also a real talented actress. I also really liked Raymond Burr in this one and it sort of made me wish that his role was longer and bigger. A great done- and more 'modern' genre piece within its genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contemporary issues lie at the heart of this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) comes from a lower class background; he runs into a wealthy uncle who invites him to come to California to work in his apparel factory. George starts at the bottom on a packaging line. There he meets Alice (Shelly Winters) and develops a relationship with her, to the extent of getting her pregnant--a definite no-no as per company policy. In the meantime George meets Angela (Elizabeth Taylor), the daughter of a wealthy friend of George's uncle. George immediately falls for Angela (who wouldn't). It is a bit of a stretch to see how Angela so quickly falls for George. There is no indication of who she is giving up in order to take up with George--such a beautiful and vivacious woman must have had multiple suitors begging to be selected. The soft focus close-ups of Taylor make you question whether high definition is an advance. Anyway, that's the setup, George wants to dump Alice and take up with Angela. But the pregnancy is in the way and George is in a real dilemma. Nobody plays tortured decision making better than Clift and he is at his best here. Shelly Winters plays the part of a sniveling whiner so well that you almost wish that George *would* murder her and ride off into the sunset with Angela. Alice does have the perceptiveness to understand that George does not want the baby and goes so far as to see a doctor with the idea of abortion in mind. But that eventuality is so off the chart at the time that the doctor, when he finally understands what Alice is getting at, says, "I cannot help you." If this were to happen now, Alice would have gotten her abortion and this plot point would have been resolved. When Alice realizes that George is moving in more exclusive circles and has fallen for Angela, she uses her pregnancy essentially to blackmail him. Finally the lovestruck George figures he has to dispatch Alice and takes her out on a lake to do the deed. When the moment comes, he cannot go through with it, but Alice is done in by accident. At trial George actually admits that he had murder in mind, and his attorney points out that contemplating a crime is not the same as committing it. Innocent as he may be, poor George can't defend himself against the circumstantial evidence and he is convicted and gets the chair.This movie makes a case for pro-choice and against the death penalty. Was that the intent in a 1951 movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Faithful Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been twenty or more years since I read Dreiser's "An American Tragedy." I remember being totally absorbed from beginning to end. There are so many positives about this film. Montgomery Clift, the master of angst, is a fine choice. He is handsome and has seemingly everything ahead of him. Because of loneliness, he becomes sexually involved with Shelley Winters and she becomes pregnant. This is the ultimate monkey wrench in the works because the initially unattainable Elizabeth Taylor (my gosh she was beautiful) becomes his for the taking. Winters' character, however, wants her life to go on with his, and as far as any hope for future with the rich young woman, this would have put an abrupt end to it. The scene in the boat is gut wrenching. We get to see that he is not a murderer, but he has carefully set up everything and his planning is what does him in. All the actors are excellent. I wanted to push Shelley Winters out of the boat, but she had every right to feel the way she did. He was truly a cad and had, for all practical purposes, selfishly deserted her. I was so glad that the movie stayed true to the original novel. I thought maybe Hollywood would throw in an eleventh hour reprieve based on some evidence turning up. By the way, the symbol of catching his foot in the rope as he leaves the boat in the courtroom is priceless. Raymond Burr must have set himself up pretty well for his future as Perry Mason, though he would have been on the other side. The picture is visually striking as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's a mild-mannered, plain-looking, self effacing no-account guy, with absolutely nothing going for him, in short, a complete non-entity, supposed to do when he has a chance to get in with the rich crowd but can't because of the presence in his life of a woman he not only does not love, but downright detests? How does a guy with no resources and limited intelligence deal with such a situation, especially when he is trying to hook up with another woman, this one who is beautiful and rich, and is going to be his meal ticket that will guarantee his "Place in the Sun"? This movie suggests that one must be wary of judging people too quickly, and to resist the temptation to be seduced by a superficially friendly or self-effacing mannerism because the seduction may be motivated by secret ulterior motives that render you a mere tool in their quest to satisfy their own nefarious needs. What makes this movie so great is how the movie captures how the guy completely fools everyone and is found out only after after the guy himself commits a crime. If he had played his cards right, he would have never been found out. But then again, if he had succeeded, there wouldn't have been a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic American Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Place In The Sun (1951) George Stevens directs this film classic that co-stars Montgomery Clift before he totally freaked out and had that car crash that ruined his looks and Shelly Winters trading in her early blond bombshell look for that of a frumpy clinging wife. One of the earliest movies that questioned the American dream and exposed many of the hypocrisies that existed in 1950s America.Contains one of the most famous clips in not only Elizabeth Taylor's career, but in all of American cinema. That being, Taylor and Clift's famous kiss. Stevens zooms in, for the first time, on Taylor's famous eyes, and even in black and white, the effect is both chilling and incredibly erotic. Rent the video and swoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only Taylor and Winters had exchanged roles...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the best of my knowledge it was the late great Pauline Kael who first advanced the theory that "A Place in the Sun" would have been much more interesting if Shelley Winters had played the rich girl and E. Taylor had played the poor girl. She was so right. Despite the arty cinematic flourishes and the pleasure we get from watching the camera worship Clift and Taylor during their love scenes (plus I've always been partial to Franz Waxman's moody, stirring score), the film's impact is blunted by its overly romantic approach. If Winters had played the rich girl in the same drab way she played the poor girl, Clift's interest in her would have been much more suspect. And if Taylor had played the poor girl in the same vivacious way she played the rich girl, then Clift's dumping of her would have been much more agonizingly poignant. As it is, the contrast between the two women is so obvious and heavy-handed we never seriously question the choices Clift has to make in this movie. I haven't read the Dreiser novel, but I'm certain that the hero must have been portrayed much more unsympathetically there than he is in this movie. As for poor Shelley Winters, she's not even allowed to look attractive or have a personality, so we can't even see why he would want to have a one-night stand with her much less consider marrying her! By implying that poor girls don't even have any natural assets, this movie seems to be an unintentionally glorifying the class system American style. The film's striking black and white photography looks splendid on the newly released DVD, but an audio commentary by George Stevens, Jr. and Ivan Moffat is disappointingly bland and uncritical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good movie, but the ending is too manipulative. It is highly implausible, that a gorgeous rich girl would visit a working class man sentenced to death, to say to him "I will always love you". This is a typical Hollywood ending designed to make women look downright angelic. It is also absurd, that Elizabeth, the most pretty girl in town, would have no boyfriend, and that lowly Monty would steal her heart. Dramas seldom satisfy me. I far prefer comedies, because comedies do not pretend to be realistic, and thus do not rely on suspension of disbelief. Dramas claim to be slices of life, and hence often turn into unwitting comedies. The choice seems to be: either you laugh with a movie or you laugh at it. (1990 diary entry).A great, but flawed movie, and this time I realized why: The whole second half after Clift's arrest, his trial and execution should be cut out entirely. It is utterly anti-climactic, melodramatic, redundant. It strains credulity and destroys art. Instead, Clift's relationship with both girls should have been more elaborated. The three main characters are presented in too sketchy a manner, not allowing the viewer to get involved with them. As it is, this film smacks too much of newspaper clipping. The characters are too flimsy, because the movie tries to encompass too much. Still, the first half until the arrest, is breathtakingly beautiful. It is one of those rare films whose every frame you could hang on a museum wall. I am therefore terribly puzzled by the banality and worthlessness of the second half. Was this movie made by a committee? Was the director fired? Seldom does one see very good and very bad stuff in the same movie. Particularly ludicrous is Elizabeth visiting Monty before his execution. That is an obvious concession to the all-American handkerchief. I am also offended by the priest prying into Clift's heart to establish whether in his "heart" he was guilty, and finding, that yes, he was, and that consequently the execution is not an outrage. This silly little scene is intended to justify the death penalty to the viewer, not to contribute anything to the movie. This film stands as a warning for all movie-makers: movies should deal with few characters and few situations. The more characters and situations you joggle, the thinner the soup. (1995 diary entry)I liked Sheley Winters best, both her performance and her character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Stevens is one of my favorite directors. And I think this is definitely one of his best films. Montgomery Clift gives an electrifying performance as George Eastman, the young man with many problems. He goes to work at his uncle's factory, and finds himself falling for a young worker there named Alice Tripp, played by Shelley Winters. Their romance heats up, and Alice finds out she is pregnant. Meanwhile, George is off having fun with a beautiful young socialite named Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). George finds himself in a terrible position, because Alice insists that they need to get married, but he is very much in love with Angela. So what he decides to do one weekend will forever change his life..."A Place in the Sun" is a romantic drama, based on Theodore Dreiser's novel 'An American Tragedy'. I think Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift give some of the best performances of their careers. So I give this movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Black-and-White classic truly worth its fame and praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Steven's high-calibre drama, a six-times Oscar winner (including BEST DIRECTOR and SCREENPLAY), is a tellingly puissant moral lesson adapted from Theodore Dreiser's novel, AN American TRAGEDY, inspired by real event. A working-class young man George Eastman (Clift), comes to town to work for his industrialist uncle Charles Eastman (Heyes), strives to fight for a better future, but begins to bog down into a dilemma when his low-class girlfriend Alice Tripp (Winters) gets pregnant and puts pressure on an immediate marriage, whilst a gorgeous socialite Angela Vickers (Taylor), whom he secretly admires, surprisingly reciprocates her affections.Any advice to solve George's dilemma? Not hindsight wisdom, yet the truth is, if that (highly uncommon) scenario would happen to anybody, under such a tempting circumstances, a rosy future with the perfect woman a man could ever dream of, the idea of dispatching the poor Alice would lurk around pretty certainly to any morally deficient social climbers, so despite the horrific act (Alice's pregnancy has never been put into foreground to exacerbate the crusade against George during the trial), we audience tends to sympathise with him, plus, the film intentionally omits what happened after the boat was capsized, in the eyes of viewers, it is an emotionally perturbed Alice herself causes the capsize of the boat at the first place, only in the court, George tries to re-enact what was happening then, even his side of story is scarcely credible, there is tiny possibility that he is "innocent", and what's more disturbing is that, subconsciously, we do hope he is!That's where lies the strength of this slow-burner, as George could be anything but "innocent", simply because even if he had not done anything to harm Alice, just lets it happen when a landlubber like her was drowning to her death, is another form of murder. He has the perfect motive, and his not-doing is exactly the helping hand to facilitate Alice's death.Why then, our commiserations are more inclining to George than to Alice, first of all, it is Montgomery Clift's unrivalled and wonderfully consistent performance, a misfit being ricocheted onto a wrong echelon, who awkwardness is painfully visible. Just when he decides to accept the reality to stay where he belongs, a windfall sweeps off his feet, which ensues a turbulent battle of human frailties and moral senses underneath of his humble physique and perpetually preoccupied minds. Mr. Clift even masks any edgy aspects of George's personality, to make his actions even more ambivalent, either he is a ruthless schemer putting on a masterful front to play meek and try to evade punishment, or he is a tragic character, passively devoured by the twist of fate. And even up until the final scene, we can not tell which one is the real George Eastman, in my book, that's a top-drawer achievement for the thespian.Secondly, Ms. Winters' Alice, exists more than just the unfortunate prey, when a woman has to literally blackmail her boyfriend with pregnancy into marrying her, apart from blaming an unjust social environment towards women, the truth is, they will never reach a happy ending, Alice is miserable but equally as selfish as George, bovine and unglamorous, the flagrant contrast between her and Angela, is another excuse for George's road-of-no-return. A trifle of misogyny and female objectification can be discerned, but in Ms. Winters' defence, she delivers a palpably soul- pulverising coup-de-matre, notably in the scene with the doctor to insinuate an abortion, and her final in-your-face accusation and hyperbole on the boat.There is a 16-year-old Elizabeth Taylor, a child star transmogrifies to a fabulous screen goddess overnight, her voice is crispy and untainted, so is her off-screen rapport and affection to Mr. Clift, mirroring Angela's undying love for George, an avatar of perfection too good to be true in reality, extant on the silver celluloid only. It is her angelic face and seductive kiss remain in George's last moments, something worth dying for in its literal meaning. Oscar-winner, the limelight-stealing character actress Anne Revere has a small cameo as George's religious mother, whose film career ended abruptly after this due to being on the infamous "Hollywood blacklist", which prompted a nearly 20-years gap of absence in her filmography.Mr. Stevens takes great patience and pain to elicit striking endeavour from his cast, and his unpretentious method of channeling the narrative arc with a deft hand of juxtaposed editing, pays off handsomely in its end-product, especially considering how they could manage to sidestep the Hays Code while retain its dramatic pathos and inspire contemplation of its thorny subject matter, a Black-and-White classic truly worth its fame and praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i agonized for quite some time debating whether another review was warranted. is there anything that i could add that hasn't been said? yes: 1. that george eastman could be any one of us at some point in our lives - a hot mess. and this is where it hits home. i suspect the negative reviews of apits is founded upon the maxim: "if you spot it you got it". men are uncomfortable with seeing that in themselves. the only other equal to this movie could possibly be the talented mr. ripley. 2. there was a synopsis that said alice tripp latched on to george eastman like a vice. unfortunately, this is true. after she found out that george is a coward, a liar, and a cheater, alice should have walked away. but that's easy for me to say. i don't have to raise a child on my own. part of what makes this such a great movie is that alice is a trusting, sweet, young, and beautiful woman. only a fool would walk away from that, and this is exactly where i can relate. i want to say that a lying, cheating, coward is going to get his comeuppance, but then i think which one of us has led a perfect life? not me, that's for sure.</fullReview>

Which one will he choose? He feels he's got it all figured out when the low class girl reveals she's pregnant and he's THEN faced with some pretty hard choices. There, THAT'S a good synopsis of this. This film has LOTS of surprises up it's sleeve. The 2 stars, Clift and Elizabeth Taylor just look ridiculously gorgeous in the movie, and George Stevens directs the tar out of this, putting in GREAT examples of foreshadowing and symbolism and what not.

		<shortDescription>This is nearly an exact copy of a prior film--except for the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is credited as coming from a novel by Theodore Dreiser, but the story in so many critical ways is the same as THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME. But, fortunately, both are also exceptional films and have very different endings. In general, this movie is a little more polished, while THEY WON'T BELIEVE ME is a little wilder and more entertaining--especially the ending. It turns out A PLACE IN THE SUN is the older of the two stories, having been filmed in 1931 as AN American TRAGEDY. Montgomery Clift, Shelly Winters and Liz Taylor all star in this long and very satisfying film. Supposedly nice-guy Clift is a poor fella who goes across country to work for his uncle's company. He is started at the very bottom and strikes up a romance with Winters--who eventually becomes pregnant! A bit later, he is moved up the company ladder and begins to socialize with his uncle's country club friends--where he gets to know Liz. He and Liz fall for each other. Marriage to her would mean the sweet life, but honoring his obligation to Winters would destroy all his plans for success. So, he considers killing Winters. What happens next is pretty unexpected (provided you didn't see the other film first) and the story has a lot of amazing twists and turns that make it a must-see film. The acting, writing, direction and nice location scenery really all come together nicely in this suspense film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very rarely write reviews. Usually it is when I feel something wonderful has been unfairly maligned or when something much praised fails to win me over. I'm afraid that A Place in the Sun falls in the latter category.It arrives with an impeccable pedigree. Three exceptionally talented actors and a full slate of Oscars and nominations. I was amazed at what a bloated, overacted, badly shot mess the whole thing turned out to be. I know that Elizabeth Taylor is stunning. Shooting her through gauze and Vaseline does not add to her beauty although it does give me second thoughts before having another cocktail. The vibrant Shelly Winters is reduced to a one note mope. Montgomery Cliff looks ridiculous with the fake sweat spayed on his forehead in every other scene. This could have been a great picture. If the director had allowed Ms. Winters and Ms. Taylor to play the full spectrum that they are more than capable of playing. If someone could have capitalized on the true sense of guilt and duplicity that Montgomery Clift dealt with in his everyday real life.I think that person is Hitchcock. If Alfred Hitchcock had directed this film it could have been a classic. Instead it barely qualifies for the matine movie on 1970's local television. That this was considered competition against The African Queen or An American in Paris is quite beyond my understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can your subconscious commit murder? That's the question this film leaves us to ponder, though I'm not so much left pondering the somewhat facile logic of the film's conclusion as the fact that so much incredible talent was put forth for this particular story. Although I found it gripping for most of its running time, ultimately the appearance of Raymond Burr and the constrictions of the production code and its furies of justice lead to much head-scratching.George Eastman (Montgomery Clift) is a young man in search of a better life: with pennies to spare he rolls into town as a passenger with a Mexican peddler, quickly wheeling a deal to work in his uncle's (Herbert Heyes) clothing factory. There he meets a rather subdued co-worker named Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters) who momentarily grabs his fancy, although his eye is continually turned towards society maven Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor). Eventually he concocts a ridiculously shortsighted plan to murder the pregnant Tripp so that he can live his dream with Miss Vickers, but of course nothing goes according to plan.To me, again, the quality of the story is good but not up to the level of the performances or of George Stevens' fine direction. At the point when it devolves into a crime-and-punishment morality tale, complete with Liz Taylor making weepy prison visits, the film becomes a bore. But Clift's performance is stunning, drawing us in at times in spite of ourselves. Stevens makes use of some very interesting cinematic devices, such as inaudible dialog and overlapping fade-ins and fade-outs that seem to convey a dream-like state of the protagonist's obsession with Vickers. A scene will fade out, just for a moment fade in to Clift and Taylor in passionate embrace, and then fade in on another scene involving Clift. In one particularly disconcerting scene of this type, the fade-away momentarily involves his dour religious mother.It's from the novel "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser, but I'm left wondering what was distinctly American about it. Presumably it's the overbearing theme of ambition, this idea that the Clift character is just trying to live the American dream. What we can see is that in the rough outline, his story would be ugly indeed -- he knocks up the low-rent girlfriend and then tries to ditch her for a rich lifestyle. The fact that the film makes us so sympathetic to his actions can either be read as tacit acceptance of "the dream" or, more likely, an ironic comment on our own willingness to put much ugliness aside when it's necessary to live the life we imagine we need. Young Eastman could have reached for the stars in the first place, and he seems to be punished just as much for accepting a substitute dream in the first place as for any of the actions he might have subsequently carried out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. Good acting, good story (though sadly I read a spoiler before seeing it and it took the edge off for me). But I disagree with the director's decision to do it in black and white. It's ELIZABETH TAYLOR for pete's sake! Now, although the director may have thought that technicolor detracted from the story, I think that says more about his directing abilities or lack thereof (or lack of confidence in himself) than reality bears out. Life is in color and we all know there's enough tragedy in that. And seeing Elizabeth Taylor in all her glory in glorious color would have made the dumping of a pregnant woman (who frankly got on my nerves so much I might have reached for a paddle myself) more understandable to the viewers. Not justifiable, but...It's ELIZABETH TAYLOR. What a waste at any time to let such an opportunity of such beauty to be missed. And if you don't know how to use that palette of colors to include drama and trauma and pain, well. As I said, that says more about you as a director than about the film or subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Place In The Sun, I must assume, has landmark elements to it included somewhere. It is simply not a good enough film as it stands to be lauded as highly as is, taken only by itself. Is it the first movie to show a love triangle? I should think not! Is it the first to show a man tormented by his thoughts and actions? Not even close! Maybe the film brought technological advances to the industry, or maybe in terms of style, it was ahead of it's time.Dissolves are used constantly, and is seemingly the way the filmmakers decide to change Every scene and mark EVERY passage of time. This gives the film a dream-like effect, to presumably gives the audience a murky, feel no consequence feeling, much like Montgomery Clift's character.The acting is fine in many cases, but none of the actors givbe their best performances. Clift is a little puzzling, but I guess in those days a man with his looks didn't really need to act that well. Elizabeth Taylor performs well, but this part could really have been played by any popular attractive actress to similar effect. Shelley Winters succeeds in being truly, truly annoying, so I guess it's bravo to that Raymond Burr is good in a small part, and carries a decent trial scene.I made this movie out to be out worse than it is, but it was never enjoyable, so I really don't see how I could give it more than a 6/10.</fullReview>

Winters is excellent in her role, but she is annoying (she's supposed to be) and overly pathetic at times. Taylor is drop-dead gorgeous and very good in her role.

		<fullReview>Spoilers! I finished watching A Place in the Sun (1951) not 20 minutes ago. If you liked this movie, I hate you. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this pointless. I don't mean bad. No, this film is literally pointless. The actions of George Eastman, the protagonist, so completely invalidate later events in the film-not to mention the consequences of those actions-as to make the film meaningless. During the film George gets a coworker, Alice, pregnant but falls in love with another woman. The film has engineered this situation to 1) make us feel sorry that George is stuck with this woman he doesn't really love, and 2) create tension after Alice's accidental death as we wonder whether George will be blamed for her murder. Except that the whole situation is George's fault. Within the first 10 minutes of the film it is explained to George that because he is a member of the family that owns the company he's working for, fraternizing with the female employees is unacceptable. At this point both the audience and George know the rules, so after George knocks Alice up why should the audience feel anything but bored? Oh no, poor George, he got Alice pregnant but now he's in love with Angela-oh wait, that's right, George knew the rules, only he didn't have the discipline to keep his genitals under control, it's entirely his fault! What's even worse than the fact that the movie expects us to empathize with George is the fact that he doesn't take responsibility for his actions. He could take responsibility by staying with Alice (which he obviously doesn't) and dealing with the consequences of supporting her or by at least putting some decent effort into masterminding her death. That may sound strange, but think about it. If he's decided to kill her, taking responsibility for that decision would be to take whatever steps are necessary to both kill her and get away with it. George's sterling plan involves not only drowning Alice, but also allowing Man1 and Man2 to see him with her on the same day he finally works up the nerve to off her (that would be the man who sees them arguing and the man who rents George the boat used in the killing, respectively). This does not strike me as being the plan of a determined murderer. It is impossible for a film set up like this one to contain any real messages. One could try to argue about how the film shows how society is more focused on morality than justice, or something, and how George is the oppressed working man-except that, as mentioned above, George creates the whole situation. George is clearly in the wrong for almost the entire movie. He is not innocent. He is, in fact, a bad person. Every scene in the film is ridiculously contrived. But the film builds on the silly, flawed premise that somehow the audience should care anyways, because apparently there's a message to be learned. Perhaps if there was any evidence showing that George actually loved Alice, I might be willing to go along. But I will not care about such a flimsily built house of cards.</fullReview>

He portrays a self indulgent boy more than a man. His looks can't carry the day. Perhaps he could model for a Ken doll, but really had no business in this movie.Elizabeth: Weak, unbelievable role. Yes she is one of the most beautiful women in the history of cinema. There was no depth to her character, but she did her job well.Shelley: Made to look and act so frumpy and whiny that the viewer just wants her to leave the movie set.Plot?: Very weak and unbelievable. Clift acts so dumb in his plotting to murder Shelley that we just don't care if he gets caught.Star of the movie?: the radio sitting in Shelley's bedroom window during the rain storm.Scene I would have enjoyed: Clift, with shaved head, getting juiced with Ole Sparky.
