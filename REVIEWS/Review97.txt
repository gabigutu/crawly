		<shortDescription>If you respect Spielberg as a filmmaker, please don't watch The BFG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The BFG in theaters for my friend's birthday. Why she picked this movie, I will never understand. As I was leaving the house my brother yelled "You know they're calling that movie the worst film ever directed by Spielberg, right?" Oh, how I should have listened. I was sitting in between two of my other friends (not the birthday girl). Thank goodness, because I think I might've ruined her birthday with my constant "What are they doing?" and "Are they serious with this dialogue right now?" At one point I actually fell asleep. When I fell asleep, they were frolicking around the magic dream tree. When I woke up, they were outside the window of the Queen of England. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. And miraculously enough, I was still completely caught up plot-wise, despite falling asleep. THAT is how stupid this movie was.The small child, whose name we don't learn until the very end, was every stereotypical child-wonder ever. I'm pretty sure the filmmakers decided to take Matilda, take away her superpowers, and stick her into Giantville. The BFG himself is quite frightening, really. His habit of screwing up every word out of his mouth comes across as annoying rather than endearing. And why in the world did he take the child in the first place? It's so confusing. And his little dream-lab is frightening, to say the least.The "message" of the film is actually pretty screwed up. When the BFG decides to put the child back in her orphanage for her own good (the smartest decision he'll make in the film, btw), she throws herself out the window, believing that the BFG will catch her. That works out great for her, but what about the small impressionable children watching the film? And at the very end, it is revealed that the BFG can actually hear the whispers of children everywhere. I left the theater disturbed rather than happy at that revelation.The CGI is laughable. When I saw the trailer, I was convinced for a few moments that it was an animated film. My friend came into the theater convinced that it was an animated film. It actually might have been less weird as an animated film. Because in this disturbing mix of an actual child and a CGI giant world, it was creepy as hell.If you respect Steven Spielberg as a filmmaker and a human being, do not watch the BFG. I had nightmares for a week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big BORING giant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this should be one of spielberg's worst efforts ever.the most boring movie i saw in a long ime.no plot....not good actors.....not an explanation to whatever was happening.a giant took the little girl with no explanation just like that.the scenario was poor.....performances mediocre....the cgi so and so and the movie was poor overall and one of the worst from spielberg who lost his touch in this effort.Not recommended . avoid it. there are better movies from this genre out there.the only thing worth it are a few scenes in which the giant meets the queen and there's a laugh there but nothing much.spielberg failed big in this effort.better luck next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big, Friendly, but Not Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On paper you could argue that 'The BFG' screams "blockbuster summer movie" - a combination of Disney, Steven Spielberg and beloved children's author Roald Dahl with one of the best children's books ever. But the reality is a disappointing mess of dull special effects with mismatching awe-inspiring music.The flaw in turning Roald Dahl books into family films, is that words on a page don't have movie-style ratings. In the BFG the main plot of the film is the existence of child- eating giants, which naturally due to the rating and audience of the film we only see materialized in a giant sniffing Sophie and going 'yum'. I wasn't expecting graphic images of children being mauled, but with no darkness whatsoever the other giants became comical stereotypes who define the disclaimer on the back of the DVD of 'mild threat', despite their main role in the story being outrageous murderous beasts that require military intervention. So immediately from the word go, the main drive for the film is fundamentally flawed: the giants aren't scary, it just looked like the dwarfs from the Hobbit trilogy got lost.If you've read the book you'll know the main story: (a) Girl taken to giant-land by the BFG. (b) Girl learns about other children-eating giants, and that the BFG just goes around giving children nice dreams. (c) They go to the queen and use the army to round up the giants and put them in a hole. Yet it's almost laughable that we spend the majority of the film in (b), sat around laughing at the BFG's speech impediment (ha, disability?) and despite taking a lot of the dialogue directly from the book, failing to transfer the magic. There's no conversation about how different children from different countries taste (hilarious - go read the book), or even explanation about the Snozzcumber (amusing - go read the book). The outcome is a movie that feels both slow at times, and rushed at others. And you get epic music climaxing as the young girl looks around in awe, but you're left wondering how she knows what's going on because as an audience we certainly don't.Admittedly the quality of the visuals in terms of realism of the CGI and use of motion- capture was top notch. However in the modern world of cinema this is far from impressive; it's been normalized so much over the past few years of filmmaking that I'd argue that CGI is only significant if done badly.It is possible to make a film about a classic story using groundbreaking special effects while retaining the heart and drive of a classic family movie (see Disney's 2016 'The Jungle Book'). And go back in time and release 'The BFG' ten, or twenty years ago and the effects may be distracting enough to make up for the shoddy storytelling. But if you're looking to go to the cinema today I'd recommend every other film currently showing over the BFG, and there lies the problem. The film isn't the worst thing to ever grace our screens - but put simply there are so many better films out there, if you find yourself watching this one I'd recommend you reassess your life (I know I certainly am). Let this stand as a warning to films made from classic books, or films made from re-making earlier classic films: at the end of the day if it isn't as good as it's inspiration, you'd be better off reading the book or watching the original. And in the case of the Big Friendly Giant, I would recommend you doing just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Giant disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is one of the worlds most talented directors, and has always entertained and brought something special to his films. They have their own style, and there is always that 'Spielberg feel' to them.He invented the summer blockbuster with Jaws, reinvented it with Raiders Of The Ark, reinvented it again with Jurassic Park, and had some major summer hits with Tom Cruise in the noughites.So to hear that he was adapting one of the most beloved books of all time to the big screen, with one of the most reputable film studios in the world, was a dream come true.Sophie is in for a surprise when she meets the Big Friendly Giant. Scared at first, the young girl soon realises that the 24-foot colossus is actually gentle and charming.As their friendship grows, Sophie's presence attracts the unwanted attention of Bloodbottler, Fleshlumpeater and other giants.After travelling to London, Sophie and the BFG must convince Queen Elizabeth to help them get rid of all the bad giants once and for all.But the reality is an absolute nightmare.Although the film is pretty faithful to the book, and the initial sighting Sophie has of the titular character is breathtaking, it all goes downhill once Sophie enters the land of the giants.Gone is all that magic and love that Spielberg once had, the film is nothing more than an expensive special effects bonanza featuring a plethora of dead eyed giants, and one that resembles Mark Rylance.Whereas films like E.T, and even A.I had a wonderfully parental chemistry between the subject matter and their cinematic partners that gave the film that Spielberg sheen, this has nothing of the sort, and the relationship between Sophie and The B.F.G is virtually non existent.Even Temple Of Doom had a convincing paternal element in the relationship between Indy and Shortround.When we are in the land of the giants, I'm sure I could have gone into the projection booth, spliced a few scenes from warcraft into it, and no one would have been none the wiser.There's no urgency to the film, the effects, while impressive, just take up the majority of the second act, and most importantly, Spielberg just doesn't seem to have added any of his love, magic, or soul to this project.It's as almost if he thought it would be a licence to print money.A real disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time if you're under 10 years old.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was willing to give this movie a chance. It's Steven Spielburg, what could possibly go wrong, right?Well, to be fair, this isn't the WORST movie ever made, but it's one of those waste-of- time movies that just doesn't instill any kind of coherent emotional reaction. I felt nothing during this movie. There was nothing for me to enjoy.The visuals were really phony. I know that a movie like this needs CGI if they wanted it to be live action, but the blending of the two was just AWFUL. Every time Sophie and the BFG were in a scene together I could tell she was sitting in front of a green screen. Most of the film was also whimsy for the sake of whimsy, with the pretty visuals of the sparkly dreams drifting around the fairytale forest landscape serving no function other than to wave pretty colors in the faces of children to keep them entertained. The story meandered. Then they introduced a conflict, which could have added a ticking clock element to the plot. And once I thought it was going somewhere, the plot stopped completely to make for hilarious antics of the BFG in Buckingham Palace. "Isn't it hilarious that he's giant and everything else is tiny?" the movie asks. "No," I say. It's not really. Maybe a kid would find it funny, but since I'm not a kid I can't say for sure."Isn't it funny that he says weird words in the presence of the Queen of England?" the movie asks. "No," I say again. It's really not. All the humor in this movie falls flat on its face. It's the kind of weirdly delivered humor that I remember movies like The Polar Express have, where there are "wacky" characters who do and say things that are not inherently funny, but based on the other characters reactions, the movie tells us that we were supposed to laugh at it. What was the point of the magical fart juice? Other than being true to the book, that is. Seriously, it was the most pointless joke in the movie. The delivery was bad, the timing of it was bad, and the execution of it was bad. The moment the BFG reached for that bottle of fart juice the second time (an hour after the movie introduced it and forgot about it), I had to walk out. That was it for me.I really don't know what else to say other than The BFG was a meandering, pointless waste of time. Nothing was funny, there was almost no tension, the plot goes nowhere, and I left without feeling anything for any of the characters. Maybe a kid of 10 or under would enjoy it, but as an adult in their twenties, I certainly didn't. I walked out of it, so I don't even know if it got better in the last half hour or so.Skip it. Unless you're young and easily entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As good as The BFG looks it is a huge disappointment for me. I like Roald Dahl's stories (I used to read them to my classes and the children loved them), but I never got around to The BFG. The movie is well set and beautifully filmed as one would expect from Spielberg but I don't think the story is strong enough for a big movie the like of which this is supposed to be. It has had some good reviews, mainly praising Mark Rylance's portrayal of the giant but I am afraid I do not rate him as an actor at all. I have only seen him on the small screen and really could not accept him as a good performer. Many people are raving about his stage work so maybe that is where it is at. To be fair I have only watched about 30 minutes of the film so far but it has failed to grab me at all. In fact I am about to switch it off through boredom. Spielberg's work has always impressed me previously with the emotion,story telling and the visuals but this has missed the mark big time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bore of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say this - if I had children, I think it would have been a good trip. However, this was one of the more boring films this year and unfortunately ended up being an expensive nap.First of all, Ruby Barnhill. I think this will be her one film and that's it. A very annoying actress who just comes off as a brat. Her voice began to grate about 5 minutes in. A young Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) would have been perfect. The film was long for a 2 hour film and it drrraaaaggggeedddd. The scenes with the Queen were very forgettable. The scenes between the BFG and Sophie became a bore as it went on. The giant scenes were the more enjoyable just because they had a bit of humour.But overall this is an instant DVD film. I'm not surprised this hasn't done well at the box office and I don't think Spielberg has he Midas touch anymore in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adult rating - Meh. 7yo's rating "Is it finished yet?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFG is a funny book. The David Jason 1989 animated film is funny, this really isn't. The film was too long for young children, who the story is aimed at. It kept me entertained because I knew the story well but I was disappointed. I hated Shopie's (Ruby Barnwell's) weird wooden acting, there was no connection between her and any other character - especially as most of it is green screen, on her own, and she's just not good at it. The best performance was Jemaine Clement as Fleshlumpeater. I didn't even know this was a Spielberg film until the credits and I thought "This film should have been better." Spielberg really let himself down with this. I went to see this with my 7 year old niece, who is a mature 7; an hour into the film she was asking when it finished. If you want to watch the BFG, watch the 1989 animated one.</fullReview>

So I was really curious to saw this movie.I didn't saw the trailer, but even without knowing much about this film, I expected more from it.This was just a waste of my money and time.I didn't like how the story developed, there was no explanation for anything, things just happened and it didn't made sense. The actors didn't acted well and there were no heart-touching or funny moments, just one big boring story that made no sense to me. Also, the character Sophie is annoying and really unlikable. I've never read the book, but I can only hope it's better than this film.. it was awful,for real. I just didn't like the story to begin with. I didn't liked how it started, developed or ended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the BFG when I was a kid. Loved it.I watched the BFG when I was an adult. Didn't love it.Difference?I found that the whole movie lacked charm. It was 2 hours of "this happened, then that happened. Now look at this special effect sequence. Now we're going to have people talk to each other", with no real establishment if of why I should care about anything going on or the characters themselves. As I said, the movie lacked engagement and charmSure, it was a Spielberg movie so the movie was not *technically* bad. The man knows how to put together a movie. However, this was not an engaging one. Some of the pacing was totally off in this film. Some jokes and sequences lasted WAY too long, where other important elements were pushed through too fast.At the end of the day, one might say "well it's for kids". To that, I say that the kids who were in the theatre seemed less than thrilled as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Giant" disappointment from Spielberg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg doesn't make "bad" films; even his oft ridiculed 1941 isn't actually "that bad" and lets just forget about The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but the Great Beared One's The BFG is certainly below middle of the road leaning towards downright average Spielbergian fare, which is a great big shame when you consider the seemingly perfectly suited combination of the famed director and author extraordinaire Roald Dahl.A beloved novel (and one I certainly enjoyed as a child) and an enjoyable animated feature, The BFG is an appealing tale that features wonder, intrigue and more than its fair share of potty humour (which makes up one of the films major set ups) and we all know Spielberg can handle himself when it comes to family entertainment but there's something strikingly off about The BFG, that whilst hard to pinpoint to an exact element, is enough to hamper the film for its entirety of its runtime even though there are glimpses of a much better film frequently appearing throughout.The film looks and sounds delightful, as you'd expect with the finely crafted CGI, the score from John Williams and the lens work from frequent Spielberg DOP Janusz Kaminski and after unearthing the underused and largely unknown Mark Rylance (now an Oscar winner) in Bridge of Spies last year, Spielberg and the British theatre staple produce an impressive BFG incarnation with Rylance's animated facial expressions and colourful portrayal of the runt of the giant litter a stand out in a film that finds trouble making us care for the characters that inhabit it and the narrative that drives it.Newcomer Ruby Barnhill gets the tricky job of making human lead Sophie work and while the young performer clearly has the attitude to become Sophie, it's not a memorable turn by any stretch of the imagination and Sophie often comes across as annoying rather than endearing and her friendship with the BFG doesn't ever get the warm and fuzzies going.The other (forgive me please) giant problem with The BFG is the actual source material and E.T screenwriter Melissa Mathison's adaptation of it. The film never really feels like it has anything on the line, never actually seems to be going anywhere fast and with a downright lacking finale the whole show feels like a non-event. It's strange for a Spielberg film to feel so as even his average films are still good fun whereas The BFG finds the esteemed filmmaker struggling to wring emotion, fun or excitement (even dream catching seems boring) out of a tale that on the basis of this effort seems far better suited to text rather than screen.A hugely disappointing experience and one that will likely get lost in the abundance of high and low class family films getting produced on a mass level in today's climate, The BFG marks what could be a career low point for Spielberg and one of 2016's biggest missed opportunities and even for the biggest Spielberg fans out there, this is a film you can safely miss seeing on the big screen and perhaps altogether. Not something you'd often say regarding the newest Spielberg blockbuster.2 bubbly beverages out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Roald Dahl fan. When I came to know that BFG was being made into a movie, that too by Steven Spielberg, I was waiting for its release with the eagerness of a 10-year-old. I really enjoyed reading the book. I do not venture out to cinema halls to watch movies these days. It is almost 4 years. But for BFG, I made an exception. I was looking forward to all the funny, crazy things from the book, imagining watching them on the screen when I entered the hall.And the movie was a big disappointment. Technically, the movie may be brilliant but it did not do justice to the book. If only they had stuck to the original story. The opening scene itself killed the spirit of the book and was a huge disappointment. The giant country is supposed to be very hot, sandy and without anything growing around. The giants sleep during the day and go hunting during nights. Those scenes should have been in brighter light. The 'frolicking' indulged in the giants with the car was totally out of story line.Even catching of dreams was dragged for too long and unnecessarily made serious. Only one dream that the child was shown having was no good. There could have been more beautiful and colorful dreams as shown in the book. The nightmare that BFG blows into Fleshlumpeater was completely dropped. It could have been a hilarious scene.Sophie was hiding in his pocket when BFG was hurled around by other giants which would have had more impact.Even BFG's cave is supposed to be simple with a table and walls with shelves full of jars, with the friendly giant not bothering to cook. That simplicity was the beauty of BFG. The last scene of catching the giants and dropping them in a pit specially dug for them could have been a little more elaborate. It looked as if it was wrapped up in a hurry. The only saving grace was whizzpoppers and palace scenes.On the whole it was a big low down. May be it is sacrilegious to be critical about a Steven Spielberg film, so all reviews were good. I am still an admirer of SS films and hope and wish that his coming ventures do not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), an orphan girl, encounters the Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) one night in London. He takes her to his home in Giant Land and, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kind-hearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children.Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers there is no doubt about that. Ever since "The Terminal" though I have found it hard to fully enjoy a picture of his, "Bridge of Spies" being definitely the best one, yet still leaving me slightly cold. Here however, I was presented with an absolute disaster of a film, which proved to be so hurtful knowing from where it was coming from, there was no heads nor tails to be made out of the mess I experienced.I mean the only merits I can really attribute the film is that its not nasty or mean in any way, its heart is in a good place even if that is not really a saving element when there is no morality to your story. Visiually the film is remarkable too, the combination of practical and CGI is really seamless, much more so than Spielberg's past efforts. Moreover, as always we get a distinct visual world and there are many shots in the film that are as complicated and brilliant as they are technically advanced. Yet, even that, in the eyes of this mess of a story, proved to be quite a useless feature.Were to start to point out what isn't working in a film where story-wise nothing is working? I mean right from the opening sequence of the film I had no idea what was going on. The while first act was cut into the first 90 seconds. We aren't shown who Sophie is, we don't get to know her and we are already experiencing her adventure, but there is absolutely no conflict whatsoever. The BFG moreover proves to be the most adorable giant ever right from the moment we see him, once again proving there is absolutely no conflict.We are then presented to an extravaganza of story disaster when about three different plots are weaved together into a senseless mess. First we're into this whole dream story-line, then we are fighting giants and then finally we go where? To the Queen? I could not believe my eyes. But that's not even the worst part. We are served a full quarter of an hour sequence were Sophie and the BFG are served breakfast. I am not joking. We spend a full quarter of hour in this totally ridiculous scene with zero character beats. I was almost starting to get offended.There is no correlation to what is going on on-screen. It is just random events happening one after the other, which are supposed to feel sweat and fairy-tale-like solely because we have John Williams playful score playing in the background. I mean there is no moral, no thematic undertaking the film does, no character goes on a journey of change especially because we aren't shown these people in a situation that's different from where the conflict is supposed to be. What we end up with is visual noise that can be as pretty and advanced as you want, but when we are in the hands of a headache-inducing mess of story I just checked out."The BFG" is right up there with one of Spielberg's worst films for me and unfortunately, one of the worst of the year. I strongly recommend to stay away from this pretentious and honestly offensive family film which was void of any kind of substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story justifying child abduction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We watched BFG last night and my mind is still trying to grasp the twisted messages of this movie. If you haven't seen it the basic premise is this. (Spolier) An old guy abducts children. His justification is so they "don't tell his secret". Each child after their abduction ends up getting murdered. He tells the little girl of only one other abducted boy, but remains quiet on the apparent dozens of others as he presents her with the assorted clothing of both boys and girls. Which one can only assume are souvenirs of each dead child, a characteristic pattern of any serial killer. But we are led to believe by a child suffering from Stockholm Syndrome that he is a Big Friendly Giant. Then there is end of the movie. The British Military captures the bad Giants and takes them to an island where they can't hurt anyone. Sounds like a pleasant ending except when you realize this island is actually Guantanamo bay. Before the attack (which takes place on an unknown foreign country) the queen calls the US president. No contents of the discussion are disclosed and since the US took no part in the attack the logical conclusion is that it was to secure a location for the prisoners since they obviously weren't returned to the UK. This movie is probably the most twisted "kids" movie since the drug scene in the good dinosaur.</fullReview>

I require something more something either amusing or well written, and yes there is plenty of movies that are inaptly written but manage to make up for that by being entertaining.

		<shortDescription>Needs some serious editing to make it shorter but the third act is worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young girl called Sophie is taken away from her orphanage by The "Big Friendly Giant" the only giant of his kind who fears the presence of all the other giants who happen to eat children.Steven Spielberg teams up with Mark Ryalnce to bring Roald Dahl's classic story to the big screen. Is this adaptation able to capture the magic and mystery of Dahl's imagination? Sort of. The biggest problem that this film has is that ,like many others this year, it's too long and quite a few of the scenes throughout it seem to drag and make the film seem a bit longer and some members of the audience seem to loose patience. If some scenes were cut a bit more then the film would not only be obviously shorter but it would also possibly drag less throughout some scenes. Mark Rylance delivers lines that no other actor should be able to say with a straight face and therefore provides a couple of chuckles for the audience but this seems to be the only source of comedy in the film as it't not really a gag heavy film until the third act. On the topic of the third act it is one of the best points of the film and is one of the things that makes the film what it is and does capture the essence of Dahl's original words and in some shots Quentin Blake's illustrations can be clearly seen translated onto the screen which does show how Spielberg and screenwriter Melissa Mathison did want to capture the magic and mystery of The BFG. The visual effects do add to the feeling of the film and do also have a very Spirlberg'ian feeling to them especially during one slightly lengthy scene involving dream catching. But unfortunately the visuals and the acting don't distract from long scenes. When put all together it just seems like it's a couple of steps away from being a panto.Yes the visuals and the acting are good and largely go towards making the film largely what it is but many scenes in The BFG are a bit too long and distract because of this. However just wait for the third act which is one of the best things about the film.*** &lt;-- Three Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Spielberg's finest moment but not the worst movie in existence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me say I loved the BFG as a child, it was (and still is) one of my favorite children's books. That being said I entered the cinema hopeful.Overall: This is not Spielberg's finest moment and this review may get rated down but I just think this movie is not worth your time.Good: The visuals and motion capture are magical and sensational. This movie really demonstrated Spielberg's gift to inspire awe and wonder in his audience but that doesn't save the movie sadly.Bad: Personally, not one single joke made me laugh or even crack a smile. That might be me just watching plenty of great comedies recently or just having high hopes from the book but who knows. I imagine it would be good for youngsters as I could see some laughing around me, however I soulfully believe the best family movies bring something to the table everyone can enjoy thoroughly but this just seems to cater for children. Secondly, the movie grinds to a rusty halt during act two and failed to capture my attention besides some pretty colours and flashy lights. It picks up in Act Three but by then I was just bored. Thirdly, this may be controversial but I feel like they could have toned down Sophies smart alek attitude which was in the books. That is a minor gripe but still though it could have been done better. Sophies acting was well above average was a child but I still didn't feel invested with her character despite loving the book. There are multiple more I could list but this would probably be too long and it's dragging already.Best Part: The first viewing of the dream tree was stunning and truly expresses Spielberg's gift.4/10 Sorry Steve</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There had already been a TV made animated movie with the voice of Sir David Jason, based on the children's book by the great Roald Dahl, the trailer for this live action adaptation certainly looked like it could be good, from director Steven Spielberg, returning to his family movie roots, like E.T., Hook and Jurassic Park. Basically orphaned ten-year-old girl Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) lives in a London orphanage, she suffers insomnia, one night she sees a giant lurking the dark streets outside, the giant captures her and takes her to Giant Country. The giant (Mark Rylance) explains that he is not like other giants, he does not eat human beings, he is the "Big Friendly Giant", or "BFG" as Sophie comes to call him, he only eats disgusting Snozzcumber, and drinks fizzy Frobscottle, which causes the drinker flatulation, or "whizzpopping" as the BFG says. The BFG explains that Sophie must stay with him the rest of her life, so she cannot tell anyone about the existence of giants, he mentions that his job is to give people dreams, she does not believe him, he manages to help her sleep with a story, and deliberately gives her a nightmare, about failing to escape Giant Country and being eaten by another giant. Sophie wakes up and is forced to hide, the fearsome leader the Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) enters the BFG's home and smells a human, the BFG encourages him to eat the Snozzcumber, which Sophie is hiding inside, but remembering he does not like eating vegetables, or drinking water, he leaves. Sophie's clothes are ruined by the juices of the Snozzcumber, the BFG provides her with new clothes, he has a strange reaction to a red jacket she finds to wear, the BFG plans to leave Sophie in a tree house while he goes out to capture dreams, but she convinces him to take her to Dream Country. On the way the man-eating giants are woken up, they throw the BFG around and humiliate him, the giants stop when a thunderstorm starts, giants hate getting wet, Sophie comes out from her hiding place tells the BFG that he should not allow the other giants to bully him, meanwhile the Fleshlumpeater and the Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) find Sophie's blanket, they realise there is human in Giant Country. The BFG and Sophie arrive in Dream Country and catch dreams together, including a good dream about Sophie and a nightmare, or a "Trogglehumper", the two then head to London for the BFG to use his trumpet and blow dreams into the bedrooms of sleeping children. Sophie realises she has lost her blanket, and the BFG knows that the man-eating giants know about her, being put to sleep Sophie wakes up outside the orphanage, the BFG explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by the other giants, but she convinces her to take her back to Giant Country with him. When they return to the BFG's home, the other giants, including Maidmasher (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson), Manhugger (Adam Godley), Butcher Boy (Michael David Adamthwaite), Bonecruncher (Daniel Bacon), Childchewer (Jonathan Holmes), Gizzardgulper (Chris Gibbs) and Meatdripper (Paul Moniz de Sa) trash the place searching for Sophie, destroying much of the BFG's hard work, Sophie evades them, while the BFG finally stands up to them and drives them away with a hot fire iron. While hiding, Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG, a young boy, among his belongings is a picture of Queen Victoria, she comes up with an idea to create a nightmare for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (Penelope Wilton), about giants eating children, the army fighting them, and Sophie meeting her. Waking from her nightmare, the Queen meets Sophie and the BFG, they tell her and her servants Mary (Rebecca Hall) and Mr. Tibbs (Rafe Spall) the child- eating giants from her dream are real and must be stopped, after enjoying a large breakfast the Queen arranges for soldiers to follow the BFG to Giant Country. The BFG plans to give all the man-eating giants a nightmare that cause them guilt about eating children, all but the Fleshlumpeater are consumed by the bad dream, he tries to attack Sophie, but the army helicopter stops him and captures him, the giants are all taken to an isolated uncharted island, and much to their fury they will only be eating Snozzcumbers from now on. In the end, Sophie begins a new life in Buckingham Palace, Mary has adopted her, while the BFG has returned to Giant Country, and inspired by his time in England has started growing a wide variety of vegetables, he continues delivering dreams, and whenever Sophie feels lonely, which is less often than before, she knows that she can talk to the BFG, and he will hear her. Rylance with his twinkly- eyed kind nature and speaking his "gobblefunk" language is a very likable character, I agree newcomer Barnhill is perhaps a little dull as the young girl, and Wilton is a good choice to be the Queen, probably the best thing about this adaptation is the special effects, to make Rylance a big-eared vegetarian giant is all the magical colourful places and creatures is brilliant. This was the second time that of Dahl's books had been made again, following from Willy Wonka (1971) and Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), I would argue that the cartoon version is the one I prefer, as this feels emotionally remote and slow in places, even predictable, but you get the right amount of humour, including corgis farting, and children will certainly be entertained, it's an average but fun enough fantasy adventure. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version is nothing compared to the older animated version. That said I think children watching it may well find it as enchanting as we adults found the animated one when we saw it.It misses a few beats and is much the same as the original, the girl's acting or at least the way her lines are cut in aren't that fluid. Easily overlooked I suppose...All the 3D rendered graphics look nice and pretty and it's not overly scary by its new form. SPOILER the farting in the palace scene was way underplayed and could have been the making of the film had it been allowed to ride out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very sweet and beautiful. However, I didn't really enjoy it. I believe that children would enjoy this. But, teens and adults would most probably not enjoy it. I wasn't that entertained until Sophie and the BFG went to Buckingham Palace.I will admit, it was quite funny when everyone farted. My family (Including my mother) was in stitches laughing. The rest of the movie wasn't that funny though. It was better than I expected it to be though. But honestly, It's overrated. I almost fell asleep half way through. Even my 7 year old brother didn't enjoy it. I couldn't understand half the tings the BFG said. No, erase that. I didn't understand ANYTHING he said. I don't know HOW Sophie or the queen (Or anyone!) understood him. Overall, it was kind of good. I wouldn't say it was amazing though.Then again, I think only smaller children would like this movie. I'd give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; - expected more from these filmmakers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time - he has made great films of all genres for all audiences, including family films like ET, AI and Hook. Surely there's no one better to bring Roald Dahl's classic book to the screen.The problems though are pretty evident from the beginning. In this age it seems incomprehensible to say the main issue is with the CGI, but from the first moment we see Rylance's giant, something is off. The way he bounds around the city and countryside feels so fake, awkward and weightless. His facial movements don't match his speech, and these problems are amplified in the larger giants, - even more worrying when you consider the fact that the motion capture used on King Kong over a decade ago is far, far superior. It's a real shame because I think Rylance has the perfect face and voice for the role.Spielberg is usually terrific at directing child actors too. 12 year old Ruby Barnhill is pretty good as Sophie, she has a certain amount of charm and likability, but she struggles to deliver any real weight or emotion, despite her fairly emotional backstory. Wilton and Hall are decent in their roles, but Spall's accent is bizarrely distracting (he sounds American, then Irish, then Scottish, and I'm not sure in hindsight which it was supposed to be?!), but their segment in the movie seems to last forever!Of course the story and script is well written/adapted, though the pacing is way off - it should have been closer to 90 minutes than two hours. There are some wonderfully inventive visual gags too (mini-umbrella, etc), but mostly the animation is unconvincing and underwhelming. I personally think rather than motion capture and digital cameras, they'd have been better using forced perspective, doubles and celluloid to make it feel more old-fashioned. It's quite a fun movie, but I just expect *a lot* more from Spielberg.3/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg in his lower quartile.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a big fan of Spielberg I was rather disappointed by "The BFG". In the SFR (Spielberg Film Ranking) it is more at the "1941" and "Crystal Skull" end than at the "ET" and "JAWS" end. This is a film squarely aimed at the kids market (and there's nothing wrong with that) but even for kids films there is no excuse for poor execution.The BFG, as virtually every parent is aware, tells the story of little 'insomniacal' orphan Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill) - espying and being carried off by the titular Big Friendly Giant (a CGI'd Mark Rylance) in the middle of the night. The BFG's job is to catch dreams and blow them into the heads of sleeping people. He's friendly but his bullying colleagues in the Land of the Giants are not, liking very much the taste of 'human beans'. The rebellious Sophie determines to jolt the BFG out of his servile state to take on his repressors; something that will require the help of people in high places.On the positive side, the look of the film is glorious from the opening 'Mary Poppinised' views of London to the BFGs home and the 'land of dreams'. Spielberg regulars Janusz Kaminsky drives the beautiful cinematography and Michael Kahn the crisp editing. Also worthy of note is the Production Design and set decoration on which the credibility of a film like this relies.Mark Rylance also injects great charisma into his facial expressions which, at the moments where the film turns (overly in my view) soppy and sentimental, do move you. And there are some (OK, about two) really laugh out loud moments with flatulent Corgis being a high-point.However there seems to be minimal chemistry developed between Sophie and the BFG, and it constantly feels that they are filming this in different places (which they very possibly were). While I hate to be critical of a young person, this seems to be down to the performance of Barnhill. Spielberg is normally the master of pulling out epic performances from his kid actors (think of Cary Guffrey in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" or Drew Barrymore in "ET") yet - whilst young Ruby is perfectly sweet and pleasant - there doesn't seem to be that depth or range in the actress to make you believe she is particularly scared at the beginning (wouldn't you need a blanket wash?) or having the gumption to drive the giant to such actions.I feel even worse about my next criticism - screenwriter Melissa Mathison ("ET") - since this was her last screenplay before dying in November last year at the early age of 65 (and the film is dedicated to her). "Dreams is so quick on the outside but long on the inside" says the BFG, and at times some of the dialogue feels far too 'long on the inside'. A problem here is that Roald Dahl's story is rather slight, but the screenplay seriously struggles in padding it out to the 2 hour running time. Given the attention span of youngsters, Spielberg would have done well to make this a 90 minute movie. While the film very occasionally kicks into gear, significant chunks are, unfortunately, just plain dull.The script also seems to lack an anchor for its time and place. The Queen (the excellent Penelope Wilton) is familiar as our monarch, but a comedic reference to "Prime Minister Boris" is immediately punctured by a confusing US reference to Nancy and Ronald! Why not Barack and Michelle? Bizarre! The soundtrack is by the great John Willams, but this is not one of his best. I remember an interview with the Maestro where Alfred Hitchcock advised the young composer on the set of "Family Plot" to stop the music at one point to signify the emptiness of a room. There are times in this film where you wish he still held to that advice, since at times the music is jarringly obtrusive and irritating, mimicking in percussion every little dream that zips across the screen.For balance, in this summer of repeated terrorist horror and distress, this is a dose of escapism that should be welcomed. (It would be nice to think that all these troubles could be solved by helicoptering all the bad guys in the world to a remote island with nothing to eat but snozzcumbers!) And I'm sure that many a 6 or 7 year old will simply delight in the film. But I can't help thinking it should have been much better, and perhaps might have been better enlivened as a musical, with Tim Minchin lyrics to add a bit of parental zip.As a final serious note to parents, there is a point at which Sophie jumps out of a high window expecting the BFG to catch her: in the same way that the old "Batman" TV series had an Adam West/Burt Ward led pre-clip telling kids not to copy their antics, I would suggest that any susceptible young children need a stern talking to that all of this is "just pretend".(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man to see the graphical version of this review.

The BFG himself was a good representation from the book but the girl couldn't act very well. The scene at the palace was forced humour. Started off well but got worse as the movie went on. I enjoyed the dream catching parts as this was the most emotional and happy the movie got. The Frobscottle drink was just typical, cliché, kids forced humour that was just boring. The movie was too fast in parts and too slow in others and had many unnecessary scenes that didn't add anything to the story. Again incredible graphics and voice work, just badly done...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, at best, alright. If you're looking for a good movie to take your kids to, this will do, but there isn't really anything to hold onto for older audience members. I thought the little girl's performance was really awkward and unnatural at parts, a lot of the dialogue/sequence of events seemed pretty forced, and while the motion capture was really well done, any time the girl and the BFG were in the same shot the blue screen was painfully obvious. Not to mention that the last third of the movie is pretty boring (it was really testing my patience). Spielberg is a great director in his own right, so he does an overall good job with an incredibly lackluster script, but even so, there isn't much of anything here that you could call noteworthy in any way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have it on good account and from Adults and even some children that the famed Roald Dalh book from which this film derives is a cracker and one of Dalh's very very best. Yet why is this Steven Spielberg film so lifeless, it looks great, and the giant has real charm but the whole film feels very very flat indeed, i do not think i managed a laugh through the whole picture, even worse i was constantly looking at my watch as time dragged. When Spielberg was really good, seem's like a long time ago now, he seemed a brilliant film maker but along the way, he has lost his vital spark i fear, this film reminded me of "Indiana Jones And The Crystal Skull" in that what once gleamed now seemed old tired and worn out. The BFG, is not a bad film, Spielberg is far to gifted to every make a really bad film but this film is simply bland and so forgettable and such a wasted opportunity. The popularity of Dalh, will give the movie a long shelf after life on wet afternoon's i am sure but this is a classic case of a film that adult's think children will like, but the edge that cheeky slightly wicked edge, that children love is in a land far far away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Introducing a Generation to the Modern-Day Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time, a seven-year-old boy dedicated his free time to one thing and one thing only: fairy tales. He would make his family reenact his favorite stories, take his father to see low-budget musical productions of these stories, and even illustrate his own versions of Jack and the Beanstalk, The Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel, and so on and so forth. Coupled with the Disney classics, he simply could not get enough of these highly interpretive whimsical tales. Then came the third grade, when he read a little book called The BFG. As he read it, he had difficulty putting it down because of the wonderfully dim- witted yet big heart of the title character. Even to this day he still remembers how heavily it resonated with his love for fantasy.Yes, I was that boy from the story. While this book has stayed in the back of my head for years, I never lost my love of fairy tales, particularly in what Disney can do with them. Then Steven Spielberg announced his upcoming project focused on the classic: very dumbfounding considering how he has long ago retired the captivating child fantasies for much more mature political studies. My admiration of Spielberg's heart for filmmaking did not affect my concern on how it would result; at the same time, I knew The BFG needed to scare us and make us smile at the same time, reminding us of the good in the world.The Big Friendly Giant himself, portrayed through CGI magic by Mark Rylance, makes any true kid at heart fall in love with him. What he does is simple: he snatches children in the night at the witching hour, and takes them away into Giant Country. It's the only company he could ever find, as the other, much larger giants see him as an insult to giant peoples. During the day, he catches dreams found in a magical tree, sorts them into jars, and blows them into children's heads at night. Much like the sandman or the tooth fairy or old Saint Nick, here is yet another entity for children's nighttime fantasies. This elephant-eared giant may look evil at first as he hides his way through London's streets, but after hearing his kindly, sluggish speech, you instantly feel a personal connection with him. It's just a shame that the film is anchored by an unbelievable relationship between the BFG and little Sophie.Ruby Barnhill plays the orphan who stays up during the witching hour with the cat, and I could easily imagine any other actress in her shoes and playing the part possibly better. She isn't introduced with much detail, as she is carried away by the BFG too soon for a desire of following her journey to be initiated. It wasn't scary like it intended to feel, and nobody explained why the BFG chose her in particular to bring home. Maybe it explained in the book but I can't remember.Even without the girl-giant bond, the environment creation makes up for the entertainment. Composer John Williams does it again with his spellbinding sounds of sweet dreams, and production designer Rick Carter (Lincoln, Jurassic Park) recreates the large color of dreams with an upside-down tree shrouded with all the glowing sprites of dreams. Together, they create a spectacular light-show of northern lights, dripping leaves, and sprite chasing like we've all felt at some point way back when. If only the creative geniuses went back to old-school special effects without all the obtrusive CGI, then these moments would have felt all the more nostalgic for the generations beyond the millennials.If you ask me, the feature's third act officially lost me in its imagination and realism. Basically, Sophie sets a plan with the BFG to get rid of the other giants by sending a nightmare into the head of the queen. So they together successfully make it past the guards and get the nightmare into the queen's head, following with a scene so atrocious in direction that I am ashamed to place it along with the rest of the movie. Penelope Wilton, the actress portraying the queen of England, put no effort at all into her part, and the entire direction of the scene felt purely uncomfortable and out of place. At least it follows with an amusing if overlong sequence where the queen gladly welcomes the BFG by treating him to a huge breakfast, with a pitchfork and sword substituting for a fork and knife. Thinking back to Spielberg's history of portraying the political system on screen, I expect him to have done more with this historically relevant scenario to make things flow better. Alas, we just can't have the best of both.It disheartens me a bit to say that not enough was done with this whimsical fairy tale. The "so what" factor falls short compared to simple tales such as Goldilocks and the Three Bears or Pinocchio. But judging by the first two-thirds, the childhood escapism successfully triumphs. It teaches little ones the reward of being a good giant besides a greedy giant, and reminds older readers of these stories' timelessness over hundreds of years. Even today, we still can put ourselves in Little Red's place as she falls deceptive to the wolf's lies. We still see rags-to-riches stories similar to Cinderella's. I would love to see us all to start reading these old tales more frequently, including discussion on how a particularly story spoke to us individually. If we learn not to be afraid of the observant wandering child within us all, then we too can become little friendly people who can live happily ever after.Overall Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A passable try but Roald Dahls books , like them or not (I was never a great fan although they have much more literary merit than say Harry Potter) had a dark skein woven into their fabric. Steven Spielberg has a tendency to lace everything with quantities of schmaltz which sometimes he gets away with and sometimes not. Here I am afraid it is NOT. There is far to much emphasis on the BFGs relationship with the young girl and not enough phantasmagoria the other giants are just not terrifying enough.Despite the excellence of Mark Rylance in the lead role this is something that just does not quite get there, a splash of Spielberg with a dash of Tim Burton and who knows this could have been a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should've never attempted it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start with the obvious. The BFG is a major disappointment on all fronts. The story doesn't hold interest and doesn't flow. The actors lack chemistry, and Ruby Barnhill is unfortunately a very poor casting choice. John Williams' score is bland, uninspiring and at times so obvious and overpowering that you just wish the music wasn't there at all. The CGI is occasionally brilliant, but mostly - mediocre. Not once did I see Sophie being carried in BFG's palm where it looked natural. So the less obvious question is - why and where did it go so wrong. The answer is that the treatment is all wrong. The brilliance of Dahl's BFG is that it's a multi-layered, complex novel, hiding behind the facade of a children's book. It's full of subtleties and innuendos and satire. But most importantly, it juxtaposes good and evil, beautiful and ugly, horror and amazement. The good balances the bad. Without them both, the incredible concoction that is The BFG is just some bland chicken soup. Which is exactly what the movie is. Disney and Spielberg have stripped the evil from the story, leaving us with a meaningless and sentimental journey to nowhere. Here is one example of the impact of this treatment. In the book, the characters of maid Mary and the butler Mr. Tibbs serve as the comic relief. Sure, there is some class criticism and satire in their characters, but mostly they are there to add some long needed laughter after some frightening and tense moments. In the film these two are straight characters (romantically involved), with only a hint of comedy. And this makes sense, because in absence of the evil and the frightening, there is no need for a comic relief in the movie.And so, we know the answer. The treatment of The BFG was totally wrong. It should have never been a Disney film. Nor a kids' film for that matter. The BFG is and should be treated as young adults literature, and the movie needs to reflect that. Otherwise, it's just some lukewarm snozzcumber soup.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Expected More from a Disney / Spielberg Team-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFG is Spielberg's first foray into live-action family territory since 1991's Hook, and much of BFG feels like him trying to call a mulligan on that notorious Peter Pan "sequel". Sure, it's better than Hook, yet it still can't seem to cause more than only a few smiles and lots of clock-watching. This movie brings to mind Scorsese's Hugo: an iconic director makes a (mostly) skillful and (mostly) pretty kids film full of brightness, wonder and whimsy yet can't match his more adult offerings. Undeniable imaginativeness aside, BFG represents much lesser-Spielberg. Based on Roald Dahl's classic book, it's the story of an orphan girl (Barnhill) and her friendship with a magical Big Friendly Giant (Rylance). The plot they walk through is thin, as we watch the duo try and overthrow a gang of human-"bean"-eating giants. The movie uses the space a thicker plot would fill for some serious pacing issues. Too many scenes, even good ones, overstay their welcome (i.e. a cute but way overlong meal scene with the Queen). Luckily, both lead actors prove more than affable enough to carry through some of the runtime. Barnhill is adorable, while Rylance shines through the mo-cap animation of his surprisingly soulful character. As always, Spielberg moves his camera from fluid to frantic with narrative purpose and precision. Sadly, what he's shooting is not only overstuffed, but its combination of CG animation and live-action is distractingly ill-fitted. Why he didn't do all animation (ala Tintin) or all live-action (ala Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) is beyond me. In the end, it's a muggled ucky-muck of phizz-whizzing and frothbuggling! (Translation: The BFG is a qualitative mess).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flimsy, Effect-Reliant Effort Which Lacks the Magic of Dahl's Book and Spielberg's Preceding Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven Spielberg's doggedly loyal adaptation of a Roald Dahl classic, sadly, doesn't have much oomph. It's the narrow tale of an orphaned girl, abducted and (eventually) befriended by a steep, thin, heart-of-gold giant, who goes on to discover they have an awful lot in common. Originally a short story that was later expanded into a full novel, I can't remember the book feeling nearly as thin and stretched as the film does. It's got a nice message, some vague warm-fuzzies, a fair piece of physical acting (unsurprisingly, given the cast's stage credentials), but the central relationship is missing some intangibles and the looming threat never actually seems all that important. Spielberg and company took the sugar-coated route, skipping much of the menace that might have earned the film a stiffer rating, and along the way they slashed out its teeth. The dreamy, surreal CG is problematic, too. Often the fairy tale renderings seem more sharp and textured than the live actors, as if they're occupying two different realities in the same space, and that took me out of the scenery on several occasions. Mildly entertaining, but too effects-reliant for its own good. The journey is about so much more than the shape and color of the paths we've walked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "gigantic" letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So five years ago I was in fourth grade my class read this book and I loved it, so when I heard that Steven Spielberg would be directing a movie, I got pretty excited. Finally I am walking out of the theater with my head hung low, this disappointed me on so many ways. Let me begin by saying that the main character Sophie, has absolutely no character development.The opening scene is when the BFG abducts her. It takes about 4 minutes for that to happen and doesn't take the time to introduce much about Sophie. I was trying to not let that bother me too much. But it is never explained why the BFG truly took her to giant country. It made no sense. My biggest issue with this movie is that it really has no plot. There is no conflict or problem needed to be solved. The final 30 minutes finally have something happening, but it is so poorly done and randomly included. I should give it credit for the character of the BFG being exactly like the book which was cool. And most of the things done in the movie were closely like the book. And the scene with the queen was fun and enjoyable. But other than that this movie is incredibly slow and dull. All my family fell asleep I was the only one who stayed awake to watch the entire thing. There are some really childish moments that someone under 5 would laugh at. I'm sorry, I truly apologize but this movie is not that good. If you loved the book it would disappoint you, like it did to me. If you really want to see this movie just wait for the DVD to come out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a pre-teen 'human bean' of the eighties, there were a number of prerequisites to growing up during that decade:1. Watch Blue Peter (apologies to non-UK people, I'm not sure if there are other equivalents. But most UK kids watched this programme...without admitting to it).2. Always play within a territory pre-determined by your parents.3. Read, remember, adore Roald Dahl books.Dahl's The BFG never really appealed to me as it seemed to whimsical when what I really desired was something darker and more menacing.I was never going to be too disappointed by this, quite workmanlike and enjoyable adaptation by none other than Steven Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The odd sight of BFG's "frobscottle" ? a green fizzy drink where the bubbles go down instead of up, speaks to the tonal dissonance that normally shouldn't work in this feature film. From the get go, The BFG begins like a classic, possibly dark, tale set in the cobbled streets of a 19th century London. Around the "witching hour", an insomniac orphan named Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is snatched from her bedroom by a scraggly-looking giant (Mark Rylance in motion capture) and takes her to the Giant Country. Director Steven Spielberg's then subtly builds up from the photo-realistic "dream tree" sequence to author Roald Dahl's otherwise, abrupt and wacky setting change ? a modern-day Buckingham Palace where BFG consumes his royal breakfast at peace while the Queen of England (Penelope Wilton), her generals and pet corgis fart green clouds in satisfaction. Is this the same film that I walked into? The BFG will probably be best remembered for its short moments of silliness yet that's not necessarily a bad thing.Spielberg devotes the film's first hour in introducing us to Giant Country ? its Hobbit-ish surroundings, glowing orbs and all to keep us visually entertained. For a while, the magic slowly starts to run thin and I was worried if The BFG will wake up from its frolic dream state and start working on its plot. Not to say that the singular performances from its leads are nothing short of spectacular, but this is the type of children's film where its plot offers no serious stakes and any sense of danger can be dismissed as a mild threat. The oohh-so-scary "cannybulls" which go by names Fleshlumpeater, Bloodbottler, Gizzardgulper, Childchewer, etc. are portrayed as merely comical dumb bullies weak enough to sustain the third act's liftoff. Sure enough, the film's straightforward and childish resolution involving the military will only sell to a bunch of eight-year olds. Spielberg choose to shy away from the potential grotesquerie in Dahl's fictional world and makes this film more harmless. Hence, if you're looking for that needed sense of adventure, The BFG can be a bit lackluster.Still, Spielberg's childlike sense of wonder and emotionally honest storytelling allows him to transform into a dream catcher. The BFG, as a bottled piece of a captured dream unmistakably radiates with the classic Spielbergian magic that we've all come to know and love. The unlikely bond between a young girl and a giant transcends to the mature themes of finding friendship amidst loneliness and learning to stand up for yourself. It may not earn the timeless, universal appeal of the closest Spielberg classic that comes to mind (E.T.) but this frothbuggling (i.e., silly in Gobblefunk) tale gets the warm and fuzzies going. A whizzpopper it is!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went with the kids, 6 and 7 years old. "This is my favorite movie!", "Can we go again?"And I loved it as well :) I loved those Roald Dahl books as a kid. Release a very skilled director, like Steven Spielberg, on it, and you know its gonna be good.Since Mom was a little afraid that it would be too scary for those kids, they were a little nervous. Roald knows how to play with that and Steven translated it to a movie very well.All movie making techniques are executed very well, but most important, you get pulled into the story. Guess, that is what Steven Spielberg is good at.Highly recommended. 9-10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is someone who can come close to doing The BFG justice, it is none other than Steven Spielberg himself. He nails it and creates this enchanting image of the giant that we had always marveled about as kids. Spielberg brings him to life with his astounding powerful direction well supported constantly by the flick's beautiful CGI.MARK RYLANCE: THE PERFECT BIG FRIENDLY GIANT Mark Rylance is absolutely outstanding as the Big Friendly Giant, wearing his benevolence on his sleeves for us to notice him. He has such a beautiful soul that you cannot imagine anyone else wearing the character so perfectly. He fits into the persona like a glove. You can't help feel sorry for him when he struggles with the words. Yet in his occasional balderlash, he manages to say things that generate effortless musings."I hears your lonely heart, in all the secret whisperings of the world." If you pay close attention to his demeanour and follow him up with a childish gaze, it would be hard not to fall in love with his goodwill. Spielberg's CGI manages to capture his every expression making every moment melting.OTHER NOTEWORTHY ASPECTS IN THE BFG Screenplay is brimming up with Roald Dahl genius, and well moulded by Melissa Mathison for Cinema. Beautiful words from the book still lurk there, and they manage to rivet you with the kind of pace Steven Spielberg and all of us love."It was the Witching Hour, when the Boogeyman comes out when people go missing. The girls say the Witching Hour arrives at midnight. I think it comes at three in the morning, when I'm the only one awake. Like always. Like now."Ruby Barnhill was a great choice for Sophie too. Her cuteness level is endearing to watch. Her conversations with the BFG is what helps in putting things into perspective.The score of BFG is equally enchanting; setting the right mien to let you experience the wonder. The artistry on dreams was stunning as well. The whole concept of catching a dream, creating it, blowing it, is so well thought of that you cannot clap enough for Dahl's creativity.Watch the Giant storm past the trees swiftly and you will see how gorgeously his movements have been captured. The time when Sophie is picked up from her bed, as she beholds the dodgy pathway through her blankets, will tell you how Steven Spielberg never fails to give painstaking attention to his frames. He lets us in on Sophie's vision to show what she sees. There is poetry lurking in his direction which makes the whole cinematography affair even more winsome.THE FINAL VERDICT Apart from changing little facts from the Roald Dahl's creation, Spielberg brings back the lost charm of his ingenuity to the front page. He makes it happening via the tranquility in his frames something only his finesse could ace.Whilst those who haven't come across the children's book before, they might find the story a bit fantastical, but to be really candid, you need to turn back time for this. Witness the movie through the eyes of a little girl who comes across Giants for the first time in her life and goes on a whimsical little adventure to the Giant Country.Read full review here: http://straightfromamovie.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday with my 2 nieces and 1 nephew.The 2 little ones (8 years old) enjoyed it and found it cute and funny, however, my older niece (11) and I were bored to death, I even fell asleep for a while, which doesn't happen very often.I'm not saying this is a bad movie. The little girl did a pretty good job in her role, so did the actor who played the CGI giant. The whole movie looks pretty good and the CGI is great, but it has a lot of dialogue and the whole time you are waiting for something interesting to happen.I get this is a movie made for kids, but there are a lot of animated movies out there that are enjoyable for kids AND adults, and this is not one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG. A Beautiful Fantastical Gentle movie that's fun for everyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another film to add to Spielberg's filmography, The BFG is about the big friendly giant who kidnaps a child and takes her to Giant Country where the BFG must overcome bullies and seek a friendship with the kidnapped girl. Based on Roald Dahl's original work, I was most certainly going into this with low expectations (not being a fan of the original film)...but was pleasantly surprised! This is actually really imaginative and one of those rare films where I was in awe of the magic and wonder. Mark Rylance was great as the giant, you feel connected to him throughout the film and his voicing talents were brilliant (especially since he comes from a Shakespeare background). The rest of the cast did fine, but there isn't actually that much dialogue. The majority of the story is actually told through the visuals and my goodness there is some impressive work here, truly outstanding effects. I did take me some time to get used to the live action and the effects blending together, but this was only a short time. Spielberg has done well yet again, but the problem is that the film is just too safe. It feels like it was made for the 1980's and does not add anything new to the genre. Also there are times when&nbsp;you feel like the story isn't going anywhere, 117 minutes might be quite long for the younger viewers. Overall, this is an imaginative magical feature that might feel a little bit too safe but is definitely a great addition to Spielberg's canon.&nbsp;- Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some very impressive things but bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At his best Steven Spielberg is a genius film-maker and director, and Roald Dahl was and still is one of my childhood favourite authors, of which 'The BFG' is a favourite.Spielberg's 'The BFG' sees him nowhere near at his best (being at his peak in the 70s and 80s), but at the same time this reviewer does think there is enough to stop it from being one of the low-points. It is not an awful film, far from it, but it does lack of the Spielberg and Dahl magic overall. Although it isn't perfect, the 1989 animated version captured the spirit of the story much more.It was disadvantaged by pretty bad advertising, that the title and story is not familiar to a lot of non-UK viewers (and many seemed very put off by some of the book's plot-line and themes) and that despite being a great story the original book doesn't lend itself well particularly to a 2 hour film.There are many things to like about 'The BFG'. It does look great (one of two improvements over the 1989 animated version), the production and set design are exquisite on the eye and it is beautifully shot and immaculately edited. John Williams' music score is rich in orchestration, lively, whimsical and emotion-searing, more fitting and cinematic sounding than the charming, atmospheric but somewhat very 80s soundtrack of the animated version.Best thing about 'The BFG' is the BFG himself. He is a wholly likable character and brilliantly motion-captured. This is matched in every way by the performance of Mark Rylance, which has a twinkle, warm humour and heartfelt subtle nuance, bringing surprising complexity and expertly soul to a motion-capture character that could have not had any of those qualities in lesser hands as well as a rare ability of bringing meaning and nuance to a line of dialogue when many struggle to bring the same amount of believability to a page.Ruby Barnhill to me was engaging as Sophie, and she has a promising future ahead of her. Really enjoyed the warm and touching chemistry between her and the BFG. While generally a better job could have been done with the rest of the giants, the acting for them is very effective particularly from a deliciously repellent Jermaine Clement as the Fleshlumpeater. Bill Hader also does well as the Bloodbottler, very different to other performances of his. Penelope Wilton is suitably sincere as the Queen, Rebecca Hall sparkles as Mary and Rafe Spall delights as Mr Tibbs.While there are changes, a good deal of the details are here and there are some effective scenes. Especially the rivetingly exciting opening kidnapping scene, the visually stunning and enchanting Land of Dreams sequence and the affecting blowing-of-the-dream-to-the-little-boy scene. Spielberg shows real technical brilliance throughout.However, 'The BFG' does suffer from pacing issues. It starts off great, but becomes inconsistent once in the Land of Giants. The first half is at times quite sluggish, conversely the climax feels rushed and at the same time lacking in urgency. A couple of scenes fall flat too, one does miss the heart-skipping-several-seconds impact of the Bloodbottler's first entrance here, which is nowhere near as frightening here, and although the Frobscottle is in the book it's overdone to overkill effect here with the otherwise visually entrancing and interesting breakfast scene for example, amongst others, marred by misplaced lowbrow humour (like the farting corgis, and for being too long).It has been said in this review that many of the details, though with also some changes, are here, but the spirit is lost. There is charm here, but it does feel so restrained emotionally it comes over as remote, while it lacks the darkness of the book and the magic of Spielberg's best work, instead often feeling too safe. Despite the acting, the giants not only do not have the wondrous attention to detail that the BFG does (with the CGI looking like over-sized cheapness in comparison) but are not terrifying enough and most are not very interesting or much different from one another. For example the Fleshlumpeater should be the most fearsome of the lot, but feels too much like an ordinary "menacing" giant.Overall, 'The BFG' has a number of impressive things but feels rather bland and too safe. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I truly feel sorry for those who miss this movie. I think it's a very beautiful, heart warming, magical and funny movie with lovely soundtracks. A movie to be watched from the lens of childlike innocence and imagination. A movie with depth and hilarious dialogue as the giants speak funny English. Amazing acting from Mark Rylance as the BFG and Ruby Barnhill as Sophie.THANK YOU STEVEN SPIELBERG for making this movie - I am reminded of the fun younger days reading all of Roald Dahl's books and Quentin Blake's cute illustrations .My friend (age 40s who saw the movie with me) has never read a Roald Dahl book yet she thinks the movie is awesome. Glad we didn't listen to the negative sayers , we think its a great movie for everyone (but not toddlers afraid of giants) and its especially for adults - if you want to feel young again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bfg is Steven Spielberg's newest film and honestly one of his weak ones in resent times after bridge of spies that was great he makes the same actor Mark Rylance act as the Giant .it could be great but it wasn't even a good movie. It was a decent movie with pros but mostly cons for me for being so boring of a film. I don't like boring movies but Spielberg made a boring film for me. It doesn't have the things that he can do. The actress Ruby Barnhill is one of the only positives about this film. She gives it her all I give props to her for saving the film but it would not save it enough to it is still not good. It has its positives though Ike I've said it has her acting good. The story For This Film is OK but it could be better like I've said it's not good enough of a movie to have that story. Being good like jaws or ET it's just a boring movie For me and not worth time but better than really bad movies though and decently better than his bad movies this isn't a bad movie just boring still better than a Michael bay film. good family film I think and I think kids can like this though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An above average family friendly film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Steven Spielberg and of some of roal Dahl's books so I did want to watch the bfg and this is an alright film. The premise of the film sees a young girl taken to giant country by the bfg where they attempt to understand each other. Mark rylance coming off of his Oscar win for his role in bridge of spies plays the bfg in this film and he is fantastic in this film. He comes across as the lovable giant that he is supposed to be and you do grow to really like him in this character and he is definitely the best thing in this film. Ruby barnhill plays Sophie and She gives a good child performance in this film. She has good chemistry with rylance and he is quite a cute young girl who you believe in this film. Unfortunately everybody else in this film is incredibly dull an you won't care about any of them whether human or giant. The story has a nice story about this relationship between this girl and the bfg as they understand each other and grow to become friends. But apart from that there isn't a threat to them that you take at all seriously and the film just doesn't have enough going on it for you to care as an adult. The script has some fun dialogue involving the bfg's dialogue. There is however, allot of child humour that comes across as lazy. Also there really isn't any drama in this film at all. The style has some marvelous CGI especially for the bfg. This film though is quite slowly paced and many families will find it a bit long to watch. Overall this is a decent family film but it isn't one of Spielberg's best so if that's why your seeing this film then I may skip this one.</fullReview>

I may have been the only one who never thought much of 'Jurassic Park' and our beloved alien 'E.T.' is outdated, because we all know he would have stayed in touch with Facebook nowadays. Many of his films to me are over-dramatic or obviously suffering from Spielberg's 'Peter Pan-Syndrome'. But, man! This movie is awesome! I loved the humor, the CGI is very good, the giant is just portrayed perfectly and it never becomes dull. Exciting, not too terrifying for young children and very creative.

		<shortDescription>Charming but distant effort from Spielberg with brilliant turn from Mark Rylance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of negative reviews for "The BFG" on IMDb. While the film is flawed in several respects, I do think it showcases some of the elements that have made other Spielberg movies family classics.I'll start with the positives. Mark Rylance's performance in this film is sublime. Still a relative unknown on the screen when he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor earlier in the year (for a performance that I wasn't so bowled over by), his performance of the BFG showcases his long stage experience. Only a classically trained actor could deliver the kind of nuanced expression and emotion in the tangled vocabulary of the dialogue here and Rylance never failed to captivate me for a single moment. It's fair to say that the film would not have succeeded without this crucial performance - Spielberg must have been grinning from ear to ear when he first witnessed it. It probably adds 2 points to my score here and is worth seeing the film to experience.Newcomer Ruby Barnhill needs to be mentioned here as well. While not lighting the screen up with her performance as the orphan Sophie, she capably carries the scenes that she needs to.The production design of the film is also impressive at times, particularly the giant sets in the BFG's house which convey a fun sense of wonder for Barnhill to navigate in. The area where the BFG keeps his dreams is also nicely designed with inventive water mechanisms which provide the basis of the best dramatic sequence in the film. That being said, I did have some niggling issues with the continuity of scale throughout the film, particularly between the 3 main dimensions of the humans, the BFG, and the considerably larger other giants. This seemed noticeably inconsistent to me which grated against my enjoyment of the film.The film successfully delivers the fun moments with some good family comedy moments. A particularly memorable set-up "whizz-banger" scene in Buckingham Palace is sure to make the kids (and most adults with a funny bone) laugh out loud.However it is in the drama that the film suffers. One of Roald Dahl's talents was in creating an unusual level of threat for a children's author and this is simply missing from the film. We're told that the other giants eat people but never come close to witnessing this on screen. As a result the bad guys more often come across as a bumbling gaggle of idiots than a source of dread. Roald Dahl takes time in the book to make us afraid of the other giants but Spielberg, possibly in search of his PG rating, declines to do so here to the detriment of the film. Contrast this with Nick Roeg's excellent adaptation of "The Witches" where the truly chilling opening is devoted to showing the evil and terrifying methods employed by the antagonists.As well as lacking in scares, the film rarely raises the adrenaline either. Unlike in the excellent "The Adventures of Tintin", Spielberg fails here to raise the pace much culminating in a truly limp finale.Overall this felt like a very old-fashioned kids movie which is not helped by the indistinct setting which veers in feel from modern day to Victorian. It has a lot of charm in its presentation and is aided enormously by the main performance but falls short of the source material and Spielberg's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG is A-OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I perceive The BFG to have many problems as a film...yet it has still somehow managed to charm the hell out of me.So what's the reason? Maybe it's in part thanks to Spielberg's ability to emotionally manipulate an audience and the apparent charm that comes with it or maybe it was the great audience reaction in the film screening I saw that has influenced my take on it.Do I think it's a brilliant family film? No I don't, yet do I believe it will have the required effect on the target audience? Yes I do, contradictory some may say, part of that feeling comes directly from my cinema experience amongst a large family audience with the child age range primarily of what I'd say to be 6-9 year old's, with countless child gasps and murmurs of 'Is that the dream tree?' and 'It's the BFG!' I've been in many a family/kids film audience where the child audience has been restless yet this film seemed to manage to encapsulate the sort of wonder that many kids animated films fail to do.So what's positively good about it? I have to begin with set design because if anything has been proved with this film and Spielberg's last film Bridge of Spies, the people he employs are surely the best set designers in the business with him wonderfully recreating London streets where the orphanage is situated in The BFG.The performance of the young Ruby Barnhill as the principle lead of Sophie the young girl who is taken from her orphanage by The BFG and took to the land of giants is nothing but exceptional, she offers enough intrigue and warmth that makes her thoroughly engaging throughout the film, Mark Rylance in a motion capture performance as The Big Friendly Giant is also entertaining with him charming his way through the film with his wonderful pronunciations of original novelist Roald Dahl's interesting dialogue.Not everything works though and it's fair to say sometimes Rylance's accent comes across a bit too twee for my liking, also even though the other giants are meant to be a decent part of the story they feel rather more like decorate dressing around our main two characters, my main two criticisms are bound to contradict each other with not enough humour for my liking and given the fact that giants are coming into children's bedrooms and eating them the film does a bit of a sanitisation job of the actual darker intentions of what made the book and Dahl's works in general so unique and wonderful.I certainly feel it will connect with the target demographic although I'd say definitely more here in the United Kingdom than say the U.S. and like I said I was surprised how much it did charm me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the film started out I thought it a little cliché with the orphan girl trotting around the decadent halls of an orphanage at the witching hour with her specs, torch and quilt seemed all so Harry potteresque. Plus, from a British perspective seemed a somewhat disconnected and insufferable American stereotype of Britons which grated on me. I also found the protagonist rather annoying at first. However, when things kick off with BFG screen time it was all quickly forgotten because Mark Rylance is perfect casting and he was such a lovable character. The motion capture technology used to embody the bumbling giant runt enabled all of the actors exquisite nuances to create the greatest on screen Interpretations of my personal favourite fictional characters. Largely due to his enchanting performance the mediocre film with its misplaced cultural references that surrounded him became insignificant. Oh and I eventually found some love for Sophie the protagonist as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A giant experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my review of the BFG (spoiler free) ***(3/5) Cast: Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill, Penelope Wilton, Jermaine Clement, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall Plot: A girl named Sophie (Barnhill) encounters the Big Friendly Giant (Rylance) who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kindhearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children.Adapting Roald Dahl has become easier since 1990 ? the year the author died. When he was alive he was famously opinionated, raging filmmakers for altering plot details or casting actors that he didn't approve of, the publicly campaigning against the films if his demands weren't met. Some films escaped his wrath though, including the faithful-to-the-book 1989 animated version of The BFG. He'd be pleased of this too especially from Steven Spielberg's E.T: The Extra terrestrial with screenwriter, the late Melissa Mathison who also joined in writing this. The story opens promisingly as you'd expect with John Williams' score being as good as ever although sounds somewhat familiar, it does sound exactly like Harry Potter but that isn't an issue. Barnhill is a terrific young actor and her down-to-earth, bespectacled character is a far cry from Disney's archetypal heroine. Once we're in his land, the full glory of the BFG unfolds: he's a big-eared, wispy, white-haired CG wonder with the kind eyes of actor Mark Rylance, who was filmed using motion-capture cameras. Like Andy Serkis when he played Gollum it's the same way. Rylance ? who won an Oscar for Spielberg's Bridge of Spies ? is the perfect choice for this gentle, humble creature, and brings Dahl's quirky dialogue to life in a soft West Country accent. You maybe confused at first his muddled speech but as the film goes on you start to fall in love with the character. After we get to his land and the amazing story goes on something strange happens: nothing for a long time, which is slightly off putting, it takes a long time for the story to get good again.It spends a long time getting into each scene even with the 8 other giants voiced brilliantly by comedy superstar Bill Hader and also Jamaine Clement, they are fun and intimidating enough but underdeveloped. When the BFG gets bullied by the bigger boys it has sort of an underdog appeal to it. When it gets to that bit it is too long and feels like it is in a repetitive loop. Sophie shares the love for the fizzy drink Frobscottle, which leads to loud farts which will have kids squealing with delight. When the dialogue wears a little thin it spends scene after scene outstaying its welcome. Those who haven't read the book will you shifting in your seat because of the 2 hour long run time; you'll be wondering where it's all going. The BFG's habit to collect human dreams is also underused in fact barely used at all moments that are in one scene when we see a boy having a dream when he gets called by the US President, moments like that are rare by which only used once. The scene when Sophie gets shown the tree of dreams sounds like a name in Avatar it's very gorgeous with bright colours and a wonderful but, it's flat and spends ages in that scene, and the score is very enlightening when it gets to this point, it's very well done but could have been done better.I bet you're wondering does the final act get better? Yes it does, and in the nick of time. In a scene which will look familiar to those who have seen the animated version, when the BFG and Sophie go to Buckingham Palace to convince The Queen, played wonderfully by Penelope Wilton that giants exist and they are stealing and eating children. This scene is marvelous because there is much to love in this scene whether it's the charming Rebecca Hall's Mary or even the nervous Rafe Spall's Mr. Tibbs who is also wonderful. This scene is probably the most thrilling and also the funniest because unlike the rest of the movie this bit isn't overlong or doesn't spend ages through it, it's wonderful. The part when the BFG is in the dining hall being delivered a lavish breakfast by many footmen proves that Spielberg can do comedy because again it's very funny. Not only does it recall the likes of Gulliver's Travels but better, it reminds us what fantastical fun can come of a large cast as well as a large character. So the end makes the whole experience worth it.VERDICT: Giant expectations may lead to tiny disappointments in this two-hander that's slow in parts. But it still offers magic and visual pride, and the final act is a treat.6/10 An enjoyable and fun experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exquisite Example Of Restrained Craftsmanship &amp; Elegant Storytelling.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sensibly crafted, firmly grounded &amp; radiating an immense sense of joy, warmth &amp; wonderment that only a Spielberg film can provide with such effortless ease, The BFG is an enchanting, endearing &amp; transporting fable that's meant for and will mostly appeal to the young &amp; easily entertained viewers but has some surprises in store for the grown-ups as well.Based on Roald Dahl's novel of the same name, The BFG tells the story of Sophie, a young orphan girl who is abducted by a giant after she sees him outside of her window during the witching hour and is taken to his giant country. Trapped in an alien place yet happy to have gotten away from the orphanage, she decides to assist the big friendly guy in his endeavours and ultimately develops an amazing bond with him.Directed by Steven Spielberg, The BFG marks his first stint at Walt Disney Pictures and the source material really benefits from his assured direction as the eminent filmmaker manages to bring this children's story to life in a very down-to-earth manner yet with all the magical qualities embedded in it. Another striking feature is the absence of dark elements as Spielberg decides to keep things gleeful, optimistic &amp; good-natured at all times.The script is always focused on Sophie &amp; her budding relationship with the elderly but kindhearted giant, and although the former is the heart of this picture, the latter is the soul. The set pieces are eye-pleasing by all means, refined to smallest of details, Camera-work is smooth, relaxed &amp; smartly handled as per the scene requirements, Editing paces the plot with composure, while the ebullient score by John Williams seamlessly integrates into the narrative.Visual effects in any Spielberg film is state-of-the-art stuff by default and The BFG is no exception as the film brims with some gorgeous, breathtaking &amp; heartwarming display of visual wonders, one specific example being that Dream Country sequence. The Big Friendly Giant is portrayed by Mark Rylance through motion-capture and his calm demeanour really enhances the BFG's innocent side. Ruby Barnhill is no slouch either and plays the role of the young orphan with comfort &amp; confidence.On an overall scale, The BFG is a sweet, affectionate &amp; warmhearted present from Spielberg that's going to enthral the kids and transport the rest of the viewers back to their childhood. While it isn't amongst his finest films and lacks the lasting endurance of his most magical works as well, it's still a heartfelt adventure that amuses &amp; delights in sufficient amount. Offering an escape to wonderland with its healthy dose of family-friendly entertainment, The BFG is an exquisite example of restrained craftsmanship &amp; elegant storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing Eye Candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The BFG", starring Mark Rylance-Bridge of Spies, The Other Boleyn Girl; Ruby Barnhill-Her first movie, although she was in an English TV show called 4 O'clock Club; Bill Hader-Trainwreck, Paul and Penelope Wilton-Downton Abbey_tv, Shaun of the Dead.This is the first time Steven Spielberg has directed a movie for Disney. It is based on a 1982 children's book by Roald Dahl. There was an earlier 1989 animated British movie but it was made for video &amp; TV so this is the first live action adaptation-with lots of CGI. I have not read the book so that may explain some of my confusion. The movie looks great but some of the storyline was hard to understand. Mark is a 24 foot tall giant-his brothers are all taller, at 39-50 feet tall-that spends his nights capturing dreams and giving them to people while they sleep. Ruby is an orphan that sees Mark performing his nightly duties, so he kidnaps her and takes her to giant land-he doesn't want her telling anyone about him. Mark has to hide her from his brothers because they are people eaters-they usually kidnap children during the night to use as snacks-unlike himself, a vegetarian. Bill is one of the taller brothers that likes to pick on Mark because he is shorter than they are. It's not long until Mark &amp; Ruby are best friends, in fact Ruby starts calling him BFG, or Big Friendly Giant. They develop a plan to get rid of the mean brothers by going to the Queen, played by Penelope, and getting her help. Some of the hard to understand parts-at least to me- included where Mark got the dreams, in the first place-a tree under water. Then there is the green bubbly liquid Mark drinks-the bubbles travel downwards so instead of burping after you drink it, well..... let's just say, the gas comes out the other end of a body. The language Mark uses is a weird mixed up version of English-using words like Rumpledumpus &amp; squigglybum. I'm sure that it is for comical effect but I guess I'm not in on it enough-you know, too old. I'm not sure if younger children will enjoy the movie-We had a 7 year old girl with us and she was bored. It's rated "PG" for action/peril, scary moments and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 57 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is along the same lines as Moulin Rouge!: a movie that all critics are forced to like because of its pretty effects and cinematography. I'm sorry. But CGI and fancy angles still don't make up for an otherwise boring, tonally inconsistent mess of a film. Not only is the story as minimal as meat on a turkey after Thanksgiving feast, but the dialogue just comes off as random and arbitrary, adding little to nothing to the already confusing "plot" (if you can call it that). And that's the major problem with this film. The plot is as confused, inconsistent, and as bare boned as a screenplay can possibly get. Sometimes the film feels like telling the "story". And sometimes it just- doesn't. There's no rhyme or reason as to why it feels like taking a break from the three act structure. It just- does. And it's BORING. So incredibly boring. I appreciate the CGI. But it just looks boring. There's even a scene where the BFG does nothing but hop around and giggle. Why, you may ask? I don't know. The film definitely doesn't know. So, in summary, no one knows. I hate to say this, but, this film's a mess. An absolute mess. And a bit of a tragedy too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg once again proves that he can take a child actor/actress and pull a very good performance out of them, as we seen with E.t., Hook and artificial intelligence. Although this film does not contain the emotional punch that it may be trying to deliver nor contain a very dramatic, and dark scene like the films I listed previously, this is still a very sweet, funny, charismatic, and wickedly clever film. The motion capture performance by Mark Rylance is visually stunning and very heartfelt as well is Ruby Barnhill's character Sophie. This film will make a deep impact in the young minds of children, it's very harmless and sometimes a little to silly towards the final climax of our two protagonist's journey, but if you love the original children's novel by Raul Dahl, you will surely appreciate this film. I had a very fun time with this movie, it could very much fit in with being one of the best children book to movie adaptations we seen in a while. The cast are very vibrant, and cheerful as is the overall story, the more we explore the wonders of this world and the deeper meaning behind it's story, the more I can imagine children around the world pulling up the original novel and also being swept away to magical worlds beyond our reach. This is a good intentioned, well acted adventure. It's not one of Spielberg's greatest but it's a great family adventure that's sure enough to receive critical acclaim and grown popularity by the end of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The BFG is a great movie. It's the type of movie you'd watch with family and love. The movie is aimed at children so adults may find some parts of the film "dull". I went to see it last night and with it being almost 2 hours long it can get a bit boring. At the beginning of the film it isn't much but as it progresses it really begins to become quite a fast paced film. The BFG himself is a very moving character. With 9 other giants living alongside him in Giant Country it can get quite sad. At one point the other giants bully him and it can be quite sad. It gives you that feeling when you want to run up to the screen and punch that bully in the face. Altogether though The BFG is a great heartwarming film filled with little giggles and cries. It may not appeal to all adults and teens but it is a great choice for kids and family's to watch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Certainly for BFG fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Spielberg film directed for Disney and Disney's Second Roald Dahl adaption after 96's James and The Giant Peach; finding out DreamWorks Pictures (not the Dreamworks Animation) signed a 30 picture deal with Disney back in 2009, with BFG being the first collaboration film since Dragonslayer with Paramount in '81. Based entirely on Dahl's personal favourite of his children's novels, with the screenplay written by Harrison Ford's ex-wife and Spielberg's good friend Melissa Mathison, who was also the brain-child behind E.T. She sadly passed away last November due to cancer, who this film is dedicated to. A young Ruby Barnhill plays the kidnappee Sophie very well but a little annoying; I'm blaming the character more than her acting. But it has to be Mark Rylance who's the big star of the film and rightly so. His diction is incredible and if there was only one thing good to come out of Spielberg's Bridge of Spies, it would be where the two met leading to Rylance being casted for BFG. (I actually like Bridge of Spies, especially for Rylance.) his facial expressions says so much. Some might think it's all CGI but Disney/DreamWorks did something not done before, well, Weta digital did; and that was actually using a hybrid blend of performance and live action on real sets. Unfortunately, whilst looking impressive in parts, it does look weak and cheap in others but not so bad you dislike the film. Maybe it looks so real it doesn't. Spielberg regular John Williams, does the score but isn't wholly noticeable, but Williams has spoilt us with iconic film themes spanning the decades, especially Spielberg's and Lucas' masterpieces. It's not a score that grabbed me, enchanted me or be one I would purchase, but, that doesn't mean it bad, because it's not, it suits the film. I'm not a great fan of Dahl, though not a disliker of his works or the film adaptations, just never enjoyed them as much as most kids at school. I don't actually remember owing any of his books and I think our literature classes skipped him altogether so unfortunately I wasn't as hyped and I mildly entertained by the film if not disappointed with Spielberg final cut; didn't even feel like a Spielberg movie, but I believe fans and children will love it. Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 9 Direction: 7 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 purely for Mark Rylance's expressive performance. 72% 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly enjoyable!! Why all the hate?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I just wanted to touch on some of the harsh negative reviews that seem to be dominating the top of the page for The BFG. In recent times where the movie going public have been subjected to such mediocrity including; Ghostbusters,Star Trek: Beyond, X-men: Apocalypse, Kung Fu Panda 3, Jungle Book etc it strikes me that when a half decent movie does indeed come out, so many of us are conditioned to these average movies we forget what a real movie experience actually is. A movie that can take you on a journey to the heady days of falling into Roald Dahls world and forgetting about the travails and stresses of everyday life. Where imagination and wonder plays as much apart of the experience as anything presented on the screen. The cinema should be more than just a two hour baby sitter when it comes to taking the kids and The BFG allows for real engagement between parents and kids with its simple, yet masterful approach in presenting the subject material to its audience (who else but Spielberg and co).The plot is simple, Orphan girl and outcast giant try to find a way to protect the children of the world from the horrible "Bean" eating giants that come from giant country. The story is motivated by the developing connection between a young girl with no parents who finds a paternal relationship and way to escape her reality, in the form of the beautifully realized, whimsical and mostly silly (the way your Grandpa would be) BFG. The BFG instills some pretty big ideals both in the book and on screen. Eg; Sticking to your principles - The BFG refuses to eat children because he knows it's wrong &amp; so subjects himself to eating Snozzcumbers and bullying by the other giants. He also has experienced loss/grief in the form of the first child that he befriended who was killed by the giants. His relationship with Sophie provides him with the possibility of moving on from that grief and allowing himself to be happy again by making choices that may not have worked out for the best previously. Our protagonist, Sophie is presented as the - literally- little girl lost trying to find her dreams. The world of Giant Country, in particular BFG's home, is beautifully realized. While primarily a CGI enhanced environment, the set design for Sophie to interact with creates a seamless whole which is never distracting past the point of wonder. While there are one or two issues with pacing (the introduction to the Queen is distinctly drab and the final scene too brief), there's enough within the main set pieces to ensure we are never left dwelling on earlier moments as the highlight in proceedings. The entry into giant country/BFG's lair, dream catching sequence, opening exchange between BFG and Fleshlumpeater as well as the fantastically silly "Breakfast with the Queen" should have kids and parents alike giggling and cooing throughout.In a summer (or year, depending how you look at it) lacking any real family access to a decent movie going experience, The BFG is a pleasant relief. The best way to judge, is to find out for yourself. It'd be a shame to be put off by some of the poor reviews that, while completely acceptable opinions, may not reflect your own thoughts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just because your kids loved it, doesn't mean you loved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly loved the original book about The BFG. It was charming and funny at the best of times. It's a solid read. This movie however is only worth it to the small demographic of children who don't know any better. Around ages 5-8, I'd say. And I'm not in that range. Why would I be here if I wasn't.There were points I liked in the film.The special effects were nice, the CG was good, and the story was tied and true to the book. Sadly, that's where the good things end.The movie was slow. Like... a snail was faster than the movie's pacing. They tended to spend way too much time in one area or on one scene instead of moving on to something else, and when they did move on, they spent too much time on that scene. Every second in the Royal Palace dragged on and on for an eternity.There's a lot of pandering to that age 5-8 demographic. That demographic is still too young to understand that fart jokes are not funny. So what does the movie do?Anyone remember Whiz-poppers?Yeah. They do that a lot.I find it very hard to laugh when the movie is trying to make me laugh at basically a glorified fart. And it happens quite a bit. They explain and show what happens at around the middle of the movie. Then the explain it again in the Royal Palace scene and just add more people Whiz-popping. The kids were laughing like they were drunk. My palm was in my face. How can a movie made off of a timeless book stoop this low? Pandering. That's how.There was a BFG movie made before this one, and I think it to be better than this new age one. At least in that movie scenes moved at a competent pace and they didn't focus on Whiz-poppers for a chunk of the run time. There was one scene in that one dedicated to Whiz-poppers, but it was only one scene. Unlike this movie.On a final note, if you read other reviews for this movie (or any other kids movie), you tend to notice that there are reviews saying "The kids loved it!" And the review is happy-go-lucky with a high star rating. Just because your kids loved a movie, no matter how good or bad it may be (looking at you, The Road Chip), doesn't mean you have to love it with them. This movie panders to your kids. Of course they're going to love it. It had fart jokes. Mindless, unfunny fart jokes. So your telling me you liked those jokes just because your kids loved it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Spielberg Meets Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A girl named Sophie encounters the Big Friendly Giant who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kindhearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because, unlike them, he refuses to eat children. When Steven Spielberg has to direct a film, no matter what the subject is, I'll be there. Because I know, with Spielberg at the helm and E.T screenwriter Melissa Mathison (though she died last November) at the typewriter, I'm in for the awe of watching the art of a true legend of filmmaking - and to me probably the best storyteller of all time. Steven Spielberg directed 29 feature films in his career, but he has never before made one with the powerhouse that is Walt Disney Studios. This film is the first to be put under the Disney Studios fairy-tale castle logo. The BFG comes from a director who knows how to make films on that note and on that scale. It arches back to Spielberg early days when he was making movies about friendship and magic like E.T. And I'd dare to say that this film could serve as Spielberg's E.T for an all-new generation. In fact, for a certain generation, E.T will always stand as the ultimate children's movie. No matter how fantastical the tale, this splendid Steven Spielberg-directed adaptation makes it possible for audiences of all ages to wrap their minds around one of the unlikeliest friendships in cinema history. This London-set adaptation of the Roald Dahl story reunites Mark Rylance and his Bridges of Spies director. Mark Rylance is awesome! he brings the BFG alive. It is a thing of wonder to see his trademark nuances, generally so studied and small, magnified to this colossal scale. With no offense intended to pioneer Andy Serkis, it's exciting to see someone else driving one of these virtual performances. Without him, the film would certainly lack the charm and sweetness it now displays. he plays the BFG like an abused child, grown to and alienated old age, taking refuge in a world of his own. Spielberg manages to make you feel like magic is real, it's out there, in our world, it's incredible - like he did in Jurassic Park for instance. This feeling is intensified by the fact that you are watching a story through the eye of a young girl. Who can be more imaginative than a child? Ruby Barnhill is fantastic as well, she's brilliant in comedy as well as with the dramatic aspect. Indeed the motion capture work and CGI are very strong and John Williams score is as beautiful as ever. Finally, this film relies on the simple notion that magic only works so long as children believe, and here we see this principle put into practice. Overall, The BFG feels like something magical between an Amblin Entertainment movie and a classic Disney Studios fairytale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who reads IMDb reviews? Men (mostly) aged 30-55.Who did Roald Dahl write this book for? Children aged 4-10 (or those that still believe in magic and monsters).Who did Spielberg make this film for? Not you if your reading this review.I took my 5 year old daughter to the London BFI IMAX as a birthday treat and she was blown away by the magical and immersive enveloping world of Sophie the norphan and the Big Friendly Giant - the film is perfectly timed, paced well and scary enough for the average CHILD. I don't want my kid to be mentally scared by watching a film that was supposed to about a little girl and a FRIENDLY GIANT. She laughed a lot, she cried and she was just enough scared and didn't get up for a wee once (which is a sure sign she wasn't bored).If you have kids go and see it with them. Don't be the sad 30+ man in the anorak and note book sitting on your own with Spielbergian expectations of being scared the poop out of your pants because guess what this film is not made for you - in fact if Spielberg did make the film for adults he would have dishonoured Roald Dahls great legacy of work (as growed ups like us are horrid).I read the book as a kid and read it recently to my daughter - the film is perfectly placed in her imagination to fill her life with positivity and for her to realise that not all big people are bad and just because life sometimes throws you a bad apple, as long as you dream big you can achieve anything no matter who you are. That message shines through both the book and the film.And if you think "so what does this blokes kid know anyway" well by age 5 my daughters seen every kids film possible and knows when to tell me "Pan", "Capture the flag", "Minions" and "the Good Dinosaur" are boring etc - she knows her stuff.I implore you to take a child and show them a world of dreams and magic, let's not sour their childhood with our growed up angst and bitterness - the world needs more of that like it needs grown ups reviewing kids films :p (yes that is a raspberry).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, it's not Spielberg's best effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFG is one of Spielberg's rare excursions in childish whimsy these days, as sweet and big-hearted as you'd expect from the maker of E.T.: The Extraterrestrial. Technically speaking, it's a motion capture marvel, with Academy Award winner Mark Rylance in line for another nomination, in the title role of Big Friendly Giant.Based on Roald Dahl's children's book, the screenplay by the late Melissa Matheson ? who also wrote E.T. ? relishes the author's wacky way with Gobblefunk, a silly word salad spoken by BFG. Rylance is a constant delight, chattering and chuckling decipherable nonsense like "vegeterribles" and spreading news on "the bunkum box and radio squealer."While mo-cap pioneer Andy Serkis hides behind the process, Rylance is unmistakably the digitized face of BFG. His eyes radiate their usual soft kindness, the only part of his physique that isn't digitally exaggerated. Elephantine ears, spindly appendages and buzzard neck are faked; the actor is genuine.This is, however, an easier movie to admire for its technical prowess than embrace with emotional zeal. Spielberg doesn't pull heart strings as much as push the right buttons, dutiful to an undercooked story. The BFG begins like a classic fairy tale and ends with helicopters and fart jokes, a tonal dissonance that is Dahl's fault, not the film's.Like E.T., this is a tale of a child bonding with a humane creature. Sophie (Ruby Barnhill, serviceably cute) lives in a London orphanage, waking at 3 a.m. nightly when lonely makes sense. One night she spies BFG prowling the streets, her gasps drawing his attention. He plucks Sophie from bed, carrying her to Giant Land and his lair.Much of the film's first hour occurs in these Hobbit-ish surroundings, as Sophie learns BFG is the runt of a clan of giants led by Fleshlumpeater (voice of Jemaine Clement). The others are "cannybulls" eating "human beans," and Fleshlumpeater's keen nose tells him one is near. Protecting his new, only friend is now BFG's mission.Complicating matters is BFG's nightly task, collecting and distributing nice dreams to London's children with ninja stealth. Sophie tags along against the giant's better judgement, exposing her to Fleshlumpeater's crew. Spielberg adds a fresh approach to dream-sequence technique with little more than silhouettes and a smile, a rare ingenious touch in this movie.Then comes the point when Dahl may have simply grown tired of the story, opting for an abrupt change in direction to Buckingham Palace and Queen Victoria (Penelope Wilton) calling out the army. It feels so at odds with everything preceding that intermittent delights like BFG's gigantic royal breakfast don't impress as much, when the queen and her Corgis begin breaking wind, thanks to BFG's homemade fizzy pop. Is this really the same movie we walked into?No, because Spielberg isn't the same filmmaker today. He deals much more often in fact than fantasy, and imagination muscle has only so much memory. They're flexed here in Rylance's appearance and not much else. The BFG is like hearing grandpa tell an okay bedtime story, punctuated with an underarm fart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had my two kids and their niece in the movies for this, 7 and 2x11 years old, it is not the fastest of movies and maybe it was more fitting for a different time in many ways, it is however a wonderful break from the hectic world outside and all kids including myself :) enjoyed this film.There are many interesting scenes in this, many that becomes this fairy-tale kind of story, some that are beautiful &amp; mysteries, some that are vivid &amp; unbelievable, some that are scary &amp; with a twist of fun, all of them are very much for the kids and so is the story, but as a grown up it is still a great experience and just try to have your kids retell what they have just seen afterwards is a joy (they notice things, we as adults do not).I was entertained and think this is one for the kids to watch again.Location, seating &amp; time: Atlas, R?dovre, Denmark - Bio 2, row 6 seat 1, 2, 4 &amp; 6 - 14.08.2016 at 13.20</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A splendid visualisation of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you got here eventually? Good.Disregard every bad review in its entirety. Everyone that says it is boring, that the acting is bad, that the plot makes no sense, that there is no magic. Have a chuckle at the one that says there should be more Doom weapons by all means - but the rest - utter cacbabble. You don't have to read the book to love this film, but the book is the story and the story comes alive in this film. The BFG is flawed, he is a small giant, he is a gentle giant in a time of angry giants but he tries to do right. He can't articulate well but he tries. Sophie is lost and alone and seeks purpose and not only finds a friend who will always be listening, but saves children and raises an army by having a plan. I'll grant a little slow at times - I thought the palace scene could've been snappier but then I'm watching it from the PoV of knowing the punchline. My four year old did hide behind her open fingers when the bad giants came by, and was elated at the end. "That movie was brilliant" she declared. For me it was Quentin Blake's images of the story Dhal put in my head, brought to life.Dreamlands, Giant lands, concocting dreams and why they are important to have and believe in. What could be more magical?If you have no imagination or sense of wonder, you may struggle here - don't watch Matilda either. If you need detailed plot history and Letts notes for a PG, stop reading George R R Martin, start reading Hemingway, or Dhal. Magic needs no explanation - that's why its magic: just like this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The BFG" Is A Colossal Adaptation Worthy of Disney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The BFG" brings back to film industry to Steven Spielberg with a genuine work aimed at adults and infants that covets to has the same impact than the previous classics of the director, nevertheless, his film does not capture such pleasures.The central axis of the film is Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill), an orphan of 11 years old suffers child insomnia, her disorder makes she believes in "the witching hour", moment in which children of all the world are kidnapped by unidentified creatures. Sophie is kidnapped by the BFG (Rylance), who takes her to his home, which is beyond of Great Britain, beyond of mountain chains, more beyond of cloudscape. The apparent giant lives there, in a rustic house under a crag, however, he coexists with nine giants more, which belong to different alimentary prototypes, but, they concur with one special ideal: humiliate tremendously to the oldest and smallest of their countrymen. The BFG is the most diminutive (based on height) of his kind, nevertheless, has the heart more sensitive than others of his class; eating rotten and nasty vegetables and preparing his sleepy potions the giant spends his days, even so, Sophie has different plans in mind.The film is full of significant elements cared for thoroughly, it is in charge of each small visual and aural detail, it is in charge of each small sentimental detail. Friendship, nostalgia, pragmatism, temperance, dreaming and fighting are aspirations transmitted from beginning to end, thanks to the detailed atmosphere engendered by Spielberg and his crew.The first collaboration between Walt Disney Pictures and Amblin Entertainment (Spielberg's company) guarantees comfortable and suggestive expectations. Based on the British literature of Roald Dahl, "The BFG" is an adventure reflectively intimate and fascinating. Melissa Mathison ("ET") adapted wonderfully the pages of Dahl creating a trip completely familiar and faithful. Mark Rylance (2016 Oscar Winner for Actor in a Supporting Role for "Bridge of Spies") portrays a marginalized giant who lives with encapsulated dreams and rotten vegetables in a country where equality is under the ground. His signing up was imminent after he won gold at the Oscars Awards, and although, this was a dissimilar character to the of his statuette, the veteran actor interprets it with great lucidity and professionalism that a nomination would not be coincidental the next year. Rylance sustains the film, his unique vocabulary and his aspects captured with CGI costumes adorn and venerate the complexity of the original storytelling, creating an eminent interpretation. Barnhill is beginner in the profession, she did not get the impact of Jacob Tremblay in "Room" film, since she was not the typical girl that asks for everything and conveyed femininity, she is a leader, an orphan who knows distinguish between reality and unreality, nevertheless, she is left to hypnotize by the imaginary fantasies of the tale Dahl.Whatever is the project that Spielberg takes to the big screen will have colossal greediness, Why?. As one of the best directors of the century, Steven Allan Spielberg captivated us with works worthy of carry his name, stories that are changed in classic instant and that have helped to forge the childhood of hundreds of people, who has not seen at least one of his films; this man is a cinematic god , a perpetual director, screenwriter, editor, producer and designer that guarantees monumental successes until the end of his days. For these and thousands of reasons do not leave of surprise us his last invention, which not manages to get that gleaming shine of his golden years, Yes, it is an excellent movie in all the parameters, but with Spielberg the word "excellent" not is impassable.Assiduously, the film takes advantage of his majesty and inventive, Spielberg knows how to handle to the perfection his elements, the dreams tree or the escape of London leverage the splendor visual impregnated by colors, reflections, and lights. The ambitions were excessive and although "The BFG" tried to be "E.T." for the new generations would be Utopian; we are in an age where children are more mature and developed than any adult mind, there are not already girls who believed in fairies or children who wished to have an alien friend, those times have already passed and BFG receives a hard blow with reality. Spielberg demonstrates that still has strength and imagination in his films; "The BFG" survives by its own merits and is not necessary to compare it with a classic, an independent and well developed product that transforms the darkness of the original story for children into an adventure full of dreams, colors and expectations that preserve the hard-work of Rylance and Spielberg, and of course, the debut of Ruby Barnhill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The combination of director Steven Spielberg and author Roald Dahl worked pretty well; their sensibilities tend to be very different, but the story of the book The BFG covers some recurrent themes in Spielberg's filmography: lonely children, misunderstood monsters and friendship as the catalyst of internal growth and universal tolerance. The novel The BFG was published in 1982, but it has that parsimonious cadence of Victorian literature, in which the story was a mere excuse to describe places, persons and details with quite a detail and eloquence. And the screenplay adapted by the late Melissa Mathison keeps itself faithful to the literary source, keeping a sedate rhythm from the beginning to the end. That was an audacious decision... and possibly the cause of this film's economic failure. But it was also one of the main reasons why I ended up liking this film pretty much. The BFG is an antidote against the vacuous and hyper-accelerated childish movies infesting modern culture; with one or two exceptions, the film refrains from introducing action scenes, or bringing an unmeasured "attitude" to the characters, or forcing the presence of pop songs in order to promote the selling of the soundtrack on iTunes. On the opposite, Spielberg and his wonderful cinematographer Janusz Kaminski seem to enjoy the slowness of the narrative, filling the screen with interesting elements and creative frames we can fully appreciate without frantic cuts every two seconds. That description might not be totally correct. The BFG isn't exactly "slow"... the point is that few things happen through almost two hours of running time. But it's not boring either; it's just... relaxed. Once in a while, we reach a key moment of the story, and it seems that things will speed up; but it's not like that. Even during the third act, when the movie makes a twist which takes it to the territory of Apocalypse Now (only the music accompaniment of Flight of the Valkiries was missing), everything is developed with the classic British phlegm, very appropriate in the cultural context of the book, but quite unusual in a modern movie "for kids". And then, we have the excellent performances from the whole cast. Ruby Barnhill feels charismatic and absolutely credible in her role, without ever getting irritating or cloying, while Penelope Wilton, Rebecca Hall and Rafe Spall also make a perfect work in their roles. And Mark Rylance brings a brilliant "virtual performance"; he's very expressive as the Giant, and the digital creation of that character is credible while allowing him to transmit realistic emotions... unlike other films which weren't able to escape the dead look of their animated characters. So, I don't know whether The BFG will be the cup of tea of every child, but I found it a very competent audiovisual complement of the book. I genuinely appreciate the fact that Mathison and Spielberg kept themselves so faithful to the spirit of the novel and its author's intention, and that was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed this movie and I consider it worthy of a recommendation, with the warning that I could perceive some restless and maybe bored kids at the cinema, probably because there wasn't a chase every five minutes, or talkative animals, or pop songs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gamble Which Deserves to Come Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sophie, a young girl from a London orphanage, meets and befriends a BFG. "BFG" is an acronym for "Big Friendly Giant", although this is something of a misnomer. Admittedly, the giant is friendly enough, but at only 24 feet high he is not particularly big by giant standards; most other giants are at least twice his size. Moreover, these other giants are also far from friendly. The main plot line concerns the attempts of Sophie and the BFG, assisted by the Queen and the British Army, to prevent an invasion of Britain by Big Unfriendly Child-Eating Giants.Filming of "The BFG" actually took place in Canada, but the director and co-producer Steven Spielberg keeps Roald Dahl's ostensible British setting, although this is perhaps a Britain which few Brits would recognise. The action seems to take place some time during the late 20th century, but Spielberg's vision of London nevertheless looks strangely Dickensian. This is a world in which the Queen can order the armed forces into action without consulting the Prime Minister or Parliament, although she does obtain the co-operation of the American and Russian leaders. There is a curious anomaly here. The American President is named Ron and has a wife called Nancy, a clear reference to the Reagans. His Russian counterpart is named Boris. The only recent Soviet or Russian leader with this name was Boris Yeltsin, who did not come to power until 1991, two years after Ronald Reagan had left office. Given that the story so obviously takes place in a fantasy world, however, I will not claim this as a goof.The special effects are excellent, as they need to be, as children (at least the older children for whom Dahl was writing) tend to be more picky about such things than adults. A fear that the state of the art in the eighties was not really advanced enough to cope may be part of the reason why we have had to wait so long for a live-action version of the tale. (There was, of course, a cartoon version in 1989). When the possibility of a live-action version was first mooted in the late nineties, the late Robin Williams was slated to take the title role, but he seems to have disappointed the producers who felt that his style of comedy did not fit with the BFG's personality. Congratulations are therefore due to Mark Rylance who takes the part here; to have succeeded in a role which defeated Williams, one of the greatest comic actors of recent years, is no mean feat. The BFG needs to be scary when he first appears, then benevolent but eccentric, and his idiosyncratic use of language needs to sound natural rather than contrived; Rylance succeeds on all these points. Congratulations are also due to Ruby Barnhill, who makes Sophie and adorable young heroine.Dahl's story is not particularly well-known internationally, so it was a brave move on Spielberg's part to turn it into a Hollywood movie, especially one with no major Hollywood stars. (In recent years he seems to have enjoyed taking risks of this sort. Neither "Tintin", based on a series of Belgian comic books little known in the States, nor "War Horse", a First World War story featuring important British, German and French characters, but not a single American one, struck me as being designed to appeal to the American market). In this case the risk does not seem to have paid off, as box-office takings in North America have reportedly been disappointing.It will be a pity if Spielberg's gamble does not come off. Some of Dahl's earlier children's stories, such as "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" or "James and the Giant Peach", were very much part of my own childhood, but "The BFG" did not come out until 1982, by which time I was at university, so I cannot claim to have treasured childhood memories of it. Nevertheless, it is clearly a well-loved children's classic, at least here in Britain, and this attempt to film it is a very decent one. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only one of The Autistic Reviewers will be reviewing this movie, and that will be Jay! I grew up reading almost all of Roald Dahl's books. He always knew how to capture our power of being a child. He had a really unique way of telling a story. I also loved the cartoon version of "The BFG." Steven Spielberg steps into the spotlight...yet again and displays his true talent as a director and captured the magic just as the book did! The acting was really good. Mark Rylance as the BFG couldn't be better. I had a bit of a problem with Ruby Barnhill as Sophie. I didn't really think she was realistic and thought she was over acting and very fake. Every time she was in front of the BFG or other giants her reactions didn't seem to play well with the current situations. I know she's just a kid, and for that I will forgive her...i hope her acting does get better, though.The CGI did its part quite well. The dream scenes were probably the best parts of the movie. There were some scenes that didn't fit very well...such as the BFG just giggling for no reason what so ever. There were times when the movie did lose its cool. This was about half way through. But by the third act, when the BFG meets the Queen it provides us with nonstop laughs and excellent fear of the humans not knowing what the BFG might do! All in all...it is worth seeing. Spielberg did capture the magic and there is no doubt if you grew up reading Roald Dahl's books this might bring back some childhood memories. It's not the best thing to come alive from a story book, but it's so from bad. I'm giving this 7/10. 3/5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may trudge at a slow and dialogue heavy pace, The BFG does stir up some amazing dreams thanks to its effects and main stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do the stories of Charlie &amp; and the Chocolate Factory, James &amp; the Giant Peach, Matilda, The Witches, and The Fantastic Mr. Fox have in common? They were all written by the late Roald Dahl. This children's author specialized in finding magic within a modern world. He understood that children could be just as adult while the adults can be just as childish given the situation. He also understood that the world, no matter how pretty it is, can be a mean place and figured that children can take a lot of scary imagery. Stories like these have made reading fun for kids that wanted to feel like they were just as important as their parents were. Today's movie The BFG is another Roald Dahl adaptation that I'm surprised hasn't been made yet. I remember it being made as an animated movie (that I still recall that we never finished due to a parent complaint of the scary images despite being rated G). If this was going to be given a live action treatment, then I'm glad Steven Spielberg is in charge, as I've wanted him to give family films another try. E.T. and Hook showed that he understood children, so let's see if the magic still there in The BFG. Within a London orphanage, a young girl Sophie (played by Ruby Barnhill). She can't sleep, so she keeps herself busy by reading an occasionally looking out into the night. During one look behind the curtain, she spots a giant. The giant takes her, out of the city, into the countryside, before they end up in another realm called "Giant Country". She's taken inside a cottage where Sophie begs not to be eaten. The giant (played by Mark Rylance) reveals he's a giant that refuses to eat people and in fact introduces himself as the BFG (Big Friendly Giant). Sophie finds that the BFG is responsible for catching dreams in Dream country in order to spread to various people. She also sees the other giants, which make the BFG a runt compared to their fifty-foot height. These other giants are responsible for recent disappearances of other children that have gone missing (and are hinted to have been eaten as well). Sophie decides that the only person that can help is the Queen, so the BFG mixes up elements to hopefully make into a dream that will convince the Queen to help stop the other giants.It's nice to see Spielberg return to making family movies. Is The BFG the right movie for him? I'm a bit mixed on this as he has plenty of things done well and other parts not as well. I'll say that the casting on both the BFG and Sophie are really good. Spielberg has a talent for using children actors well and Ruby Barnhill is just as good as Elliot from E.T. or Christian Bale in Empire of the Sun. Thanks to the magic of motion capture, Mark Rylance brings a lot of life to this giant. Like Gollum in Lord of the Rings, the effects on the giant are really good and will probably last well after future effects overtake it.It's a good thing that both characters are interesting, because this family movie is surprisingly dialogue heavy. Not that it's a bad thing, though I think most kids going in with their parents were expecting something more action orientated. Much of the big action doesn't happen until the last thirty minutes, but the rest is full of the whimsy you'd expect out of a Spielberg family movie. What's lacking is a flowing story, which is one of the few times when a book's context needed more expansion within it's transition to the big screen. Had we gotten more of an insight on the land of the giants and how they get around on the Earth, I'd probably like this more.I'll give this six snozzcumbers out of ten. This is one of Spielberg's weaker movies, though it still remains a good story for kids. I'd say that this is for older children, like at least eight and above. Those under will probably see The BFG as slow and boring. This Roald Dahl story does enough that families will be entertained by this, though whether it has rewatch value will be up to the viewer. I'd say give it a watch and see if this film is a giant in your mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BFG brought to Life at last - amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lord of the Rings was the first - it was the first time technology needed to be good enough to bring a book to life and now its happened again with the BFG. The BFG is a specific piece of literature, written in a particular way - its narration by Dahl is one of a kind and the feeling and message it gives when reading is almost impossible to recreate on film. By SS has done it, in a truly amazing fashion, the BFG is not just an animation but a full blown character right from the book, Sophie is a girl we all know, we also have family or friends with a daughter just like Sophie, just like Dahl did in his grand daughter. My kids, 11, 9, 5 loved it - the peril is enough to keep the plot moving and the laughs full - 2 hours for a kids film is a long time but they all sat enthralled just like when I red them the story at bedtime. Hats off SS this may not go down as your best movie ever but like ET it will go down in history the best of its kind the best rendition of Dahl novel ever and one which can never be bettered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Youth oriented movie guru specialist Steven Spielberg steps back into the fantasy film realm with this enjoyable pic based on Roald Dahl's 1982 children's book. With no previous knowledge of the book, this CGI special effects film is an all around enjoyable experience for all ages. Academy Award Winner Mark Rylance (Bridge of Spies - 2015), adorable little Ruby Barnhill, the cast of mean giants, and one of my new favorite actresses Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey) all do outstanding jobs as they (under Spielberg's guidance) creatively bridge the visual line between humans and CGI enhanced characters. Unfortunately, for a children's movie, the storyline at times slugged along, making me wonder if a child's attention span would sustain through such a movie. While Spielberg calls upon musical score guru himself John Williams (Star Wars) for his score, the continual sweeping musical interludes come off predictable and unnecessary. While some will want to compare this film to anyone of Spielberg's other successful such endeavors, The BFG is a quality fantasy family film that stands on its own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting and stunning visuals that couldn't quite offset the bad pacing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering Mark Rylance great performance in Steven Spielberg's previous production 'Bridge of Spies' it really came as no surprise that we would be seeing more of him in one of Spielberg's films. This time Rylance stars as the BFG, short for Big Friendly Giant, alongside child actress Ruby Barnhill who plays a little girl called Sophie. At the start of the movie Sophie gets kidnapped by this aforementioned giant and what follows is movie where the main focus is the growing friendship between her and the giant.To properly capture the magical world created by Roald Dahl on the big screen Steven Spielberg uses a blend of real life footage and computer generated images. Although we've come a long way with CGI as a whole, the minor differences between images captured from the real world and those generated on a computer were just large enough that they were often times off-putting. Spielberg does do an amazing job to get the amount of times this happens to a minimum however by using certain techniques that make the real life footage seem more like computer generated ones rather than the other way around. That does not mean that the CGI in 'The BFG' was bad though, it's because they were so good that these moments happened. In fact a few times the visuals were so stunning that it could make almost everyone's jaw drop in amazement. That is not to say that the directing was flawless however.Over the course of the movie it becomes quite noticeable that there is a problem with the pacing. Quite a few times this has the effect that scenes which were mesmerizing at first drag on for too long, so long in fact that often times they will have overstayed their welcome. This is especially true for the few action scenes the movie has to offer. The bad pacing also causes the story to fizzle out and what is left is a movie that gets a little bit boring after only half of it's two hour running time.One of the movies redeeming factors however is the amazing acting by the aforementioned actor Mark Rylance who does a really good job at getting the viewer to care about this big and friendly giant. Another great performance is given by Ruby Barnhill who really shines as this little girl Sophie. Although there were a few moments where I think her acting felt a little bit off I am really curious where her career will go next. Together these two actors make the building friendship between their characters seem very believable and they are the reason the viewer will stay engrossed in the movies story.Overall the movie featured some amazing acting with stunning visuals, but sadly there is only so much that can be done to offset the bad pacing.My rating: 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland, Fart-heavy, (but still) Glowing with Spielberg magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking of bottled dreams, try this one: it's 1992. Steven Spielberg's Hook, his Peter Pan passion project, is a smash hit. His follow-up box office darling: an adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's classic The BFG, reuniting him with Hook champion Robin Williams (as the titular giant), and perfectly geared towards the first generation of children to grow up reading the book. The project was a dream. So, naturally, it didn't come true. Fast-forward 14 years, and Spielberg's BFG hits cinemas with a new star (RIP Robin), and a lacklustre audience of kids now likely less versed in Dahl than their iPad. Talk about nightmares And yet, Spielberg's first kid's film since Hook is so warm, earnest, and nostalgic, it's oddly fitting to play as anachronistic. Like its titular behemoth, The BFG is visually awe-inspiring, but clumsy, lumbering, and prone to spouting well-meaning gibberish. Yet, as a vessel for heart - pure, old fashioned, un-cynical, complete with note of lamenting urgency -The BFG is Spielberg to a tee, and it's absolutely worth being swept away to giant country with him. Compared to past cinematic cracks at Dahl, Spielberg is remarkably faithful, with passages and images transposed verbatim from the text. In many cases - the garbmarbled, gobblefunking talklarking of Dahl's giant-speak, for one - the delightful lilt of the novel translates perfectly. However, unfettered whimsy can come at a cost, and the film's pacing and emotional arc suffer heavily for paralleling, rather than adapting, Dahl's novel. The introduction - protagonist Sophie's abduction to giant country from her Dickensian orphanage - is vintage Spielberg: mysterious and magical, ominous and fiendishly exciting. However, after ascertaining that Sophie's captor, BFG, does not intend to gobble her up, the film's middle section lags tremendously, with the wonders of the BFG's workshop scarcely masking the gossamer-thin plot. Like Bridge of Spies, The BFG shows excellent Spielberg work become plodding and snoozy through overindulgent editing, risking losing kids (or adults) to their own dreams, no matter how many pretty lights and scary giants on screen. Even more distressing: seeing the (debatably) greatest living film director taking the wrong notes from Peter Jackson's despicable Hobbit trilogy. Behold: a surplus of silent side characters (the giants, apart from Jemaine Clement's Fleshlumpeater, suffer from indiscernible dwarf syndrome), eschewing character development in favour of overly convoluted, physics-flouting chase sequences. Here, the under-cooked BFG-bullying subplot is boiled down to a vaguely cringe-worthy scene of the 'mean giants' playing chicken, rolling BFG down a mountain towards a giant rollerskating on cars. For, um, some reason. As the film's only real conflict necessitates Sophie inciting BFG to rise up against their murderous cruelty, it would help if Spielberg hadn't drained the majority of their nastiness away on screen - let's not forget that Dahl's novel begins with the BFG pontificating about the tastiest humans, before countering that humans constantly "squishing" each other in war is less justifiable than the giants eating to live. Grim. So, is the film worth it? Unfrozziloutly, yes. Naturally, it's visually sumptuous, with tactful CGI and impressively credible performance capture work. Similarly, a pre-climax visit with the Queen, who unquestioningly lends military support to the giant conflict (ahh, dreams) is so deliciously demented, you can imagine Dahl himself cackling along with an auditorium of children at the dopey farting corgi slapstick. Still, it takes visiting the dreamworld for Spielberg to really remind us all why he's here. The underwater, gravity-inverting dream tree, ensconced in flickering, multicoloured sprites, is mesmerizingly gorgeous, striking up the film's primary motivation of dreams and escapism making the troubles of the world amount to a hill of (human) beans. In one sequence, the BFG's bottled dream is broadcast on the wall - a shadow puppet play through a movie projector. It's as brazen a horn-toot to the value of cinema without a winking Spielberg stepping out from behind a camera, like Martin Scorsese in Hugo. It's an intentionally quaint idea - can't things just be pleasant, full stop? - and you can practically taste the desperation in Spielberg trying to sell it so full throttle here. But in its quieter, simpler, gentler moments, The BFG truly does remind us of what dreams are made of. Newcomer Ruby Barnhill brings a spunky yet vulnerable edge to Sophie, making her inhabitation of the 'precocious orphan girl' archetype particularly endearing. Still, there's no question that it's Mark Rylance's eerily perfect BFG who's the highlight. Infusing his adorable bumbling with a breezy, gruff silliness (his cackling at the rocket-propelled farting-er-'whizzpopping' is what sells the otherwise stale gag) and puppy dog sadness, Rylance is arguably the most fully realized and lovable motion captured character since Gollum. Jemaine Clement brings a perfect cocktail of threat and goofiness to ringleader giant Fleshlumpeater, managing to squeeze every ounce of menace out of "I has a boo-boo," while Penelope Wilton remains delightfully regal amidst the silliest of scenarios as the chummy Queen we'd all love to pretend really heads the Monarchy. Rebecca Hall and Rafe Spall are fun, but largely wasted as the Queen's attendees. Keep your eyes peeled for stellar background work from a cabal of Vancouver actors (shout out to Paul Moniz de Sá as the superbly comically windmilling, top-heavy giant Meatdripper and "Lout #3," and William Samples, master of the affronted double-take, as an incredulous royal footman). Breezy Feel Good; Banal Fluffy Galvani (I *barely* resisted the temptation to write this review entirely in acronyms), Spielberg's penchant for "Only good dreams" may make his BFG somewhat flimsier and more forgettable than anticipated. But that's the thing about giants - there's so much of them to love, and as BFG quips, "I is not right all the time; quite often I is left". So, for a film that encapsulates pleasantness and charm in every sense of the words, Spielberg's BFG is, yes, a dream come true. -7/10</fullReview>

Such a beautiful film, so subtle so warm, humorous, what a wonderful world created. So much heart. It is not about spectacle, action and it is not specifically for children, it is for everybody with a young heart. Who still has a child inside full of wonder and gratitude of being alive. The characters are so beautiful, humorous, the gentle gentle giant. The girl, strong, direct but touched inside by this gentle giant. The visual effects wow so much to see, experience, the scene with chasing the dreams, beautiful beautiful. And can't say enough about this film, how wonderful wonderful this film was for me. Yes me, a man of 53 years old. And my girlfriend about the same age as me shares my opinion. Are we crazy, or is there something wrong with this world? Thank you Steven Spielberg for daring to create such a beautiful fairy tale, true magic of the heart. If you open yourself for it maybe it can touch you, you may feel it. Karel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful, endearing and fun. Very well done!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I can see of other reviews, these are people who either never read or don't remember the book or who never really engaged with the story.This movie is VERY faithful to the original ambiance if not 100% faithful to the original story. But then it really didn't have to be faithful to the original because it is simply tremendous fun! Taking my daughter to the cinema has become a weekly occurrence and I have to admit that - most weeks - I sit through some Disney "inspired" bilge, whilst doing - I think - a passable job of pretending to enjoy it for my daughters sake; Daddy daughter time - though not in short supply - is precious time after all! However in this case, we were both thoroughly engaged and delighted with the movie and have vowed to purchase the DVD when it becomes available on Skys buy and keep service.The special effects were not overdone, the casting faultless. The soundtrack and adaptations were absolutely spot on.But best of all...the BFG is PRECISELY as imagined from the book I read as a child and now my daughter gets to experience him in all his clumsy, goofy, friendly glory! If you have kids, see this movie now. And if you don't, go see it anyway: it'll bring out the big kid in you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you have trouble sleeping, go and see the BFG !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of Steven Spielberg's cinema. I think I actually saw all of his movies; so I had no other choice than to drive half an hour to the movie theater to see 'The BFG'. Although I must admit that I read pretty average reviews. I had hoped that the movie would be slightly better than what I read. But it's not, it's worse ! I can't image that Spielberg directed that movie. He must have left it to a team of assistants. The big issue is the adaptation of the original book. Any film is supposed to go beyond the original story and provide something new. Sophie's character is bland and dull; something must have gone wrong in the casting. The Giant is neither friendly or unfriendly, always talks like he's coming out of a London pub. Everything is completely flat; no thrilling situations, no real plot, no interesting characters, no emotions. As far as the cinematography is concerned, this is all pretty ugly. I wonder what someone like Tim Burton could have made of this. In today's world of formulaic and cliché B-movies, we surely don't need a dull Spielberg movie. Let's hope he gets more inspired next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful children's story, but honestly, not the best Spielberg movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to nit pic (Well not really), but the BFG was barely on my radar before the film came out. It seemed kind of weird for a movie directed by the great Steven Spielberg, especially a magical adventure for kids of all ages like this one.Based on a children's book by the same guy who wrote the book Willy Wonka was adapted from, comes the story of a ten year old girl who goes on a fantastic adventure after she befriends a big friendly giant.As far as the children fantasy goes it's a great story about two of the most unlikely people becoming best friends forever. The BFG has the perfect tone to put you into a child-like mood while you're watching the picture. The visual effects were great, absolutely well done when it comes to creating the world of the giants and making the BFG himself someone that can be related too rather than just a bland CGI character.But it's no ET. As far as Spielberg movies go, I've seen him do better in the subject of children's fantasy. The adventure does not flow as gracefully as it should, which causes it to feel really long at times. Maybe trying to be fateful to the book cause the dull pace in parts.But The little girl who they got to play the main character was cute and charming, and the semi-CGI BFG has more personality than most on screen digital images. It was very humorous with a humor appropriate for all ages and quite a lovely story. Overall, it's a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Closer to Hook than E.T.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the highly adored Spielberg classic E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), the protagonist Elliot lures the titular E.T. into his home using M&amp;Ms. E.T. fumbles about the boy's room; they exchange glances, they mimic each other's movements, they greet each other. The BFG is an attempt to sustain the same sense of wonder Elliot feels when first meeting E.T. only this time replace Elliot with a precocious little girl named Sophie (Barnhill). It's a sense of wonder that courses through the film like the lucid flickers of a waking dream; it's majestic, it's magical and its unabashedly sentimental. Unfortunately, like waking up from a dream, a sudden stumble can really ruin the experience. A tossing turn can end a dream with an unceremonious thud which regretfully happens in The BFG.The film takes no time in introducing its audience to Sophie and BFG (Big Friendly Giant) played by Mark Rylance in all his motion capture glory. Sophie is whisked away from the orphanage she tolerates to Giant Country where BFG is but the small and abused runt of a litter of giants with names like Bloodbottler (Hader) and Bonecruncher (Bacon). The largest and meanest of them all is Fleshlumpeater (Clement) who is partial to eating children. After avoiding the keen noses of the nine cannibalistic giants, Sophie follows BFG to dream country where the lonely giant bottles dreams and shares them with the sleeping children of the world.The BFG is based on a children's book of the same name written by Roald Dahl. The film remains highly faithful to the book almost to a fault. It takes a while to really get into the world of The BFG partially because of a near constant injection of whimsy. Thus for the first half-hour we must be guided by a sea of linguistic context clues and Sophie's stubborn pluck. Seriously, these giants sound like Eliza Doolittle had a run-in with Alex and his droogs.Yet eventually like a seedling, the film grows on you. It replaces its moments of caprice and forced mawkishness with real sentiment. It's coaxed largely by the growing relationship between the child and the giant, one of which has surprising cleverness while the other has a folksy simplicity about him. It is moments like the ones in dream country that are not only a feast for the eyes but provide the very best narrative charge to elevate the art of film itself.The beauty of The BFG and director Steven Spielberg's entire oeuvre is his ability to world-build. Spielberg doesn't just give you the tour, he envelopes you into a fiction you can almost touch. It certainly helps that he lets his actors interact as much as possible with the intricate details and adorning accouterments. A lesser director would have cut corners, making and updated version of The Devil-Doll (1936) but not Spielberg. Every hoist of the giant's hand, every impish step and every jump into a snozzcumber gives a tactility. A tactility that legitimizes the giant's home, dream country et al. as more than just a studio set.The film then once again devolves into a cluster of technically impressive but hollow set pieces, syrupy "stand up for yourself" clichés and a third act that gives the phrase deus ex machina a queenly quality. The sustained wonder dissipates under the weight of some unnecessary world mixing. I realize most large events in the film are also in the book but surely we could have gotten the giant eating tiny pieces of toast through some other means. Also by this point, a long percolating joke slides to its punchline just long enough to make the kiddos laugh and grandma get the vapors.Though it's all for the sake of the children and while I've been a long proponent for improving the state of children's films, The BFG is ultimately far from rubbish. It's certainly no E.T. but the tactile and seamless world-building brings to mind Hook (1991) which wasn't perfect but does still leave a nostalgic residue. The BFG will undoubtedly leave a similar impression of young children who watch it and with a message of hope, acceptance and friendship it's certainly more tolerable than The Care Bears Movie (1985).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think Roald Dahl would have approved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I developed a personal connection to Roald Dahl's stories when I was very young. His tales of ordinary or isolated people put into extraordinary circumstances still has an appeal to me now as an adult. So I was looking forward to seeing the master of fantasy films, Steven Spielberg, take on a cinema adaptation of Dahl's classic children's story, The BFG.The BFG is a big friendly giant from the fictional 'Giant Country' who catches and delivers dreams to the children of Britain in their sleep. It's a magical concept that lends itself well to cinema. The BFG himself is a simple yet lovable character with an appropriately warm and inviting West Country accent (an accent I'm very familiar with living in that part of England). The character has been recreated masterfully with state-of-the-art CGI that captures every subtle emotion on the giant's face beautifully. Mark Rylance's performance captures the BFG's likable vulnerability well. This works particularly well when juxtaposed with newcomer Ruby Barnhill's tough and feisty interpretation of Sophie, an young girl kidnapped by the BFG after seeing his secret dream work in the act. A classic Disney fundamental can be spotted in Sophie's set up as lonely orphan from Central London. The character, based on Dahl's own daughter, bounces really well off the bumbling BFG's sweet sensibility.Spielberg's technical skills as a director shine here. Stunning long takes, engaging camera-work and neat storytelling really bring the fantastical tale to life. However, the story that follows Sophie's kidnapping doesn't follow a typical Hollywood structure and lacks substance. Our hero's antagonists, child-eating Giants, lack depth and their motives are unclear. Some minor tweaks to the source material do well to dial up the emotion and lead character development but the silly and nonsensical story involving a rescue mission brought about by the Queen of England struggles to let the audience into its world. I feel that the film lacks the layers that many classic fantasy films (such as E.T., Beauty and the Beast or Edward Scissorhands) have to appeal to adults as much as young children. Similarly, the sense of humour in the film could be perceived as quite childish with an emphasis on toilet humour. The children in the cinema were laughing out loud at the more low brow moments but the same couldn't be said for me or the other adults in the auditorium. There are some emotionally and visually beautiful moments that get lost amongst the silly sense of humour which I believe will limit the films lasting appeal.Roald Dahl was notorious for disliking movie adaptations of his work but I genuinely believe he would have approved of this mostly faithful interpretation. I don't think this film will go down as a classic that will be remembered in years to come but it's light, visually entertaining and mostly fun to watch, especially if you have children to watch with you who will probably enjoy the movie more than you will.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The BFG" is a delightful and imaginative family film which is a worthy successor to director Steven Spielberg's "E.T.".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the talent that comes together for a certain movie is simply incredible. Take the family fantasy adventure "The BFG" (PG, 1:57) for example. The film co-stars 2015 Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner Mark Rylance (in the title role) and Ruby Barnhill who, much like Neel Sethi in 2016's "The Jungle Book", as a child, had to carry much of the film ? and is perfect for the role. Co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, "The BFG" has Spielberg directing his first film for Disney. And one of America's greatest directors has involved much of his dream team of filmmakers in this project. That list, according to IMDb.com, includes "two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer / director of photography (DOP) Janusz Kaminski; two-time Oscar-winning production designer Rick Carter; three time Oscar-winning editor Michael Kahn, ACE; Oscar-nominated costume designer Joanna Johnston, and legendary five-time Oscar winning composer John Williams", as well as the late screenwriter Melissa Mathison, who had previously written Spielberg's classic family film "E.T. the Extra-terrestrial". With "The BFG", Mathison (who died of cancer towards the end of production) was adapting the book of the same title by British novelist Roald Dahl, who also wrote "James and the Giant Peach", "Matilda", "Fantastic Mr. Fox" ? and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"! Mind. Blown. A cinematic pedigree like that begs the question of whether the first live-action adaptation of "The BFG" is worthy of all the talent that went into bringing it to the big screen. The answer, in a word, is yes.Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) is a 10-year-old living in a London orphanage. One night, she hears something outside her window and takes a look outside. She sees something that she wasn't supposed to see ? a real-life giant (Mark Rylance in a motion-capture performance). Not wanting his existence revealed, the giant grabs Sophie and spirits her away to his house in Giant Country far to the north. This spunky and resourceful little girl tries to get away, but the giant doesn't let her ? for his safety and for hers. The irony is that, in Giant Country, this giant is actually a runt, and is referred to as such by his fellow giants. He's 24-feet-tall, but there are nine of THEM living nearby who are at least twice his size and who use their height and strength advantage to harass him and take from him anything he has that they want.At this point, what the other giants want is Sophie. Most giants, including these nine, do eat children (according to the reputation of giants), but not the one who refers to himself as "The Big Friendly Giant", and whom Sophie takes to simply calling "BFG". As BFG hides and protects Sophie from the others and as he and Sophie bond over their mutual feelings of being put-upon out-casts, Sophie and the BFG become BFFs. The BFG even involves Sophie in his work, which involves capturing, bottling and even mixing and manipulating dreams. He uses his talents for good, trying to bring joy to the lives of children around England (which is what he was doing when Sophie first spotted him), but he can also use his expertise to disseminate bad dreams and manipulate people (ala Leo and company in "Inception").Sophie comes up with an idea to end the threats posed by the other giants ? the threat to the BFG, as well as the threat to herself and to all the other children whom these oversized meat-eaters pursue. Sophie wants to go back into London and take the problem to the queen herself (Penelope Wilton from "Downton Abbey"). For Sophie's plan to work, the BFG is going to have to use all of his abilities and literally step out of the shadows. Even if all that works out, this unlikely pair is going to have to convince the queen and her aide (Rebecca Hall) and an overly cautious head of security (Rafe Spall) that all this is for real ? then come up with a way to neutralize nine huge giants. All that amounts to a very tall order."The BFG" is a delightful and imaginative family film which is a worthy successor to Spielberg's "E.T.". Featuring a friendship as unlikely as that boy named Elliot and a certain short, wrinkly alien with a heart of gold, this film is similarly touching, but not quite as emotionally engaging. What it may lack in emotional resonance, however, it makes up for in charm and terrific visuals. Some of the scenes are simply beautiful and are enhanced by 3D glasses, but the best reason to watch this film in 3D is the realism it lends to its settings and its CG characters. The script feels a bit contrived and disjointed in parts, but overall, it's well worth getting to know "The BFG". "B+"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a heartwarming and thoughtful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firsty, i am very surprised by the negative comments about the film being 'boring'. The BFG is a childhood classic loved by millions of British kids (and adults alike), but I did fear that audiences unfamiliar with growing up with Roald Dahl may not have the same reaction to the film. The film was engaging from start to finish, and did the book justice. The BFG was written for Dahl's granddaughter, Sophie. It told the tale of a peace-loving, outcast giant from the North who stumbled over his words and wanted to bring joy to the world instead of stealing and eating its innocence. Dahl, a giant of a man in real life at a whopping 6'6 was of Norwegian decent, dyslexic and after seeing the horrors of WWII, an advocate of peace. Dahl is The BFG! and the book/film is his story for Sophie.This is a subtle film, which creeps upon you; dealing with the issues of loneliness, mental health and being different. Sophie, a young orphan with insomnia is plucked from her bed by what she thinks is a monster - by all accounts he should be - but he is a vegetarian, almost Buddhist like giant living amongst bloodthirsty cannibal giants who enjoy eating little children. Sophie is catapulted into a world beyond her imagination, where her BFG is catching dreams to deliver to those sleeping back in the land of the beings. Mark Rylance is a joy to watch as the BFG. Yes, it could have been darker, but i liked the way Spielberg has concentrated his efforts on creating a dreamlike, fun world that is lighthearted and true to the world Roald Dahl created through his writing.</fullReview>

There's a good score by John Williams and noteworthy cinematography by Janusz Kaminski.The movie may be too intense for smaller children, but it will be enjoyed by older kids and adults.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The BFG is directed by Stephen Spielberg and is based on Roald Dahl's children's book of the same name. In this fantasy tale, a little Orphan girl named Sophie who has insomnia is taken out of her room after she sees a giant (Mark Rylance). In this world giants come and gobble up Orphan children, so naturally, it's a scary moment. But Sophie quickly realizes she's with the only nice giant in all the land, the Big Friendly Giant. This giant is small for his kind, only eats a gross, stinky vegetable, and brings dreams to the children of the world. Sophie and the BFG must work together to keep her safe, and stop the giants from terrorizing children anymore. Let's start with the positives. There has never been a more faithful and loving adaptation of a Roald Dahl novel. Each scene seemed to leap from the mind of the innocent children's writer himself. The whole movie has an air of magic that only Stephen Spielberg himself could've brought. I can't see anyone else directing this and doing it so well in that sense. However there are some negatives. The acting in this film is honestly mediocre at best. Mark Rylance tried his best but the acting from Ruby Barnhill just wasn't convincing at all. I understand she's young and this is her first acting experience. And she basically had to talk to nothing there most of the movie. So I get what happened, but still. Gotta be honest. Plus the rest of the cast seems to phone it in. And the animation is dreadful. The mocap on this scale, especially when you have real actors, was not a smart choice. The world felt fake. I appreciate the amount of work put into making him look a little odd and just like the books, but in this case, prosthetics on a real person might have better done the job. I was happy to have such a faithful adaptation of one of my favorite children's writer's books. The world was full of magic and whimsy. There were definitely some areas that needed improvement. I'm giving The BFG a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFG is a fantasy movie directed by the great Steven Spielberg based on the Roald Dahl's book with the same name. The movie stars Mark Rylance as the titular character, Jemaine Clement, Rebeca Hall, Bill Hader and also introduces the young Ruby Barnhill.The movie tells the story of a young girl living in an orphanage, who, during one night, sees a giant and gets taken by him in Giant Country. Mark Rylance performs the so-called giant via motion- capture, bringing much heart and depth to the role, revealing himself to be a, well? Big Friendly Giant. It's great too see Rylance work with Spielberg again, after they collaborated in Bridge of Spies (a role that brought Rylance the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). The young actress playing Sophie, the girl who gets taken by the giant, Ruby Barnhill, is wonderful in her role and shows lot of promise, although sometimes her performance seems to be more aimed at stage theater rather than the movie screen. Her acting is not bad by any stretch of the imagination however, she is only twelve and in her first major picture role she's directed by Steven Spielberg. All things considered, she does a fine job.As soon as Sophie enters the Giant Country, she will see that not all giants all friendly, in fact some of them even want to eat children. The villainous giants are played wonderfully by Jemaine Clement and Bill Hader.With this movie, Spielberg goes back to his more kid-friendly type movies, like E.T., Hook or The Adventures of Tintin, and even though this movie is lovely and will be perfect for children, I feel like the story is not engaging enough at times. Also, and I might be a little too picky, but the CGI doesn't work that well. There are some scenes in which the giant holds Sophie and the special effects are really obvious. Sure, the children in the theater won't notice, but for Steven Spielberg it will get a little distracting. The movie has humour, adventure and a batch of lovely characters, but the sometimes dull plot elements and the distracting special effects won't make this the best Spielberg movie. It's not a bad movie and you should not skip it, but lower your expectations a tiny bit. I give The BFG a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG: impressions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Occasional fairy tale movie always interests me and this one wasn't an exception. Artful and almost-photorealistic trailer indeed called for attention and the movie itself wasn't disappointing. Visually and atmospherically movie completes its magical mission with ease. What concerns me more is that world of this movie seems cramped inside BFG's (Who said Doom?) wood-and-rock hut. It has an intricate interior with all these beautiful wispy dreams in the cans, ingenious mechanisms and slight cozy chaos. But it is almost all the space that we're getting for this 2-hour flick besides few scenes in London and outside the hut. Event-wise The BFG feels accordingly. It almost totally consists of dialogues between Sophie and her giant friend, who are indeed deliver great job acting. Especially impressive looks Rylance's job. Facial and voice skillfulness of this year's Oscar winner is pretty impressive. Young British actress that plays impossibly restrained and educate orphan Sophie does good enough as well. But it is not enough to be a great movie.The movie starts to feel sleepy so I started to loose my attention somewhere after the middle. There is simply not enough adventure. As soon as I've adjusted to interesting fantasy of this world I started to feel slightly bored. There is not enough tension here and the biggest threat to our heroes is almost not stressful at all. It somewhat delivers pleasure from it's humorous endeavors, but these efforts are pretty limited. Enough to say that big place on the 'humor' shelf here takes a fart joke (that **spoiler alert** involves Queen of England). Most of enjoyable fun goes from cuteness of the pair of the main characters. I'd like to say that screenplay feels decent, dialogue is solid and smart enough especially for a kids movie. But main plot seems limited enough with a taste of absurdity near the end. The magic of fantastic giant-land fades with real world invasion into it. The ending seems unfulfilling in this circumstances. And why did they use 40s London (or it was just my imagination) and then jumped to modern days anyway? For me it was not bad, but not good enough movie. 7 is a good rank for it. I would compare it with Jungle Book, which wins by all means here. It was more fun, more dynamic, more graphically appealing and not a bit boring. But The BFG is still a decent enough family/kids movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as E.T. but still a great treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At this point, I'm about as sick and tired of people throwing shade Spielberg simply by the fact that he never made the next E.T. "What happened to Spielberg?!" on one side, "He's gone soft!" on the other. It's annoying, mostly because Spielberg, arguably the most influential of geek filmmakers, is doing just fine! But all these constant articles keep telling me that he's in the "washed-out" phase like he's freaking Metallica when all I can think of this argument is "well, what do you think? He can't make Jurassic Park all the damn time!" And besides, since this is the same guy who made Close Encounters, Indiana Jones, Jaws, Schindler's List, Lincoln, and Minority Report, and pretty much shaped the blockbuster landscape decades ago, I believe he has all the rights in the world to put out at least one middlebrow film like this for a change!All that venting aside, calling The BFG "middlebrow Spielberg" isn't so much a criticism as much as it is a reminder that whatever this movie achieves may not bode well for those that either want more or less of it. In this case, the film strips most of Roald Dahl's classic tale into a lean and child-friendly adventure flick that lacks the complexities and or many adult undercurrents like his last films. But even as minor of an effort from the master of whimsy, the film is still a delightful, gorgeous, if a bit flawed, film that achieves much of what it wants to be to some extent. One of the said achievements is the major cog in this machine: Mark Rylance's facial motion capture of The BFG himself. Even though a lot would dismiss this type of animation as some type of "uncanny valley" gimmick, I believe it's used quite well, mostly due to the physical actor involved. Credit is due to the little girl playing Sophie (who is just adorable!) Rylance, in particular, breathes life into this character, while the filmmakers walk a fine line between too realistic and too cartoonish without tipping on either side. Speaking of the CG, this is one of those films that breaks free of Spielberg's real-life limitations and just swoops the camera wherever it wants, issuing a new standard for CG photography. Say what you want about Spielberg, even most of his shortcomings are about as good as this.That isn't to discredit what's not working, though. For all the downtime the film offers to grow the friendship between the Giant and Sophie, it also has too much going on in the second act that it almost loses itself from the plot. And not to disrespect the late Melissa Mathison, but it's not particularly her best-written effort, as it does skew too much for kids. Not that it's a bad thing to be exclusively child-accessible, but I could use a little more appeal to my taste. That being said, I enjoy the banter between the BFG and Sophie dealing with the giants broken language, as it is quite a cheer to listen to. Speaking about children, even though I don't mind the details of explosive farts as it was in the books, I doubt people would find it appealing. Even those minor issues aside, this goes to show how much even the slightest of a genius' efforts can still turn out better than anyone else. There is no denying the disappointed faces of those that expect the next E.T., but I believe that we can still appreciate the same level of heart and wonder that remains. Overall, recommended.For more reviews, check out my blog! https://itachisan125.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg In Giant Country</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In terms of writing children's books, Roald Dahl has to be among the most unconventional. Instead of necessarily being safe-and-sane reading material for the younger set, his books such as "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory", "Charlie And The Great Glass Elevator", and "James And The Giant Peach" frequently evince a wicked sense of humor. And yet they have found their way into being essential reading material in libraries and for kids, subsequently becoming big-screen adventures, much like Tolkien's "Lord Of The Rings" series and J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" books. This also turned out to be the case for his 1982 book The BFG (standing for Big Friendly Giant), although it would take extreme advances in animation into the digital age over a three and a half decade span to get there. Fortunately, it got made, and it ended up in the hands of Steven Spielberg.In this film, Ruby Barnhill portrays Sophie, a young girl with a vivid imagination but left in a London orphanage who one night is whisked away to "Giant Country" by the Big Friendly Giant of the title, voiced by Mark Rylance (who had won a Best Supporting Oscar in 2015 for his role as KGB spy Rudolf Abel in Spielberg's Cold War drama BRIDGE OF SPIES). Barnhill is openly frightened of Rylance's slightly uncouth and menacing behavior, but she soon comes to see that Rylance himself is at the mercy of the other giants in Giant Country (voiced by Bill Hader, Jemaine Clement, and others) who are not only very mean and menacing, but who are also on the scent for any human intervention, and consider Rylance a disgrace to their kind. Rylance, talking with a vaguely Cockney accent and with a penchant for some off-color humor, sees a great deal of goodness in himself because of Barnhill's presence in his world. In the end, knowing that the evil giants plan to do Rylance extreme bodily harm, Barnhill conjures up a dream with Rylance's help to get the help of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria (Penelope Wilton) and the whole of the British military to exile the giants. Of course, the 24 foot-tall Rylance's initial appearance in the Real World, as opposed to Giant Country, is jarring to Wilton and her royal military.Spielberg, at least up until SCHINDLER"S LIST, and with a few stories beyond that 1993 Holocaust epic, was known for, among other things, placing children in extraordinary situations. The best example of that was, of course, with his 1982 sci-fi masterpiece E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, which, like THE BFG, was also scripted by Melissa Mathison, and which also featured a plethora of special effects. In terms of THE BFG, it was a story that had pretty much fascinated him from the time of the book's 1982 publication; but his interest in it accelerated when he became a father in the late 1980s. All the same, however, it took another twenty-five years for his vision of what THE BFG could be to become a reality, because he had become more involved in works that were either darker in tone or dealt with serious historical material (MUNICH; LINCOLN; BRIDGE OF SPIES). And the most ironic thing, given how the films he directed with children in prominent roles earned him comparisons with Walt Disney, is that he managed to make THE BFG for the Disney studio itself. But he also needed to make the mix between live-action and digital animation, something that he had only tried a handful of times before, work convincingly and seamlessly.Fortunately, he had found this in allowing Rylance to essay the role of BFG; and though a fairly obvious mix of the two styles, the mix of animation and live action works with another solid performance from Rylance. Barnhill also gives one of the best performances by a child actor in Spielberg's canon, right up there with Henry Thomas' in E.T., Haley Joel Osment in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, and Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards in JURASSIC PARK.The film, which is dedicated to Mathison (who passed away in 2015), also features the return of John Williams to the Spielberg film-scoring fold after turning over the reins to Thomas Newman on BRIDGE OF SPIES. Though some of the "humor" in THE BFG is not necessarily for all kids, this doesn't mean it's a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it is a really solid film by every stretch of the imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming slow tale but likely too erudite for the masses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My 10 year old had a wonderful time watching and noted that this was a LOT better than Finding Dory which is in theaters also at this time. This is a slow and charming tale for those kids that are not too spoiled by fast paced and/or action orientated movies. It also has no love undertones, no violence, no bad language which is a rare happening in movies so in that sense I find it is the ideal movie for a kid.So how about older kids? This movie is not a comedy by any means but it has lots of subtle humor, wit, and at times attempts at action comedy. Enough to entertain the little ones and adults who like this type of humor. It also has a lot of heart. The story is at time too naive and a little choppy for older movie critics but still worth watching. The animation is magnificent and in and of itself makes the movie worth watching. For the word lovers, this movie has a giant that scrambles his words, adds or substitutes syllables which will keep you guessing as to what the words are. The scrambling is amusing and reminiscent of the French writer Pef and the Motored style books.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The BFG" contains plenty of visual magic, but very little movie magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While living at an oppressive orphanage, young insomniac Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) wanders the halls during the witching hour, pondering the whereabouts of the numerous missing children that seem to vanish in the night. When she spies a tall, lanky giant roaming the streets ? and it notices her back ? she's nabbed by the lumbering beast and whisked away to "giant country," a far off place whose residents exhibit epic proportions. Soon discovering that her captor, the BFG (Mark Rylance), is actually a gentle, vegetarian behemoth, unlike the nine other gargantuan man-eaters that inhabit the countryside, she quickly befriends the aurally proficient colossus. Learning of the BFG's mystical profession, and his troubles with his bullying brethren, Sophie sets about devising a plan to rid the land of the nine brutish monstrosities.If witches, wizards, dragons, and orcs are part of high fantasy, then the bumbling giants of "The BFG" are surely low fantasy. And they're made much worse by the insufferably precocious little girl at the center of the tale, afraid of nothing and blissfully ignorant (and impervious) to injury, even when facing the kind of certain doom that inexplicably evades the human characters in "The Avengers." Just because Steven Spielberg's latest venture is clearly aimed at young children, particularly with the basis on Roald Dahl's much-loved book, it doesn't mean he can ignore intelligent entertainment value. Plenty of other juvenile fare has transcended its target audience to enthrall maturer crowds.But here, there's very little on offer for older viewers. When reference is finally made to a previous child who endured the same kidnapping (or rescue, depending on the perspective), the film generates a welcome sense of gravity, emotion, a deeper connection, and the foundation of a powerful friendship - but this all takes place an hour into the picture. Before that, the whimsical adventures are of the airy, CG-heavy kind, substituting genuine mysticism with darting lights, bright colors, plenty of fog, and cavernous environments. The set designs are indeed grand, as are the special effects surrounding the giants (each of the evil juggernauts are better conceptualized than the big, friendly one), but such diversions no longer set a project apart; every other blockbuster out there excels at visual trickery. It's not enough to overcome an unoriginal "The Wizard of Oz" vibe between the real world and the fantasy realm, or the ungraspable fairy-like qualities of living dreams, or the dream-blowing insemination that resembles something out of "Minority Report" or "Slither.""The BFG" contains plenty of visual magic, but very little movie magic. It's especially odd that when a completely fantasy-based predicament arises, the solution is largely grounded in reality, going so far as to use military equipment against the unconvincing physics of oversized bullies. It's as if "Jack the Giant Slayer" was toned down for kids (basically removing the action yet leaving the immature gags about bodily excretions and flatus), but mixed with the artificially adorable illiteracy of the BFG's verbiage - or a family-friendly take on the brilliantly slangy language from "A Clockwork Orange." At least the manufacturing of dreams is an amusing idea, though the movie carries on far too long (it's ironic that Dahl's writing was crafted with the intention of combating short attention spans), with a feasting scene in particular that grinds to an unbearable crawl. The material is familiar territory for Spielberg ("E.T. the Extra Terrestrial," "Hook," and even "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" all deal with fish-out-of-water fairy tales), but that doesn't mean he should continue tackling properties with which he's comfortable. Perhaps this kind of story has been adapted and seen too many times before, but Spielberg's vision here is uncharacteristically tiresome and uninspiring.- The Massie Twins</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feast for your eyes to see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you that don't know in the late 70s or 80s(I think if I am correct)there was an animated version of The BFG starring Only Fools &amp; Horses Star David Jason,fast forward a good decades later and Hook director Steven Spielberg is back doing more family movies and directed this remake of the animated film based on Roald Dahl. The BFG is about a 10 year old girl called Sophie who lives in an orphanage in England. One night she sees a mysterious shadow figure and the mysterious fellow kidnaps Sophie and brings her to his home. Turns out this mysterious fellow is no other than the BFG(voiced by Mark Rylance)a dream catching giant who finds dreams both good and bad from people and he of course befriends Sophie. But some not so very nice giants are after the BFG and Sophie and the BFG tries to protect Sophie from getting caught. So will Sophie get a family in the end or will she stay with the BFG?Bottom line this is a very well made film. It did however take me a while to get into it all but the visuals and the cinematography blew me away. I liked the design of the BFG(Big Friendly Giant the BFG stands for btw)as it felt so real looking(the same animation they used for Jim Carrey in Disney's A Christmas Carol back in 2009)which used photo realistic imagery. The cast was very good I liked the girl that played Sophie(this was Ruby's first movie debut)and I thought the film overall was very good.My only downfall with this film is that there is some scary moments that involve these big mean giants and this may frighten younger children so beware of letting 5 or less than 5 year olds to see this film. If the child is 9 over then there should be no problems with you bringing your kids along. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bright and fluffy, not much substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall: (Note: I have not read the book. Thus I am reviewing this as a film, rather than as a comparison to the book) The BFG is a meandering film that does not seem to really want to tell a structured story. Sophie is an underwritten character, who is whisked away to Giant Country before we even get to really know her, while the BFG doesn't really have a motivation and is given half of an arc. The pacing of the story drags in the middle, while it introduces an undeveloped and non-threatening conflict towards the climax. However, Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill give two stellar performances that ground the movie with a satisfying emotional core. While it is held back by some wonky special effects that don't jibe as neatly as they could and questionable storytelling choices, the BFG is a sweet and genuine movie that accomplishes what it sets out to do. Ultimately, it's a film that reminds what made me fall in love with movies as a child, even if through adult eyes I can find it somewhat lacking.7/10Detailed Review:Story/Script: The biggest fault here is the lack of a structured approach to the plot of the film. The characters don't have clear motivations or histories and the ultimate conflict does not feel threatening. While the action does get going quickly, the second act just meanders while the third act doesn't feel like there is much that needs to be resolved. At times, it feels like it is forcing itself upon you, trying to get you to feel the wonderment and whimsy that you would as a child without letting it happen organically. Yet, when the story relaxes and lets the characters tell the story, you do feel what it is trying at times to force upon you. There are genuine moments of wonder and whimsy, but that is quickly lost when it tries to force you to feel it. It feels like a child is telling this story, breathlessly going from point to point. But, the film is ultimately saved by the central performances and some deft design choices. -1Characterization: It's hard to separate the lack of characterization with the well delivered performances. Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhall really place the film on a solid footing; the ability of these two actors to evoke the sense of friendship and camaraderie helps the film find its emotional center, which gives the audience a buy in point. When you get to the end of the movie, you have a genuine feeling of contentment for these two characters that doesn't come from the story or ordeal they've been through. Rather, it feels like these are two real characters that have formed a real friendship. And that is beautiful on in itself. +2Design: Bluntly put, the design of this movie really breathes life into the proceedings and gives the two leads an amazing backdrop to work off of. Little touches, such as a ship that is a bed in water or a tea tray made from a highway road sign, help make this fantastical world feel grounded. However, it does suffer from jarring "uncanny valley" moments, especially in the beginning. The green screen effects don't always seamlessly work together, which does throw the movie a bit and at times the sense of scale doesn't always quite evoke the emotion it's hoping for. Technically, there isn't anything here we haven't seen before, but the thought and artistry behind it is stunning. -1 Sound/Music: The Foley track helps support the visuals, where they are not over the top but help accentuate the action. Competently done. The music felt distracting, a John William's score without John William's ability to subtly use leit motifs. Once again, the score seemed to try and force a sense of wonder and whimsy but just couldn't just quite get there. Unfortunately, probably some the weakest parts in the movie. -2Miscellaneous: A movie like this is hard to review. I look for various things in films, such as character motivation, solid three act structure, consistent pacing, etc. This film lacked a lot of that. Yet, this isn't the point of this movie. It's a film made for families, and for that, it works exceedingly well. My critiques are nitpicky, because I still felt something at the end of the story and that's what matters. It's a film that reminds what made me fall in love with movies in the beginning, even if through adult eyes I can find it somewhat lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Spielberg, but not quite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'THE BFG': Four Stars (Out of Five)Director Steven Spielberg's new fantasy adventure flick, based on the classic 1982 children's book (of the same name) by Roald Dahl. It tells the story of a young orphan girl, that befriends a 'big friendly giant'. The two team up, on an adventure in 'Giant Country', to stop other giants from eating human children. The film reteams Spielberg with actor Mark Rylance (who won an Oscar for Spielberg's last film, 'BRIDGE OF SPIES'), and screenwriter Melissa Mathison (who also wrote 'E.T.', and a segment of 'TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE'; which Spielberg also directed). Rylance plays the title character; and the movie also costars Ruby Barnhill, Jemaine Clement, Penelope Wilton, Rebecca Hall, Rafe Spall and Bill Hader. The film was a bomb at the Box Office, but it got decent reviews from critics. I enjoyed it as well.Sophie (Barnhill) is a ten-year-old girl, that lives (unhappily) in a London orphanage. One night she witnesses a 24-foot elderly giant (Rylance) outside her window. The giant notices the girl has seen him, and he snatches her up (kidnapping her). He then takes Sophie to 'Giant Country', where the gentle giant is an outcast among other (meaner) giants. The two later start a friendship, and an adventure together. The movie is almost classic Spielberg, but not quite. It's definitely not in the same league as 'E.T.' (or 'TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE'). I did enjoy the film though, and it does feel like the type of movie I would have really liked as a kid. If I remember correctly, it also does decent justice to the classic source material; and it's somewhat nostalgic seeing that story depicted on screen again. The visuals are also stunningly beautiful to watch. I definitely wouldn't say it's a disappointment.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BFG: Exactly What the Title Promises.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that centres exactly on what the title says: a Big Friendly Giant.The strength of this movie lies in this simplicity. By maintaining the focus primarily on the relationship of BFG (Mark Rylance) with the other main character Sophie (Ruby Barnhill), the side characters and the antagonists, you get a very solid and somewhat focused film, and the character interactions, especially the dynamic between BFG and Sophie was the strongest yet so far in this year's family film fair, which is particularly impressive when you consider the fact that Barnhill is interacting with a green screen figment of digital animation imagination.Kudos goes to the voice acting of Rylance who really brought this character to life and was the perfect choice for BFG with his Shakespearean theatrical chops shining thorough especially well here.The computer animation (through motion capture) done on BFG and the other giants was particularly good. He looked younger in the face then his cover art from the Dahl book and his depiction in the 1989 animated version, but it oddly works here when combined with the balding greyness as it somewhat helps pull across that sort of ageless quality inherent in the character (and remarked upon in the film).Weta Digital did a good job with the the film's special effects, particularly with the dream tree scene.The plot meanwhile was fairly faithful to the book, if not quite capturing some of the couched darker tones of Dahl, with a pace that worked surprisingly swiftly for its run time in part carried by the relativity fluid transitions from one moment to the next carried on the back of the character byplay.The only drawback to the film is that the less darker tone from the source material took away from the unique experience that comes from a Dahl work, and if your a Dahl fan, this will likely annoy you.That being said it is a Disney film under the control of Spielberg which means that the "Family film" aspect will remain strictly traditional. Though its worth pointing out that with the increasing maturity of family television out there, the traditional notion is going to find a harder branch to perch on with young audiences.Overall, while it isn't exactly an epic film, it is a good film nonetheless that delivers on the promise of its premise with stellar acting, character designs on part of the giants, and visual effects and worth watching for all age groups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Family Movie With Some Jaw Dropping Motion Capture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFG is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, a little girl living in an orphanage in England, who believes in tales of giants coming during the night to eat children. She thinks that these giants come at around 3 in the morning, the only time of the night when she's awake, and nobody else is. One night, a giant whisks her away to giant country, but she learns that he's a Big Friendly Giant (or BFG), and doesn't eat children. However, the older giants do, and it is up to the BFG to protect Sophie from the giants that are much bigger than him, him being the runt of the giants.I don't even care what the title is, or what the story is about, if Steven Spielberg is directing it, I know I'm going to enjoy the movie in the long run. Steven Spielberg is a legend when it comes to filmmaking, and his name is enough to get me to buy a ticket. As expected, The BFG is a pretty good movie. There are some points where it somewhat falters, and I wouldn't call it Spielberg's best, but it was enjoyable in many different ways.The first point that I have to address is the motion capture work done by Mark Rylance as The BFG. We have gotten to the point in cinema in which CG can, if done right, look better than makeup or practical effects. The motion capture done on Mark Rylance is the best motion capture work put to film since Andy Serkis' Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014). I loved the CG put to use in this movie, and not just in Mark Rylance's motion capture, but in the magical world of giant country. All of the CG used in this film is utterly impressive, and took The BFG to the next level.Mark Rylance did great as far as acting as well. The BFG (the character) does have a speech impediment, and Rylance pulled off the lines containing odd words used by The BFG in a great way, heightening his filmography by another great movie. Ruby Barnhill as Sophie was a great casting choice, and did amazing in the film. This is one of the best child performances of Spielberg's career, and one of the best child performances of the year. All of the other actors do pretty well, especially Jemaine Clement as the unspoken leader of the giants, Fleshlumpeater. I likes his motion capture a lot, and his character was the type that the audience really begins to dislike, which makes the main characters all the more likable.Now, towards the end of the second act, I was really getting into the movie. I started enjoying it on a high level, and was wanting to see what happened in the next act. However, with the start of the third act, the movie completely fell apart for me. I don't want to spoil it, but Sophie and The BFG's plan to take down the mean giants metaphorically threw me out of the theater. I was getting very immersed into the world that the filmmakers had created, but was sucked out of it very quickly once the third act had started.Also, some of the humor fell flat. Most of the comedy was genuine, and I enjoyed it, but, I'd say probably a quarter of the jokes weren't all that funny. However, there were some jabs at comedy that I don't normally like, but had me laughing pretty hard in this film, because it was done right. Anyone who's seen the movie most likely knows what jokes I'm talking about, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen The BFG.Overall, The BFG is a very fun family film, with a lot of good laughs and some amazing motion capture and CGI. I'd suggest the movie to anyone who can sit down and just have fun with a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lovely Heartwarming and Entertaining Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not even a hint of a negative review here! I have read both positive and negative reviews of this movie here on IMDb - it seems that opinions are highly polarised - love it or the opposite. We (my wife and I) have just seen The BFG and thought it was a superb piece of entertainment that was entirely enjoyable in every respect. Poor acting? Humbug! Spielberg has lost his touch? Humbug! Boring ??? Well, I guess it didn't have any vampires or walking dead in it and it certainly wasn't a shoot-em-up action movie but as a heartwarming and utterly enjoyable movie with some laugh-out-loud moments it is a great success and as good a movie as we have seen for a long time.I can only agree with one reviewer who said that it may be too erudite for many people. The script was excellent, the timing was spot on and the whole movie presented with a wonderful overall coherence that is missing from so many contemporary films. Never too 'soggy' or sentimental but not too superficial either it presented a modernistic fairy tale fantasy in a consummately digestible manner. It should appeal to all ages.Without giving too much away about the comedic aspects (IMDB reviewers: if this is regarded as a spoiler please forgive the faux pas - it doesn't seem like a spoiler to me) imagine, if you will, a carbonated drink where the bubbles go downwards and not upwards in the glass: drinking the beverage certainly won't make you burp but it will make you ... well, I hope you get the idea! It was a highly visual 'gag' that wasn't overplayed and the results were hilarious, most especially when they take place in a certain wonderfully spoofed royal situation and environment.In summary then: visually stunning, well acted and wholesomely entertaining. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful and sincere adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most impressive thing about Steven Spielberg's adaptation of The BFG is the art direction and animation. It's hard to picture Quentin Blake's original illustrations being this crisp and realistic without some form of compromise to the original designs, but somehow they pulled it off.It's been a while since I read the book, but from what I remember, this adaptation is very accurate to the book, and the sequence of events hold true. However, in my opinion, this compromises on pacing a little bit. The second act especially drags out a bit, and there are some tonal inconsistencies throughout.The trailers for the film also imply a more serious sense of whimsy than what the film delivers. Sure, there is a lot of amazing and awe-inspiring scenes in this film, but overall, the tone is a lot more silly than what may be expected. This is ultimately a kids film based on a kids book. I was surprised at first when I saw how low the critical reaction to this film was, but on further consideration, while this is not at all a bad film, I understand how some critics may dislike it. There are two scenes in the film that rely heavily on fart humour. This is accurate to the book, but perhaps seeing it in motion isn't as pleasant as reading it in words.Mark Rylance as the titular character was astounding. He made the BFG's broken English from the original novel sound perfectly genuine and realistic. Speaking in this sort of broken English could easily come out stilted and clumsy, but he pulled it off fantastically. Ruby Barnhill as Sophie, the little girl that the BFG whisks away, was also a decent actor in her role, although perhaps her role at the beginning feels like the sort of bratty Hermione from the first Harry Potter film.I think the BFG's biggest flaw is how reliant on the original source material it is. My favourite Roald Dahl adaptation is Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox, which uses the incredibly short source material to build a compelling and complex film the whole family can watch and enjoy at different levels. Both adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory build on the source material to further flesh out the novel, to greater or lesser success. The BFG, however, sticks to the book over making small changes for the purpose of pacing.Don't get me wrong, this film is definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the original book. I hope I don't come across too hard on this film, as I really did enjoy it, but it's hard to not recognise the flaws, especially in pacing and tone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Endearing and admirable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With sensibilities aligning, Steven Spielberg and Roald Dahl are a match made in cinematic heaven. In fact, they're such a snug fit that it's unfathomable this is the first time the genius filmmaker has tackled the legendary author's work. But tackled it he has, and the result is a beguiling, sweet, and old-fashioned tall tale that wears its heart on its sleeve and veers away from the modern-day mould of action-packed and joke-filled family flicks. Despite grappling with serious themes such as bullying, lost friendship and growing up in foster care, the film is balanced with light-hearted moments that even extend to downright silliness, keeping the mood from becoming too sombre. Spielberg is as Spielberg does though, hence his trademark sentimentality is in full swing here with long stretches of slow and contemplative scenes that, although meticulously and gorgeously crafted, will test the patience of younger audience members. The handful of set pieces may be spread out few and far between, but when they arrive they're nothing short of inventive, exhilarating and superbly executed; assisted by the beautiful and flawless computer effects. Employing motion-capture technology to breathe life into the giants works a treat too, in particular for the eponymous over-sized creature who is gifted a wonderfully heartfelt performance by Oscar-winner Mark Rylance. Acting opposite Rylance is the altogether less-experienced, 11 year-old newcomer Ruby Barnhill, who is highly impressive as orphan Sophie, the precocious and brave young girl who inspires the BFG to take a stand against his bullies. Its languishing pace and ponderous tone might not be to everyone's liking, especially those seeking some simple holiday fun, but The BFG is an admirable and endearing motion picture that'll likely stand the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of negative reviews for the bfg, but they're all adult reviews. Everyone seems to have forgotten that the bfg is a children's book. This movie is aimed at children so I'm going to give my son's opinion rather than my own. I read the book to my son (6) which he really enjoyed. He was very excited about seeing the film. Afterwards I asked him what he thought. He never mentioned too much CGI, he never mentioned plot issues, he didn't complain about acting or the pace of the film. His review was fairly short, he said it was great! The film doesn't stray too far from the book and it was great to see him react to things he had remembered from the book. If it's good enough for him it's good enough for me so it's 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BFG may not be "E.T.," or "Hook," or "Jurassic Park," but it has signature marks of a wonderfully exciting Steven Spielberg family adventure film. Yes the great director Spielberg is back after making his rounds through a few tense dramas ("Lincoln," "Bridge Of Spies") to bring us this lovable visual effects-filled story about a courageous little girl and the big friendly and somewhat shy giant.Based on the book by the late great author Roald Dahl whose imagination has made the world a little bit better with such works as "Charlie And The Chocolate Factory" and "Fantastic Mr. Fox," THE BFG tells us that when it comes to being brave, size doesn't matter.Starring Spielberg's latest go-to actor, Oscar winner, Mark Rylance as the title character and a resident of Giant country. Standing 24-feet tall, Rylance's character has enormous ears, great sense of smell, he talks funny and he fancies his job as a dreamcatcher. When he's spotted by a little orphan girl named Sophie, played by newcomer Ruby Barnhill, he takes Sophie with him to Giant Country where there Sophie finds that other giants in the area are not as friendly, giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) are twice as big and they bully the BFG and they also eat children. The BFG however is somewhat of a vegetarian, he consumes these disgustingly lookin' Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. But things start to get unsafe for Sophie to remain there, so the BFG decides to return Sophie to the orphanage. But Sophie insists that they should stand up for themselves and stand up to those bullies. So they acquire the help of none other than the Queen of England.This little actress, Ruby Barnhill, is quite a treat, she really plays her age really well, meaning she's so curious and full of questions, that's what kids her age do, she's idealistic and optimistic, and Barnhill has all of that and a bag of chips. Rylance is perfect in his role, because there's that sense of child-like wonder also on Rylance's expressions that are of course magnified by CG, Rylance's gentleness and charm shine through naturally.I can see why Steven Spielberg and Disney really wanted to bring this story to the big screen, not only has the technology caught up to it, but also because it has those feel-good inspiring themes; it's a story about two lonely misunderstood characters that become friends; it's about tackling giant problems by using solutions that may seem giant to some; and it's about being brave even when the world doesn't give you a reason to be. From time to time, Spielberg loves going back to wildly imaginative stories like The BFG that's just all around wonderful.-- Rama's Screen --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg + Dahl + Disney = Magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years our good friend Steven Spielberg has been dishing out biopics and war films (War Horse, Lincoln and Bridge of Spies). But with the BFG, Spielberg allows himself to unleash his creativity and imagination that made him popular as a filmmaker in the first place. The film holds the same amount of magic and nostalgia as E.T or Jurassic Park. It's whimsical, humorous and at times emotional. Of course, we have to also give all due credit to Roald Dahl, who conjured up this simple, but enchanting story of a young orphan and a Big, Friendly Giant. His book was then exceptionally adapted by the late and great Melissa Mathison(who was also the screenwriter of E.T) . Her screenplay was then Moulded and translated by Spielberg, who did a fantastic job of bringing the characters up off the page and onto the screen. The film shows his visionary approach to directing, and displays the power of his imagination.The film, by all means, isn't for everyone. It is certainly no "intellectual" and I'm sure that the film buffs in the audience could identify dozens of plot holes. It is not thrilling, nor is it romantic. It tells a very basic story, and it's loaded with "cliche" Spielberg nostalgia. But if you are a fan of Dahl, Disney, Spielberg or the Magic of Cinema, this is a must see. It's a feel good story, captured in the most magical way. Forget Harry Potter and his wizardry, this is real Magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Whimsical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anything relating to Roald Dahl ? both books and films ? will always be extremely nostalgic for me. As well as Enid Blyton, Dahl was one of my favourite authors growing up and I consistently found myself lured into his multiple magical worlds that were always full of kooky characters. Take this as a warning that my opinion on Steven Spielberg's take on The BFG might be biased on either side. I could either hold it up high on a pedestal where it's completely untouchable or I could be extra critical as it has a lot to live up to. Considering I haven't read the book in a long time, I believe I was quite fair when passing judgement on this film.From the very moment the BFG snatches little Sophie from her bed at the orphanage, the story started slowly coming back to me. Considering all of the modern day developments in visual effects, this movie certainly puts them to good use, with some scenes looking so incredibly realistic that even a grown woman like myself started questioning whether giants really do exist.Spielberg really is the king of children's fantasy ? he brings out a fantastic performance from new-comer Ruby Barnhill who plays the bold orphan Sophie. It was almost reminiscent of Henry Thomas in E.T. It's a shame this film didn't perform too well at the box office because it's a movie that had a great combination of scares, imagination, heart and humour that I think every child (and adults alike) should go out and see. Escapism at its best, The BFG gave me a case of the warm and fuzzies ? and also had me curious as to what exactly a snozzcumber tasted like.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is always difficult to capture a book in a movie. You always envision the story, the characters, the scenery different than the director and this was not different here. So yes, occasionally you have a feeling of disappointment, but oh boy, were these moments few.The CGI drips of the screen as you start watching, but I don't see how it could not, if you want this world to come alive. Of course the story is among the greatest I know, since my childhood, but the magic of the book was captured very well and the colors swirl around making you want to go there, to giant country and discover for yourself. The BFG, Sophie, The Queen, Mr. Tibbs, ... all characters just fit and help in bringing even more flair to the setup. Small details are added, including the funny talk, the dream mixer and the lovely breakfast scene.And so all the small disappointments (they are few) are forgotten before your next flitspopper.A happy movie with just a hint of sadness and a masterpiece for everyone who loves this story.</fullReview>

Normally when I put any type of hope into a Disney movie, I am utterly disappointed but this movie made me believe I was actually reading the book. The BFG and Sophie were super believable and The Giants were out of this world. I commend how much attention to detail the folks at Disney paid to this movie.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spielberg is a master story teller. This movie is no exception. In some ways, this movie harks back to the 70s and early 80s to a time when films had more innocence and much more heart without the soppiness, lowbrow, sexism and preaching you get from many children's movies in modern times. There is some very mild violence in this movie and themes of children being hurt. I would expect most 6 year olds would be OK with it, but expect scares for younger ones. What really captured the charm in this story was the beautiful relationship between the two main characters (a sweet but gutsy girl and a stunted giant). Rylance as the BFG was amazing. He's a combination of gentle and simple but not stupid. Most actors would have played the BFG as a dimwit. However, BFG came across as very capable but socially stunted through his own experiences. What also stood out was some amazing camera work. You really get a perspective of the size of the girl, the BFG and the bigger giants all the way through the movie. It's the first movie that seamlessly transitions between 3 wildly different sized characters extremely well. Imagine comparing a mouse with a dog and a human, but grounding the movie with the mouse's view. I expect more movies to copy this in coming years. Minor gripes with the movie include a few slightly long scenes and a slight grating tone from the main heroine. However, as a first time actress, she was superb. Thankfully, no "girl power" or ninja warrior sexism to sit through. For the non-sexist, that's a great in itself. In summary, a beautiful movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(RATING: &#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; out of 5)THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: Spielberg in childhood mode misses the magic but still entertains.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: An orphan accidentally sees a giant and sets off series of events.JIM'S REVIEW: When I taught third grade, two of the most popular books during read-aloud time, by far, were by Roald Dahl. James and the Giant Peach and The BFG, the latter receiving the most joyous response from my students, were prime examples of the author's macabre humor and imaginative plotting. I don't know if it was the book itself, or just hearing the teacher read gibberish vocabulary and dealing with fart jokes which were aplenty in his story of a little orphan and a big friendly giant. The same effect can be found in this fine movie adaptation by Steven Spielberg, but not the same outcome. &#xfffc;Technically, the film has lovely moments, largely due to Janusz Kaminski's rousing photography. However, unlike the original source, this version has no real heart or emotional bond. Whereas the short novel had Dahl's droll humor and humongous tons of charm, the film adaptation has a lot of filler that edges on a more serious tone. The additional plotting just pads the story into a full length motion picture experience. Spielberg's film relies more on adventurous chases and needless backstories which neither enhance or explain anything. &#xfffc; The BFG stars Mark Rylance as the title character and newcomer Ruby Barnhill as his pal, Sophie. Abducted by the giant late one night, Sophie is transplanted into a world of giants, not as kind as her soft-spoken Big Friendly Giant a.k.a. BFG. This giant is the more sensitive kind, who catches dreams to share with sleeping youngsters later on his evening sojourns to London. But there are much larger and evil giants in the world that pose a danger to little Sophie, like the Fleshlumpeater, the biggest and baddest bully and leader of the whole lot. They would like to eat our heroine, a human "bean", or any other tasty children for that matter. So Sophie and the BFG team up to stop them and enlist the aid of the Queen of England.The film successfully visualizes many scenes from the book. The opening sequence of Sophie's capture, her visit to the Land of Dreams, and a delightful scene of the BFG having a lavish breakfast with the Queen are spot-on. Mr. Spielberg also keeps Mr. Dahl's wondrous invented vocabulary front and center which immediately establishes the sweet nature of the BFG...words like strawbunkles (strawberries), trogglehumper (nightmare), snozzcumber (a foul-tasting vegetable), frobscottle (a fizzy drink that causes whizpopping (farting). When delivered by the talented Mr. Rylance, the dialog sound like comic poetry.&#xfffc;But the film itself remains inconsistent in tone, logic, and visual look. At times, the scale of tiny Sophie and other surrounding objects, including the BFG, tends to fluctuate. The time frame of this tale varies as well. The production design of the orphanage and London streets seems like Victorian England, yet there is Queen Elizabeth, and not Victoria, on the throne. Later on, a clear mention of the Reagans being in office dates the film to the eighties. A real time warp.Mr. Rylance does some wonderful subtle acting with his CGI portrayal, but I personally found some of the special effects too artificially produced, especially whenever the side views of the giant came into play. (The head and elongated neck seemed too unconvincing, but the large ears did help complete the character well and matched Quentin Blake's classic illustrations. Frontally and in close-up, the BFG imagery worked very well.) Ms. Barnhill does a good job as Sophie and Jermaine Clement as the Fleshlumpeater provides enough menace. Penelope Wilton as The Queen brings that upper English class to her role.&#xfffc;The late Melissa Mathison's screenplay has many of the components of the book. It just doesn't have the magic that I expected from all the talent involved. The film can be as effervescent as a "frobscottle" but it also go flat, spinning its own wheels. Just as the BFG himself, the film has trouble making up its mind. Still quite entertaining, this film version of The BFG ultimately becomes "smogswallowed" by its own heavy-handed plot devicesANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oddly, American families are resisting Disney cramming a message down their throats . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . that child-killing cannibals deserve to spend their "Golden Years" feasting on an island paradise. This, of course, summarizes the climax of THE BFG. If you don't count THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, most experts now consider BFG the Biggest Flop of director Steven Spielberg's career. For some strange reason, the U.S. public sees a difference between teens watching bikini girls being chomped by Killer Great Whites in JAWS, and toddlers being exposed to the suggestion of their peers getting gobbled alive in BFG. Probably many U.S. parents have checked out the source of such questionable material on Wikipedia, which says BFG author Roald Dahl was one of England's Disinformation spooks during WWII, thought that there was something about Jews in general that gave Hitler "a reason" for trying to exterminate them, and hated that plucky American ally Israel with a vengeance to his dying day. Dahl was merely one of that huge sector of snobby "holier-than-thou" self-styled "British Elite" which certainly includes Vanessa Redgrave and Eternal Queen Elizabeth II's uncle King Edward, all of whom have injected their anti-Semitic venom into the World's Culture since King David's time, and enabled Al Quaeda, ISIS, Hamas, the PLO, Hezbollah, ISIL, Boko Haram, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Republican Party to flourish into these so-called "Modern Times." SCHINDLER'S LIST director Spielberg should be ashamed of himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Never get out of the bed. Never go to the window. Never look behind the curtain." Sophie (Roby Barnhill)Of course, she does get out of bed and in director Steven Spielberg's and writer Roald Dahl's worlds, she will have the time of her life with lessons aplenty. Learn she does from a Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance, incomparable), mostly about the efficacy of dreaming and taking the measured way to fulfill those lightning-bug like imaginative sprites.The nine other giants on this planet are carnivores, while BFG goes around catching dreams and bottling them. After abducting Sophie from an orphanage, BFG wins her over with humility and some "squiggly" dialect called "gobblefunk."Arguably the premiere director of our time, Spielberg coaxes a performance from Oscar-winning Rylance that captures the soul of a noble savage. Rylance alone is worth going to this adult-friendly fantasy.Unusual for a kid's book, the late writer Melissa Mathison of ET fame and Dahl engage the Queen of England and her army to combat the bad giants while the writers offer a not-so-surprising ending fitting for a story about dream catching. Despite some of the usual kids-movie tropes (orphans, clueless adults, things going bonkers at night, etc.), enough original ideas float around to make it delightful for pre-teens, such as a generous number of flatulent segments (even Swiss Army Man uses that bodily function to further the plot). A giant who has heard "faraway music coming from the stars in the sky" and owns a drum made from the earring of a giant who built Stonehenge is a giant whom adults with a hint of romanticism in them could love. Bad Giants with names like Bonecrusher and Meatdripper will win the imaginations of a young audience that will love the macabre world.My four year-old buddy, Franco, called the film "awesome."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a word I usually use: this is ENCHANTING!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should be surprised that The BFG didn't do better this opening weekend, but I'm not (Pixar when they have something audiences want do so well that no one can come close), and with Secret Life of Pets out on Friday it doesn't stand much of chance of being a financial success. But as an artistic success it is a minor gem in Spielberg's filmography. It says a lot that a man who has been working over 45 years in movies can still make things so delightful, seemingly effortlessly, like the flick of a wrist in visual grandiosity and wonder, with his band of collaborators (Kaminski, Williams, Kahn, and here in a grand finale Mathison as writer, and Rylance who is now like Tarantino/Waltz, I can't wait to see more work from them).He, from Dahl's book, keeps on giving us things to look at and marvel. But it's a little tricky in a way; it doesn't move at a very fast-frenetic pace. Things move in a pace where nothing is too rushed, and Sophie discovers things in a way that moves more in a, do I say 'old fashioned' way? Ironically the film uses motion capture technology, and yet it's more advanced by now than from a decade ago with Polar Express. So what I would say to any parents worried their kids might be, well, 'bored', a) have a little more faith in your kids' attention spans, and b) this may be something that will bring children over and over for years to come. If it's not a success immediately it will be in the long run with audiences.I may be slightly biased since I loved the book as a kid (I remembered enough, some things were 'oh yeah' moments), but movies get screwed with all the time in adaptation, for better or worse. What works so well is the combination of a strong emotional core between Rylance as BFG and newcomer Ruby Barnhill as Sophie (she could, under the wrong direction, be cloying, but she is given just enough to show the wonder and discovery and also the intelligence that Sophie should have) with the whole world created that the giants live in, the BFG's cave. What's impressive too is that it's not sapping for sentimentality, the emotion's genuine between the actors, so that when characters separate at a key point (due to a past instance with a little boy and the 'human bean' eating giants), it resonates and makes an impact. Oh, and then at one point there's a Mel Brooks level fart joke. The BFG is a movie with a great sense of humor and often if it's not worth a laugh a smile will do.It surprises me the most to see many critics (not all, but more than I'd expect) say this is a lessor film from him, like he made another 1941 or Hook or War Horse. If I find someone make a defense of War Horse but spit on this movie, I don't know what to do for you. It has conflicts (the monstrous giants), it has surrealism (this is basically in essence Inception for kids), and it has a heart that means to be beating in the face of cynical a-holes. It's such a good movie I almost forgive England for leaving the EU! Will it be one of my favorites of the year, or on par with the last time Spielberg and Mathison brought together two lonely souls in a fantastical narrative? No, but few films are. It's a fitting follow-up though and seeing it on a big screen is one of the events of this summer for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday I attended a morning advanced screening for The BFG and was wondrously surprised!I am 20 years old and went with a friend, and both of us had read the book many times as children. It was really quite emotional to see it being brought to life.The cinematography and CGI was amazing, but that didn't compare to the wonderful atmosphere created by splendid storytelling and interesting character development.The balance of suspense and cheerfulness were just right for a family film. I've seen some complain about the giants not being 'scary enough', but I thought they were at a decent level. My friend and I jumped at a couple places, and a mum rushed out with her young child (but later returned) who was getting too scared. We need to remember that this IS, after all, a children's tale! Even with that said, I'm sure a few children throughout the world will have some nightmares in relation to the man-eating giants!It was really quite amazing seeing this film, and I hope it does well so we can continue to have more like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You really cannot ask for more in this day and age of action flicks and horror or doom and gloom pictures. This movie sidesteps most of what has gone absurdly wrong in Hollywood in the past couple decades, though one must expect this kind of picture from Spielberg.The story was good and allegories and metaphors seem the name of the game here. This film can appeal to anyone of any age. I particularly liked the James Joycean speak of the BFG or God. I tend to like to think of a God in such a manner as a kind and stumbling caretaker unwilling to harm others including those that harm others, have to have free will. The girl shows faith in her bravery to face up to her fears and that inspires the BFG "whom can hear every whisper". Well done presentation of this famous story.It was nice to not have to watch a battle scene with the giants which would have blown it in terms of telling the story it seems. So much gets ruined these days with overplayed action films, don't get me wrong, I love any of the other kinds of films as much as anyone else, I just prefer when competent film makers make works of art such as this that can appeal to any age, it maybe as though age maybe of minimal importance to the message, and there was definitely a message in this one. It'll even bring a tear to the eye if you maybe willing to let it. In a nearly empty theater our 9 year old clapped proudly at the end. Thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a true pity that The BFG has not been able to drum up much of an audience, because it is a wonderful family film touched by brilliance. The BFG marks Steven Spielberg's return to the type of family-friendly fantasy that was his trademark in the 1980s and is a triumphant return. The film is aided by sublime visuals, two wonderful leading performances, a beautiful musical score, and a script that takes its time and allows viewers to grow truly attached to the characters and the plot. In a way, there is true poignancy in praising the plot as Melissa Matheson, who adapted Roald Dahl's book for the screen passed away last year. her script contains at times the sense of wonder that was so prevalent in her other collaboration with Spielberg, 1982's legendary E.T. Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill are both absolutely ideal in their roles as the sweet, kind BFG and the resilient, charming Sophie. They bring absolute sincerity to their roles. There are also appealing cameos from Penelope Wilton, Rafe Spall, and Rebecca Hall as the Queen and two members of the royal court. John Williams' lovely, lilting, and adventurous score is also a wonder to behold. And some of the showpiece sequences in the film (such as a scene involving visible dreams floating around a tree) are just as good as any other Spielberg sequence in the past. In a time of manic films, The BFG is a cool, strong, lilting refreshment. It is a true charmer.Originally published at Letterboxd</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BFG began as an imaginative book by Roald Dahl about a giant that captures and saves dreams so that he can bring happiness to sleeping children and adults as well. The movie begins as the BFG is seen by the cute-as-a-button insomniac orphan Sophie. The BFG takes the terrified Sophie gently from her orphanage bed and spends the rest of the movie bonding with her, precious soul to precious soul. My family (one teen, one "tween") loved the movie. The story is about trying to live a kind and gentle life in a world that is not always so kind or so gentle. The BFG has his tormentors, and Sophie becomes his little supporter, encouraging him to deal rightly with his problem. Likewise, the BFG looks out for Sophie who needs all the love she can get. The movie tells a most unique tale that will keep you involved until the end. There are some giants that might be a bit much for preschoolers. I did see a two year old crying when they appeared. The BFG is a fun and warm movie with laughs and a fine message. Great fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Roald Dahl as a child, The BFG has always been one of the books I've most wanted to see adapted for the big screen.Based on the children's novel of the same name, The BFG is about a giant (Big Friendly Giant) who takes a girl from her orphanage and brings her above the clouds to Giant Country, out of fear that she will tell people about him. Although he's "friendly," his larger contemporaries aren't. They bully him and feast on human beings.There are some points in the film where you aren't quite sure how the story is progressing. It meanders a bit during the 2nd act and the pacing can get pretty slow, but it's not so much of a bother since there is so much to enjoy visually and the scenes are so dense.While not quite as dark as the book, the imagery still translates well. The CGI isn't just there. Rather, it's as much a part of the film as the story itself. If the visuals were less impressive, the movie just wouldn't have worked as well.Part of what makes the film so enjoyable is the charisma of its two leads. Mark Rylance plays the title character, and newcomer, Ruby Barnhill, reminiscent of Drew Barrymore in E.T., plays the little girl, Sophie.The BFG's job in life is to collect dreams and give them to people. The events in this film feel like a dream from a child's perspective. Having nobody in life and turning to a seemingly-imaginary character for friendship.Luckily, the last third of the film elevates in a wondrous way. Things begin to happen and the story becomes full and complete. Director, Steven Spielberg, has a way of wrapping things up like no other. While the brief hiccup halfway through the film--though not really his fault--is uncharacteristic of his films, the ending reminds us why he's the best.The vision of The BFG is magical. There's no other way to put it. It doesn't just offer some fairytale story masking, for children, the harsh realities of the world. Instead, it shows them that there's hope--no matter how impossible it may seem.Twizard Rating: 98</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good I immediately went to see it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so rich in every department: visually, musically, in its excellent, charming, witty script, and the casting of actors who bring their best to the screen in their roles. For once a children's tale without the tiresome clichés that currently dominate kids' movies; a sometimes quiet and intimate film with sensitive, feeling characters who talk to each other in longish dialog scenes. This is a fable in an old fashioned mode, and yet is made from pure 21st century movie magic. As great as Mark Rylance is, and he is amazing, Penelope Wilton is unbelievably funny as a combination uptight, take charge and yet completely empathetic Queen. The whole breakfast scene, in fact the entire Royal Palace section, is one of the funniest things I've seen in ages. The film is doing poorly at the box office so catch it on the big screen before it's gone - it's absolutely gorgeous. And speaking of gorgeous, John Williams, collaborating with the some of the world's greatest musicians including Heather Clark on flute, has written a symphonic work that underscores just about every minute of the film. It's a masterpiece that ranks with the very best of what he has written for film in his long career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roald Dahl's The Big Friendly Giant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child, whenever I read one of Roald Dahl's novels, or short stories was an absolute joy for me in every way possible. I remember one birthday in particular where I was probably 9, or 10 years old and I received the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and I remember each night coming home from school and even during school such as on lunch breaks, or at recess reading this book along with various other Dahl favourites (I don't think there were ever any I didn't like) and just completely falling in love with the books and the author's writing style itself. I credit Roald Dahl as an author who inspired me to read at a young age and now 20 years later, I may be reading different material, or sometimes more mature fare, but it was because of Dahl and his wonderful imagination, witty sense of writing and sometimes delightfully dark and yet humorous stories that made me continue to want to read and added some escapism and pleasure to a childhood that was mostly good, but especially helped out in the more turbulent times because I could escape into one of his books and put away my childhood worries and cares for a time. I eventually sought out many of the film adaptations that were made of his books such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox and now The BFG and because Dahl was so expressive with his writing and could completely transport us into other worlds, manners of speech and over the top yet fascinating characters, all of the above mentioned films were complete successes and I would like to add that Steven Spielberg's new version of his classic The BFG fits along with those classic titles and should become a hit with both adults and children and belongs with the very best of the genre. Spielberg here teams up with his E.T. The Extra Terrestrial screenwriter, Melissa Mathison who as any kid who grew up in the 80's, or 90's can tell you that E.T. was a staple in their childhoods and I remember myself that whenever I had a pick of a film at the local video store at that age, that E.T. would most likely be the first film I would pick up and bring home, even having seen it for the umpteenth time. I also know people who watched their VHS copies so much that the tapes themselves wore out from so much use. The sign of a much loved item. Here again over 30 years later, Mathison and Spielberg are still able to create magic and a long lasting classic that will both appeal to adults and the youngest of children. It has been close to 20 years since I last read The BFG, but watching the film, everything came back to me and it was like I was discovering one of my childhood treasures all over again. Mathison's screenplay which is full of wonder and amazement and also takes us into a new world with wonderfully rich characters, Dahl's wonderful mangling of the English language (I mean that in the best way possible) and also wonderful lessons for children such as about friendship, bullying and believing in yourself. The film also most importantly is a lot of fun and I was in an audience that was laughing when the film was funny and even close to tears in the beautiful and sentimental moments that didn't feel false, but felt beautifully captured and enriching all the same. The special effects are kept to a minimum and what we do have visual wise is so beautiful and truly spectacular to look at that it is one of the most visually pleasing and stunning films that I have seen on the big screen in quite some time. The acting by Mark Rylance, Ruby Barnhill among others is terrifically expressive and yet they seem to have a great time in this film and we are along every step of the way with them and when they are having fun, so are we, when they are scared, so are we and we connect with them and love being with these characters and watching them. Truly a beautiful film that is a wonderful and fun time for children, but beneath the surface also teaches valuable life lessons and truths and encouragement that every child needs. One of the best films of this year and one of the best family films of this year, or really any other. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked it. The blend of real sets and action with post production work is very well achieved. The technical expertise of the Weta Workshop in doing this is almost flawless. The story is easy to follow and its depiction here well accomplished. I had watched the trailer and was somewhat apprehensive about the entire product...the trailer is misleading, so my advice is...ignore any apprehension and go see this movie.I have been at a few screenings of movies where at the conclusion the audience clapped. This was one of them. The story is lighthearted and the performances authentic to the Raold Dahl characters. The late Melissa Mathison's screenplay is simple, yet thought-provoking in a gentle and positive way. The performances of the actors are where they need to be with the interplay between the two main characters a joy to watch. Mark Rylance as the big friendly giant and Ruby Barnhill as ten year old Sophie were good choices. And Penelope Wilton as the Queen of England was also a good choice. The John Williams musical score does the job of enhancing the story without being heavy-handed.This is one of a few movies I would enjoy viewing again sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most completely original imagined fantasy world I've ever seen &amp; enjoyed in a movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget Avatar, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings and even WarCraft. Spielberg brought back the lyrical and magical ambiance of early Disney live action of "Darby O'Gill &amp; the Little People" and "Mary Poppins" in "The BFG" but with a more beautifully visual world so engrossing I couldn't believe what I was seeing.I've seen all those movies mentioned except Harry Potter &amp; WarCraft, but this one is special. The characters and story are original. The dialog, naturalistic character acting (think Edgar Buchannan, Walter Brennan &amp; Chill Wills) with all their lovable idiosyncratic speech patterns make this movie sparkle with the added visual style of '80's fantasy illustrators, "The Hildebrandt Brothers". (Google them).Beautiful color, lighting and ambiance with believable depiction of human giants. CGI acting is noticeably improved especially the expressiveness in the eyes which usually comes across in past movies as animated corpses in human like characters but I was sold in this movie. Just like in "Mary Poppins" I welled up in some scenes from the believable acting on this one.I really enjoyed and love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spielberg Conjures Another Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Steven Spielberg has created yet another masterpiece, with this one being a gentle adaptation of Roald Dahl's kid lit book, The BFG. The BFG is nothing short of brilliant, with imagination on display at every turn. The movie follows the titular Big Friendly Giant (or BFG as he comes to be known), as he befriends a human girl named Sophie and whisks her away to giant country, where the BFG is the runt of a litter of larger, more violent giants. Throughout the course of the movie you really get to know Sophie and the BFG, with the two of them forging a friendship due to their shared circumstances. Both are lonely souls who others think less of, and in the eyes of each other, they discover what it means to be a better human "bean," as the BFG would put it.Newcomer Ruby Barnhill plays Sophie with wide-eyed wonder and sass, immediately making Sophie an adorable heroine you want to root for. Then there is recent Oscar winner, and current Spielberg muse, Mark Rylance, stealing each scene he's in as the BFG. Rylance has this uncanny ability to convey deep wells of emotion with nothing other than his eyes. He truly is a marvel to watch on screen, and when you go from his work in Bridge of Spies to his work as the BFG, you see a completely different actor. The BFG is a warm and gentle soul lacking in bravery, who only wants to help deliver the dreams he catches up in dream country to sleeping people. Perhaps the greatest marvel of this movie though, is the fact that the special effects manage to make us believe that Ruby Barnhill is interacting with a twenty-four foot tall Mark Rylance.Through the use of CGI and motion capture work, the special effects crew manage to capture every element of Mark Rylance's performance and make it writ large. I have seen many movies that try to show us giants interacting with humans, but there is often an odd feeling to the difference in scale. I never had that feeling with The BFG. I truly believed that Sophie and the BFG were there together in every scene, and that allows the magic spell of this movie to be cast.When you get right down to it, The BFG is not an in your face adventure movie, it's a rather simple bedtime story. There's not a lot of violence, nor are there any real scares (except for when the BFG is bullied by his fellow giants), and the crudest thing the movie has within it is the greatest farting scene I've ever seen in a movie. The BFG is easily Spielberg's most child appropriate movie he's ever made. It is sweet, funny, and will have your imagination in overdrive the entire time. Couple the gorgeous images from longtime Spielberg cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, with the beautiful musical score by John Williams, and the great script by the late E.T. scribe, Melissa Mathison, and you've got another Spielberg classic. Will it be remembered as fondly as E.T. or Raiders of the Lost Ark? Probably not, but it could very well be on the same plain as Spielberg movies like Hook and War Horse, which is not bad company to share.I give The BFG a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this film. Took my 6 year old daughter to see it and she didn't look away at all during it. Graphics were awesome and you fall in love with the BFG. You also fall in love with the friendship the BFG and the young girl end up having. Graphics were awesome, as usual with Disney films. The ending was awesome and it was a relief seeing a Disney film without any extremely sad parts. Maybe it's not Spielbergs best film ever but honestly it is probably one of my top favorite movies. He did good! It was also very funny at certain parts and everyone was laughing, no matter what age. It is a movie anyone can enjoy. It definitely was a feel good movie, I teared at the end a bit. I also brought my mother along who loved it so much and she isn't usually into the fantasy films but she really loves the BFG. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD already so I can watch it all over again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing "E.T." atmosphere, but still enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since Steven Spielberg ventured into grim and gritty features like "A.I.", "Minority Report" or "Munich", I always secretly hoped he'd look to his early career days and yet again give audiences another wonderful experience as he did in full abundance with "Close Encounters", "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and of course, his, perhaps all-time creative triumph, "E.T.". Late Melissa Mathison's emotionally mesmerizing writing helped the film's ultra-success (along with the unforgettable Oscar-winning John Williams score), and I dreamed for this home run collaboration to take another come around. And then, 34 years later, it finally did. I would have absolutely loved to write that it produced another very similar undertake in spirit as the story of the small, benign, brown alien with telepathic powers, but unfortunately, this isn't the case. Now, don't get me wrong. My 7 rating gives a distinctive I wasn't disappointed, but only if we differ ourselves from the Spielberg-Mathison-Williams mashup and watch "The BFG" as a standalone project. The CGI is impressive, but then again nothing noticeably technologically improved of humans-and-giants together than what we've already seen in, for example, "Jack the Giant Slayer", made back in 2012. Mark Rylance gives his usual mild and heartfelt performance as the virtually generated character, but in this case, by my modest opinion, perhaps Andy Serkis would have been a wiser choice for the role. Mathison's script this time takes a much stronger turn on a fairy tale storytelling rather than perhaps somewhat basing itself on realistic grounds, which I, personally feel was a wrong turn, since I completely failed to connect to it, as I did with "E.T.". Kids ages from 5 to 15 however, might find this more appealing. Spielberg's directing, along with the John Williams soundtrack, is, as always, very smooth and without a false note, but still, one has to wonder if it still could've been on a higher scale. "The Extra-Terrestrial" was a film that spoke to everyone, all ages. "The BFG" will mainly speak only to children audiences. One also has to question if this endeavor could've, with just a little more creative effort been a cinematic experience to cherish for the next 34 years like with their 1982 feelings-roller-coaster blockbuster. This way, it'll just be for a year, maybe two.</fullReview>
