		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Unforgettable Masterpiece that shows the true cost of war.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch Grave of the Fireflies yesterday. My friends told me it was extremely moving and sad. I hesitated at first, but then I said "Oh well, I'll give it a try." At the end of the film, I was crying my eyes out. This was the best animated film, I've ever seen.This is a moving depiction of the fates of cast-off children who become casualties of war.This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.Quite Simply 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie you'll never want to see again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the fortune of being able to see Hotaru no Haka on the big-screen in Seattle a couple of years ago. It was truly the high-point of my film festival excursions. At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up. It would've seemed almost disrespectful to profane the silence with words.Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.I've made the comment to my friends that if you ever see someone who isn't moved (usually to tears) by this movie, you've found someone without a soul. As difficult as it is to watch, turn off the phone, dim the lights, and immerse yourself in the film with ones you love - you will be a better person for it in the end.There are many other reviews of this movie, and most of them are probably far more comprehensive than my own - I'll conclude by saying that this movie should required viewing at some point (as should the peace museums at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) for everyone.When you see war and conflict in the news or read about it in the paper, think back to this movie - your perspective will probably be broadened, and your eyes opened a bit more.I've only watched this movie about 4 times - it usually takes a year or so to "decompress" after watching it. To see it too often would lessen the impact, and that would be the worst possible thing to do to this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece, whose beauty is often overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this movie, I steeled myself for a traumatic experience, based on every review I'd ever read of it, which usually include phrases like "don't watch this if you're suicidal." Instead, if I had to pick a single word to sum up the movie I saw, it would probably be 'beautiful'.Certainly it was sad, and arguably depressing, but I've read this movie compared with 'Saving Private Ryan'. That's ridiculous. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is gentle and poetic more often than it's violent, and it's remarkably restrained in its anti-war message. It simply tells a story : there's very little at all in the way of moralizing or polemics. Why would a story like this need such heavy-handed tactics?I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead. I have a quite different view of that device.Firstly. the beginning of 'Fireflies' is, for all intents and purposes, a 'happy ending'. This is such a non-linear plot development that you could fail to notice it, and thereby only see the movie's gloom. The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).As for a character revealing that he is dead in the first line of the movie, this is a device which has been used in centuries if not Milena. The crucial thing here is that 'Fireflies' isn't _about_ tension. It tells a story whose ultimate conclusion you already know (a legitimate narrative approach), and everything which happens during that story is emotionally infused with a foreknowledge of its ending. You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power. You know the characters are going to die, but you hope things won't be so bad in the meantime. It doesn't take much of an effort to make that an analogy for our own lives, which makes us all fireflies.Perhaps what might make someone feel disappointed or cheated by this film is simply that it's so damn honest. I mean that: it's one of the most honest, artifice-free movies I've ever seen. It doesn't even really try to ram an anti-war message down your throat there is very little overt violence, and if there are some scenes of corpses and suffering, it's never gratuitous, and it's over quickly. Compare this with 'Private Ryan', where you have to suffer through 40 minutes of the most horrific blood and guts, only to reach a conclusion which, after much blood and thunder, signifies very little.'Fireflies', OTOH, has far more beauty than gore. This is what really surprised me about it. Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.Perhaps best of all, Setsuko is one of the very, very few (if not the only) animated 4 year-old I've ever seen who actually _behaves_ like a four year old. I'm so sick of seeing preternaturally smart, sassy, sophisticated and precocious children in Hollywood movies. Setsuko's emotion and behaviors are _exactly_ right for a completely normal four year-old, and recognizing this lends many scenes incredible poignancy. Similarly, Seita is a teenage boy who behaves with the sort of mixture of pride, compassion and hubris which you'd expect of someone his age. He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where. This leads him to make mistakes: possibly the most obvious one being where he fails to take the farmer's advice, swallow his pride and ask his nasty aunt to take them back in again. You would probably have to say his decision not to even try - to go it alone instead, was a very bad one, but - hello, people - here is a character who makes mistakes because he's actually human: a believable teenage boy in an extraordinary situation, who doesn't miraculously save the day, because his best judgment just isn't good enough.Of course, his aunt may well have knocked them back anyway. Who knows?Don't go into the film expecting tension, drama or even a tirade against war. It's a movie about the beauty and fragility of life and youth. If you think Japanese animation is all giant robots and superhuman schoolgirls, this could be the film which changes your mind. It's slow, poetic, beautiful and sad, and extraordinarily honest.I must be the only person who didn't cry during this film (and I mean, I get choked up during some Disney movies). Yes, it is sad, but its beauty and honesty is what I'll remember.NB: this review refers to the subtitled version of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was warned this movie would be emotional, but I had no idea just how understated that was. By the end, my friend and I were huddled together, pouring out tears I've never shed for any movie before. It was a mix of horror, empathy, sadness, and so many more emotions I can't even begin to list.Visions of this film have haunted me since first watching it, and I would find it hard to watch again, simply from it being so heart-wrenching. Only one movie has ever hit me hard enough to keep me from subjecting myself to it's strong emotions again (The thief, the cook, his wife and her lover).I strongly urge all to watch this, as it rises well about any films I've seen, anime or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is utterly emotionally draining whilst being rewarding at the same time.The animation is both realistic and stylized but that's not the point, the main focus of this film is the character development of the brother and sister protagonists. Their relationship is nothing short of beautiful and touching.And without spoiling anything I have to say that this film touched me in a way no other film has ever touched me in my adult life. One or two films have upset me and reduced me to watery eyes but Grave of the Fireflies had me in fits of sobbing despair. I was a mess! I'm talking total emotional breakdown. Couldn't talk without sobbing! One of the best films I have EVER seen, animated or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Occasionally there's a film that literally changes one's perceptions of the world. `Grave of the Fireflies' is one of those films. No movie ever made generates such an intense and powerful emotional response as this one. It's an animated film set in Japan during the closing days of World War II. Two children; a boy named Seita and his much younger sister Setsuko; must quickly learn to cope with life after their mother is killed during a fire-bombing raid by American B-29's. The film starts with the children and their mother preparing for the attack, then follows the children as they attempt to survive the death of their mother, and the possible death of their father, a naval officer serving aboard the Japanese heavy cruiser `Maya.' (A US submarine torpedoed the `Maya' in late October of 1944 during the battle of Leyte Gulf.)The story of two orphans trying to survive in war-ravaged Japan is not the subject of your typical light-hearted animated film. In fact it may be much too serious for anyone under the age of 14. The first five minutes of the film hits one like a sledgehammer ? by far the most emotional opening scene I've ever come across. I found myself already reaching for the tissues, and trying to choke back the tears.Yet there's more than just tragedy in `Grave of the Fireflies.' It is the most awesome love story one is ever likely to see. But it's far from the typical Hollywood idea of a love story. Instead of the usual highly attractive Hollywood actors of the opposite sex pining for one another in front of the camera, we have an animated Japanese brother and his much younger little sister. It's not a tale of romantic love, but one of `brotherly' love. Seita loves his little sister, and once he discovers that his mother has been killed in the bombing, he does everything he can to keep his sister from finding out about her horrible death. Then, with typical Japanese seriousness, he begins to immediately provide for and comfort Setsuko; she being the only member of his immediate family he has left. Though not stated in the film, it seems obvious that part of Seita's motivation for looking so carefully after his sister has to do with avoiding his own pain and despair having been left with NOTHING after the bombing attack. No mother, no father, no home. The war Japan is waging against the rest of the world takes its toll on these two little ones, without regard for their feelings or emotions.That which truly broke my heart into ten thousand tiny pieces was the selfless way Seita looked after his younger sister, and shielded her from the horrors all around, especially the lack of food. Films show us many things, some good, some evil, but rarely has any film shown how one person so unselfishly puts another ahead of them self. Seita does makes some mistakes in the way he goes about taking care of his sister, but I can't fault him for his love and his devotion. Who of us have always chosen the best path, the most perfect way of doing things? Surely not I! Seita's obvious love and devotion to Setsuko is the most moving and convicting thing I've ever come across on film. I use the word `convicting' because this movie convicted me of my own very selfish nature. `Grave of the Fireflies' caused me sadness not just because of Seita's brave attempts to take care of his little sister; but because he gave of himself so totally and completely, even though his sister was a liability to his own survival. I could not help to be convicted concerning all the many times there have been family and friends who have needed my help or understanding, but I ignored them in favor of `doing my own thing.' How sad I am for all those times I've ignored the suffering of others and their cries for help. This film showed the evil in my own heart ? something that I would not have noticed on my own. But now that the blinders have been removed, I can repent of my selfishness, and look for ways to help others, instead of avoiding them. Some Japanese anime I've seen are very much anti-American. But even though it's the Americans dropping the bombs in this film, there is no overt anti-American message. In many ways, the Japanese civilians are shown in as bad a light as is the American air and naval forces! Their hard hearts and stubborn ways are displayed on the screen without apology; and one can see how the plight of the two children is made even worst by the selfishness of the adults that they have come to rely upon. It would be easy for someone from `the West' (i.e. the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, etc.) to think that the two children depicted in this animated marvel were the exception, rather than the rule. They lived in very trying times, and surely children in this day and age do not have to go through experiences similar to Seita's and Setsuko's. Unfortunately, that's not the case. There are still major problems with orphans and unwanted children in the former communist block countries of Eastern Europe and Russia itself. There are also large numbers of unwanted children roaming the streets of China, India, Mongolia, and various other Asian nations. We may not here about it on the news, or hear our friends talk about it; but I assure you that there are literally millions of children around the world whose situation is no better, if not much worst than that of Seita and Setsuko. I am very thankful I had the honor of watching this film. I'm also very thankful for the people who put it together. But most of all, I'm very thankful for the positive impact it has had on my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutally honest and heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being my first Anime review I thought I'd start off with my one of my favourite pieces of work from who else but Studio Ghibli. Ghibli have rarely produced anime that doesn't fall short of great but Graveyard is something different indeed.Set in the aftermath of World War II, Graveyard is focused on the lives of a caring brother and his young sister (Setsuko and Seita) and how they struggle against both the elements of wartime and a depreciating Japanese empire. The most striking thing about Graveyard is probably how real everything seems. The animation is very unconventional to the likes of say Spirited Away or Laputa but in a good way. The horror of war is beautifully realised through the animation, whether it be the American destruction being shown or the bleak outlook on peoples lives, namely the two main characters. Thankfully it earns every shred of emotion it conveys through these two sympathetic characters that only the coldest of hearts wouldn't warm up to.Avoiding any Hollywood sentimentality, it is often a bleak and depressing perspective depicted but all the more brutally powerful in the process. With my eyes welling up through the duration of the film, it occured to me just how well the Director understands what raw heartfelt emotion is and how to play the audiences heart strings. Nevertheless nothing is shown in a heavy handed approach, no empthasis is put on the Americans nor is there any special attention taken to the war details. If anything the citizens of Japan are shown in the coldest light often giving little help to the plight of others, but demonstrating furthermore what desperate situation everyone is in.Takahata instead decides to focus on the plight of it's title characters against the background of war. With the empire of Japan in crisis and food shortages everywhere it is heart breaking to see a brother struggle to meet ends meet for his sister. Due to the approach taken it borders on being horrifying but fortunately the tone is changed with the spirit put into Setsuko's character. Much like 'The Pianist' the issue is not the war but the struggle and will to survive in it. This is clearly displayed in a plot that revolves around the downward spiral Setsuko trying to feed himself and more importantly the younger and more vulnerable sister Seita. The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly. It's the perfect mixture of such animation, realistic and highly likeable characters that makes the whole film one tearful experience. Dealing with such difficult issues it's very hard to imagine this being a film and if it was I don't think it would of been done as well.Part of the brilliance also comes from symbology and the association to many different worlds in such a understanding depiction. The child, Seita, is nothing short of perfection in child like behaviour happily oblivious to the desperate situation, amusing herself with simplicity and the quirks of nature and the outdoors. The older brother Setsuko who must carry the burdon of everything is also perfectly portrayed and to watch there decent is painful to say the least. To struggle is one thing but to have shock, shattered dreams and be depended on is something anyone can empthasise with.There may be some people who will shy away from Anime, disregarding it as a mere cartoon. To those people and everyone else I recommend Graveyard as the tonic, which can be appreciated by anyone with a heart and soul. Among the finest pieces of Anime created and one of the most touching war films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film that shows the true cost of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grave of the Fireflies" is one of the most ambitious, depressing, and quite frankly, best films that I've ever seen. I was nearly moved to tears by this film's brave treatment of such critical subject matter. Yes, it's an Anime' piece, but surprisingly, it came out in 1988, during a time where most Japanese animation films were either relentless bloodbaths, borderline pornography, or both.As a fan of the Anime' genre of film-making, many great pieces have achieved some sort of cult status here in America, yet none have really reached mainstream success. Some have broken through the barrier and have gained acceptance with American critics, like Katsuhiro Otomo's "Akira," or "Princess Mononoke," or "Spirited Away" (both films directed by Hayao Miyazaki). One that I've seen and has been barely mentioned by most critics is "Grave of the Fireflies."What we have with "Grave of the Fireflies," is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II. WWII was the costliest conflict in world history, with millions dead and thousands left to pick up the pieces.In the center of it, are the aforementioned two children, who are pretty much left to fend for themselves after their mother is killed in a bombing raid. Because their father is off fighting in the war and they have no way of contacting any other family, they're sent to live with their aunt, who is at first warm and welcoming to them, but eventually becomes very cruel and the children are forced to live in a nearby bomb shelter. From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.Very easily one of the best Anime' films that I've ever seen (or any animated film for that matter), I find it difficult to believe just how truly overlooked "Grave of the Fireflies" is. The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).We get a sense of the dread of the two lead characters, who watch as the world around them crumbles into heaps of ashes, and aircraft loom ominously overhead, dropping their deadly, incendiary cargo on unsuspecting Japanese villagers.The director, Isao Takahata, obviously has a special resentment of the war, but manages to avoid condemning it outright. The director instead lets us focus in on the conflict as seen through the eyes of the two children, who watch unflinchingly as the realities of their world begin to falter before them."Grave of the Fireflies" is a bold statement on the condition of the human soul during conflict. I probably shouldn't say this but I am anyways, but this film has to be the "Schindler's List" of animated pieces. It's brave, it's not overly sentimental, but it is relentless in its dramatization of a dangerous reality. It should be required viewing in any high school world history class.A beautiful film; not to be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"September 21, 1945...That was the night I died."-- SeitaReading war statistics and even seeing bloody images on television does not fully communicate the horror of war as well as the heartbreaking Grave of the Fireflies, an anime feature directed by Isao Takahata, a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki. The film tells the story of two children, Seita, a 14-year old boy and Setsuko, his 4-year old sister and their uphill struggle to survive the effects of American firebombing in Kobe near the end of World War II. Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave is a powerful experience that powerfully communicates the strength of the human spirit to carry on against overwhelming odds.Though despairing, the film does not resort to cheap melodrama to achieve its effect but delineates simple and direct images that are not watered-down to appeal to the children's market. It would indeed be too sad for most children under 13. In an interview with Cedric Littardi, AnimeLand magazine from 1992, Takahata said that he did not set out to depress the audience but to show a natural death, as opposed to a "scientific" death, the way most of us view it -- behind closed curtains in a sanitized hospital.Takahata in some ways softens the impact of the tragedy at the outset by showing Seita dying outside a subway station and his spirit reunited with his little sister Setsuko. The story is told by flashback as the two children are left alone to fend for themselves when their mother is killed in the bombing campaign. When their father is also killed in the Navy, they must struggle against starvation, the cruelty of an aunt they trusted, people's general indifference, and their own pride. Though both children eventually succumb to malnutrition (or radiation poisoning), the animation is so lyrical that it creates a magical, dream-like effect. This does not mask the tragedy but makes it all the more poignant. Nothing sums up the message of this film better than the beautiful poem, "I Come and Stand at Every Door" by Nazim Hikmat, one of the most important and influential figures in 20th-century Turkish literature.I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead, for I am dead.I'm only seven although I died. In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow.My hair was scorched by swirling flame. My eyes grew dim, my eyes grew blind. Death came and turned my bones to dust. And that was scattered by the wind.I need no fruit, I need no rice. I need no sweet, nor even bread. I ask for nothing for myself. For I am dead, for I am dead.All that I ask is that for peace. You fight today, you fight today. So that the children of this world. May live and grow and laugh and play. -- Nazim HikmetIn our day where our leaders are busily preparing for another war, it is important to remember the human cost of these plans and the untold suffering they will inevitably bring. Grave of the Fireflies should be required viewing in the Oval office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During my searches on Anime on the net one day I came across this title. This was 2 years ago.Then last week I went to an Anime convention and at the DVD stand I saw it. I bought it immediately.When I got home 3 days later I popped it in. I was warned about it being tragic but nothing could have prepared me for the wave of emotion that hit me while watching it. I was depressed for a whole day. Even thinking about it made me cry..This is the power of Grave Of The Fireflies..This is not your typical Dragonball Z/Sailormoon/Pokemon style anime. While I love Sailormoon and some Dragonball Z, Grave Of The Fireflies surpasses it by lightyears. I bought it expecting an epic movie like Ghost In The Shell or Akira but even those paled compared to this.We have here a story of a 14 year old boy(Seita) who loses his mother in a firebombing during World War 2. He then has to take care of his 4 year old sister(Setsuko). While at first they're taken in by his aunt the relationship between him and his aunt takes a turn for the worst. He then ends up on the street and the struggle begins... It doesn't take a genious to figure out that things get really depressing, yet I won't spoil the ending..All I have left to say is that you have to see this movie.. It's the most powerful movie I've ever seen... It's painful to watch but still you have to see it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent piece of work and one of the most heartbreaking tales ever told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Animation is often seen as a childish medium, and for good reason as kid's films often are animated. However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films. Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are. We follow Seita and Setsuko, a brother and sister that have lost their parents in the war and are now forced to fend for themselves in the war torn country. How the two go about doing that and the boy's development from a child to a (somewhat) responsible adult due to the change in the surroundings makes up the spine of the movie.I'm not a big fan of animation, but there are some films that are so great that a person's personal preferences are irrelevant, and this is one of those films. The animation is beautiful and certain scenes, including the air raids and anything with the fireflies are amazing works of art. The way the music blends with the images on screen is haunting and beautiful, and helps add to the tragedy of the story. Because we are able to care for the characters, the tragedy is increased ten fold and the story on the whole is a sad one, but few movies have ever matched up to this film's ending in terms of pure despair. The conclusion is absolutely gut wrenching to an extent that few movies have ever matched, let alone animated pictures. The fact that it's so plain and blatant, with no attempt to console the audience takes the tragedy to a whole new level and I don't doubt that many audience members will be holding back tears upon the film's conclusion.This film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great animated films of all time Grave of Fireflies tells the story of a couple of kids as the try to survive in war time Japan. What happens to them should be seen by anyone thinking of starting a war since it tells very graphically what happens to those often forgotten, the children.Like its companion piece, Barefoot Gen, which tells the story of survivors of atomic bombing and the horrors that were experienced by those unlucky enough not to have been killed out right, this film proves that war is hell for everyone, especially the children.Its very hard to send anyone out to see this unhappy little film (The previously mentioned Barefoot Gen spawned sequels, this has not) but at the same time you owe it to yourself to experience, however distantly what sort of monster we unleash upon the world every time we go to war. It helps that however depressing this is, its also a damn good and incredibly compelling story.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.The story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun or even Schindler's List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we're not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.This is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren't moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**I saw "Hotaro no haka" on german TV the other day and it has changed my life! Never have I been so moved by a film in my whole life. I cried and cried and cried. Since then I can´t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.After the movie I went upstairs to the bedroom, where my 3-year-old daughter was sleeping. I woke her up and took her in my arms. In the way she talks and acts she is just like Setsuko, one of the main characters in the film. And I can´t help feeling like Seita, her brother - because my daughter and I are alone since my wife left us a few months ago.I found one of the most touching scenes was the one where the dying Setsuko starts sucking the buttons she collected, because she ran out of her special sweets. I will also never forget how her brother cremates her after having tried everything to save his little sister. The most depressing thing with this movie is: you feel so helpless. You think: Man, I wish I could have helped those kids.This movie has changed my whole attitude to life. All the problems you may have - they become so small. Watch it and you´ll be a different person.Michael Saunders</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartrendering, moving masterpiece from Isao Takahata, and a triumph for animation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly one of Studio Ghibli's greatest crowning achievements, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is a brilliant masterpiece fully deserving of a place in any of the best movies ever made. Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as cliché, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.Based on an autobiography by Akiyuki Nosaka, the film, set during the bombing of Japan in --of all times-- World War II, centers on Seita, a loving, headstrong Navy soldier's son and his innocent little sister, Setsuko. Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start, when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s. Mom is seriously wounded and found wrapped in bandages at a hospital, where she dies shortly after. The children move to Nishinomiya to stay with their aunt. Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out. After butting heads with Auntie long enough, the children decide to run away, setting up home in an abandoned cave by the lake. Both try by all means to live off of vegetables or whatever food they can afford to trade and/or steal, to no avail....The outcome of the story is actually showcased at the opening of the movie, where we see a ghostly specter of Seita watching a more malnourished version of himself die a painful, lonely death at a train station. Indeed, as we see how these events came to pass, we find ourselves rooting for Seita and Setsuko to find a way to stay alive, but alas, it is not to be, given Seita's stubborn pride. The overall tone of the movie is of a very tragic nature--even such lighthearted moments as the aforementioned sequences involving Seita and Setsuko playing around the house or gathering fireflies as lights for their cave are all tainted with a touch of sadness, for we know that these brief scenes of happiness will not last.Who is to blame for the plight of these children? The movie never addresses this question to the audience, nor does it really care to. It would be easy for director Isao Takahata to make this an anti-American movie, but he does better than that. Instead, he aptly conveys that war can spell serious--and deadly--consequences for victims. He also eschews casting any character as a hero or villain, and instead makes this a very human story, with no clear-cut "good" or "bad" characters. The aunt, for example, is not evil; she is merely an angry, desperate woman who is only struggling to survive just as much as Seita and Setsuko are. Atrocious as her treatment of the children is, we somehow never see her as a true baddie, but a very flawed, multi-faceted human being.Normally one would think of this kind of story as suitable for live-action, but GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES proves that it can be told through the art of animation as well. This is no mindless showcase of gorgeous visuals--although the artistic merits of the movie are, as with Ghibli productions, sumptuous and at times breathtaking--but a display of real characters struggling with very tangible emotions. And the most amazing accomplishment about this movie is how much we grow to care for Seita and Setsuko--their inseparable bond of love and companionship is the heart and soul behind the movie.There are long stretches of silence on the soundtrack, with music used very sparingly, yet the movie is all the more powerful for it. The most effective moment is where we hear a scratchy rendition of "Home, Sweet Home" over a montage of Setsuko playing by the shelter. It's a simplistic, sweet, yet very saddening moment that not only works in the context of the movie, but on its own as well.I don't normally say this in my reviews, but I would definitely recommend watching this movie in its native language of Japanese for a truly powerful and memorable experience. That's not to imply, however, that the English dub, produced by New York-based Central Park Media, is inferior; on the contrary. It is, in fact, surprisingly good, with an effective lead in J. Robert Spencer and noteworthy cameo appearances by Anime voice-over actors Veronica Taylor, Crispin Freeman, and Dan Green. Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl, and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea). Still, for those who can't read subtitles, the dub is more than adequate (although not as high-profile as others that I've heard).Even in a genre as multi-faceted as Japanese Anime, there are few films that literally everyone really MUST see. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is one such movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I first really got into anime in High School. I'd grow up with Naussica and cartoons, and had just seen Akira, then my brother and I rented this.We sat through the whole thing without saying a word, then when the movie was over we didn't even talk.Not a simple film. Instead of just making the Americans out to be bad guys, the Japanese people in the children's village either through greed (their aunt) or through indifference (Gardener, Doctor), also play their part in the children's starvation and death. So it's not just about war, or anti-war, though I can't think a better movie to watch about war.The animation is perfect also. Absolutely beautiful colors.As another testament to the power of this movie, I decided to sponser a child through Compassion after watching it for the second time, 8 years later.Everyone should see this one, but be warned, it's not Akira or even a Miyazaki movie. Watch it with an open mind and heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Addressing my fellow reviewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the first time, I have decided to write a comment. You have seen enough reviews and ratings (and rantings). I prefer to address the commmon ways in which this movie has been misinterpreted.Many reviewers, both American and others, seem to have mistaken this movie for either a tear jerker or a political statement. In essence, it is neither. The novel it is based on is simply an expression of the guilt and pain felt by the author.To those who feel that it is a politically motivated story, or it only portrays suffering on part of the Japanese: Quite simply...it is not. The war scenes are not there for drama, they are there to place the situation into context. It is my opinion that your personal prejudices are coming into play. Being a patriotic American, I can state (not without shame) that there are plenty of mindless American movies which portray Americans as either heroes or victims (usually both) and their purpose (as with all flicks) is $. It is my sincere opinion that Akiyuki Nosaka's motives were far purer when he wrote this. He was looking for closure and writing a tribute to his sister at the same time.To those who feel revulsion towards Seita and feel that the war scenes were pointless: As mentioned earlier, all the the war scenes do is place the story in context. They are not there to excuse Seita's actions in any way. The story clearly shows that there is no absolution for Seita (Akiyuki Nosaka's alter-ego). He bares his shortcomings and imperfections (as seen from his own eyes) for the world to see and feel repulsed by in the hope to find some solace for his own guilty heart. I've dragged this on far too long and I have a test tomorrow morning.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grave of the Fireflies Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on IMDb.Japanese animation is something that has always been seen as a different expanse from the animation that we get here in America. Not to say that those films are bad, but the things that we see from oversees in this area are getting to be quite impressive. One studio in particular, the Japanese Disney, if you will, Studio Ghibli. Best known as the creative force behind Spirited Away and other Miyazaki films, we forget to see some of the other films that have come from the minds that reside there in. I am talking of Isao Takahata, always by Miyazaki's side, but never really given the credit he deserves. Without this man, there wouldn't be a Studio Ghibli. He is a key character in the development of any and all films to come from the studio, and most likely created the best feature to come forth."Grave of the Fireflies" is, quite possibly, the best animated feature of our time. When a film is done without a camera, when acting is without seeing your actors, and when cinematography is but a pencil line, you have to think about how to rate such a movie. Well, this is the standard on which all animation should be based. The movie is subtle in everything it conveys, but subtle in a way where it can't be ignored. You feel for these characters represented on that screen, and it makes you forget that you aren't watching something "animated". The truly beautiful thing about this movie is that as you watch the film, you want to see good things happen to these kids...Yet, as the movie opens, you see the main character, a boy named Seita, die right before your eyes. Immediate and profound. The film opens, and then you have a narration heard over head, that goes like this..."In 1945, on the night of September 21, I died." You hear this almost omniscient voice as the visual shows a boy, tattered and bone thin, propped against a pillar in a train station. Then, as the narrative comes to a close, the boy slouches over, and says in a final breath, "Setsuko". Not in anyway is this "cartoony" either, his eyes remain open, his mouth agape, and you can just sense that this is the main character of our story. Our "hero" is destined to die, and you have to watch the movie show it as it enfolds. A young child will die, and there is no stopping that from coming, no matter how attached you get to that boy. He will die. How harrowing is that? It gets worse when you see the corpse being riddled of its possessions by a security guard. Welcome to the movie. Like many films, though this has a "G" rating, you have to see where I stand on that. Already this movie is too much for a child to handle or grasp, and that rating will be misinterpreted as something of a children's movie. Though, being animated, it already has that covered. It's sad, in my opinion, that such a good film as this will remain lost to so many because of simple thinking like that.The movie has you know that all hope you will gain for these characters is futile, that life is never that easy. To keep you realizing this, they have the spirits, or Rei, of Seita and Setsuko (his younger sister) watching on as the events unfold. They appear at times throughout the film where the emotions are high, to keep you in this mold of reality. That means the whole movie is one big flashback, in a sense, but that really doesn't matter. It's the story of two children, lost in the slew of war. People are harsh, and war is unfair. Yoou can't choose who is effected by war, because everyone is, and these are the things that this movie causes you to realize. Other movies involving war have shown this, but it is from the eyes of a child that this gains it's impact. They never lose their innocence, and that is what makes this story so compelling. They are just kids. I'm not going to ruin the events of the story for you all, I wouldn't want to tarnish the way you view this film in the least. I will, however, like to sincerely recommend that you find this film, and that you watch it, with no stereotypes of animation. You haven't seen something like this, trust me. It belongs on the list of great war movies, but also on one of the greatest stories ever told. Compelling through and through, I have bought three versions of the movie. Subtitled is best, as it shows not only the original intent, but the true nature of the films culture. This movie remains one of the focal points in the argument of "anime" being much more than animated movies from Japan. They can be like any other film, and at times they can beat out most other films,and this is the example to prove it. A beautiful movie, and one that should be seen by anyone who respects movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hard to recover from, impossible to forget"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those reviews where I will say at the outset that, if you haven't yet seen the film, you should go see it. As soon as (or even before, if you're the impatient type) you read this review, I urge you to run out and buy or rent it.Because my words simply cannot convey what Isao Takahata's animated masterpiece Hotaru no haka conveys.Known in the English-speaking world as Grave of the Fireflies or, in some countries, Tombstone for Fireflies, Hotaru no haka is the single most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. As a work of art, it ranks among Picasso's Guernica and Elgar's cello concerto. It succeeds where many American films?like Fahrenheit 9/11, Apocalypse Now, and even Schindler's List?simply don't. Hotaru no haka is a grim depiction of innocence lost, not just of its two young protagonists, but of the entire Japanese nation.The story centers around two children: Seita, who is about thirteen; and his younger sister Setsuko, who is four. Their mother dies of wounds when their town is attacked during the firebombing of Japan in World War II, and they go to live with an aunt. While kind at first, she grows to resent the two siblings she must now feed and shelter?why can't Seita "work for the war effort," as his cousin and uncle are doing? Seita and Setsuko eventually set out on their own to live in an abandoned shelter. But food is hard to come by, and they gradually succumb to malnutrition.Yes, they die. That is obvious from the film's exposition, which shows Seita sitting ragged and obviously malnourished in a train station, a mysterious tin on his person. A janitor throws the tin into the night, where fireflies encircle it and the spirit of Setsuko emerges. She joins her brother's ghost, they board a train to the next world, and the story is told in flashback. "September 21, 1945... that was the night I died" is the opening line.The interesting thing about this film is that, although it is Japanese, it neither victimizes the Japanese nor demonizes the Americans. In fact, its deepest disdain is reserved perhaps for the Japanese people themselves, who turn a cold shoulder to the suffering of their children and fellow citizens. Takahata shows us that the true casualty of war is not life, but innocence.The animation, while in the stylized animé tradition, is rooted in realism and rich detail; and, while it strikingly depicts the tragic demise of the characters, it also has many moments of beauty. There is much to be admired visually in this film?hardly surprising, since it comes from Japan's legendary Studio Ghibli, which has produced the most breathtaking traditional animation that I have ever had the privilege to see.All these elements?story, symbolism, animation?combine to make one big emotional punch in the gut that is hard to recover from and impossible to forget. It's an animated film, sure; but it is one of the most bitingly real films you'll ever see, and the simple fact that it is not live-action doesn't diminish its power. If you have a night to ruin, watch Hotaru no haka. It's a film that you don't want to see, but one that you will never regret having seen.My inevitable "dub vs. sub" commentary: The DVD contains two versions of the film: one is a dubbed English version, and the other is the original Japanese with English subtitles. I urge you to do yourself a favor, and watch the Japanese version. I see no point in watching the dub, since you won't be showing Hotaru no haka to younger children anyways....right?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka) is one of the most powerful and beautifully made movies based on WWII.It is not about the leaders or military, but about the people themselves. Two orphans Seita and Setsuko lost their home to the air bombs, where thrown out of the house of their angry Aunt and forced to live on their own in the bomb shelters.Some people have complained that this movie is pro-Tojo and anti-American, but it's not. It is just simply a point of view from the common folk of that country, and everyone of every country, whether in War or Peace, have a story to tell.Did you know that this movie is based off of the semi-true story of Akiyuki Nosaka, who also lost his sister to starvation. Feeling guilty of all this, he writes this story, with Seita's death symbolizing the slow mental dying in the poor man's mind.It is a powerful movie, I recommend this movie for everyone to see. It has a well meaning message of the hardships of WWII.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''Hotaru no Haka'' (Brazillian title : ''Túmulo dos Vagalumes'') is a very sad and moving film about the second war in Japan,focusing in the difficulties of a brother(Seita) and a sister(Setsuko).After their mother is killed in an air raid and their father was also killed working in Japan's navy army, Seita needs to be responsible for his little sister Setsuko,a very adorable and sweet little girl. They both go to their aunt's house to live, but after knowing that Setsuko and Seita are now orphans,their aunt changes her behavior and starts to be cruel and annoying with them. Seita stays tired of that, and decides that is best to him and Setsuko to live in a different place, that is a kind of an abandoned shelter. Having problems to find supplies and needing to steal to have something to he and Setsuko eat, Seita and Setsuko gradually starts to have many health problems. Setsuko even goes to the doctor, since she is with malnutrition and diarrhea, but in war times, everything gets even more difficult.Even if you are not an anime (japanese cartoons) fan, this movie is worth of watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extremely sensitive and poignant animated film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most touching stories I have ever seen. Everything about it clicked beautifully. It was sensitive and emotional, without feeling sappy or too manipulative.The contrast between a teenage boy and a little girl trying to live their lives, and the ravages of war around them was a very strong and moving idea.The standard conceits of anime with large sappy eyes and small mouth movements with short pithy dialog wasn't at all distracting in this.(Spoiler warning)One of my favorite scenes is the sequence when Seito gets caught for stealing and is taken to the police, thus forced to abandon his little sister. The officer turns out to be very understanding, and the young teen Seito is quickly released; only to find that his sister has followed him into town, and is more concerned for him than her own well-being. The contrasts and emotions of the scene are very deep and effective. I loved it because it said a lot without being too heavy-handed.In fact, one of the greatest attributes of this story is its gentle underhanded approach. A few little moments add up to a great deal of philosophical themes, which whole pages of text couldn't really describe.It's really great to see an animated film deal with a very serious and tragic subject matter, once in a while.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Graveyard for fireflies is a heart rendering animated tale from japan that is based on the events of world war II invasion of japan by America. The movie highlights the evils of war and shows in detail the way lives of normal people get affected by political motives of power hungry leaders. The story revolves around a boy and his young sister. Following the invasion by America, their happy lives are overturned and are left to face the hardships they had never expected. The beautiful thing to see, however, is their will to fight to adjust to deteriorating situations around them. As the story goes on, their resilience is finally overtaken by acute shortage of basic supplies. The hardest part of the movie to watch is how it leaves the brother helpless. The boy shows exceptional courage for his age, and does his best, even goes out of the way at times, just to help keep his little sister happy and comfortable. Being a navy officer's son, he is filled with dignity and tries to keep it till the end. However, some viewers may find his dignity throwing few shades of ego in certain crucial moments of the film that they might feel, could have changed their situation, had he compromised. Although the brother has a strong presence in the story, i t is the sister that wins hearts by her cuteness. The simple words, and child behaviour, is excellently depicted in her character. There are things she says during the movie that will leave you filled with emotions - warmth, joy, sadness.. you get attached to her the minute she appears in the movie. You go along with her sharing her joys and pains.The characterisation is so powerful that the viewers end up saying prayers for her in their hearts.This is one story that will remain close to your heart for a long, long time. Words will not do justice to the movie, you will have to watch it. A word of warning though - you will feel depressed for a day to a month depending upon how emotional you are. An excellent movie, 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique combination of Italian neorealism and Yasujiro Ozu's Japanese drama for probably the best animation film out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this movie from Roger Ebert's list of great movies, so I decided to give it a try. Anime is a recent interest of mine, and I was impressed with "Spirited Away" and "Princess Mononoke", but only a faint warning from others about this movie was the only preparation I had for the ninety-some minutes of this film. This film was nothing like "Spirited Away" or "Princess Mononoke". For an animation film, "Grave of the Fireflies" surprised me in the style it was portrayed. The atmosphere of this movie was seemingly like the Italian neorealist films of the 1950s, like De Sica's "Umberto D.", but it also had the precision and care of what was portrayed on the screen like Yasujiro Ozu and his "Tokyo Story", "Floating Weeds", and his other masterpieces.Like De Sica and other Italian neorealist directors, "Grave of the Fireflies" simply portrays life as it truly is; in this movie it was the aftermath of the World War II bombings on a Japanese town. Nothing is held back, but nothing is shoved into your face and fabricated like some popular Vietnam War movies. Like Japanese directors like Ozu, there is a great care in how this story is portrayed. Pillow shots are utilized greatly in this movie; that means that a scene will be played out, and then there will be static shots of scenery (not necessarily have to be stunningly beautiful), but it gives the audience some time to contemplate on what happened. For only a ninety-minute film, "Greve of the Fireflies" is a very well-developed movie with only what is essential, with great and peaceful pillow shots for contemplation and meditation. Also like Ozu especially, this movie utilizes many still shots, especially in key scenes where the emotions are at its unprecedented peaks for an animation film. Rarely will the background frames move, except in displaying panoramic views. And also like Ozu, this movie keeps the focus on family struggles, always a favorite topic for Yasujiro Ozu. It is about a teenager boy and his younger sister trying to cope with the aftermath of a bombing on their town. That is all I will say about the plot of this film.The combination of this Italian neorealism and Yasujiro Ozu's camera-like ethics make this film a great film to watch. But because this film is an animated film, the influential combinations can take almost anybody by surprise. Animation can simplify matters in the mise-en-scene to amplify the essential and thus creating more emotion out of this film. But there is so much care in this film that it deserves its respect as probably one of the best movies (real or animated) ever. Since it is portrayed in an everyday-type feeling, the emotions running are powerful. This is definitely the best animation film ever, and can be on the list of the top twenty most powerful films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great animation classics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me put it this way. When I was five, I would wake up early every morning to watch my favorite cartoons. One night, I woke up way early than usual. It must have been around three o' clock. Anyway, I did what I usually did. I watched television. Nothing was on, so I switched it to channel 8 and laid down. There would always be weird interesting stuff on that channel that I used to love watching. A few minutes had passed with me watching whatever was on this channel ans eventually, GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES came on. At that time, I had never seen a serious animated film. The film started and there were two ghosts. I remember seeing how peaceful the whole thing seemed and feeling that it was strange that it wasn't a scary type of film. However, I probably shouldn't have assumed that it wasn't a scary film at that point. Soon after, there were terrifying scenes of destruction and chaos with people getting shot and butchered. A boy and his baby sister were caught up in it all and were desperately trying to get away. I saw these two siblings and the love and care that he had for his younger sister and immediately broke into tears. At that time, I had never seen a film where people cared about each other in such an honest and unflinching way. It was shocking to me in a way that I had seen a film that displayed so much love and desperation. The film continued and their trials became more and more horrific. By the end of the film, I could barely breathe. The film had hit me so hard in my heart that I felt wounded. I have never feared and loved a film both at the same time as much as I had for GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES. When the film was over, I fell asleep crying. When I awoke, I wondered if what I had watched was a dream. Could such a film ever even exist? I had been afraid to find out, but inside I yearned to learn more about it. Fast forward thirteen years later and I know more about it than I had when I was younger. I haven't seen it since, but I remember it as clearly as possible. I remember the music, the images, the emotion, the love, etc... I can never forget this film. Will I ever decide to pick it up and view it a second time? Absolutely. I just need to make sure that I know what I will get into if I watch it again. It's a touching piece of work and one that will go down in history as one of the most emotional and beautiful films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the most powerful movie i have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i just finished the movie and if not for my 2 dogs I would have to drive to someones house at 2am because I could not be alone right now. I dare not give anything away but I will say that the movie really got to me. I consider myself very educated and informed about the most troubling issues facing the planet I live on, but this movie really shook me up. I had to hold back tears with all my might because I was scared to let go, I was afraid because the movie, a cartoon, became so real I forgot I was watching a movie, I was completely lost in the story and it was scary. A cartoon should not be able to do that. Please watch the movie and remember it is a true story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One for the unknown victims.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just marvellous! This hearty masterpiece of Japanese animation is incredibly moving, sincere, haunting and captivating in detailing the special bond between brother and sister caught up in the horrifying and unforgiving face of war. It guides us on one really tragic, but rewarding trip where it truly has an impact. Never does it get overwrought or push itself onto the viewer, but still it manages to leave a lump in your throat and have you emotionally drained when the credits begin to roll. This one is not afraid to stay gloomy, and because you know the outcome at the beginning, this makes the significance of the story's journey more potentate in its increasing pain and devastation. By that alone, the wonderfully textured plot doesn't take the easy way out and the reality of the situation is never lost because it's animated.Staying simple and focused, kept it rather flawless in its in-depth story telling of emotional pride and lasting effects. Slow it might be, but there's too much subtle richness within its characters, premise and visuals to really bother about the loose pacing and lack of action. Isao Takahata adapts the novel of Akiyuki Nosaka, and gets us deeply involved with the civilians, and the mere war stays in the background. A contrast between two different worlds, one being the war itself and secondly the one the two children find themselves in to forget it. Namely those scenes where they're experiencing the beauty and freeness of nature (at if they might never get that chance again) and those sequences with the fireflies admirably paint the feelings of what's to come. The budding relationship between Seita and Setsuko is tremendously done, innocent and full of colour. Even capturing the Japanese citizens and families in this cold plight is believability achieved, as it throws questions, issues and metaphorical messages. These people (including our two central characters) are doing it hard, but their wills won't collapse after what they've been through, but things do take their toll when everything you ever care for can suddenly vanish and the heartache turns to utter numbness. Because what kept you living, is no longer there to hold you.Breathing heavily on the mood is the soft, lovely musical score that certainly weeps with its melodic tone. The vivid animation is gorgeously crisp and enchanting, and the background scenery is profoundly vivid and convincing. Many beautiful, striking illustrations are framed with a sincere touch, where darkness treads neatly together with the lighter moments. What a delightfully effective and soulful meditation piece of sublime art by director/writer Isao Takahata. This one has plenty to say on the topic at hand, and it gets even more relevant everyday.Magnificently heart-wrenching and sensitive war-time story on the people who find themselves dealing with the unbearable consequences of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tears swell up in my eyes just thinking about this movie. To simply give it a rating or praise would not do it justice. Keeping that in mind, this is still the best movie I have ever seen. It has changed my life. After watching this movie, I keep asking myself why do we kill each other? What drives this putrid hatred in us that pushes us to war? Can't we see that no one wins in war...no one wins anything. We only lose loved ones and cause unbearable pain and suffering on each other and for what? Our country? This mass of inanimate land? Or perhaps some perverse idea of honor and pride? What honor is there in killing Seita and Setsuko?I can't say anymore about this movie... You simply must watch it to feel its awesome power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotion-filled film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most emotional films i have seen. Do not make the mistake of thinking that this movie will not be as emotional as some have told you, many make this mistake because it is an animated feature. This is a great film, and the fact that is animated, i think, only adds to it's realism. This is such a great film because it contains much more than the story of a boy and his sister, it illustrates the tragedies of ww2 and what many Japanese people had to suffer trough. the emotions that you will experience during this film prove to be but a glimpse of what the Japanese went trough. Very quickly you forget that these characters are animated, you become involved in their world and get to know them as people. you will suffer trough their tragedies and will hopefully come out of this experience knowing not only more about them, but knowing more about yourself as well. If you have ever wanted to experience a film that will move you and not only show you a different perspective on ww2, but also help you learn more about how you relate to others, i highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best film ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Grave of the Fireflies is the best film ever made, animated or otherwise. I have never been so affected by a movie for so long afterwards, and I have watched a lot of movies. It stuns you with its truth. I purchased this movie not knowing anything about it 2 days ago, and sat down to watch it with my 20 year old daughter. I expected good things, but this was something else. The story line has been well documented on this site, so I won't dive into that. Needless to say, it will affect you for days after watching it, no kidding. We are both still sniffling. It's the attention to the subtle detail that makes you identify with the charecters. Everyone knows a toddler like Setsuko, and the quiet strength of Seito. There is a scene where Seito and Setsuko are watching the stars at night (after going to the toilet, no less) and he tells his younger sister about the days before the war. When he looks over, she is asleep. He goes to put his arm around her to cuddle up. I thought the would have panned out on that scene and left it at that for emotional impact. But no, what does the little girl do but throw his arms off her (much like my own toddler would do). The whole movie is like that. The ultimate message about the real casulties of war, the innocents, who suffer and endure events not of their own making, is heartbraking. Buy/rent this movie and be haunted forever. It will change the way you look at things and you will be a better person for it.</fullReview>

This is the first movie that made me cry and I've cried during the movie and I've cried well after the movie was over. I finally stopped crying and decided to write this review (my first movie review) and typing these words thinking about the movie brought tears into my eyes again. I'm a pretty tough guy and I rarely get emotional, but boy did this movie hit me hard.I think everybody should see this movie, even though it's such a heart wrenching emotional experience.

		<shortDescription>Tragic yet Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start by saying that at the time of writing this review, I am 18 years old. I had never cried whilst watching a movie. I was borderline teary watching the Australian film "Red Dog", and absolutely crying on the inside during "Magnolia" and "Requiem for a Dream"; but never had a film completely moved me to emotionally produce tears. Until I watched Isao Takahata's "Grave of the Fireflies". Never has a film conveyed so much sorrow, tragedy and depression using the form of animation. It's deeply emotional on one hand, but undoubtedly beautiful on the other. Call it flawed, call it manipulative, call it whatever you want; but I do feel that if you express a great deal of negativity towards this film, then you have completely missed the rewarding experience.The film is set during the World War II period and centres on the story of a boy named Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi) and his much younger sister Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi). Setsuko is na?ve and fragile, and Seita's primary focus is on keeping the two of them alive during this time of tragedy. They want to be happy, but during a time like this, it's near on impossible to do so. He is 14, she is 4. The sense of hopelessness is drawn up early on. The opening sequence shows our young hero dying of starvation in a train station. The rest of the world moves along as he and others lay against poles waiting for the death to reach them. It's a devastating sight. No this is not the teary part. Watch the film as it cuts back to the beginning of their story. to see the power that will come over you and have you reaching for the tissues.Michio Mamiya's score is enough to convey the harrowing atmosphere. It elevates at times, matched with light-scaled animation, but will drop faster than a bomb into the deep pits of despair as we follow these two children on their quest to stay alive. Prepare to be shaken. The children are moved around, never wholly welcome anywhere, Seita is caught stealing to survive, hope is seemingly out-of-reach. But do not be put off by what I've said. No one who is interested in the power of cinema should dare miss it. It's a Masterpiece. One of the greatest war films and animated films ever made. Period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grave Of The Fireflies is one of the very best anime films there is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave Of The Fireflies (directed by Isao Takahata) is one of the true classics of anime. Along with Spirited Away it's my favourite film by Studio Ghibli. Even though the film is an anime it's different from anything that's typically associated with the medium. There is no "end of the world" scenario here, or characters with big eyes and coloured hair, or plenty of slapstick humour. Instead, what Grave Of The Fireflies offers is a believable drama set during the second World War. Near the end of the war a boy named Seita and his five-year-old sister Setsuko have been made homeless because their mother was killed and their house was burned down during the firebombing in Kobe. Their father is in service to the Japanese Imperial Navy, but he was probably killed in action. Eventually the children find themselves in a grim situation. They have to live outside, and food is very hard to come by as a result of the widespread famine. Seita tries everything he can to acquire food for himself and his little sister. We get to see their struggle, and how they try to stay positive during this difficult time. The story is focused on the two children. There's hardly any discussion about Japan's war with America. In fact, I think the Americans aren't even mentioned in the dialogue. As is to be expected from a Ghibli film the animation in Grave Of The Fireflies is top rate. The music is effective. It helps make some scenes very moving. Some famous baroque and classical pieces by composers like Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Mozart and Boccherini were included too. Appropriately aged children were cast in the roles of Seita and Setsuko. Some anime reviewers have named Grave Of The Fireflies the greatest anime there is. Having seen the film I understand why they'd say that. Before watching the film I heard that it makes viewers cry because it's very moving. I didn't cry, but that's because I tried very hard not to. After that I still had to blow my nose. Film critic Roger Ebert considers Grave Of The Fireflies to be one of the most powerful anti-war movies ever made. He included the film in his Great Movies list. The AllMovie guide awarded the film a rating of 5 out of 5 stars. The only other anime films to earn the perfect rating are Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Akira. I don't really care about ratings, but this is one of the few anime films that deserves the hype.</fullReview>

Never wanted to cry on my birthday, but couldn't help it. A tale of a brother and his kid sister in WW2 Japan, which actually tells you the suffering of a common man had a family, a life, a smile and a future, but lost everything for no fault of his own. It's so touching that you cannot help breaking down to tears. I won't reveal the plot here, but I'll suggest you watch the Japanese version with English subs. This is surely the one which will move you to the core, it felt like I lost something too, when the movie ended, and 'she never woke up'. Great stuff - 10/10 (or even 11/10 - as an anime moved me more than a human film)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I'm usually your typical Die-Hard, Guns Blazing, Sword Swinging, Magic Wielding Anime fan! So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that "Grave of the Fire Flies" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites. And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed) That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever.This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over...Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand. I'm temped to say it's a life changing experience, certainly has been for me. The rest I leave to you to decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Takahata's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the famous war films ever made, like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Cross of Iron", usually try to show the film and the war from the point of view of soldiers, those who fought in there. It is rare to see a film from the point of view of the innocent victims of the war. Probably the most famous film of victims is Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List". Even rarer is an animated film of victims of war. Animations in western countries are usually labeled as children's stuff, so it is no wonder Disney has refused to distribute this film, one of the Studio Ghibli's greatest works."September 21, 1945? that was the night I died"With those words starts director Isao Takahata's most famous film, "Grave of the Fireflies" (Hotaru no haka, 1988). Unlike his long time friend and colleague Hayao Miyazaki, Takahata prefers to leave fantasy elements in his films to minimum. This is the way how Takahata amazes viewers. If Miyazaki's fantastic visions make our jaws drop to floor with amazement, Takahata's close to reality stories touch us deeply by hitting our emotions. And "Grave of the Fireflies" certainly does that masterly, being the only film that has ever managed to move me to the point of tears (and I am *not* a teary guy).The film, based on a novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, tells the story of a young boy named Seita, who with his little sister Setsuko, lives in the 1940's Japan, during the World War II. After loosing their mother during a bombing, Seita does everything in his power to create an illusion for Setsuko that things are fine and there is nothing to worry about. The film has been often blamed of being too depressing and having a sad end, but I think it's the opposite. Of course this certainly is not the kind of film to make you smile, but it is already revealed in the beginning that both brother and sister will die. So when we reach the end of the movie, with an image of them as spirits, sitting on a bench looking happy and healthy, with a modern day city around them, this is actually a happy ending after all the suffering they went through.It's very hard to say exactly why this film should deserve full stars from me. It just does. It's full of little beautiful scenes that instantly have an effect on you, accompanied by Michio Mamiya's peaceful music. Maybe the fact that it can make me wonder why it is so good is the proof enough to make it a masterpiece. And that is what "Grave of the Fireflies" is; a masterpiece. One of the most amazing films from Studio Ghibli and Isao Takahata's most famous film. And definitely the ultimate proof that animations can be used for other than children's stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a time when Disney and Pixar milk false sentiment for all its worth, here is a film which delivers not sentimentality, but truth. The characterisation of the little girl is charming: cute but intensely realistic. The film grips with its depiction of the aftermath of a fire bombing and has a political sub-theme but it is the little girl who is our real concern. We laugh with her, fear for her - and ultimately despair with her. The ending is gut-wrenching - one of the most moving endings my family has ever seen ..... my 20 year old son had to leave the room! If you watch only one film about war, watch this.Whilst the art work is deceptively simple it easily surpasses modern animation and clearly paved the way for films like 'Spirited Away'. Unlike most Japanese films the narrative is easy to follow and (rare in Japanese animation) never strays into fantasy or surrealism. The countryside is beautiful and is clearly intended to be seen in juxtaposition to the depiction of the damage war does. Part of that damage is also human: we see people degenerate and become selfish, desperate and de-sensitised but the little girl remains somehow spiritually untarnished ..... but not physically so.</fullReview>

This movie is so human. So very human. It will make you want to hug all of your loved ones just to make sure they are safe and happy.That this movie is animated doesn't hurt it a bit. In fact, it makes it better. Instead of connecting the characters that are so well-developed in the movie with an actor, you only connect them with the idea of a person you've created in your head. It's like reading a book. Without explicit visual cues to go by, one has to create the images in one's head. It makes the characters that much more powerful and moving because instead of being on a screen, they are in your head. That said, I could not get them out of my head for days.

		<fullReview>There is no denying that Studio Ghibli is the finest animation company ever and have made some of the most stunning pieces of cinema ever. The fact that they never fail to craft some of the most beautiful and compelling masterpieces proves the brilliance. Ghibli animators make films that are intelligent, fulfilling, complex and burst with joy. The animation is one that can appeal to people of all walks of life and perfectly sums up what cinema is all about. I've never once been disappointed by a Studio Ghibli work.Grave Of The Fireflies is certainly far from easy viewing and is one of the most harrowing war films ever made. When released in America Grave Of The Fireflies caused controversy because some people felt it was anti-American and the fact is that it's not. The film doesn't take sides to anyone and understands that everybody did awful and horrific things during WW2. One thing that is obvious when watching the film is the fact it's anti-war and shows how the innocent are the people who become the most effected.It's not easy to make films about subjects like this one because they become very emotional and hard to make realistic. Yet Grave Of The Fireflies succeeds in every way other war films don't. The story is a magnificent tale of love and friendship between an older brother and his young sister. The loss of innocence and the real-life brutality that these children see are something that nobody would ever want or be prepared for.The cinematography is beautiful and every frame of animation holds so much substance and inner beauty. There are very few films that manage to play with my emotions as easily as Grave Of The Fireflies because it remains a haunting study of a brother and sister's friendship. I found it hard not to cry and I'll be honest I did cry towards the end of the film. The fact that you fall in love with the characters and become attached to their personality, surroundings and situations is why it remains so provocative. The film's style is excellent and helps set a perfect mood. I love the use of operatic music at the end of the film as it was profoundly effecting.A genuine masterpiece of cinema, one of the greatest animations (anime), one of the greatest war films and one of the greatest films ever made. Recommended for anyone of any age, a film with mass appeal and wide range. Holds a wonderful message and a genuinely inspiring story. Sheer brilliance for what is such a daring piece of film-making.</fullReview>

Girls show it to you're boyfriends and see if they have a heart or not, ha ha. Not really, i watched it alone, I'm a guy and I hate tearing up in front of others.

		<fullReview>This movie is the most beautiful movie I had ever seen. No other movie touched me like this one did. For all you people who think all animation is kids stuff, you're wrong. Grave of the Fireflies is NOT for kids. I don't even know why the cover states it is rated 3 and up. It should be rated pg13 because it is much to sad for little kids. I watched Grave of the Fireflies about a year ago. My brother saw it on the internet, and after I did. I thought it was going to be violent, but that wasn't the case. It was beautiful and tear jerking. Before I saw Grave of the Fireflies I always thought A Walk to Remember or Titanic was the saddest movie. These movies are NOTHING compared to Grave of the Fireflies. Setsuko was so real. I have never seen any four year old in movies act like a real four year old like her. It brought me to tears to see her die. But then again, Grave of the Fireflies is also sort of happy. At the beginning and the end you see that both Seita and Setsuko are together again, and there is no more suffering. Grave of the Fireflies shows what a war could do to people. Do we really think about what happens to the children and their families during a war?Thank you Isao Takahata for producing such a masterpiece! Grave of the Fireflies is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Have Been Deeply Affected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cried watching this film, something I haven't done in years. It's been two days since I saw it and I still can't get it out of my head. My wife and I have talked much more about this film than most others and I have spent some time researching the film online. Never has a film hit me on such a personal level. I am the father of two small children and after seeing this film I went into their rooms while they slept and kissed them and whispered that I love them.Having done some research on the author and the truth behind the story I realize it has lots of symbolism and literary and cultural references which I as a Westerner cannot understand, so I'll keep my comments on the personal level. The film gets its message across that in war, it is the most vulnerable of society who suffer the most. It troubled me because as an American I don't see the daily struggle for existence in regions torn by war and hunger(Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Balkans, and possibly Iraq to name a few of many conflicts). It also troubled me that my country really doesn't care either. As a father of a 5 year old son and a 2 year old daughter, I want the suffering of Seita and Setsuko to stop and someone to acknowledge and help their emotional pain as well as their hunger. As a parent, I dread the thought of my children being without anyone or being in their situation. As a kid I read lots of WWII books and knew that we had firebombed several Japanese cities and that Navy fighters were strafing small towns. This film made all that history seem very real and present. As an evangelical Christian, it also reinforces for me how cruel and how kind people can be and how lost we truly are.I read Roger Ebert's review of this film and I agree with him that it is one of the best I have ever seen, because it troubled me deeply on a personal and external level. I can't look at my daughter now and not think of Setsuko and her beauty, sadness, and innocence. See it, but don't see it alone. Remember it's not for children since it's more than a cartoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly devastating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's better not to learn too much about this film before watching it, for fear of spoiling it. I'd heard it described as the saddest film of all time, but even that didn't prepare me for what I saw.Speaking from the point of view of somebody who avoids animation as much as possible, I found this to be a piece of exceptional film-making. Use as many superlatives as you like: amazing, engrossing, compelling, outstanding, it all boils down to one important thing - this film tells a story that grips us with its exploration of the human condition. I imagine virtually everybody who watches it will be able to identify with it in some way or other.So forget this one's a cartoon and just go into it expecting a tale packed with emotion and feeling. And if you have to go back and watch the beginning again after you've seen it all the way through, that's fine too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an amazing film! Very rarely have I been moved this much by an animated film. Watership Down yes, Bambi yes, Secret of NIMH yes, Beauty and the Beast yes, Land Before Time yes, but Grave of the Fireflies is in a different league. A film that is once seen and never forgotten, a film that is beautiful, haunting and emotionally devastating. It is slow moving perhaps and "depressing" but it is very poignant as well. I find it very difficult to fight back tears at the film's end. The animation is amazingly detailed, the backgrounds and characters are drawn with such care and you just marvel at the detail that goes into it. The music is both haunting and melancholic and one of the main reasons why the film is as it is. The story is harrowing, as it details Seita and Setsuko's hopelessness. The characters are easy to relate, Setsuko isn't precocious or obnoxious, instead she is quite cute, and Seita shows real love for his sister as well as being a strong protagonist. There are many memorable sequences, but one that springs to mind is the one with the nocturnal fireflies, which is something of true melancholic beauty. Overall, a masterpiece, pure and simple. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To describe the emotion of this film in words is like trying to describe how food tastes to another specie, it just cannot be explained without experiencing it yourself. This movie will literally bring you to utter sadness within minutes and will continue to do so for 90 more. It will bring out a range of emotions throughout the film but most of them being heartbreaking scenes of turmoil and complete shock towards the events that unfold. But it is just beautiful in its delivery. The animation and dialog of both Seita and Setsuko makes you feel so much for them and this is why this film works so much. It will move you like no other movie and to that I applaud it. The animation is superb, beautiful landscapes, masterful drawings and an incredible use of color to which it is a visual masterpiece. The story tells of a brother andhis small sister in a fight against poverty during WW2. It is most definitely anti-war, but it does not point fingers, because it doesn't need to. It does not want the viewer to feel anger towards the circumstances of the war, it wants you to feel strong emotions for the consequences and effects it had on people DURING the war. This is an unforgettable piece of film that shows the sheer honesty Japan has towards the past events and I recommend it to anyone. Powerful, heartbreaking, upsetting, beautiful and utterly brilliant. Amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful haunting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I checked out this movie because I was looking for a film similar to Miyazaki's animated films. I was warned by my sister that this was a very very sad film but I decided to watch anyway.The first time I watched it I was completely haunted by the what if's that ran through my mind as other possibilities for a possible happy ending.Also the little girl Setsuko is so much like my own daughter and the fact that the older brother takes care of her...I found the story disconcerting because I have an older son and a little girl. I kept putting my children's faces over these animated characters faces.There is such a reality and innocence in the animated film that is sometimes overlooked but in this film it shines through. There are little things like the girl swinging her legs as she sits down on a train bench and crying as her brother pokes her (probably because her aunt just told her that her mother died) just shows some sweet drama of life that can be beautiful and you want to hold onto it. You want to keep these characters in your heart and not let go or at least I did.That said it was so sad that I determined not to watch it again, for the pain that I felt for these characters was real. I knew from my readings that lack of food was a major problem in Japan after WW II. I knew that things like this could have happened. Problem was I couldn't get the movie out of my mind so I decided to look more into it and study the movie and anything that was said about it. When I found out it was based loosely on a true story I decided to watch it again with my children. I felt like my children needed to know that there is suffering in the world. They were not affected as much as I was the first time.I understood it so much more the second time I watched it. The beginning made so much more sense to me the second time that I enjoyed it more.This is a beautiful movie and story. I recommend watching it and talking about it with your loved ones but at of course your own discretion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a truly beautiful example of Japanese animated cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>before i start i would like to mention that this is referring to the subtitled version of the movie, i have not viewed any English dubbed version.first off, before i saw this movie every review i read seemed to warn me to prepare for an extremely harrowing experience.. so i prepared myself and... was pleasantly surprised, my overall feeling having watched this movie is that it is quite simply one of the most beautiful and realistic examples of the anime genre.yes it is sad, the subject matter is not really a happy one, and i have to admit to having tears in my eyes during more than one scene. but the story is told in a very beautiful manner and there are plenty of happy moments to balance things out.we already know the outcome of the film within 5 minutes of it starting. what matters most is the journey along the way. the characterisations are very realistic with setsuko as probably the most realistic 4 year old I've ever seen in an anime movie. and seita as a normal teenage boy.. making decisions as he sees best, so maybe they aren't the best decisions he could have made but they are his none the less. i did not find the film to be overly gratuitous in its anti war message, and what little gore there was was confined to occasional scenes and over quickly. the art and animation was stunningly beautiful as i have come to expect from the incredible studio ghibli.highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest animated film ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a geeky teenager in the 90's who loved anime. The thing I liked about anime was that even though I was getting too old to watch cartoons, I could make the claim that in Japan cartoons were made for grown-ups and justify my love for them. I would go to Tower Records and rent every single anime as they came out and then copy them with two VCR's (90's version of torrenting) and this was released by Central Park Media (one of the three American companies releasing anime back then) so like all the others I rented and copied it. But oh my God this blew all the other stuff I was watching out of the water. IT made me cry, it made me feel. I HAD to show my parents this film to justify my love of anime.And I did, and my parents who really don't like cartoons both cried. Bawled. My dad says he still remembers it and that it haunted him. Anyways, fast forward to the present day, I am now an adult approaching my 40's, i have a family of my own, I've outgrown anime (let's be honest the majority of it is garbage) but my dad reminded me about this film, so I decided to watch it again all these years later to see if it would still hold up.I cried even more. Once you become a parent, as many other reviewers have said here, you put your loved ones faces on the animated characters and it makes it even more powerful. I don't know if this could have been even more powerful or more heart-wrenching if it was live action. You can watch it and because it's animated you can project onto the animated characters and setting even easier than if it was live-action. You can see war torn Kobe as your hometown, you can see it as Iraq, you can see it as Afghanistan, it makes the film all the more powerful. Being a dad now I watch a lot of cartoons, and all the Disney ones, and Pixar etc with my own little Setsuko...this film blows them all out of the water. This is indeed, the greatest animated film of all time if for nothing else than the fact that it is able to transcend the genre and shows the full unfiltered power of what the media is capable of showing. If you are a parent, or have little ones in your life this film will hit you harder, but even as a teenager it hit me hard. I think it shaped my views on war, and had a very profound affect on me. I don't understand the people who say they wouldn't watch this again because there is something strangely cathartic and beautiful about being able to bawl your eyes out. I guess people are afraid of their own vulnerability but I have to say, I enjoyed getting back in touch with that empathetic part of myself. It's strangely relaxing. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Studio Ghibli's Grave of the Fireflies is a lesser-known anime from the creative studio responsible for the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. The lack of fame is understandable due to the sadder side that Grave of the Fireflies brings to the table, but don't let that difference dissuade you. This masterpiece is arguably a more well-rounded story and should be on everyone's list of anime films to see. Starting off with a family in Japan during World War II, the bond between brother and sister is instantly there to see and is the main focal point of the feature. This is a relationship that everyone can see in their own lives, if you have siblings or not there will always be someone who in that situation you would protect and do absolutely anything for.After the death of their mother and the terrible treatment their relatives show them, they have no choice but to go it alone. Surviving on scraps of food, morsels they can steal and barter for. All seems to be going well for a while until the plot takes us down a slippery slope full of turbulent emotional conflict. Complications in their lives quickly arise, and without substantial nourishment and proper shelter they struggle to stay well.The end is expected but nonetheless manages to still bring a tear to the eye of any human?however, strangely, it is not entirely out of sadness that you cry. Their horrendous ordeal to survive is over. I have yet to meet someone who it hasn't touched and wholly convinced them how important family and friends are in their lives.Films depicting family bonds and sibling dependency are not uncommon but where some only scratch the surface Grave of the Fireflies brings a whole new side to the idea and will leave you with a lasting impression.Even if you don't enjoy films that leave you in tears this is a must- watch Ghibli classic. Go home, get some ice cream, find someone you love and, with them, watch these 89 minutes of story-telling mastery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A moving masterpiece of art and drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally comment on films, but I think this had to be said.Grave of the Fireflies is not for the weak of heart, it is a moving, and sometimes extremely sensitive, piece about the harsh realities of wartime life, from a child's perspective. But when I say it is from a child's perspective, don't think that this movie is exaggerated or over-simplified, because it is neither. This movie shows the true beauty in animation.Often we imagine animation as a departure from reality, but Grave of the Fireflies does the opposite. It forces the harsh realities of wartime on us, while keeping the beauty that animated movies have.The story itself is not unlike ones that have been heard before, families that are torn apart by death and loss, but the depth in which it is told keeps it unique. It is told from the point of view of a young teenager, Seita, a perspective of wartime that is usually ignored.This movie also shows how deep bloodlines can go. Subtleties in the movie are used often (and well), and as stated by Roger Ebert, 'One of the film's greatest gifts is its patience; shots are held so we can think about them, characters are glimpsed in private moments, atmosphere and nature are given time to establish themselves.' The movie doesn't rely on any specific sequence or action, but rather will let you draw conclusions based on what you've seen.Without going into DEEP spoilers (you may want to skip this section if you haven't seen the movie) I will say this:There are times when you notice the harshened reality that Seita notices about him. His Aunt is feeding them (Seita and Satsuko) and fills his bowl with just sauce (no rice), then fills her own family's bowls with rice (from the bottom of the pot). There is a slight pause, and the film itself gives direction to the catching of the eyesight between Seita and his Aunt. Seita knows what she did, and has been doing all the time they've lived there.This type of subtlety is what makes this film a masterpiece, and will forever be (for me) one of the best animated pieces I've seen AND felt.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story of Regret</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First and foremost are some disclaimers: I've only watched this film once, and I'm unlikely to re-watch it anytime soon - seeing that adorable little girl die once is quite enough for me.Last I checked, there are some 31 pages of comments so I apologise beforehand if what I'm about to say has already been said.I am not of Japanese descent, neither do I agree with their wartime antics; however, I believe in giving credit where it's due. A good film should be recognised for what it is.=====Please let me begin by laying down this basic premise: this is not an anti-war film, at least not at the onset; neither is it an attempt to garner sympathy for the Japanese people, the same people who terrorised half of Asia. It is a story about the last days of the (rather short) life of a teenage protagonist who just happens to be growing up in wartime. A truthful story at that. Call it a confession.In the trivia section it is mentioned that this film is based on a true story - the author's. That makes sense.This story, I believe, is about regret. Regret so heart-wrenching that the protagonist allowed himself to wither away and die as self-imposed punishment. Perhaps something the author wished he had done those decades ago. As with all good stories, many subtleties are left unexplained and up to the reader (audience?) to figure out.=====This story is all about Seita, the alter-ego of the author. So I shall attempt to offer my own interpretation of this one single character.Seita is not a lazy kid. He piggie-backs his little sister about, cooks their meals, washes their laundry, carries all their belongings, scavenges, steals, and whatnot.Seita is brave. He seizes every opportunity to dash into bomb raids - not your typical looter. He appears unfazed and in control when the whole town is up in flames all around him - while adults are in a state of panic. He certainly has courage, whether innate or borne of naivety is anyone's guess.Seita is a filial son. In the beginning as he was about to flee the bombings, he grabbed his father's photo instead of more valuable possessions. Later on he brings along the ashes of his mother. One scene is particularly good - while sitting on a tram(?) with the urn on his lap, an old lady next to him gives him a disgusted look, but he does not notice. The symbolism of this scene is probably lost to most western audience.Seita is idealistic - but in a negative way. He is the product of indoctrination, much like his counterparts in nazi Germany (hitler's youths) and later on in maoist China (red guards). This is evident from the following clues: he dresses in pseudo-military garb (hint: the socks), idolises his father in Naval uniform, reminisces about his father's battleship while staring at fireflies (instead of, say, girls), and pauses to gawk at warplanes while standing on a burning street.Finally, 2 very interesting questions regarding this intriguing character: 1) Why doesn't he find work? I think the reason is that he did not believe his lousy situation will last very long. Afterall japan is invincible, right? His father is one of many brave soldiers, his ironclad battleship with big bad guns will blow all their enemies out of the water, no? His naive belief is only disproved near the end of the film when he hears of the unconditional surrender.A couple of clues seem to support this: i) he comforted his little sister that their mother's savings can tide them through. Through to what? The end of the war and their father's victorious return, of cos. ii) the scene at the beach, where Seita and Setsuko frolicked in the waves while an old woman, who was collecting seaweed with her grandchild, looked on baffled. The old woman could not understand how those kids could be so carefree in times like this, sadly those kids did not know just how desperate times were and had no authority figure to tell them.2) Why doesn't he join the army like his aunt suggested? The easiest answer would be that he wants to take care of his little sister, especially since their mother is no longer around. However, supposing he had joined the army, his aunt would've given Setsuko decent care in his absence anyway. Or perhaps Seita secretly loathes the harsh and rigid military life? Personally I am inclined to believe the latter is the reason. (All fantasies about glory are dispelled once they make you march 50km in full gear - true story.) There ends my rather long-winded analysis of this film. I believe the thing that makes Seita such an interesting character is that he is based on a real person. As such he cannot help but acquire all the confounding and contradictory traits that exist in all of us.I cannot hope to have been thoroughly correct in my interpretation, but I do hope I have done justice to this film and the story behind it.-- Jsun</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animated film at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give Hotaru no haka a fair judgement is hard. It is without question one of the best animated films I have ever seen. The way most of the kind of action you would expect in a war movie has been scaled of and replaced by plausible characters and beautiful and powerful scenery, always created so that it seems as if a painter were creating a new masterpiece in every cell, it makes the protagonists lives seem more real than just about any other war depiction I have seen this far. It is quite special in another aspect as well, as it depicts japanese civilians during the second world war I can honestly say that this is the first such film I have seen, a situation I think many can identify with. The fact that the film does not demonise any human beings, not even the enemy, which can only be seen as anonymous bombplanes high up in the sky, but just tells a tragic and timeless story about a boy and his sister and their struggle to survive in wartimes is actually what makes this film a true masterpiece. This will be hard for any western filmmaker to surpass.The summation can only come to this: if you haven't seen Hotaru no haka yet, do it, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gem in every right, and one of the best things ever put to film, animated or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that is as stunning and brilliant as a cartoon as it could halfway be if it was a live-action movie. This is because, as an anime in itself, it gains so much more than it would in any other medium. The layers upon layers of hidden details in the art and symbolism used time and again in so many ways that just aren't possible in live-action movies are showcased in such subtlety in this movie that its mind-blowing. But I'm getting ahead of myself. I rated this a 10 and I haven't even gone past how great the art is yet.This movie is about two children who live during World War II. The main point of the movie is that their town has been bombed and their mother is seriously injured and eventually dies. From there, the horrors of the war and its effect on Japan are just one of the many backdrops that the two siblings must endure as they try to live on through harsh conditions. The whole world is against them. There is no light-heartedness in this movie. You would be hard-pressed to find even a funny moment in the show. This movie is as rough and vibrant as you can get. In one scene in particular is this fact shown. The two kids have just sold one of their mother's most precious possessions in order to get some white rice in order to eat. They have since been living at their aunt's house and been taken care of by her family since they have nowhere else to go. When they arrive back with the rice, the aunt takes a good chunk of it and tells them that her family needs it more than them, that they work and make it so they have a house to leech of them from, in a sense. And, of course, there is the infamous scene in which the movie gets its name, in which the two are living in a cave on the outskirts of a town and are hiding under a little netting to sleep. She is watching the butterflies and watching them create pictures in the netting. The older brother recalls how his father, a naval commander, had been on large ships from his childhood. The next morning, he finds his little sister burying the fireflies in the dirt in front of the cave, muttering to him "Why do fireflies die so quickly?" This is just an example of the strong symbolism used in the movie, but the scene in particular rings so strongly that you will probably watch it more than once in order to take it all in. This movie is incredibly depressing, as I have been saying. It goes beyond the tear-jerking finale, because you will know it's coming since the opening of the movie tells you that both of the siblings die. Rather, its the wholesome emotions being displayed, the raw humanity that is being displayed in every cell, in every scene of this classic that make it just that, a classic.The animation, even for a movie made all the way back in 1988, is still as fantastic as it was back then. This is just icing on the cake for an already wonderful movie. The voice acting on both fronts, Japanese and American, are fine in their own right, but I would recommend all who would be willing to take a chance on this gem to try the original soundtrack with the subtitles. Granted, there isn't a ton of dialogue to be had in this movie (not that it needed much to begin with), but the Japanese one just adds so much more authenticity to it that it is hard to recommend the American one over it.But enough of my rambling, I'll end by just saying that it is highly recommended that you watch this movie. It doesn't matter an inch that it is animated or not, because the movie is so engrossing that soon you will forget that your watching something dubbed anime. It is art at its finest, one of the best works of cinema production, animated or not, ever created. And be sure to watch it more than once. Multiple screenings are practically a must in order to truly appreciate everything this film has to offer.</fullReview>

Somehow i always think this is one of those "high fantasy" "FEEL GOOD MOVIES". But I have never been so wrong in all my life. It didn't even give me a second to understand what is going on but striking me in the first scene with the quote "September 21, 1945... that was the night I died." I must admit that this movie changed me in so many ways. At the end, with my eyes red and wet, i thought "i guess i ll never laugh again as it was before seeing this movie." I believe instead of teaching glories and defeats of one's country to our children, we should let them know what really war brings to human's life. How it destroys lives and every thing we know that makes us human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies which I only heard of (and got to see) after looking at IMDb's recommendations. That is something I always do: to see the recommendations on the IMDb page of the films that I like. Then I do research on them and decide if they interest me or not.This anime Japanese film is probably better than the average anime stuff that plagues TV nowadays. At least the anime here is less crude and the story is sentimental. Nevertheless, this movie is harsh, with a lot of heavy stuff for an animated motion picture: starvation, war, dropped firebombs, burned corpses/human remains (which is very gruesome), badly injured people, two kids who lose their mother, dead fireflies, the little girl who suffers from malnutrition (it's horrible to see her physical condition like that) and is cremated by her older brother after dying...Basically, this movie tells the tale of two poor children (the older brother Seita and his younger sister Setsuko) and their struggle for survival during the World War II in Japan. The film's language is Japanese either.Like animation historian Ernest Rister says, this is one of - if not the most - profoundly human animated film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I have to say that to me, this movie was absolutely amazing. I cried for a good chunk of the movie nonstop because the characters and their emotions felt so real it was hard to believe they were fictional. I love how Isao Takahata can make the most realistic scenes and breathe life into them, to tie them together into a captivating film.As you can tell, I love this movie. And when I read some of the negative reviews for it, I felt a little hurt. Don't worry, I'm a big girl so I understand that some people will differ in tastes from me, and its not a big deal. However, I did read some of the negative reviews for the sake of curiosity, and I was a bit put off by what I found. Just to clarify, I'm not attacking anyone, especially if you thought this movie just wasn't to your tastes or that it was boring to you. I just wanted to defend some of the characters and aspects of the movie because I liked them so much.So first, I know this was a sad movie... But i thought that that made the movie stronger because it stirred such strong emotions in its viewers. And I feel that contrary to some beliefs, the aim of the movie wasn't to make the viewer sad, but simply to empathize with the protagonist, who went through some hardships but always showed his love for his sister and his family. Instead of concentrating on the fact that the movie starts of with his unfortunate death, it's important to notice that he is able to be with his beloved sister soon after, and they remain together forever more.Also, I know some people couldn't relate to some aspects of the film because of historical context or thoughts on the war. But this movie has very little to do with the war itself. If it did, there would probably be a reference to the nuclear bombings, or other controversial war issues. It was just about 2 kids who faced hard times because of wartime. People in every country had to face this, and Japan was no exception. I won't go any farther into this issue, but I do think that the war just happened to be the setting, and the focus of the movie was on the characters, and how they dealt with their situation.And I just have to say... To some of you negative reviewers out there, cut Seita some slack! Lots of people ask the question, "Why didn't he just work?" But put yourself in his shoes. He's about 12 years old (14 at MOST), his entire city burned down, and he has to take care of his 5-year-old sister all on his own. No one's around to love him, and no one is around to show him proper guidance. Who knows if there's even a place for him to work?! His school burned to a crisp for sure. What could he really do in that situation? Also, a lot of the time he was "just being lazy," he was actually trying to be a good brother by spending time with his sister. It wasn't like he was selfishly playing video games you know... Also, you can't deny that although it was a naive decision, he was trying to do what was best for his little sister and himself by moving out of his aunt's house. His aunt CLEARLY didn't want him, and his sister looked sad. An elongated camping trip might seem attractive to a 6th grader, and that's probably the type of mindset Seita had. I also don't know if toward the end, working would have helped them. He still had money - about half of the savings his mom had was still in the bank, and he was trying not to use all of it, showing that he was trying to be responsible, although it didn't help him in the end. The whole time, he did what he could! He's just a kid you know... So yeah. Sorry if I ended up attacking anyone... It's just that I so greatly empathized with this character that it made me sad to see other people think he was selfish, and worse, a child abuser. The one thought I had as I watched this movie was, "Man. What a good brother. He loves his sister so much," and I think that was strongly portrayed, and meant to be portrayed, regardless of the bad decisions he may have made along the way.Overall... I loved this film! I love stories that invoke strong emotions, and this was just that type of movie. The story was real, as were the characters, and I loved almost everything about this movie. I guess I just wanted to defend it a bit &gt;.&lt;. I hope all of you enjoy this movie too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>much greater than the godfathers,batmans and pulp fictions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review for any movie and the feeling is paradoxical...on one hand I feel impelled to write this review and on the other I also feel that my review will be inconsequential considering the greatness of the work..To start, this is not merely another movie...it's much more than what we know as Cinema. It shows you the mirror...not just any ordinary mirror..one in which you see your soul. This work truly penetrates the material being and reaches your soul where the epiphany of being a human occurs. Being a human means the one who feels, the one who has emotions...In today's stressful life we often feel that we are emotionally invulnerable..In fact to succeed in your life today..you need to forget that you feel and act like a machine. This movie wakes you up. I can say that because there is no one person who would not cry watching it. It's not a shame. It's not a weakness. It makes even adults cry because it hits your soul of whose existence even you might be unaware of before.To consider it a movie will be doing injustice to the effect it generates. It's a soul-stirring work which we usually tend to associate with archaic literature. As a piece of Art, it is one of the best tragedies ever written...not only on the silver screen but in the entire human history. If you think I am exaggerating, you have to see this movie and it will have the same effect on you as Romeo-Juliet or Hamlet or Macbeth will have or maybe more since it's presented through the modern and hence, more understandable modes of communication.In my opinion the top rated movies and so the greatest movies are about gangsters, murders, bad guys. No disrespect to them, I am a movie buff and those are my favorites (The shawshank redemption#1, godfathers#2,3,and others like pulp fiction, goodfellas,the good,bad, ugly), but honestly, ask yourself..how many gangsters you know...or superheroes for that matter. Those are great works but they are fiction in the truest sense. you cannot relate to them. Those are fantasies. While 'Grave of the Fireflies' lets you relate yourself to the protagonist through the HUMAN connection.I have seen most of the top rated movies and without being a braggart,can safely claim to have developed a taste and an eye for great works and to me this is the greatest work of cinema. Astonishingly simple but powerful like an A-bomb(ironically) which devastates all your beliefs and ideals about War, Human Relations and Life in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most important animated film ever made?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I ordered this movie from Amazon expecting a shameless exploitation of the destruction and death wrought upon a defeated Japan near the end of World War II. What I did not expect, but indeed found, was a shockingly personal story with some grounding in real events, one that focused much less on the wider war being fought (and not at all on the politics behind the war, thankfully) than on the battle of a teenage boy to simply keep his young sister and himself alive.Consider this the antidote to the typical American war film, particularly those set in the Pacific theater of World War II. This story is one that lays bare the real consequences of war in the modern age. Nobody is spared, not even the youngest children. The film's heavily sobering nature is, however, intermingled with scenes of a happy brother and sister, striving to live their lives together in the face of the worst possible occurrences. This is likely what makes the film all that more difficult to watch; it is beautifully portrayed through its backgrounds, simple musical score and detailed animation, which are alone enough to set this apart from the average anime feature.I might have been flirting with pacifism before I watched this film, but it certainly pushed me over the cliff; one knows before seeing it that most of the casualties of war are the truly innocent, the civilians in their own homes, but such a fact is much easier to ignore when it's not visible in such a concrete portrayal. To put it simply, Grave of the Fireflies ought to be shown to every American social studies student, as it strips the glory of war away to reveal the true suffering it brings, not through a callous and gory festival of horrors, but through the love of two siblings for each other in the face of their earthly demise. I can barely make it through this film without crying, any time I watch it. Politics and national enmities have no place here, just pure love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say this is among the most powerful war films ever made, right up there with All Quiet on the Western Front. In addition to this animated version, there is a complete live action version which can be seen in it's entirety on YouTube. Though less poetic, it is also very devastating in it's own right.On a personal note: In 1969 my father was stationed in Japan with the USAF. While hiking in the woods, we found numerous decaying shelters many with old bottles and scratch built stoves. I took an unusual bottle that I have to this day. This haunting film has really effected me. I will show it to my children when they are older and give them the bottle. I don't know whose disrupted life it belonged to, but can only hope that they or their children are out there somewhere today, enjoying fireflies for those who no longer can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I'd like to explain why I gave this film a 10. I don't rate in comparison to other films because I take each film on its own, and I couldn't fault this film one bit. I was thinking of rating it a 9 just because it was a bit short in length but then again I thought that it was that good that I wanted more. The animation is amazing. You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime. To be honest I was expecting nothing less from studio Ghibli. The story is haunting in its simplicity. They are right to say its one of the best anti-war movies of all time. The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary. They give us the raw nature of the human kind and most of all the unspoilt love that can only be found between siblings. I watched the subtitled version of the film. It's truly worth it. The laughter of the small girl still haunts me and I'd love to watch this film again and again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a combination of Rome Open City and Wiesel's Night (and like both, an extreme, personally felt story)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988 Grave of the Fireflies was placed on a double-bill alongside My Neighbor Totoro. Two of the most endearing films ever created- animated of otherwise- were paired alongside one another, more than likely to balance each other out; after being submersed in a pure tale of innocence and delight like Miyazaki's great film, there could be accepted such a bleak, heartbreaking story of survival. And both films, incidentally, were based on true experiences, and while Miyazaki's story wasn't without some sadness in real life (his mother was really sick with TB in the hospital), Akiyuki Nosaka's story is one drenched in the worst horrors imaginable for a child. It's basically about two siblings, an older brother and younger sister, who are left practically orphans in a Japan completely devastated by the constant barrage of bombs falling all around, and with very little hope in sight. This lays the groundwork for their relationship, a bond very fragile and incredibly endearing.Not since Rossellini and De Sica had a filmmaker, in this case Isao Takahata, touched a nerve so deeply etched out in deconstructing the horrors of wartime. By leaving us with these two characters, who piece by piece are stripped of their innocence in just the simple task of fending for themselves in a shelter (they at first stay with an aunt who considers them freeloaders) and scrounging for food any way possible, we're left with nothing else but their struggle, essentially. The backdrop itself almost becomes abstract, something so huge that we don't even know that it's Americans dropping the bombs, as it's already too much to grasp that a child's parent is no longer with them. Like Elie Wiesel's book Night, the backdrop and horror is used to pit these people in an untenable situation, and it can only end, honestly, without compromise.So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films). The animation is exceptionally refined without being excessive in violence; images are visceral for just what is briefly revealed, without the extraneous shots that one might see in a work not meant in a G-rated film (i.e. when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter. The voice-work, too, doesn't strain credulity- these sound like, if it were a regular live-action feature, the kids who would play these parts (and, speaking of neo-realism, the two credited for Seita and Setsuko never worked before or again).Most often, the film is heart-rending because of how things build with the situation. It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son, but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge. Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko. And, finally, there's the last ten or so minutes, which I won't mention here. Suffice to say it's one of those times in movies where the opening of the film- Seiko dying homeless and famished- is explained to a perfect degree by film's end. It's a harrowing experience, and one of the very best animated films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the finest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Also, one of the saddest movies I have seen in my entire life. Not much to say that hasn't been said already, but I love this movie and I remember crying intensely the entire last half-hour. Remains quite neutral in terms of the war, as an American I did not feel 'offended', rather ashamed that this viewpoint is not more largely exposed. This is just one of those films that teaches you the value of human life and the misery that war brings upon innocent children. Quickly entered my theoretical 'top ten' list. May possibly be the best anime movie ever made, not only for it's beautiful animation, but the feelings, emotions, and thoughts that arise from watching it. And every time I watch it, it's always a little sadder than the last time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am no fan of animated features, but this film is extraordinary by any standard. The Japanese "anime" method doesn't focus on the animation per se, which would be considered "primitive" by contemporary American standards, but the scenery and backgrounds themselves are dream-like watercolours, even if many of those dreams in this case would be nightmares. The story is set in Kobe during the Allied firebombing, but the message is transmitted obliquely through the plight of a young student and his little sister who are rendered homeless in the devastated city. In an interview, the creator remarked that it would never enter his mind to use adults for the children's voices, despite the arduous task of guiding a five-year-old girl through the multiple takes required in a full-length film. Always by indirection, this sincerity makes a great impact. Perhaps I'm just a softy old coot, but I'm choked up even writing this review. This is NOT just another movie about WWII.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hotaru no Haka depicts the most grueling side of war, wherein the innocents of society are the most devastated. Especially during the downfall of the Japanese during the Second World War, the film depicts the darkest times of the common people during the different bombings. Not to mention the apathy and individualism prevailing among the people. Also, it tackles on how life may be unfair for some people. There is still a face of hope, dreams, and life amid the many horrific faces of tragedy, death, and suffering. This film is extremely tragic and depressing, but very meaningful and realistic. Though it may match the quality mainstream anime, it, more often than not, goes beyond the boundaries of commonplace anime. There are no exaggerations, just real-life situations.Kudos to the makers of this film! More power to you!Always remember, as implied by the film, that there is no such thing as a war of peace, and the innocent are the true victims of this inhuman act of man!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a war time story and, while it has a slow pace, it couldn't have been told any other way. It's like a knife being slowly inserted and twisted in the wound.Everything begins with a "La Vitta e Bella" atmosphere: mother dead, father at war, brother and little sister going to a distant relative, brother sheltering the sister from the realities of war as much as possible. But the end of the film (which again, doesn't come abruptly, but gradually) is nothing like happy.This has no action scenes, no fight or physical violence scenes, no sci-fi and no fiction. It's an anime harsh reality that makes you cry your eyes off at the end of the movie. The movie is great, it's a must see for anime lovers or anybody else.I recommend to see again the start of the film after you have seen the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What makes a movie great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think often times one knows the value of the movie they watch through the effect it has on them. That being said, this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I watch movies from many cultures and of many genres. Though I usually prefer a good action flick to any kind of sentimental rubbish; that tends to be because most movies which try to be sentimental fall short of creating a reaction. This movie creates a reaction, a big reaction. One of the ways I test a movie's greatness is to re-watch it, a lot later. As time passes and the movie sinks in, it loses its power to effect you. I watched this movie in 1998; a month ago I tried to watch it again. I did not make it past the movies opening scene. I do not easily come to tears, but I could not watch this movie a second time, I could not bear that kind of pain. That is level of power this movie evokes, and that is the level of strength the story conveys. There is no way my words can properly express the feelings which this movie creates, do not be afraid because it is in a foreign language or because it is animated, what this movie touches transcends all that. There is no more to be said, watch it and find out for yourself what I mean.</fullReview>

Its impact was totally unexpected as I watched the film only because it happened to be the other feature in the 2 film-in-1 DVD I purchased. I had absolutely no idea what the film was all about. Now I can't get those profoundly moving scenes, Setsuko's face and voice off my mind. Though the film depleted my energy/vigor at the end, it was a welcomed feeling as it leaves one in touch with one's "forgotten" sense of humanity. Or the film heightens it, if it's not forgotten. I was utterly silent, deeply sad, "devastated" and brokenhearted when the final credits rolled. I felt both the actual and potential ugliness and beauty of being human all at once. Many films have been existentially moving, but few are as simple, direct though subtle, and as matter-of-factly as "Grave of the Fireflies". It's an unforgettable and emotionally "haunting" film; beautiful and painful at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very deep piece of art (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched Grave of the Fireflies, I felt that I watched one of the greatest movies ever. Yes it is anime; however, this does not restrict the quality at all. Being moved by this film is easy, as the way emotions are conveyed is simply fantastic. The story tells of two children who lost their parents during World War II. Seita and his younger sister survive on very little. The movie shows the toll that war brings on the innocent public, the death; destruction and loss are displayed in a way that moves you. The film is often compared to Schindler's List, for its direct and sad style, and it is indeed worth being in comparison. The movie strikes in the hardest to hit places, you will find yourself at a loss for words. During the course of the movie, the children grow weaker from starvation, and they simply are not able to obtain enough food to keep alive. One of the saddest moments I have ever seen in a film was during the end of the movie, when Seita cremates his 5 year old sister, who "never woke up again". As the start of the film shows, he ends up dying himself.It's hard to watch the film and feel positive at all, the death and loss is too much for a lot of people to handle. However, upon reflection, the movie is one of the greatest films ever, which will move you and force you to take a second look at anime. For anime is not simply just "kiddie cartoons", it is merely another form of presenting a film, and when challenged with such a hard title, Grave of the Fireflies proves how emotional anime can get.</fullReview>

To Seita and his four-year-old sister, the helplessness and indifference of their countrymen is even more painful than the enemy raids. Through desperation, hunger, and grief, these children's lives are as heartbreakingly fragile as their spirit and love is inspiring. Grave Of The Fireflies is a tale of the true tragedy of war and innocence lost, not only of the abandon young, but of an intire nation.This is the greatest anime and one of the best war films of the 20th century.

		<fullReview>A most unusual blend of beauty, and sadness, to display the cruel consequences of war. Slowly and steadily, as if in slow motion, we are slapped in the face with the miserable reality of the main characters, devastating and cruel reality, shown so simply and so powerfully from the very first to the very last second of the movie. Some parts literally smash your heart to sorrow. Graphically speaking the movie displays such a breathtaking look. Not just the sceneries and overall style, even minor details like the leaves and debris flying across the scenery in several shots truly resemble the paintings of Hokusai or Hiroshigue (which I happen to be very fond of). The artistic value of the visuals works perfectly in service of the powerful emotional substance explored in this movie, the combination is just perfect. There are several moments that I personally find truly poetic and most sublime in Grave of the fireflies. Forget whether you hate or enjoy war movies, or whether you like or dislike animated or manga movies. Grave of the Fireflies really stands far beyond any preconceptions you might have for these categories.</fullReview>

In the translation pride was mentioned indeed. However, what little Setsuko knows about pride? she only know how to cry at night when she long for her mother, and what would Seita do, silence her everytime she cry in order not to upset his aunt?. Setsuko wants to leave, Seita has no choice since he wants his little sister to be happy. There could be pride issue for sure, but it's not dominant whatsoever. Seems they made a tragic choice, but do they have a choice afterall?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the most honestly told, beautiful, heart breaking films ever made and it's a shame that this undiscovered gem isn't known throughout the animation realm. Perhaps it's a good thing that Grave of the Fireflies isn't well known because it will be free from the corrupted minds of cheesy Hollywood producers like Jerry Bruckheimer, who would of missed the point of the message entirely and add a brain dead script along with Josh Harnett as Seita. Or George `one trick pony' Lucas who would of used CGI Muppets to play humans, and add Jah Jah Stinks in there `for the kids' that leaves us with a kind of humour that makes us cry in despair. Anyway enough of my moaning.I first stumbled upon Grave of the Fireflies whilst surfing on Amazon for the Princess Mononoke DVD were it popped up on the recommendation list, I was Hooked on the title and the plot. After watching it I was totally not disappointed with what I saw, and was left with a tear in my eye from the sheer power of it all. As you all know properly know that fireflies is set in 1945 Kobe during the closing months of World War 2, The main characters in this film are Seita and Setsuko where their mother dies in the American bombing raids whilst their father who is a navy officer on the cruiser `The Maya' not knowing if he is alive. They stay with their aunt for awhile who scolds them for being lazy and not doing anything for the war effort, and is reluctant to share rations with Seita and Setsuko. Even though she trades in their goods and their mothers goods to buy food. Eventually they leave and take refuge in a disused bomb shelter where after a few their hunt for foods leads to stealing. The one thing I truly admire about Fireflies doesn't use over dramatic images of destruction during the bombing raids and when Setsuko is grouchy for her mother. My mother loved this film and it reminded her of the Village she lived in, during 1950's Turkey. Where she lived in a very poor family with none of the things we take for granted like electricity and running water, and where kids had to make their own toys e.g. dolls with sticks, rags and cotton wool and playing with insects like dragonflies and fireflies. My mother cried when she saw Seita and Setsuko used fireflies to light up the bomb shelter it reminded her of how her brothers and sisters used to chase fireflies that would enter their room.Grave of the Fireflies is directed by Isao Takahata who was one of the directors of the ever popular TV series of the 1970's ?Heidi', which became a social phenomenon in Spain and Italy (where in some cases that episodes were repeated due to popular demand) he was also one of the key animators on Hayao Miyazaki's critically acclaimed Princess Mononoke. Ever since I've seen Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, I've grown obsessed with anime in particular with Studio Ghibli which has a great list of films to its name and I'm looking forward on seeing Studio Ghibli's next release Spirited Away which is due to hit British shores. I highly recommend this film and you won't be disappointed. I would like to end this mini review on a quote that sums up the films message and I believe Ecclesiastes put it best: ?Rejoice, O young man in thy youth'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow i was blown away by this title and give high praise to my local Blockbuster for stocking it in thier limited anime selection. The buzz about this film is completely accurate and it is one of most dramatic and moving features that i've ever seen. I watched this with my friend and it was the first movie which had ever made us cry, my friend much more so than me for personal reasons. (which i can't disclose due to the spoiler guideline).It was about midnight and we had just finished viewing Poltergiest Report. Grave of the Fireflies was a total turn from everything we expected that film and anime could be, sucking us in within minutes and captivating our attention even though we were both dead tired. The animation is appropriate, though a deviation from the stereotypical anime fare of oversized eyes, breasts and gravity defying hair, which would put it in the same boat is Akira. Landmark anime of a feather i guess. The story and the characters are so capable of bringing out one's emotions in this hardened day and age it took me completely by surprise, epsecially considering the fact that its just a cartoon. It doesn't matter who you are, whether you rent anime for Ninja Scroll or La Blue Girl, this is a title capable of moving you beyond the realms of expectation. Do yourself a favor and pick a time and check out this film and let it move you as it did to me. Unless you are some sort of macho stereo who doesn't want your self-image disturbed by having an animated feature move you, you will not be disappionted.</fullReview>

My American education tells me we had God on our side, and whatever we did to the Japanese mainland was justified in the name of sovereignty. I'm not a politician or a general...I don't know. But the story of Setsuko and Seiji (sp?) caused me such grief inside. What is right, anymore? Is this right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- The real meaning of tragedy in an animated film. Your tears will be so close. This is the first time I almost cry in an animated film. The film reveals the catastrophes of wars. The film is influential on all ages.- The film opens on September 21, 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, at Sannomiya Station. Here, Seita (&#x6e05;&#x592a;?), a 14-year-old boy, is seen dying of starvation. Later that night, a janitor digs through his possessions, and finds a candy tin, which he throws away into a nearby field. From the tin spring the spirits of Seita and his younger sister Setsuko (&#x7bc0;&#x5b50;?), as well as a cloud of fireflies. Seita's spirit narrates their story alongside an extended flashback to Japan in the final months of World War II, beginning with the firebombing of the city of Kobe in March 16?17, 1945.- The flashback begins with a fleet of several hundred American B-29 Superfortress bombers flying overhead. Setsuko and Seita, the two siblings, are left to secure the house and their belongings, allowing their mother, who suffers from a heart condition, to reach a bomb shelter. They are caught off-guard as the bombers begin to drop thousands of incendiary bomblets, which start huge fires that quickly destroy their neighborhood and most of the city. Although they survive unscathed, their mother is caught in the air raid and is horribly burned. She is taken to a makeshift clinic in a school, but dies shortly after. Having nowhere else to go, Setsuko and Seita move in with a distant aunt, who allows them to stay but convinces Seita to sell his mother's kimonos for rice. While living with their relatives, Seita goes out to retrieve leftover supplies he had buried in the ground before the bombing. He gives all of it to his aunt, but hides a small tin of Sakuma fruit drops, which becomes a recurrent icon throughout the film. Their aunt continues to shelter them, but as their food rations continue to shrink due to the war, she becomes increasingly resentful. She openly remarks on how they do nothing to earn the food she cooks.- Seita and Setsuko finally decide to leave and move into an abandoned bomb shelter. They release fireflies into the shelter for light. The next day, Setsuko is horrified to find that the insects have all died. She buries them all in a grave, asking why they have to die, and why her mother had to die. What begins as a new lease on life grows grim as they run out of rice, forcing Seita to steal from local farmers and loot homes during air raids. When he is caught, he realizes his desperation and takes an increasingly-ill Setsuko to a doctor, who informs him that Setsuko is suffering from malnutrition but offers no help. In a panic, Seita withdraws all the money remaining in their mother's bank account, but as he leaves the bank, he becomes distraught when he learns from a nearby crowd that Japan has surrendered unconditionally to the Allied Powers. He also learns that his father, captain of the Imperial Japanese Navy heavy cruiser Maya, is probably dead, since nearly all of Japan's navy is now at the bottom of the ocean. He returns to the shelter with large quantities of food, only to find a dying Setsuko hallucinating. Seita hurries to cook, but Setsuko dies shortly thereafter. Seita cremates Setsuko, and puts her ashes in the fruit tin, which he carries with his father's photograph, until his own death from malnutrition in Sannomiya Station a few weeks later. - In the film's final sequence, the spirits of Seita and Setsuko are seen healthy, well-dressed and happy as they sit together, surrounded by fireflies. The camera then moves showing the two looking down on the modern city of Kobe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful. SECOND VIEWING of this FILM--- very ESSENTIAL.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Wow. WOW. What an amazing-amazing movie, Ladies and Gentlemen. I'm overwhelmed in a positive way. I have to admit, I "dived" into this movie not knowing anything initially about it (didn't read the IMDb comments and reviews prior...)-- as a matter of fact, I simply found the poster of GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES (Hotaru no haka, original Japanese) intriguing and decided to check out the movie... (it is discern-able from the poster that it's about kids in a poverty background... and that made me wan't to check it out, as I'd never come across animation that dealt with the issue of poverty)."Diving" into 'Hotaru no haka' without any prior knowledge was both,with it's benefits and minuses.First and foremost, I didn't notice / or understand the beginning sequence deeply (where the Loving spirit of Setsuko comes back to reunite with the spirit of her loving brother, Seita)-- and I started paying attention to the movie only when the flashback (showing the difficult lives of these adorable siblings began) with the US planes bombing Kobe. Looking back, you can guess what this "mistake" (of not paying attention in the beginning) did to me while I was watching the ending... When the words "She never woke up again." flashed in the subtitles, I was utterly DEVASTATED. No other word to describe it. I quietly went to the door of my private room, closed it-- (so as, not to have my parents hear...)-- and after that, let those tears flow free. There is absolutely nothing more difficult than trying to stifle or hold your tears (mainly) after what comes after that sentence in the subtitles, mentioned above. Setsuko is more than a character, as is her brother Seita. By the end of the movie, you know beyond knowing, that you recognize these characters as if they were your own kid sister or adolescent brother. That's the power of the story of "Hotaru no haka". That how well and thoroughly you fall in Love with these two wonderful siblings-- and later, that's how painfully you grieve and mourn for them...! I was freely crying as the end of the movie approached... I admit, I paused the movie when the scene in which the sombre and unspeakably painful task falls on Seita to burn the lifeless body of his once jovial and life-filled, lovely sister. I took a short break, and returned back to the movie to see the remainder...NOW HERE'S THE THING: THANK GOD FOR IMDb! Why? Because a day after watching "Hotaru no haka" for this first time, I went online, on IMDb, and started reading the reviews and comments. I found out that Roger Ebert considered this the MOST PROFOUND AND TOUCHING ANTI-WAR movie ever made-- but more than anything else-- I came to the REVELATION/understanding that the end of this movie, in a totally non-linear way, is actually in the BEGINNING!!! Thanks to the reviewers who pointed this out for me... really. So (I dared and) watched GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, again. This time around, noticing the beginning, understanding and making sense of it. And I was thrilled! In what I'd originally thought to be an effective but gloomy and sad movie-- I came to realize, upon and after the SECOND VIEWING-- that the heart-wrenching story of Setsuko and Seita ends in a hopeful and somewhat even a positive note!! Yes, they had a difficult and painful life. The pain (brother)Seita grows through having to live after the passing of (sister)Setsuko-- is something I don't think most people, even grown-ups, would have been able to live through (that's why Seita eventually simply succumbs to death and doesn't fight starvation in the beginning (and/or ending) of the movie. But-- but, in the end they, the adorable and lifeful Setsuko and Seita's spirits are re-united!! Yes, they leave their physical, worldly bodies behind-- but they are TOGETHER once more, and the pure Love of caring brother to sister and vice-versa reigns supreme once again, and this time, forever.I'm surprised that some reviewers wrote that this movie ends sadly. If you'll notice correctly it actually ends in a positive and hopeful high note. Yes, it is a sad and heart-wrenching story nonetheless. But saying that it ends in a sad note is simply not correct. As a matter of fact, the opposite is true. The re-union of Love and hope, in the two forms of Setsuko and Sieta at the very beginning-- and subsequently at the very end of the movie-- are very-very positive and heart-warming.I can honestly say: I'm (hopefully) a better person knowing the story of these two siblings who are full of heart and Love. I pray and hope to help any human or child in a situation similar to that of Setsuko and Seita, if ever life shows any such to me.Hotaru no Haka-- is no mere movie. This movie is an EXPERIENCE. It's an experience which will crush your heart... but, in the process, you will discover (or re- discover) how much really your heart can actually feel-- and your heart will survive. And the re-discovering of your heart through this film is something that will be very good for you.Thank you, Director Isao Takahata, for this story and this movie. Thank you, Novelist Akiyuki Nôsaka, for writing this story and sharing it with us all. One can say, one has seen a movie. But when it comes to GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, one has to say that they had the PRIVILEGE of watching this movie, and it would be 100 percent true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>warning: this film will burn a hole in your heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the worst kind of tragedy. A brother. a sister. a bond that can't be broken... even by death.Grave of the Fireflies is a terrible masterpiece. Dismal and depressing and infinitely sad. It will burn a hole in your heart.It's a film about the worst kind of tragedy, an entire family lost to war. Set in Kobe, Japan in 1945, this picture entails the mental and physical journey of two war-orphaned children. Be warned: there are no simple morals. This film isn't the usual Hayao Miyazaki feel-good crowd-pleasing epic about their fantastic adventures and survival against all odds.This film is about their deaths.Yes, that's right. It's about an eighth-grade boy, Seita, and his four-year-old sister, Setsuko, orphaned by fate... and how they die.The opening line seals Seita's fate: "September 21, 1945. That was the night I died." He died in a subway, surrounded by apathetic people. Night-crew workers searched his body and found a rusty red candy tin. One threw the piece of garbage out of nearby doorway. It landed, bounced, and popped open. Dust and several bits of ash puffed out.With it, quite suddenly, was the ghost of a very young girl. She was dressed in a child's hood, trousers, and sandals. She looked about, and saw the ghost of her big brother.Grave of the Fireflies' actual story begins in the next scene, with the raid. The town of Kobe, Japan, is torched to cinders overnight. Seita and Setsuko's mother is killed. The siblings take up residence with a distant aunt in a nearby town. Initially, she is kind. She gives them food and shelter. But soon, she begins calling Seiko "lazy." He has no money, doesn't go to school or work (both were burned to the ground during the raid), and just accompanies Setsuko all day. She accuses Seiko of slothfulness and demands that he assist the Land of the Rising Sun in any way possible. Seiko simply disregards her, and turns again to comfort his sister. He gives her a fruit drop from the round, red Spam-shaped tin he had hidden.Seiko abandons his aunt's house and chooses to live on his own. Setsuko happily agrees. He buys supplies with his mother's money. They do well at first. But slowly, surely, the money runs thin. Seiko resorts to robbery, but nothing seems to stop them from wasting away from malnutrition. All they can do is watch the dance of the fireflies as they starve to death. Seita becomes self-obsessed and self-preserving...but only marginally. Setsuko's malnutrition symptoms worsen as Seiko searches for food and help Eventually the innocent four-year-old passes from Earth.Seiko cremates her with his own two hands. he places a tiny bit of her ashes in the red candy tin and carries her soul with him for what seem to be several weeks.With that. The movie closes. Do you recall the opening line? "September 21, 1945. That was the night I died." Excerpt from a poem by Turkish author Nazim Hikmet. Entirely fitting."I come and stand at every door. But no one hears my silent tread. I knock and yet remain unseen. For I am dead, for I am dead.I'm only seven although I died, In Hiroshima long ago. I'm seven now as I was then. When children die they do not grow." -- Nazim Hikmet</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joins a select few as a movie that has brought me tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read some of the other reviews, you already know this is a very sad yet simple story, excellently portrayed, and involves the lives of two Japanese children during the firebombing of Tokyo. The movie is powerful, worth seeing, and one you will hesitate to watch a second time. That said, I'll continue to point out some of the details that made it such a poignant film for me. Some of this is spoiler material, so if you like your movies unspoilt, stop reading and go see it now.S P O I L E R SPart of the brilliance of this animation lies in how it can select and emphasize peculiar details of the childrens' world, which are just the sort of imagery that I can recall from my childhood. Take the scene where their mother calls Seita and Setsuko in from playing on the beach, and her umbrella blows away, for example. We linger for a moment watching how the umbrella hits the sand, and spins a bit. My childhood memories are like that.Or the scene where they are bathing, and playing with the washcloth to make a big bubble underwater.Or the transition between the falling blossoms and the pouring rice.Or the maggots falling from the bandages, being trampled underfoot as their mother is carried away on a stretcher for cremation.All these associative moments bring forth the deep subconscious, which is then exposed to the descent into starvation and sickness that comprises the second half of the film. There are so many sad moments, it is hard to isolate one or two. As Seita first starts looting empty homes during air raids to survive, I felt like I shared his despair. But perhaps the saddest moment of all comes when he's at the bank to withdraw money, and finds out that Japan has lost the war and his father is likely dead. Shock, betrayal, shattered illusions of his invincible country, emperor, father... and then the final tragedies commence, as all hope is lost.Heartbreakingly relevant. If only our leaders would watch this film before sending forth each wave of bombers, our world would, perhaps, be a gentler place. There are five million people in Baghdad, 2.5 million of them under 15, and the use of everything from cruise missiles to nuclear weapons has been proposed "for their benefit." I think we can find another way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a die-hard animation fan in all forms, whether it be Disney, Dreamworks, or Japanese anime, I have watched an extensive range but never before have I ever seen an animated film that has caused me to cry at the end. The sytle of animation is like other beautifully Japanese animated films such as Tonari No Totoro, Mononoke Hime and Kurenai no buta (aka Porco Rosso). This style of anime was what drew me to watch it but I was totally unprepared for the 'Schindler's List'-type atmosphere that this movie portrays. The storyline of a brother taking care of his baby sister during the war drew me in so entirely that for many days afterwards I found myself lying wide awake thinking of the message that this movie is clearly trying to send - war destroys. Isao Takahata has made a movie that all older teens and adults should see. Its story is enrapturing, the animation stunning and realistic and its message one that we should all learn from - love not war is what this world needs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Response To The Negative Reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No-one looks at good reviews which is why I gave this movie one star, though I rate it 10.In short, the story focuses on 14-year old Seita and his sister Setsuko, and the movie opens with Seita's death, alone on a train platform, dishevelled and starving. Cut to the beginning. In war-torn Japan, the children lose their mother who is horrifically killed during an air raid. They then go to live with their aunt and there are many happy and beautiful scenes of the children who obviously love each other dearly. After their aunt making it painfully obvious she resents caring for them, the children leave to go and live in an abandoned bomb shelter while trying to live on the money left in their mother's bank account. Eventually, after a few more poignant and touching scenes, it becomes clear the children are running out of food, and the climax of the film sees Seita returning to the shelter with some food and Setsuko, thin and dirty, lying on the floor, hallucinating, where she dies of starvation as Seita tries to feed her. He then cremates her and puts her ashes in the fruit drop tin she so loved and the movie ends, with the obvious recollection of the beginning of the film, Seita dying alone on a train platform clutching the fruit drop tin.The negative response for this movie stems from people's apparent dislike of the characters. They say that Setsuko and Seita are annoying, and to an extent I can agree. Though Setsuko is just a young girl, that is all the annoyance that comes from her.What seems to really grate on people is, Seita knows his sister is malnourished and starving, when he takes her to the doctor it is shown how painfully skinny and ill she is, yet he refuses to go back to his aunt. She would have taken them back in in a heartbeat, but despite knowing this, and despite advice from a farmer who tells him to, he declines, ultimately resulting in his and his sister's deaths. He lets his pride get the better of him. All I can say to that is, that is supposed to be a part of the film. It isn't some plot-fall that was overlooked, it is an obvious and meaningful part of the film. They're just children. Seita left his aunt in the first place for no reason other than he did not want to get a job and support the family who had taken him in. But this movie is based on a true story, and it is supposed to be an apology from the real-life brother, who survived, to his sister who died from starvation. He felt he could have done more to help her and, anti-war sentiments aside, this is what the movie is supposed to be about.So people should look past Seita's arrogance and see the film for what it truly is. A stunningly beautiful and absolutely heart-wrenching picture that will completely and utterly shatter you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll cry at least once during the course of this film.This somber story of a loving brother and sister trying to survive in a war savaged Japan is beautiful. The siblings situation is hopeless and yet hopeful all at the same moment. Through all the sadness and death there is still a sense of the carefree and innocent. The soft animation makes the movie so much more fantastic.If you are looking for a hack and slash anime, this is not the film for you. However, if you want a mature and beautiful piece of Japanese animation reminiscent of something of Miyazaki's, go rent or buy this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super-depressing, but an exceptional film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I been able to see this film in Japanese subtitles, I might have scored it higher. The version shown on TCM was dubbed and I think the dubbing detracted from the film because the characters didn't seem the least bit Japanese. While this may not matter as much with some full-length Anime movies, this one was based on real people living through the final months of WWII with all its privations on the Japanese people. So, to me, it just didn't seem appropriate having the characters sounding like Americans--this seemed a bit tacky. This is all pretty sad, as the film itself is a marvelous film featuring some of the better animation I have ever seen and exceptional production values.The story is about two siblings whose mother is killed early in the film during a fire bombing. The movie is spent trying to survive on their own and deal with starvation.The film is apparently based on the writer's own experiences and is extremely important for adults and older kids, as it gives a side of war that is seldom mentioned in films. Although it will probably depress your older kids, it would be a good film to watch with them provided you take the time to discuss the film and process what they see as it is a disturbing episode in history.I do NOT recommend this to younger or less mature kids. Oddly, when the film was released, it was combined with MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO as a double-feature!!! This was so wrong--combining a sweet movie targeted for the youngest kids in the audience with this realistic and heart-wrenching film about death and starvation! What were they thinking?! I do recommend you see the film, but if possible, try to find the Japanese language version with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant. Too tough. Superb. Heartwrenching. (ad lib)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before setting out praising this movie, just a little message to those who (agAIn) ask themselves what the point is of making anime so realistic, since anime is supposed to be used for stuff that can't be done in real film. Well, two replies : a) then anime should be abandoned altogether, because they can pretty much do anything in film by now - ironically, often with special effects that are little more than computer generated anime! b) that remark testifies to, besides an extremely narrow view of what a particular art form can be, a profound lack of respect for anime as a medium equal to plain film. Since, what it's saying is basically "in specific cases anime is better, but when both art forms can do it, film is always superior". But there's more. Apparently, none of the folk who put forth that limited view on anime have ever heard of the idea that the more abstract a figure becomes, the easier it becomes to identify with it. So, to spell it out: where a normal film might keep a certain distance between you and the characters, anime characters are more easily generalised and thus identified with.But what about Grave of the Fireflies? Well, to put it plain and simple: if you haven't seen it, you're an utter idiot. I won't tell you what to feel (except in the summary line), but the film's perfect. Pacing, direction, photography, plot, you name it. And it avoids the easiest "ho let's go for the big emotion" style. It does go for it, but in a very no-bul**hit way, drawing a straight line and following it.I do like Miyazaki films, but since I bought the Ghibli Box (which did not include Fireflies, as it isn't distributed by Disney outside of Japan, and the box's DVD's come from HK) I must admit that, especially in his later films, Miyazaki tends to go for Big Messages. Instead, the three films by Takahata I've seen thusfar (especially Fireflies and Only Yesterday) are marvels of understatedness. By which I mean, it's more a thing of showing the facts and letting you make up your own mind, rather than chewing your emotional food for you. Not that Miyazaki isn't good, but Takahata has made three of the best Ghibli films. And he's not afraid of showing a darker note in his films, whereas Miyazaki tends to keep his films (except Mononoke) on constant feelgood mode.Anyhow. Required viewing. Just take my word for it. If not that, just do it out of fear for being considered an idiot...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Devastating, Tragic Animated Film, yet Most Honest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know about this film even though I am a Ghibli fan since this is so underrated. I quickly decided to watch as soon as I found out about the title and immediately I know the reason of the title.To summarize it, the whole film is trying to show the audience what it was truly like to live in an era of war. The fear of siren in the middle of night and the painful truth that can't be simply revealed to loved ones.I cried through the sadness and the rage of our young protagonist, through his effort to survive after the death of his mother, through his wounded heart upon realizing that his aunt hated him and her sister's presence in the house but slyly took whatever she could, through his hardship to live alone with his sister, through the truth that in the end, he couldn't even protect his sister and ultimately, himself.This is so unbelievably sad, I even got a bit teary while writing all this.I think people need to be reminded of the price of war and this is a good reminder for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a underrated, grossly misinterpreted Ghibli masterpiece of a film that you never wanted to see again.not going to make review about it as there are hundreds of reviews already Just to make some points: Grossly Underrated - The fact that it is not even considered as a mainstream Ghibli title when it deserve to be placed as one of the greatest animated films (or just films) of all times shows that it is grossly underrated.Grossly misinterpreted - many critics and reviewers interpret the film as an anti-war movie. Cant be further from the truth. Graves of the Fireflies is about the story of a siblings and their hardships in life, thats it plain and simple. The story is the authors confession of guilt and desire for atonement after her young sister died in his care in real life. It just so happen that the setting is WW2.In reality it can be applied to any situation where human hardship, particularly children hardship, are involved.Right now there are millions of young desperate Seitas and little innocent hungry Setsukos all around the world that are abandoned, dying from malnutrition and hunger, being unable to afford medical care, being sold into slavery, physically and sexually abused... and yet people like us (who were torn by the feeling of not being able to help Setsuko and Seita character in the film) are not making any effort to help these millions of real life Setsukos and Seitas out there.. is what i believe the true tragedy of this film.</fullReview>

It's very well one of the best animated films I've ever seen, no question. The film also makes its intentions clear by showing these characters' fates in the beginning, and so we're not concentrated on hoping they survive or anything but just witnessing the deep pain and suffering that befell so many people during this time. Definitely a must-see film, one that isn't easy but very well reminds us o the tragedy that people went through and the human suffering, and how lucky the rest of us are for not having gone through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."Hotaru no haka" (1988) is a very good animated movie. It's surely not for children, especially not for children of this generation. "Hotaru no haka" is for adult viewers, who will find here many things that were touched by war. It's a sad story, not inspiring one.Overall, "Hotaru no haka" is a really good movie. It's perfectly paced, it's storytelling is good and it has some truly moving and sad parts. If you in for this stuff, "Hotaru no haka" (aka "Grave of Fireflys") is surely not to be missed. It's not the best animated movie of all time, but it's a very compelling one.</fullReview>

There were single moments of sheer bliss like the moment when Seita and Setsukuo catch fireflies and use them to illuminate their cave. In a nutshell this is a movie that sums up both the horrors of WWII along with beautiful sense and the simplicity of the relation between a brother and his little sister.</fullReview>

The final half hour of this film tears were streaming down my face. It's so good at pulling on your heart strings. You love the characters, you're there with them, so watching both of them fail to carry on, especially after all the older brother has done, hurts. That being said, I recommend this film to anyone and everyone. It is one of the most amazing anti-war films I've ever seen and it impacts you even more so because it's animated in the gentle Studio Ghibli art style. A beautiful film, something I was sad to find isn't more openly distributed. I was luckily able to find it at an awesome library in town.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest War Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tragic film covering a young boy and his little sister's struggle to survive in Japan during World War II.Apparently people, including Roger Ebert, consider this one of the greatest -- or perhaps the greatest -- war film ever made. Now, that is interesting because it is a cartoon. You never expect that, and this might not be something you want to show kids. It is pretty bold, with wounded people, maggots, and anyone can die.Even more interesting is how it takes place from the point of view of a Japanese youth during World War II. He is not nationalistic, he is not anti-American, he is just a kid. And is that not the truth of war? No matter who is right or wrong, millions of kids become the victims.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isao Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies is arguably the greatest animated movie ever made, and one of the best war movies ever made as well.The movie tells the tragic story of two orphaned children a teen-aged boy named Seita (voiced by Tsutomu Tatsumi) and his 4 year old sister Setsuko (voiced by Ayano Shiraishi) who try to struggle to survive the U.S. atomic bomb attacks during World War II. Director Isao Takahata really does capture the essence of tragedy that WWII brought to the American people and the Japanese people alike in the same way, and to put it this way the Japanese got what was coming to them, and they were the ones that made us get involved in WWII because of the Pearl Harbor bombing, but I don't mean it in a racist way. The two main characters also try to show us not only how they felt during the war but also how important it is to love your family members more than anybody else in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All around depressing yet it's well executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story opens up strongly having the ending shown first, and letting the main character to tell the rest of the story. All around we see people trying to be strong, to be tough in the middle of the harsh environment of war torn civilians. We also see every scope of human nature manifested in this kind of environment, in which people tend to seek their own survival, whatever the means may be. Those can also include how the aunt cheated on the kids about the food and that the aunt's daughter eventually did nothing to help them. What I like from the movie is that there's no depiction of depressed desperation as to leading to suicide. This convey the message to be strong. I watched the Japanese version with English subtitling; the voice acting is very nice. Setsuko's voice are very much the standard cute Japanese little girl, While Seita's voice can really make the character relate to how brothers defend for their kid brother/sister.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's one of the most depressing movies ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say this movie is really hard to get through. It's so heart breaking. Grave of the Fireflies is based on the semi-autobiographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka. While the movie is well-made, there isn't much of a story arch. The opening minutes of the film, pretty much explains what happen to the characters of the film. There is little to no point of watching the film if you know it doesn't end well for them. People love watching Survival movies, because they know that the character will beat the odds and live. If you open the movie, knowing the characters are doom from the start. It put out that tribute of the human spirit out, quickly and you're just left in the dark. The movie by director Iaso Takahata (co-founder with Hayao Miyazaki's fame animation studio, Studio Ghibli) has this very dark overwhelming guilt trip hanging over it, like a black cloud. While, some people quoted the film, one of the most anti-war films of all time. The reason why Iaso Takahata made the film, is convey the image of the family living a failed life due to seclusion from society. While also, invoking sympathy in the 1980's youth of Japan, whom the director felt needed to straighten up and respect their elders for the pain and suffering they had experienced during World War 2. I found the movie trying really too hard to make sympathy for the two leads. Throughout the film, the movie had a lot of padding, only there for making us feel warm hearted to the characters. It could have easily been removed from the plot without affecting the story significantly. The film tells the story of two orphans trying to survive on their own, Seita (voice by Tsutomu Tatsumi in Japanese, J. Robert Spencer or Adam Gibbs in English version) &amp; Setsuko (voice by Ayano Shiraishi in Japanese, Rhoda Chrosite or Emily Neves in English version) after their mother is killed in a firebombing raid by the Allies. Most of the English dubbing is mediocre, at best. The supporting cast pretty much read their lines without much emotion added to it. In my opinion, it's just better to watch the movie in Japanese with English sub-titles. The animation is pretty good at the time, but I did notice they did reused multiplies shots for the fire-bombing scenes. Also, in some scenes, the figures in the background tend to limited in animation. I would gladly want more. Like I said before, the whole story and characters are just one-dimension, and has no story arch to it. I think the 2005's life action version, delivers the characters arch even better. In that version, we see why the Aunt became crude and mean to them, due to the limit of food, rather than being told about it, in this film. She has selfish impulses as she singles Seita out and resents the fact that the kids get special treatment because their father is a Navy man. She accuses Seita of being lazy and not supporting the war effort, and praises those who do. Eventually, Seita grows tired of her criticisms and sets off on his own with his sister in tow, believing in his own capabilities to care for the two of them. In the end, he could had learn how to swallow his pride, but nothing is clarify here. All I know is his naiveté and pride end up shutting him away from the rest of society and cause doom for himself and his sister. Blind patriotism is talk throughout the film, that masks selfish impulses during the war and, afterward, Japan's inability to confront this past. The movie does use great symbolism with the fireflies. Like human beings, firefly shine from the inside out, as if liberating its interior beauty. Only in facing darkness, does the fireflies stand out. Fireflies represent light, illumination and mysterious. Fireflies symbolize inspiration and hope. Another symbol of the fireflies represent is guidance. The natural instinct of a being is to follow the light instead of getting lost in the night. And it's true that when you're walking in the night and you suddenly see a firefly, your natural reflex is to follow it, because it is fascinating, and because it looks like it's guiding us towards the right path. The Sakuma fruit drops is another symbol, which becomes a recurrent icon throughout the film. The quick emptying box of fruit candies stands for disappearing hope, that get refill by ash. Ash represented sacrifice, sensitivity and higher awareness. In a way, while not explain, the box that Seita carry around, is indeed his mom's ashes. It's weird in a way, that this film was initially distributed with the 1988's My Neighbor Totoro because the different in the films. One is really happy, while this film lead audience saddened. In the end, My neighbor Totoro became the more popular of the two. Overall: Wonderful tear-jerker based on autobiographic novel. While, the film is market to children and their parent. I doubt many children would like this film. However, I think it's a film that children indeed need to see, when they mature enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My daddy is the hardest man I've ever known. He was describing the movie to me while we were in line at the local bank. Now mind you, I've never EVER SEEN THIS MAN CRY, not when he talks about his deceased father, biological mother (hung herself, blamed my dad in her note, he found her ) You get the idea. He started crying just telling me what it was about! I started crying A because my dad was crying and that scared me and he shouldn't cry alone no matter what reason, and B because the description was so moving ( he didn't even give anything away!) This movie touched us both to the heart. Just writing this review is bringing me to tears. The movie is stellar, especially for Japanese anime coming out in the later 1980's! It's an extraordinary film, about famine, war, sacrifice, struggle (Amongst other things), but most important thing that can never be replaced, FAMILY! A must see, and a MUST BUY, AMAZON.COM, comes in English!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is so many reasons to see this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am 15 years old. I am a boy. I have a younger sister. I have never really thought of the effects of war on countries like Japan in World War II. I watched this on my own, Thursday night, not knowing much apart from the basic plot. I was moved. On Sunday afternoon I watched it again with the rest of my family. I cried. Both times.This movie is so strong, anyone who wants to not be able to sleep tonight, who wants to be kept awake judging their own morals, the effects of war and evaluating their own relationships - watch this movie! If you don't, watch it anyway - it must be seen.I shan't spoil anything but it will touch you out of the sheer cruelty of our modern world and the stupidity of warfare. If I was Japanese or American this movie would make me feel somewhat guilty for the events of the film and it becomes even more poignant to learn that is based on true events. The relationship between Seita and Setsuko is so amazing, for the first hour it is not only extremely realistic but heart-breaking by the end. Even if you don't feel morally different about war, the emotional impact is enough to put me in a state of confusion and feeling so sad ... for days. The single greatest thing is the relationship, it is the most realistic and saddest thing I have ever seen in cinema.If you're between 12 and 25, this is must see. You need to watch it, either to question your own morals or to re-enforce them. And although the creator claims the movie is not an "anti-war" film but one about the relationship then watch it anyway - the relationship makes this movie so magical and the war themes just give it context. If you have a sibling - watch this. If you want to know about war - watch this. If you're between 12 and 25 - watch this. If you want to see something so powerful you'll be moved - watch this. If you want a war film - try something different, watch this.Just watch this movie.Why do fireflies have to die so young?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Genuinely haunting, this is the saddest movie I've ever seen in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a transcendental film. I say so because it moves beyond the realm of normal animation and becomes something so touching and emotional that your heart aches at the end of it. Many people call it one of the most depressing movies they have ever seen and I concur. It is an animation film yes but it has touched me more deeply than other movie I've ever seen. And cartoons are supposed to be fun, right?It is made by the artists at Studio Ghibli, unofficially called the 'Pixar' of Japan; the same production house responsible for such great masterpieces as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbour Totoro amongst many others. But this is totally different from their usual films. It is the most beautiful and important film that Studio Ghibli has ever made and that is saying something.The story of the film is set in the mid 1940s Japan which was being constantly bombarded by the American fighters. There is apathy and tragedy everywhere. This movie is a about a 12 year boy Seita and his 5 year old sister Setsuko trying to survive in world alone. After their home is destroyed by the bombarding, they are forced to live with their aunt who treats them as a burden. Unable to stand it, they move out and find an empty cave and decide to stay there. The heart of the movie is Setsuko. Even though the main character of the story is Seita and we see everything from his point of view, it is for Setsuko that we care for the most. Her innocence, fragility, loneliness and misery is heartbreaking. When Seita goes out to get food and other materials for their living, Setsuko waits for him, playing by herself and her shadow all day. The food they get is not enough but they sustain. Seita is devoted to his sister and tries to do his best to find food for her. He risks his life by going into the houses during the air raids simply because he can find food and other materials to barter. Stealing is not good, we know, but these characters have no other choice. At night they play with the fireflies and bring some to lighten their dark cave, just as such tender moments bring a glimmer of happiness in their dark lives.The final 20 minutes are so heartbreaking that I was crying my eyes out in the end. Now, I usually shed a tear or two for the genuinely emotional moments in the movies such as the recent works or Pixar. But this was different, I was not crying but rather sobbing by the end. This movie struck something deep in me.Grave of the Fireflies resembles Schindler's List in many ways. Both have the primary theme of war. However, even though war is the background of both stories, it is not the main focus. The main focus is the innocents who are caught in the war and what they go through. Homes and families are destroyed and people are scarred for life. This movie shows that war is not the answer to the problems of the society but rather the biggest failure of the society. We feel that when we see this movie. We feel for Seita who is suddenly forced to become an adult and we feel nothing but pity and genuine affection for the little Setsuko who is confused by what is happening around her.I mentioned haunting in my title for this and I must say that while there isn't anything scary in this film, it's theme is definitely haunting and won't leave you long after to finish watching this film. Even the most hardhearted soul will feel their eyes moisten by the end of this film. I've only seen it once but I don't think I can ever muster enough courage to watch it again. However, I would recommend this movie to everyone, child or adult to watch this movie at least once in their lifetime.I find it difficult to put this movie in any particular category; while it is "Animation", it is completely different from any animation movie you've ever seen; it's main theme is "War" but that is not it's main focus. I would rather add this movie to a personal category that I've created just for this movie only "The best movie that I never want to see again". It is beautiful and painful at the same time. Just writing this review made my eyes well up. This is the saddest movie I've ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of survival of two Japanese brothers, little Satsuko, a 4y.o. girl, and her brother Saita, a 14y.o. boy, at the end of the Second World War in Japan, based on the semi-biographical novel of Akiyuki Nosaka.Grave of the Fireflies is one of the saddest stories and movies I have ever seen. It puts face to the the children in any war, those who lose everything and have left with nothing, those too easily forgotten and so easily neglected. What makes the movie sad is the verisimilitude of the story, that something like that happened and is happening any time that there is a war.The animation is marvelous, colorful, attentive to the detail, scenic and intimate, with a lyricism that only Ghiblin Studies are able to create. The drawing of the Japanese countryside is simply superb, and the same can be said of the drawing of the city environments and destruction; the best from Ghiblin to me. The atmosphere is great. The colors a little more saturated than usual from Ghiblin studio, and really precious. The music by Michio Mamiya is extremely subtle and beautiful, perfect for the story. The characters of the two brothers are wonderfully drawn and performed by the Japanese actors. Some of the intimate scenes of the two brothers are really magical, especially the ones involving the fireflies that give tittle to the movie.What is great about this movie is that, very soon, you forget that you are watching animation, as the story is so strong, captivating and engaging, that those drawn characters become real as you and me.A classic animation movie difficult to forget, soulful and marvelous in every possible way.The best animation film I have ever seen and one of the best ever made. No doubt. No perhaps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animes can be this better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the time some categories of movies are limited to express a certain kind of typical story lines. When it comes to Anime most of the movies are related to fantasy or science fiction. If you want to see half human half robots , or dragons from distance mystic lands or vampires from the east and Gods from the forests; anime are the best place for it.But time to time there is a movie which comes out that breaks the trend. 'Grave of the fireflies' is one of such great anime movie which speaks of a different purpose. It speaks of humanity and living. Rather than being super natural it has a story which makes you think twice or maybe thrice about life and what we really do to our society. Occur in the times of the great world war 2 a young boy named Setsuko and his kid sister named Seita are refugees after their city is bombed. Grieving their mothers death Setsuko tries hard to take care of his sister amongst many difficulties. Ultimately neglected by their relatives the brother and sister seek shelter in an abandoned bunker. Not having much to eat and running out of supplies Setsuko does things that he himself is not proud of because he wants to keep her little sister happy and alive.The story is wonderful and so moving that you may forget that its actually an anime. Heartwarming at times and depressing 'Grave of the fireflies' makes most of the Animes look like child's play. I don't know what else to expect from an anime as 'Grave of the fireflies' is so emotional and sure to give you a tear or two in its climax. Originated in 1988 I wish such great movies will hit screens often. Definitely a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most beautiful and touching movie I've seen in my whole life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to start out by saying that this was one of the most depressing movies I've seen in my entire life. But it was definitely one of the most beautiful animated films I've seen also, a film typical of the late 80s anime films by Studio Ghibli. What I liked about this film was the fact that it wasn't fantasy like say, Spirited Away. This was real, based on a true story, based on events that were definitely not just limited to one pair of children during wartime Japan. That's what makes it so heartbreaking: the fact that this is based in reality and that life is cruel and does not always have a happy ending. But the story of Seita and Setsuko is beautifully told and Setsuko is one of the most heartwarming little children I have ever seen in an animated film, she's just that convincing. The music fit the mood perfectly and the voice acting was top-notch: if you get the chance to watch this, watch it in the original Japanese. On a side note, this film made me appreciate the things I have, the fact that I have food to eat everyday and the fact that I have a place to stay and am not caught in some war. It just makes you feel so lucky to have what you have. Also, I would not recommend this for kids because of events that take place early on. Great film, made me cry and realize how lucky I am. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently I purchased two Isao Takahata films on DVD, I got Pom Poko and Grave of the Fireflies being this one the one of which I heard many positive things. I knew what to expect certainly, if you come here and read some reviews of Grave of the Fireflies one of the adjectives you will read more is "heartbreaking", for me this is almost too heartbreaking to even consider to watch it again but don't get me wrong since I actually, and simply, loved Grave of the Fireflies and it is a must-see piece of animation. Japan 1945, civilians need to be ready since at any moment aeroplanes will be over their heads and then it happens, first attack we see and there we have our main characters, the siblings Seita (voice of Tsutomu Tatsumi) and Setsuko (voice of Ayano Shiraishi), almost not surviving the attack, surviving outside a bomb shelter actually. Seita has his father serving to the Navy, certainly Seita himself, just like his little sister and his mother (voice of Yoshiko Shinohara), is not only worried because the man of his house is away but also because they are not safe at all where they are. We see only once Seita and Setsuko's mother, for a reason our siblings can't go together with their mother to the bomb shelter, they won't see again their mother and we won't see in many moments Seita alone or Setsuko alone, certainly each one of them has only the other. Like a month ago or so I wrote my IMDb comment of another true must-see piece of animation, Waltz with Bashir is its English title. I put in the title of my comment a line of "Goodbye Blue Sky", a Pink Floyd song from the brilliant 1979 album The Wall, and I will write that same line here: "The flames are all gone, but the pain lingers on". So in Grave of the Fireflies after the attack that results in many people dead including Seita and Setsuko's mother the flames are not gone, the bombs will continue to fall, Seita and Setsuko will be safe using a bomb shelter. At this point we already know a character that is a familiar of the siblings, we know their aunt (voice of Akemi Yamaguchi), after their mother passed away their aunt's house is the only their aunt's place is where the siblings must went so at this point at least there's some hope in the way of having someone else who cares about them, about their safety. Meanwhile the war goes on the food is less and less, at one very relevant point the aunt gets a good quantity of rice thanks to the clothes of the siblings' mother, the three enjoy a good meal. Actually in the aunt's house live another two persons, her daughter and a student, productive persons that do something for society unlike Seita and Setsuko, that's just how the aunt sees things so since Seita and Setsuko practically don't do anything during the day well they don't deserve more rice and stuff, and they won't have it. Which is interesting is that the aunt's daughter and the other guy never said a thing but anyway that was a complete change of the aunt. There are many real touching moments, from the one that gives meaning to the title to when Setsuko says to her brother that she only wants that he stay with her. But actually those moments came after Seita and Setsuko decided to live by themselves away from their aunt. There are moments in which we see the siblings maybe just for some minutes but still we see them forgetting what's going on, they enjoy the sea and is when they are enjoying a moment by playing a piano and singing when their relation with their aunt will finally end. So in an extremely difficult period for the aunt you can't have a single moment of peace, a single moment with some laughs. The aunt enters and says something like "stop, don't you know we are in war? Is not the time to have parties, you don't have education". She is asking to two young persons that are alone because of the war if they don't know that Japan is in war, is the last time we and the siblings see the aunt. When the war is over the siblings will not even realize about that fact, sure now war is over but their lives as they knew were over much long before, extremely touching, Grave of the Fireflies is nothing but a piece of work that you must see.</fullReview>

This is the story of a brother and sister orphaned by the second world war in Japan, who end up having to fend for themselves. Everything here is achieved with excellence. I watched the subtitled version (which I always feel is best) and was really taken aback by the great little film. This film deals with the harsh realities of a civilization under siege and also with Japanese culture superbly and the director here must tack a huge amount of credit.

		<fullReview>I'd heard that this film was very sad before I saw it and knew how it ended but that didn't prepare me for just how harrowing this film was.Instead of focusing on the military this war film focuses on two children, Seita a boy in his early teens and Setsuko his four year old sister. The action is not fast paced as we follow the children's lives from the death of their mother in a fire-bombing raid through a stay with an unpleasant aunt and trying to live on their own in an abandoned air raid shelter to their inevitable end. By taking it slowing and showing the mundane aspects of their lives the viewer grows to care about the characters, especially the delightful Setsuko to such an extent that that I was smiling during flash backs showing her playing while simultaneously sobbing at her loss.This is not a film to be watched if one is depressed but it should certainly be seen by as many people as possible at least once, it may show two children in war torn Japan but it could easily be set in any war zone at any time in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a lot of movies I don't gauge my appreciation by emotional impact. For many genres you do not want emotional impact--science fiction, action, adventure, etc. But when I see a drama and the story or events are so gripping that I get involved with the characters and cry for them and with them, then that is a really good movie.And if a movie can make me share a character's despondency and weep for a while, then that it is a GREAT movie. It is art.//Spoiler Grave of the Fireflies has made me weep for humanity. A child should never have to yell at an adult, "where the hell can I get food?" and get nothing but stares blank and empty. The image of this, followed by the malnourished girl smiling at her last taste of watermelon before driftng off into death sleep... Overpowering.</fullReview>

It shows that war is deadly beast taking lives of Innocent people, especially children. The way the bond between brother and sister is depicted is truly amazing. It shows how small things are important even in dire times, when death lurks behind every corner. If you have chance to see this film, do so, but be prepared for beautiful, but shocking experience. A No. 1 classic, not to be missed by anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking - I wasn't prepared for this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I've received my present from a former student - Ghibli movies - Hooray! I sit and watch...I've never felt the compulsion to review or express my thoughts on a piece of cinema until seeing this movie. I would recommend not reading any reviews re content or any commentary on it's meaning, it would only taint the experience. But if you must I hope the below doesn't take to much away from anyone about to see the film for the first time.Sat in stunned silence, having read no reviews, done any research or had anyone explain to me what this film was about (yes, I'm an ignorant scamp!) I was in shock. Seeing this masterpiece with no expectations or any idea about the movie has been a truly profound experience.It's rare indeed for a work of art to move, causing such a torrent of emotion - and not the one's we often like to deal with. I thought I would be in for an uplifting experience, and I was, in the most unexpected of ways.Antiwar; I don't know? It seems to be touted that way by many. But then again we bring what we want too, and pin meaning to all things subjectively. 'Grave of the Fireflies' does nothing to glorify, demonise or attribute blame for any nations ideologies or the brutality and reality of war. What it does do is portray the reality of the situation and two lives affected by events beyond their power to control and the tragic consequence it has on their lives.For me this movie is a raw, unflinching confession and apology; possibly an attempt to make sense of what must have been a horrendous sense of loss and guilt...somebody's soul laid bare. This has been the most powerful movie experience this viewer has ever had to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Know What ? If It Wasn't Such A Taboo To Pick An Anime As The Greatest War/Anti-War Film,Then I Would Pick This One!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>unless you've been living in small suburban,in-bred,backwater community you will have heard the name 'studio ghibli' when talking about Japanese animated cinema. This film is one part of my holy trinity of 'grossly' underrated films of all time &amp; should really be recognised as the greatest anti-war statement in film-making,ever!The plot is very simple, its about a boy and his little sister having been separated from there family (there father is a rich captain in the army) trying to survive the bombing on japan during the world war.telling you this is an extremely emotional film, i feel is a spoiler in itself. The way the films structured was extremely fluid and created much tension and dramaticism.I will divulge this: this film had me mute for hours afterwards, i dared not open my mouth to say anything in case tears rolled down my face. Only a worthless husk of a human would not shed at least one tear for this film.Yes, it is animated but don't let that hold against this film, for too long now has British and u.s media made a mockery of children by giving them cartoon tripe. This film is a sure fire 'convertor of disbelievers' of animated features.with the sudden rejuvenation of studio ghibli titles by the help of Disney &amp; pixar, this film reached American audiences where it most mattered. studio ghibli titles now receive Hollywood voice actor dubbing which gives me hope that at last animation is being respected.i couldn't recommend this film more, in fact i believe this film should be shown in all students history curriculum. The futility of war has never been so stark then in this film,you'll find your soul overcome by a feeling you'd never thought you'd have from an animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and haunting (suggestive spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the only film from Ghibili film that Disney didn't buy suggested to me that this was either so bad they didn't want it or for some reason something that the makers felt was too special to them to sell off with the rest of the films. (This is not to suggest that the other Ghibili's have been cheapened by Disney because mostly I think they have done a very good job on the majority of them). Knowing the quality of the Ghibili studio, I had good faith that this would be a good film and I was pleased to find myself drawn into a small-scale look at the WW2 as it had its impact on two children living in Japan. Seita finds himself looking after younger sister Setsuko while his father fights and his mother is killed in a bombing raid. The story follows them as they try to survive alone while rationing and bombing limits their access to food.In a way it isn't that general a film about suffering in a war torn country because the story is quite specific but this does not limit its impact or value. The script and the deliver produce strong characters in Seita and Setsuko and they make it easy to get involved with them and care for what happens to them. In this regard it is a tremendously strong film because as it tears the hearts out of our characters it equally rips at the viewer. It is more than the basic "war is hell" stuff and I must confess I appreciated just how "human" a story it was. Setsuko is the type of wonderful child that I wish more American films could get instead of the precocious brats they mostly cast ? she is beautiful and full of life (thanks in part to the voice work of Shiraishi) and it makes it all the more crushing to see her lose that spark as the film progresses. Seita is as good a character in a different way and he too is well brought out by Tatsumi.The animation is amazing and I did have to keep reminding myself that this was made over 15 years ago because it still looks impressive years later. It captures the heart of the character and has rich backgrounds and detail. It is easy to see why some reviewers have got so worked up over others referring to this as a "cartoon"! Overall then this is an engaging and memorable film whose strength comes from many aspects ? animation, characters, heart, all these things gripped me and hurt me. It doesn't make wider points about war and conflict, it simply focuses on the effects it has on these two specific children and it is all the more impacting for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The saddest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching this movie and I still have tears in my eyes; it's the saddest story I have ever seen, specially in an animated film. It goes way beyond of what someone would think an animation could go. It is almost impossible to bear, as each moment gets sadder. Definitely, it is a must see and, I think, a breakthrough in animation.Seeing it from a technical point of view, the animation is very smooth and very well accomplished; but in the end that's something that doesn't really matter. The plot is the thing that makes this one of the best movies ever.There's no way a movie can get sadder. From the first line until the last one, each one breaks a little the heart of the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's as good as you've heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few movies which not only hold your interest throughout, but can stay in your mind for days later. 'Grave of the Fireflies' (GotF) is one such film. Among war films, it's one of the few which can convey its message without stating that there are good guys and bad guys, or heroes and villains, or "our side versus the enemy". Instead, the enemy is the indifference that war causes, and the pride which can blind people of their humanity. It's more of an anti-war film, since the opponent is the war itself.14 year old Seita is the main character, who is suddenly tasked with caring for his 5 year old sister Setsuko during World War 2 in Kobe, Japan. In the opening scene, we see Seita's last moments of life, right before he joins the ghost of his sister. Seita's eyes don't have the youth, energy, nor enthusiasm which often goes with the age. His first words give the date of September 21, 1945, followed by "that was the night I died" before breathing his last. The rest of the movie is a flashback as to exactly how he got that way.If you've ever seen Spielberg's classic "Schindler's List", you already know what sort of movie to expect. But since GotF is Japanese animation instead of being a live action Hollywood film, it's not as well known. And that's a shame. Many adults have likely seen the movie box when browsing for new titles, before judging it as an unworthy time waster for their children, when the story is really too powerful for many adults.With a budget of $6,000,000 to produce, it's unlikely that a World War 2 era village could have been built, pyrotechnics could have been used to simulate the firebombing, special effects and stunt crews could have been set up and paid for, with all the other expenses involved in recreating the vital scene, with funds left over for everything else. (And if they did, that scene might end up having more screen time than the story actually needs.) Also, writer/producer Isao Takahata doubted that he'd be able to find child actors talented enough to pull off such a challenging role, and he was probably right.In short, this isn't a great anime production, or a great war movie, or a great anti-war movie. It's just a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spectacular cartoon, depicting humanity in its most beautiful and fragile side. The director captures the most touching details of the relationship between a brother and his little sister, both orphans of war. Remember when they make a light show inside the cave, with the fireflies... and the next morning the sister asks her brother, after collecting all the dead fireflies "why do they die so soon?" relating also to the nearly departed mother. For the first time the brother cries, until then he had remained strong, keeping his sister away from the crude reality. I give a strong advice to you, after watching this movie... if you think you have been moved enough by the end of it, try watching the first 5 minutes of the movie again. You will get yet another big punch in the stomach.I agree with critics saying that this is a very strong anti-war movie... nothing can be more powerful than depicting the humanity and suffering that affects all human beings the same. War is a nonsense... as i've heard in a Chinese movie "It is a way of unhappy people to take revenge for those who enjoy happiness". Look how happy this brother and sister were. Something very big is lost everyday.As a final remark... the cartoon is magnificent. It makes you dream at each frame. Watch the small details, how well they are captured. The way the sister talks... the small joys... the games between the two... it leaves one breathless! And the fireflies...</fullReview>

As if he was saying "Look at what war does to people. Please don't ever repeat what happened again. War is not glorious nor honorable. We just wanted to live more..."So true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is easily the most powerful anime I have ever seen. Being an American, the point of view of the everyday people of Japan during WWII is not information that one readily comes by, so this film was both a cultural and historical eye opener.Up until yesterday, I would have continued to claim that Spirited Away was my favorite Anime, followed closely by Akira and Wings of Honneamise. But this blows all of them away. Those interested in the typical Anime full of fast cuts and big action will be disappointed with this film. However, if you appreciate the sheer beauty possible through anime, and you want an extremely touching, heartbreaking story, this is the film for you. Every frame lingers for just a moment or 2 longer than normal, and the impact this creates is astounding.</fullReview>

A young teen boy and his four year old sister are orphaned while their father is in the Japanese navy and their mother is killed in a fire bombing. Though there are a few small bits of humor as a way for them to cope with their situation, I caution you not to think this is a typical Japanese Anime story. It's as gut-wrenching as any live-action war movie and shows the attacks on Japan in a way I've never seen depicted before, from the personal point of view of two children. If you can take it, I think it's an excellent film that tells an important story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it's 2 am now and I'm still trembling...the last scene of Seita looking at the audience and than looking out to what seems to be the current modern Japan city under the hill with skyscraper is just haunting..I didn't see this as the Japanese suffering, for my family had their share of torture during Japanese colonialization era although the gift of forgiveness had taken care of that. Instead, these are children in war, wherever they may bedarn, it turns my state of heart upside down, completely cleared up all the smiles, joys, and nostalgic memories I got after watching Spirited Away.This movie reminds me of a reason I've forgotten, that is why at some point I'd turned to be a completely pacifist that I didn't even defend myself in the presence of serious harm from others. I was looking at myself as a coward, dumb etc, until I'm reminded that once I decided to hurt others with a reason of defense, one day (who knows?)I would declare war for the same reason, and I'd be the one causing these human beings to suffer.How in the world in this movie not in the top 250???? or as a matter of fact, in the top 10 next to Schindler's List????

		<shortDescription>Horribly Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was made with such breathtaking care that I don't expect to see another film that will move me with such intensity. The story line is told with painstaking detail, and that's what makes this movie so poignant, you understand the characters, through the little details, so well, that you cannot help but feel that what you perceive is what these characters are feeling. I literally cried throughout 15 of the films' 90 minute runtime, not just a tear in the eye "oh that's too bad," but sobbing "OH MY GOD WHY, WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO HAPPEN?!" I remember a comment kept running through my head, "this is not fair, it's not fair it had to happen to them, it's not their fault, dammit it's not their fault." This film is a representation of how good dramatic anime can be, if used correctly. There are no kung fu fights, or mysterious dragons, only reality. Such horrible wonderful reality that one will find that they cannot think about war in the same way as they did before. I know that this was the greatest war movie I have ever seen. It also might just be the greatest film ever. See it, don't walk, run, you must see this film.Brandon Gilbrech</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poignant, touching, sad tale of love and endurance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who insist that cartoons of all forms, and particularly anime, are for children, I present you with Grave of the Fireflies. This amazingly well-done anime has some of the most touching, most depressing scenes I've ever seen on a screen, regardless of format. This film is set in Japan near the end of World War 2. Seita and Setsuko live in Kobe with their mother, whom they adore. When the air raid sirens sound, Seita and Setsuko run ahead to the bomb shelter, leaving their mother (who has a heart condition and cannot run) to follow. Seita is obviously not happy with this situation, but the early teen youth cannot carry both his toddler sister and his mother, so he agrees, sure his mother will join them at the shelter. From here begins the long, sad tale of the losses that Seita and Setsuko suffer through together. This is very much the story of a young man forced into the role of provider, protector, and nurturer years ahead of time, and of his little sister who adores him. Seita struggles to provide for himself and for Setsuko, and refuses to surrender himself to despair, regardless of the obstacles he is presented. I feel that this movie is all the more heart-wrenching for the way that the hurt and the pain and the fear are interspersed with the moments of joy and lightheartedness. For much of the movie, it is almost possible to believe that Seita and Setsuko will come out of this together. Of course, since the movie opens with Seita dying, alone, you know that your hope is misplaced, but you want them to survive. The love they share, and the joy they take from one another make you root for them. The characters in Grave of the Fireflies are remarkably well acted. Seita, standing strong, doing whatever is necessary to take care of his little sister. Setsuko is the perfect toddler. Happy one moment, crying the next, unsure of why anything is happening, but sure that Seita can fix everything. The children's aunt, a cold, sarcastic, bitter woman, taking every opportunity to ensure the children, especially Seita, is aware of how much they impose upon her and her patriotic family. In addition to the quality of the story and the caliber of the actors, the beauty of the artwork is just incredible. The facial expressions, the landscapes, the atmosphere. It's all wonderful, drawing you into the story. I found myself checking to see if the prone form of Setsuko was breathing as she lie ill, then realizing that wait, this is animation.This provocative, compelling tragedy is based upon a true story. The original author, Nosaka Akiyuki, wrote a novel based upon his real-life experiences at the end of the war in Japan. This story was then turned into a manga (Japanese comic book), and the story became very popular and well-known. Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing exactly how this movie made it to the screen. A director by the name of Hayao Miyazaki was working on a project named "My Neighbor Totoro" but the production company was worried that nobody would be interested in the tale of two little kids and a monster living in rural Japan. Therefore, they decided to make a movie they felt would draw viewers based upon the familiarity of the tale and for the educational value of the story, and make it a double-feature with "My Neighbor Totoro", billing and packaging the two movies together. Those who are familiar with both movies find the concept of packaging or viewing the cheery, light-hearted romp that is Totoro with such somber, depressing fare as "Grave of the Fireflies" mind-boggling, but the tactic seemed to work, though Totoro has become far more popular and well-known of the two movies.I cannot recommend this movie enough. It is a poignant story of the love shared by a pair of siblings in the worst possible conditions. And you'll never look at fruit drops the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A deeply felt animated drama. (Contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a beautiful and subtle drama that happens to be animated and from Japan. While it could be argued that the movie could have been live action, I doubt it would have been as good. For one thing, in 1988, special effects were very expensive (and the pyrotechnics would have been dangerous to the young actors and their stunt doubles) and not as effective (especially if you consider that this is a rather low budget film from Japan). Also, the two leads are dying slowly from starvation, and several scenes show them as being dangerously skinny. Sure, Schindler's List has emaciated people, but it's more risky for a child to be that skinny.Besides that, I would like to point out a quote from the movie Harvey which explains what I feel about animation better than I could ever say it. Elwood's sister explained the difference between paintings and photographs (somewhat) like this: "I took an art course last summer, and I learned the difference between a fine oil painting and a mechanical thing, such as photograph. A photograph shows only reality. A painting shows the dreams behind the reality."The most obvious part of the dream in Grave of Fireflies is the sepia-toned ghosts who "narrate" the story by guiding us through their memories. This would be difficult to emulate in live action, and it wouldn't look as "real." The funny thing about animation is that it feels real as long as there is nothing real to compare it to--which is why obvious computer animation mixed with cel animation doesn't blend well, and why movies like Heavy Traffic are effective at being deliberately out of step with reality even though there are live action backgrounds. Grave doesn't use live action backgrounds or computers, which is why it doesn't knock the audience out of the dream.Another part of the dream (which many people consider to be a flaw) is the typical Japanese limited animation. Movements are often very subdued (though in more comedic movies they would be exaggerated), and sometimes only the lips of one character are moving on screen. But watch Japanese live-action movies like Rashomon, Seven Samurai, or Shall We Dance and you'll find the same sort of scenes. I think it has to do with the traditional styles of Japanese theater (Noh, Kabuki, and Bunraku), but I haven't had a chance to study them much.But all the animation and stylistics are in service of an incredibly tragic story (one person described it as "suicidally depressing"). Based on Akiyuki Nosaka's semi-autobiographical novella, the movie traces the slow deaths of two children who were orphaned near the end of World War II. I can't really describe how moving and disturbing this movie is, except to say that the scene in which Seita cremates his sister will scar your psyche. This is nothing like the more common science fiction anime or hentai that seemingly pollutes the American market. Grave of the Fireflies is true art.</fullReview>

I recommend you that before watching it, erase from your mind all you've heard about "anime" (Mecha, robots, flying people fighting with super powers, etc.) Just sit there, forget everything and enjoy the movie.And, besides, this is a VERY realistic movie, very well drawn. You won't find anything in it that excuses the animation except little Setsuko behavior.It's more that a sad story, a real story, because...________ WARNING: SPOILER AHEAD _______________ ...because Isao Takahata (or Akiyuki Nosaka) shows us not two heroes nor two people which behavior should be followed as if they were. In fact, I think Seita could have done more: he could have worked in something (when you live in a Third-World country you see poverty situations like this every day, and how people struggles with them, not letting themselves die...). Seita and Setsuko are two very, very, very well represented cases of normal people... Actually, everyone (Seita's aunt, for example) and everything drawn in this movie is very very like real life.________ END OF SPOILER _______________Rent it or buy it. It's one of the best animated movies I've seen. Disney hasn't (and maybe won't) do something like this movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I cry watching movies, it's typically for things other people don't cry for. I have been known to shed tears watching Samurai movies. Epic scenes get me a little emotional. That said, I'm not generally one to get the proverbial down-pour. In order to explain my reaction, I must explain that I spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence in Japan. In addition to spending a year or so in Hiroshima, I remember meeting a lot of veterans, and talking to a lot of old people about their experiences during the war, and so on. As you probably know, the Japanese are not renowned for their overt emotion. No Englishman ever did a 'stiff upper lip' that could hold a candle to the average stoic Japanese geriatric. They always told their stories with a very 'matter-of-fact' manner. But there was one old couple, the Goto-sans, who left an indelible impression on me (bear in mind, I've met other people who were in the 5- mile blast radius at Nagasaki). They had met as children after the bombing of Nagoya, and they recounted much of the very imagery that is illustrated in this film, right down to the machine-gunning by US navy aircraft of children running to the river , thinking they would not represent a legitimate target to the enemy. Their story had a very profound effect on my understanding of Japan, being as I was about 12 when I heard their stories. Watching this film was very much like watching their story in detail. It was as if their recounted childhood memories had materialised on film. It felt as though it imposed their very personal pain onto my heart and mind. Yes, that's ridiculously melodramatic, but it's precisely how I felt watching it. The story of human tragedy in wartime is common to all cultures and societies the world over, and yet this is a uniquely Japanese story; not for the content of the story, but for the way in which it is told. Any film-maker from any other country tackling this subject-matter would have thought to make a film which could probably be made in any other country (the exception perhaps, being a Russian filmmaker);and any other filmmaker would have delivered a film which does absolutely nothing to move you beyond what we've all seen before in every other war film since, well, that war itself. I believe it is no hyperbole to say that never before in the history of cinema has the subject of innocence in wartime been so perfectly,tragically, heart- rendingly captured. Nothing in this film is an exaggeration. The story itself carries all the necessary emotion, with no use of any of the comparatively ridiculous devices used in a lot of other movies in the same category (and let's not forget, this IS animation). Even the music never becomes excessive or melodramatic. You know how the story ends, but you can't just draw away, and it still tears through you like a rend in linen. It was such an emotional experience for me that I've never been able to repeat viewing. It is such a hopeless tragedy of a story, and yet I felt so much the better for having watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, be wary of the negatives due to lack of understanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read most of the negative reviews for this movie and I really pity the members making them. There's just a shear lack of understanding and/or appreciation for what had gone on. As a kid during the same war period I can relate to this story and can understand why these negative reviewers really can't see nor understand why this is happening the way it is.For example, them leaving because of the Aunt. This is a classic case not just in Japan but for many cultures. Her attitude towards them is so disgraceful there is no choice but to leave. Yes, he could have stayed and help his sister out but eventually they will not get any food, water or shelter. Worst yet, they'll get beaten to death simply because the Aunt will choose to support her family instead of her Sisters. That's how evil this scene is without even being told out completely. Viewers don't understand this it seems. Maybe everything needs to be explain for them every step of the way, I've no idea.In fact, my Father, sister and I just started talking for hours the other night about the family's "travels" to avoid the war and get the kids to safety and eventually to the US. Let me tell those that don't understand; my Father's sigh from telling the story is a sigh that I will never be able to reproduce. No matter how hard my life has been up until now, it can never compare to what they have gone through and what little I have witnessed during the escape.Honestly, you can't imagine how hard it is until you've been there. Having said that, this movie does a good job at telling it's story. If you're reading the reviews for this movie I hope you consider what I've said. Some people aren't open minded enough to see what is being communicated with the movie and assumes by taking some things too literal, as in the boy not taking up a job. Do yourself a favor and watch the film with an open mind, you'll enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, heartbreaking antiwar anime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched a dubbed, letterboxed VHS rental. First off, I'm pretty much an anime novice. I've seen four films from Miyazaki, Paprika, and that's it apart from a few things I saw 20 years ago that I barely remember. I've liked what I've seen, but nothing quite blew me away until Princess Mononoke which I saw a few weeks before this; I was hoping this would do the same.No way to do this without spoilers, so be warned. At the very beginning of the film, a young boy is dying in a train station. He dies, and it is (apparently) his ghost who guides us through and watches over the rest of the film. Seita is an adolescent boy, and early in the film he and his much younger sister Setsuko are orphaned during the late stages of World War II. Bombs level their city and their mother lies seriously wounded for a while until she succumbs. The most powerful single moment in the film for me comes halfway through when we learn that Setsuko, who Seita has been shielding from this knowledge, has already learned what happened.Seita takes Setsuko to a distant relative's house, but she soon tires of taking care of them and they strike out on their own, finding a bomb shelter to live in. Unfortunately, they have little money and no means of making more, and both begin to starve....the inevitable ending is grimly foretold several times in the film and comes as no shock.But throughout the film we find scenes of the joys of childhood, the innocence even in wartime that can allow kids to be kids, games to be played, violence to be forgotten. It is the interspersing of these scenes with the physical and emotional devastation wrought by the war that makes for a powerful experience. Still, for me at least -- though I hate to be churlish -- this didn't quite come together as the masterpiece I thought it might be. It all felt too familiar I guess, and I was irritated by Seita's unrelenting (and stupid) optimism at times; it just seemed out of place and perhaps intended to provoke a response that I just couldn't give it.All in all, powerful but not quite great</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED this movie...and I really hate Japanamation!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with my teenage son last year. It taught him more about the sad truth of the bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima more than anything else and kept his attention the entire time to boot. This gem of a film taught him more than he ever learned in school about this piece of history, and it was probably told in a more accurate and heartfelt manner than any history book could have presented it. We watched it on the Turner Classic Movies Channel. I was dreading watching it with my son that evening (he is an anime fan), but Robert Osbourne (the host of TCM) said to stay tuned to this movie and really give it a chance even if you were not a Japanamation/anime fan. I was absolutely floored, as was my son. It really touched both of us, and it is difficult to reach teenagers in this day and age. It made tears come to our eyes, and we still talk about this movie rather often. This film is a masterpiece and could be used to teach the horrors of war and the innocent victims who have no political vote or voice at all. I hope to God that Ted Turner knows what good work he has done in saving this wonderful film. I hope that I can find it on DVD one day, as I have not been successful in doing so yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>children knocking on heavens door...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about two orphaned siblings (an elder brother and toddler sister) trying to survive in the war torn Japan of the second world war. I think it would be a mistake to call this an anti-war film. Certainly it will pluck some chords in you as to the stupidity and cruelty of war. However, I think this is a film mostly about love, selfless devotion and atonement. The elderly brother who himself is basically also a child, takes the care of his sister into his own hands. He makes some poor decisions. These decisions are very natural given that he is just a naive child, and moreover the proud, somewhat spoiled child of a war officer. The story unfolds very realistically, you just know that everything will spiral down for the lonely children in an unforgiving world, but that the love between them will last.This movie presents the film making art at its best. The story telling, excruciating attention to details, directing, all faultless. I like this film also for the acting, I think it would be impossible for a child do the acting for the Setsuko character (the toddler sister) in a non-anime movie as is done here. She is so natural and real, it is difficult not to be moved. The only flaw I can find with the movie is the musical score. Mostly it is OK, but it could have been better.I am not very familiar with the Japanese culture, but I can say that the film includes some subtle but powerful criticism for the nationalistic fervor which led in that time to the ruin of Japan. You see officers rooting for the emperor in the ashes of a burnt down city full of burned corpses. You see half-starved children still chanting the songs about the proud steel warships of their empire. And you see the same proud children later but this time hurraying for the enemy planes because the bombs they pour are the only way they can feed themselves. Our world needs more films like this.Finally, this is a very moving, deep movie which deserves and needs more than one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Masterpiece, Enough said.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not to keen on Manga/Anime movies but I do know a lot of Isao Takahata Other films like Spirited Away etc. My girlfriend is a huge fan and bought the DVD and I was glancing at it from my computer desk but the more it went on the more I started to pay more attention. The images of some of the animation is incredible as much I don't usually watch these films I always complement the people that draw and makes these film because of the stunning imagery.This film hit me pretty hard which was unexpected because of the little girl and her brother's story during World War 2. I was say that this was an animation version of Schindler's List because of the horrific images of death. If you are not for the faint hearted of tragic stories then avoid this because I find myself quite close to tears in parts but it's fantastic story of hope and survival is what grabs you and never let's go. I expected a good film but I wasn't even watching it to start off, only by turning my head and listening to parts is what grabbed me and for that to do to somebody who generally doesn't watch these type of films says a lot about the film altogether. I am now going to go threw my Fiancés collection of Manga and Anime films and see what else can do the same as The Grave of the fireflies did and that was changed my opinion of a genre that I have cruelly ignored over the years. Trust me, to anyone who reads this, if you like film-making and storytelling all together especially animation then watch this because there is nothing else like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have a somewhat different take on this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard about this film for several years, finally saw it at Target for a bargain price, and gave it to my 10 year old daughter for Easter. We're both big Studio Gibli fans. Yes, I knew it was sad and I warned my daughter about how sad it would be. But she's fairly mature and it's about time for her to see films about some of the horrible events of history.Grave of the Fireflies is a beautiful but frustrating film. The first five minutes caused tears to well up in my eyes and shivers to run down my spine, which I had to shake away before watching the rest of the film. I said I've got a spoiler here, but I'm not sure if it is or not. The spoiler is that despite the good heart of brother Seito, it is he who is really most responsible for his sister's death. His pride and, indeed, arrogance prevent him from taking the right steps toward protecting her. The film is anti-war and not anti-American. I actually saw it as being more anti-Japanese. I saw it as allegorical. Brother Seito represents Japan, whose pride and arrogance led to them waging war, promoting the war, and continuing the war long after it knew it would lose the war.Yes, I'm reading something in here. But, as other reviewers have mentioned, Seito makes so many errors in judgment--not just failing to return his sister to his aunt, but also in failing to use his mother's money to buy decent food until it is too late. It just all fell together for me that Seito was more a victim of wartime Imperial Japan than of the American bombs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely touching, best movie about war ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the fireflies is a masterpiece from Japans Studio Ghibli and among my top ten movies of all time.It tells the story of a brother and a sister and their struggle to survive in Japan after their mother has been killed by the nuclear bomb. The kids never loose their optimism and are very brave considering the circumstances.The movie resists all superficial dramatics and tells its story in a very subtle way which makes it even more touching. I am sure you cannot see this film without tears coming to your eyes. Hell, I am close to tears as I write this and its a year since I have seen it.And don't judge this as an Anime, this is so much beyond other animated films. It is in a league of its own. For me it is the best movie about war ever. Don't think you are prepared.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wants to make you cry just a bit too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not an unpleasant experience overall: a simple story, cute kids, good scenes - just trying to be too dramatic without actually much content.If you've been watching any recent movies, you can see the art of making you feel has been improving considerably: good timing of dramatic music, paused dialogue and close-ups, etc. Even if you were not particularly caring for the characters, suddenly you find yourself feeling "this is serious" and maybe even your eyes water up - only to ask yourself why a few minutes later.Grave of the fireflies takes the basic formula: sad setting (war) + likable characters (cute children) and lets it unfold, adding cardboard characters as needed (cold portrayal of Japanese society, impolite or uncaring neighbors for no reason, etc).There is a senseless "flashback" from the main characters watching themselves which adds nothing. Character development is a bit limited, as you see the survival strategies ramp up a bit, but no real effect or reason on why that is. In fact, the conclusion arrives for lack of awareness, not lack of resources. Which contradicts the negativity of the war setting..Anyway, not too unpleasant, except for the "intellectual dishonesty" of shoving drama down the throats of the viewer.</fullReview>

Even through he is struggling for food and shelter how he(Seita Character) reacts when he came to knew about defeat in war and how patriotic he was.Last but not least, the emotions we felt with climax and Setsuko (Sister)Character.When brother brought watermelon put piece in sisters mouth and how she reacts and what happened later still hunting me.

		<fullReview>I recently was told about this film by a friend. She warned me that it was one of the saddest films she had ever seen. I didn't believe her at first because come on it's anime, Oh! how wrong I was.Being most used to modern anime I was at first unprepared for such 'vintage' animation but you get used to it and the story is what truly leaves an imprint on you. I tried watching it in English but I found that watching it in Japanese really made it all the more realistic. The relationship between the brother and sister was a masterpiece in itself.The film allowed us to see raw love, once the boy found out his mother had died he tried even harder to look after his sister. I started really tearing up when the brother fed his sister the watermelon and then when the boy says she never woke up I just let myself go.I haven't cried like this for any movie I have watched, I got a little misty during the pianist but that's about it. The anime, allows us to feel how much effort was put into the film the animation is so detailed and every frame vibrates with the hard work of those involved.This movie deserves to be seen by so many other people. It should be compulsory to watch this film.</fullReview>

The movie was excellent, the argument is really clear at the moment of begin to polemicize, the art is spectacular and has the capacity to make the people feel something whitout the needly of human people doing things, this kind of art leave me whitout words.I was analizing these kind of situations in the colombian's context and i did'nt found a lot of differences, because the reason of this story is just one of the colombian's stories, there is'nt just violence, there are drugs, poverty and a lot of robs on the political structure that make weak the social structure.This movie made me change mi point of view about the people that i watch almost every day on the streets from my city, now i am going to try to think why are they there and i'll open my mind, and if i can i'll help them, it doesn't matter if they buy drugs, alcohol or another think, the true is that nobody knows in what situation is going to be tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When in a story or in a movie there are children,humility and suffering is sure that it touch our hearts. Not all stories finished whit a happy end and i think that the cruelty adds more reality. Other characteristic is the animation. Some people says that the animation movies only are funny, but this concept is completely wrong. The animation movies can also manifest love, fiction or real topics and the children can be seen and enjoy. "Grave of the fire flies" is a real movie that presents the other face about of the war between two countries. The characters are completely innocence and they try on survive in a terrible place, Where there aren't any food and any things necessary for their life. The desperation increases and the people are very indifferent, like right now. This movie wants take conscience about of the countries and the wars between them. while the world continuous apparently without problems, the religion and politic do nothing for the people. Other important thing about of "Grave of the fire flies" is the soundtrack, in this case is so beautiful and nostalgic that supplements very well the images giving a better feeling to the movie.I would like to recommend this movie, but please see it better... And write your opinion! Thanks!!! Alejandro Serna Marin</fullReview>

And the other side of the face of the coin is that if people give money to poor people with all the ingenuity, good faith and in the good think especially of the poor people but not looking forward to see where that money will be spent if drugs or good things.They maybe think in good things but they don't know.

After seeing the anime, it's a great way to releasing a lot of tense emotions you may have kindled in yourself, let alone--create new ones. It's an everlasting movie, one that will leave you thinking about life for quite sometime. Maybe then, when life is precious to you, will you wish to watch it again.If you fall in love with the characters, don't fall too attached, it'll hurt you evermore. Find to love those things around you, cherish those all around you--for you never know when one thing will be there and hence, begone the next.This movie makes you appreciate the aspirations of life, it's meanings and so much content, in one tiny film.If found it touching, I hope you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This certainly is a depressing cartoon.I would not call it a "masterpiece" though, as others have, because it does have its flaws. The story pretty much revolves around two kids, and in my opinion fails to emphasize enough the reason why they are suffering so much, while others around them seem to be doing fairly "alright".The cartoon does however gives us well rounded characters so its easy for us to understand everyone's motivations, even though they do not play a big role in the story.The art style has a "hand-drawn" feel to it, creating a sense of intimacy between the cartoon and the audience. But there are certain parts, such as the montage of memories about the recently deceased, which quite blatantly goes over the top in its sentimentality, as if the screenwriter wrote "cue in tears" on top of that scene.The biggest achievement of this film I think is that it shows the death on the civilian side during the war is an excruciating slow and agonizing process, as opposed to a usual quick and violent death of a soldier on the battlefield.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very very good but it is also very very depressing. Even though it's animated you forget about all that because everything seems too real and the movie just grabs a hold of you and takes you into a downward spiral of severe hopelessness. Don't watch this during the day or else you'll be depressed for the whole day. Watch it at night so you can sleep it off and watch it with someone if you can. If you watch it with someone you can discuss it afterwards and you won't feel so depressed. If you're going to be depressed then be depressed with someone and don't be alone when you watch this movie. You will want to be with someone special so the both of you can experience this great work of tragedy done Japanese animation style. Peace out.</fullReview>

You should know a bit about the fire bombings that took place and the condition that Japan was before and after the war.This film is based on a true story, and it pulls all the right cords. If you don't like Anime because they "sexualize all the characters" then this might change your mind, and I'd highly recommend watching any of the films by Studio Ghibli which I would consider the on par with the likes of Disney and Pixar for storytelling.It's not Schindler's List, but it shows the dark side of war that most films don't cover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Got me through depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am honored to write a review for this is a movie which must be seen once in a lifetime. This movie got me through depression which often caused upbraiding or unfurling anger at my family , afore you is a masterpiece which makes you cherish life and contributes to great level of emotional awareness and sanctity. I have seen a bevy of animated movies and series but this leaves an insurmountable mark and is literally without fault in terms of its brutal honesty of this world and characters too. I am utterly mystified with the beauty of this movie as it often makes my depression go away and make my life more appealing to me. I needn't explain further the kind of psychological impact it will have on you but it definitely did on me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest film you wont want to watch twice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a 1988 Japanese anime drama/war film directed by Isao Takahata and tells the story of Japan during WWII, focusing on the devastating effects that war leaves on the civilian populations. The story focuses on a brother and sister and the hardships they face throughout the war and their struggle to survive. Studio Ghibli is often known for there more mature and adult approach to animation movies-but nothing could prepare me for the heart-wrenching, emotional and truly tragic story of Seita and Setsuko. Grave of the Fireflies touched my heart in a way no other film has, with its gorgeous animation, astounding soundtrack and powerful narrative. Each scene is crafted to perfection and the characters (although many of them unlikable) really push the theme of tragedy, abandonment and ignorance towards the desperate and innocent people. We really feel and begin to connect with Seita and Setsuko right from the start and saddened for their state and the consequences war leaves on the innocents. The scenes featuring Seita and Setsuko are so beautiful, the moments they share together feel so real and loving, they almost feel like members of your own family. and while the film is extremely heart-breaking, the moments of joy feel so magic. Grave of the Fireflies is gripping, emotional, heart-breaking, tragic, beautiful,magical, astonishing and is the best anti-war film ever made. Grave of the Fireflies really is Ghibli's crowning gem and quite possibly the greatest film you wont want to watch twice. Never the less Grave of the Firelies absolutely deserves a 10/10- Quite possibly my favourite film of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must-Watch Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story concerns a kid, not yet old enough to fight in the war, and his little sister. Their mother died in the firebombing that occurred close to the end of the war. As such, they are forced to move in with an aunt that does not really want them around. Eventually, they grow angry and leave. Takahata intended this to be viewed as a reasonable but poor decision, but the West, with all its independence, has a tendency to view his actions in more of a positive light, which I don't think is a bad thing; if anything, it adds to the film rather than detract from it.But cultural differences aside, the kids continue on their way and try to survive in the waning days of WWII. The brother does everything he can to take care of his sister and himself even as food becomes scarce. But eventually, they both die. That is not a spoiler. You the viewer are shown by the film in the opening sequence. Bro and Sis are spirits riding a train through Japan at its late-80's apex, looking out over the lights.This is not a normal war movie, as you probably have already gleaned. It is a movie about two kids forced to try to survive during war. This distinction shows in the score, which sounds reminds me of a child's music box playing with embers dancing around it. It's probably one of my favorite scores for any Ghibli movie, which is saying a lot.If I had to pick one movie to embody somberness, it would be this one. Most of it is not particularly depressing, at least not in the American sense of the word. There is no melodrama or a lot of moments specifically designed to pull at your heartstrings. The movie just lets its events play out and is better for it. Some of it has to do with smart writing; some of it is just the culture of Japan versus the culture of America. Note that I'm not saying I prefer Japanese culture and ideals; just that said culture and ideals work in the film's favor. This is a film that calls for subtle, something American films, for better or for worse, are not known for.As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly clear how and when the two kids are going to die. Now, if the film was trying to twist us around and surprise us with its every move, this would be a bad thing. But given the sort of film it is, this growing sense of clarity works. It's like putting together a puzzle. A very somber, disturbing puzzle. The characters feel this despair and so do you. It's a nice way of drawing the audience into the film.I have talked to many people who say this is one of the most soul-crushing films they have ever seen. Among people's lists of 'Films they loved but never want to see again', it is right alongside Schindler's List and Requiem for a Dream. And with good reason; there is something inherently hopeless about the situation these kids are in. You want someone to help these kids. You know that someone should help them. But you also know- right from the start of the film- that no one is going to help them.If you have a friend who doesn't think animation can be as good as live-action: first off, why are you friends with this person; second off, show them this film. It can be a bit of a wakeup call for anyone who has only seen animation used for kids movies.There are few films that can affect so many people in so many different ways. If you sit down and watch this with a friend, and they do not seem evoked by it: check their pulse, they must be dead. I could dissect how many levels this film works on, but that would take far, far too long.Something I should talk about, though, is a scene at the end of the film. Again, no real spoilers here. The ghosts of the brother and sister look out upon modern Japan once again. Take notice that the city lights are made to look like fireflies, which in this film are a symbol for the happiness and prosperity that cannot last. This has been said to be a subtle message about how the prosperity Japan was enjoying at the time was destined to fade, and that everyone should try not to be so rash and blinded by what should not last forever. Pretty cool, if you ask me.This is a film everyone should watch, at least once. There are a lot of war films out there, but there are very few like this, both in perspective, tone, and of course, quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, but emotionally draining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start, let me say that this is one of the most powerfully emotional films I have ever seen. Some people might be turned off by the fairly simplistic animation style, or write it off as a children's movie without really giving it a chance. While I can't speak for everyone, I believe this would be a mistake. I won't put any plot details here, for two reasons. First, there are literally hundreds of other reviews here with that information, if you really want to know, and I believe that films have more impact if you go into them with as little information as possible. But as good as this movie is, I don't think I'll watch it again, at least not for a while. It's so powerful, so utterly affecting on a primal, visceral level, that it's a real ordeal to watch. But don't let that deter you. I believe this is a film everyone should see at least once. The one thing Grave of the Fireflies does better than any other film I've seen is to show the real human cost of war. We all read about World War II in history class, with varying degrees of detail, but reading dry, detached stats in a book about a war that happened before most of us were born is vastly different than seeing the thing like this, up close and personal. It's too easy for us to just see the people on the losing side of our bombing raids as the enemy, and not as real humans that suffer as much or more than we do. That, more than anything else, is what endeared me to this movie. It made me think about things differently, things I was sure I already knew. That's rare in any movie, much less an animated one. So in conclusion, I definitely highly recommend Grave of the Fireflies, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's lighthearted and whimsical just because it's animated. It's heavy, profound, and deeply moving. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Animated films are usually made for kids. And besides the occasional Toy Story or Lego Movie, you don't get animated films that actually appeal more to adults or young adults than to young children. But Grave of the Fireflies is definitely a film aimed at older people. It tells the story of a brother and a sister in the wake of several bombings in Japan during the second world war and the struggle for both of them to survive on their own without their parents. It's as dark as any animated film that I have seen and without giving anything away, the film doesn't really get any better for our main characters. It's just an incredibly devastating look at the other side to the war and how terrible many peoples lives got.The film begins by telling us the main character is going to die at a very young age. Then only a few minutes later do we see piles of bodies burned to ashes from the bombs. Setsuko, the young girl, and Seita, her older brother, try and work their way through what has become a Japanese wasteland and make the most out of their conditions. I really got the 'Life is Beautiful' vibe from the film. Seita is constantly trying to keep Setsuko as happy as possible as their mother was killed during the bombings and the father is nowhere to be found. The bond between them is well represented and easily believable which makes it even more devastating as their conditions deteriorate as the film progresses.I will say the film's English voice-overs could have been better. There were certain times early on that I feel like the timing and the tone of the way the characters presented their feelings to each other were off. The aunt seemed to make certain character decisions that had no merit because of the lack of back-story. I just felt like that character felt contrived in the film's plot and was doing things specifically to move the plot along. But other than that, I didn't have really any complaints with the film.+Beautiful even at it's most devastating moments +Sibling bond+Different take on the animation genre -English voice-overs and the aunt character 8.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grave of the Fireflies"sure isn't a movie I can put myself through with any kind of frequency, but it does make you think about those caught in the middle during wartime. To really turn the knife, the focus here is on two orphaned children. There's money but no food, jobs or family. Is there any possible happy ending here? Hell no! But it's still a powerful story that goes for the emotional throat. And I still care deeply for these characters even after all is said and done. With such a (tear-jerker) reputation, I have to admit I walked into this expecting to come out a blubbering fool. I didn't to such an extent, but on the other hand, it's not everyday you see such power from an animated film.It's just so bloody unfair what these poor kids have to go through, but I can't recommend this highly enough.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies until now was the only movie to make me cry... Its powerful is in simple images and crew, the story is seen with the eyes of a child that's why is so simply. Even if it's a cartoon is not right for children, the reality of the war is presented as it is, terrifying.... The viewer is very passionate about the history and suffers with two young characters! One of the most interested thing is that the second world war is seen trough Japanese eyes, so it could be very different from the American movie we are used to see! The colors are very important to convey the sadness and the tragedy of the movie, rarely we can find "happy" colors! Grave of the Fireflies is a important love story between an old brother and young sister, is one of those movies that you can not lose! 10/10 absolutely!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still trying to pull myself together after finishing this movie 10 minutes ago.Wow, just wow. The feeling of despair I encountered watching this movie will certainly change the way I see things day to day. After the first 5 minutes I exited out of my browser and had to collect the courage to return to the movie after reading some comments. My outlook on war was negative to begin with, but this movie just made my stomach turn in ways that has never happened before.Seita could have been me. I have a 5 year old sister in the room next to me, and much to my tearful demise she acts just like setsuko. This review contains no spoilers, just an explanation from my soul. The anime turned me off at the beginning, but grew on me as the music and picture seemed to flow seamlessly. The aunt in my opinion was not a villain, she was desperate too as anyone would be in that war situation. Food was scarce, bodies lay in streets, raids were carried out daily, and death was becoming an everyday encounter. The only somewhat happy scenes in this anime were when the two were playing by the beach and by the shelter. The saddest part of the film, for me, was when setsuko reveals that she knew the truth about her mother to seita. Just something about a 4-5 year old girl who had already lost everything say so calm that her mother was dead in a grave makes it almost impossible to hold back tears. The ending of this movie was the only consolation for me. Knowing that she didn't have to suffer anymore and that she could be reunited with her family was one of the only moments of this movie that I could smile.This movie is a must watch. It may be the most depressing thing you do and you may cry and you may wish you could help but just sit and watch the movie. Do it alone because your emotion will pour out, its impossible not to cry and if you don't then you need help. Tonight I will pray for all war victims like these two. Their love towards each other is not a fictional plot in some regular anime. That sort of kindness and selflessness is felt in my heart and in the hearts of everyone watching and THAT is true art. Rest in peace to the helpless souls who's last days were in that hell. I hope the life that came after offers you the happiness and plentiful feasts that you deserve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple and Moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isao Takatha's Grave of the Fireflies details a brother and sister living through the fire bombings of Japan during World War II. The movie elegantly depicts the relationship between the two children, and uses the many tragedies they encounter to pace the film. Despite the weightiness of the topic, the brilliance of the film comes from the lightness of the interactions between Seita (the brother) and Setuko (the sister). The films dialogue convincingly mixes the inane quality of children's conversations, and the inability for these immature characters to process life or death situations; Setuko's hallucinations and the trip to the doctor both play between these divergences in dialogue. And the writing never strays from a simple plot, delivered beautifully.Animation in the movie varies in style; crude to wonderfully colourful. The richness of this style comes to the front in several scenes, particularly the opening and closing scenes. Nonetheless, the aesthetic strength of the film has more to do with the cuts and edits Takatha has implemented. Jarring cuts for visceral reactions, multiple angles within action scenes, and long shots for some of the bonding scenes.I watched the English version of this film and the only let down of this film was the voice acting. The actors delivered their scripts as if they were being spoonfed each line. Setuko's voice lacked any emotional resonance and Seita's voice never broke at any point in the film, despite having to deal with some extremely complex emotions.My verdict on the film, however, is that it touched me in similar manner to Kilmov's Come and See (1985) without being confined to a strictly definable piece of time. While Klimov's film deals almost entirely within the constraints of the horrors of WWII, Takatha merely uses the war as a backdrop to show how youth is loss to us in times of extreme horror. Also the symbolism, themes explored and the imagery used in every scene will definitely make me return to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch this movie, be prepared to be profoundly moved, and hopefully become a better person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie 10+ years ago, have probably watched it another 2 times since. Last time was about 4 years ago yet is still haunts me so much that I decided to create an IMDb.com account today to write this review as a kind of tribute to this masterpiece and the authors as well as the people it is about (the victims of war, the children who have endure great suffering).The father I have become since I last watched this movie is all the more deeply impacted by this dramatic movie since my son is now approaching the age of the young Setsuko.So many reviews have been written about this movie - I couldn't do better justice to this movie than most of those with my lacking English skills (foreign language for me). So instead of insisting on how sad and heart shattering the movie is (has been said in many reviews) I would also like to tell how beautiful it is at the same time.I would like to testify how much this movie simply manages to pass through all the shells, protections, armor and shields we busy people wrap around our souls, in order to go straight to the core and connect us with our humanity. How much I want to tell my son (and the people I love) how much I love him, how much I pray that similar drama never occurs to him. How much I feel alive and privileged to not have had to endure more than a small fraction of the pain depicted in this movie. How much the elder brother I am recalls the brotherly bonds I had with my brother and sister, and the deep desire to protect them from outside evil (yet we grew in a peaceful and prosperous place so no such drama occurred to us).Everyone: if you haven't watched this movie yet, do it. As emotional as it is, not even the wildest collection of superlative about the incommensurable sadness of this movie would miss the point, as it is beautiful and heart-changing (for the better) even more than it is sad. It will move you, but it may well reconnect you with parts of your humanity you didn't even know existed. It may be a good opportunity to ask yourself important questions and ultimately become a better person than you already are.Not for too young people, not for children under 13 and even then, parental company and post-movie debrief strongly advised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel that Hotaru No Haka is not a movie that tries to promote a message or has an agenda of any sort. This movie is a tribute to those that went through the hardship, who faced the immense brutality of war and endured the inconceivable dreadful helplessness.It is a poem of sorts, a detached and serene tale spoken to the universe. It exists in its time and space, like a bubble of emotion, floating in its reality without trying to involve you.But it's deeply involving, mind tearing, heart hollowing. Once you're in that bubble, your world breaks! You attach yourself to its reality and then simply die with it.There's no easy way to explain why we do this to each other and the horrible disheartening truth is?that's life.There's also a word of caution: though each and every single one of you must watch it, I actually fell physically ill for three days after I watched it. I never watched it since, but keep returning to read about it sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that shows a true look at how it was for some children in Japan during the bombings. Some would work and live in the factories, others would remain with teachers and schools, others would move to the country side with groups and stay with teachers, their families or relatives and others would do what Seita and Setsuko did, stay alone, or run away and stay alone. Either way it was not an easy situation for anyone. The fight for food and shelter was very true in its nature.A very sad look on how war can affect a people on all levels. Truly beautiful movie, and the voice of the little girl Setsuko, done by Rhoda Chrosite, is truly what makes this film even the more crushing.The only credit done by Rhoda Chrosite as I have seen, but the voice for Setsuko gives this film it's sad, alarming and dooming nature. Not an animated film for kids in my opinion, a real tear jerker and one not to forget any time soon. One of the top 10 best animated films in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps for the first time, I watched such a heart wrenching, realistic and poignant tale in an animated movie. The movie charts the tale of a 14 year old brother and his 4 year old sister who are left alone to fend for themselves in war torn Japan. Their mother fell victim to the air bombings which leaves them to shift to their aunt. Slowly the two face the wrath of the war and succumb to malnutrition. Perhaps there is not such distress as of dying of hunger. And the film brings this to the screen, which makes this film just distressing and grim, which you won't dare to go through again.A film that starts on a light note with an undying love and affection of a brother towards his sister ends up with the struggle for survival during wartime where the only motive becomes fulfilling the hunger. The story unfolds vividly in the picture just making you cry. Perhaps this demonstrates the power of the movie to sweep you along. Before this, I felt 'The Pianist" was able to do the same. Besides, the fabulous animation which you can expect from Japanese animes, there is a tremendously moving story to the film which would make it memorable. Well, most of the Disney and Pixar animations have made you laugh all the way, this movie has a power to make you cry.Rating:: 3 stars out of 4</fullReview>

But it is because it is so effective that you would be in this trauma for a while, may be days of weeks. I am so in love with Setsuko that I wish to adapt a kid, name her Setsuko and take care of her. This movie brings out the human even in the most devilish person in this world. Wish entire world would have watched this movie, there would be compassion, kindness, and sensitivity all over. It penetrates through your heart so much that you cant just control crying like a baby. Its realistic and you wouldn't see a premature kid like it is shown in other movies. Setsuko is exactly how a 4 year old kid would be. You will fall in love with her and the rest i don't want to say and be a spoiler. Don't expect this to be making your day happy. But expect this to bring out the human in you, and realize that we are so lucky for what we have and we should be happy and content with it.

The siblings go to live with their unsympathetic aunt. Seita clash with her, and the siblings go live by themselves in the bomb shelter next to the waters. It doesn't go well as their lives deteriorate to the point where Seita dies alone on the floor.It is the saddest of tragedy. The animation is the perfect foil to the subject matter. The animation style is children's story but the movie is all too realistic. The characters are not cartoons. It is ripped from the pages of history.

The dynamics of the brother-sister relationship is beautifully expressed on the screen &amp; voice actors have done a splendid job too in bringing these characters to life.The hand-drawn animation is beautiful, evocative &amp; aesthetically pleasing, the effects of war on civilian life is strongly felt, music is minimal yet eloquent &amp; the manner in which the fate of its main characters is unraveled is so depressing that it'll leave many teary-eyed. On an overall scale, Grave of the Fireflies is an absolutely heartbreaking, haunting &amp; harrowing piece of quality cinema that remains one of Studio Ghibli's most defining works &amp; is powerful enough to rank high amongst other war films too. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

I believe that Hayao Miyazaki's movies and Isao Takahata's movies are equally good and want to show us many things for Japanese culture and for the history of Japan, the wars and more.Finally I believe that "Grave of the Fireflies" is a movie that everyone have to watch and I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well down and very depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved depressing movies when I was in college, but generally avoid them now; the heartbreak of a movie like La Strada just seems more than I can bear. I knew Grave of the Fireflies was pretty serious, but I did not realize how utterly grim it would be. Still, I'm glad I saw it. It's a very well-made movie. It's also an example of an animated movie that makes a case for animation in drama. I often feel that if there is nothing in a film that can't easily be shown with live action then it's a waste to use animation, which loses the nuances of human acting. But this film allows for scenes you wouldn't get in a live action movie; the use of fireflies would never be as lyrical and striking in a live drama.There are a few issues with the movie. One is those weird red, raggedy-anne circles on the little girl's cheeks, which I found endlessly distracting. More importantly, there are places where the boy's actions don't make sense. This is not to say that there weren't good reasons for what happened (the movie is based on an autobiographical book, so it may be true to life), just that the movie fails to make things clear.It was a good movie, but it has not convinced me to watch more depressing films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Miss it! WARNING, you are probably going to cry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Sob Sob Sob* J?.just a moment?. *Blows nose hard* Alright? I'm ready for this. As you can see, this show is sad. I don't mean boo hoo sad, I mean full blown cry your eyes out sad. We are talking about a movie that has two young children trying to live at a time where bombs would destroy your home quickly and fear was in everyone's thoughts.The film starts on Sept 21, 1945 in a train station. World War II had just about ended and our main protagonist, Seita, is sitting against a poll. A Janitor digs through his possessions because Seita is dead and finds a small candy tin with some ash in it. As he throws it away, the spirit of a young girl comes from it and Seita. It is here that our story really begins as we are taken through the life of these two little characters during the final months of World War II. The strange thing about this is that Seita and his sister Setsuko rarely speak at all. It's as though we are watching it from both someone else's eyes and through there own. It's hard to explain except though the stereotypical life flashing through ones eyes when they die. We are placed in the part of the spiritual Seita and Setsuko watching our life go past our eyes.The artwork is old fashioned and not as clean cut as normal Studio Ghibli films but I feel this one doesn't have to be. This show is about the ugly truth of war, not a happy little fantasy world full of small magical creatures (I don't count the fireflies). It's the whole reality of the show that's the big shocker. Colors are mostly diluted tones and only really kick up on the color scale slightly when the two share something happy. It helps us feel the emotions of the characters as they too watch.There is rarely any talking but again, the show doesn't have to be as it has one of the saddest musical scores I have heard for a show. The little bit of dialoged only feels slightly forced because of how close it is to the translation. You would have to wonder how anyone could write this story without crying their eyes out.In the end, it's a really good show and you should really watch it if you want to feel something sad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bitter-sweet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is one word I would use to describe this film: bitter-sweet. It is not only an anti-war showcase but it also an amazingly detailed story of friendship, sacrifice and love.We follow Setsuko, a 4-year-old girl and a teenage boy named Seita. The relationship between the two of them is one of the most powerful I have ever seen on screen. Seita is a selfless brother, who puts his innocent, vulnerable and accurately child-like sister before himself, at all times. By the end of it, I found myself entirely invested and intrigued by these characters.The dialogue plays a bit part in this film. It doesn't rely on outlandish punchlines and doesn't try to be something it isn't, instead "Grave of the Fireflies" focuses on a much more delicate, minimal approach, the phrase 'less is more' springs to mind.Undoubtedly, it is visually stunning. The creators did not cut any corners in creating a cinematic landscape. The colours are particularly striking throughout the 90 minute running time. The vivid backgrounds almost have a smoothness to them, similar to that of watercolour paint. Bold usage of colour also helps to effortlessly blend the films darker, more sinister moments with the soft and profound moments. To end my review, this film is a triumph. It's not just a film, it's a lesson. It doesn't just teach us about the brutality of war and how it demolishes peoples lives, it teaches us about humility. Is it dark? Yes. Is it depressing? Definitely. Is it a must see? Absolutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best animated emotional movie I have ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably this time I have shed my tears most after watching a movie called The Grave of the fireflies. I love cartoons and animations so much and I do watch them too.But an animation movie could be so traumatic and emotional I didn't know before watching this movie.I do expose my teardrops if the movie is sensitive but that is a few...very few...may be my eyes just start getting wet.But this time they crossed their limit and fell continuously even after the movie ended. You will believe or not even now also my eyes are wet because I am re-watching the scenes and re-hearing the background scores.You may feel that "this girl is overreacting!!" But believe me if you watch this you too will feel the same I am. May be a little more or less.For the first time I rated a movie 10 in IMDb. You can feel even more if you have siblings.I did watch it with my elder sister... and yes we both were sobbing with our own and holding each other hand tight.The story is all about a 14 year old brother and his only tiny sister who have recently lost their parents in World War II attacks and the FIREFLIES.The story is about the love, care, responsibilities and duties of a brother who did everything possible to keep her sister safe. They were betrayed by their relatives and the society too which is quite normal during crisis but they had to be alive.They accepted the harsh truth with joy and happiness.They found their ray of hope to live more.They fought,fought and fought but the tragedy took place at the end which was pathetic and sensitive. For some fraction of time I didn't realize that it was an animation. It was so alive and felt like everything was happening right in front of my eyes and I could not help them.please watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most powerful anti-war film you will ever see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie begins showing a hungry, malnourished, poverty stricken boy suffering a slow, painful death. After he passes away, a janitor comes and strips his belongings from his deceased body, and throws them into an overgrown field. The ghost of a cute, young girl appears and takes the hand of a healthy, clean version of the boy who just passed away. The movie cuts, and we see them taking a train to a better land. It is made obvious right in the beginning that both characters die. This leads some people to say "Well what's the point of watching? We know what happens in the end." That's not the point of the movie. The point of the movie is to show the story of these two young children struggling through difficult lives. While there is hope for a happy ending, we hope that the characters have easy, pain free lives. It's the same idea for us. We all know we will eventually die, but we try to make our lives as easy, and pain free as we can.This movie breaks the stereotype of "Oh, this movie is animated, so yeah, while it might be moving, it's going to stay within safe confines." This is usually the case because animation is seen as a childish medium, which is why so many kids' movies are animated. While these kids' movies might have moving scenes and teach valuable lessons, as I said earlier, it's going to stay within safe confines. This movie can easily be mentioned in the same breath as other great war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Full Metal Jacket. It's just a beautiful piece of art that's moving and powerful, but it just happens to be animated.This movie conveys a very powerful anti-war message without completely shoving the idea down your throat. It tells the non sugar coated story of two young children made homeless and struggling to survive after air raids in World War II. Although the characters are fictional, it's based on the true story of the writer of the graphic novel the movie is based off of; Akiyuki Nosaka. It's obvious that director Isao Takahata resents the war, but he provides a strong anti war message without forty minutes of bloody, gory violence. Believe it or not, there are still children who live this way nowadays, we just don't see it on the news.Very few movies can make me genuinely care for a character. In this case, you do care for the characters in the movie. You hope for the best for these two innocent children. In most movies nowadays, you see young characters acting much older than they really are. We all know that movie with the four year old character that's sassy, smart, and mature. But in this movie, that's not the case at all. Setsuko acts like a four year old in real life would act, and her role is executed to near perfection. From her motions to her dialogue, you see can see very clearly the four year old in her. As for Seita, his role is executed greatly as well. He makes the mistakes a fourteen year old boy in that situation probably would, his mindset is that of a fourteen year old, his decisions, which are sometimes good and sometimes bad, are that of a fourteen year old. The beautiful thing about this movie is when Seita makes mistakes; you understand it, because you know that everybody makes mistakes because we're human. The character development in this movie is also top notch. We see Seita go from a normal teenager with a positive outlook on life to a poverty stricken teenager with still a positive outlook on life, but now he realizes how much his sister really means to him. We see Setsuko go from a happy, sweet, innocent four year old girl to a confused, poverty stricken, malnourished child.The next point I would like to touch on is the appearance and the effects for this movie. The animation in this movie is an art, it's stunning. The animation shows the setting in a way that real life movies just can't. From the urban environments to the fields and rivers of the wild, the animation is beautifully done. The next thing is the soundtrack. I don't have much to say about it, but they used music very well. They used music very sparingly and when they did use it, they used it at perfect times.To me, the theme of this movie is friendship, love, and caring for others. Its love story, but not Hollywood style; members of the opposite sex attracted to each other, looking for love in a romantic sense. In this movie, it's more "brotherly" love. The movie makes you aware of how good your life is compared to some people around the world. It made me aware of my sometimes selfish ways, it made me think about all the times in my life where I had the opportunity to help people, but I didn't. It makes me realize how much I take my sister for granted, and how fleeting life can be. One day, you're just fine, and the next day you can be struggling to survive. Most of all, it made me realize that life can slip away from you any moment, and to live every day like it's you're last.In conclusion, Grave of the fireflies is a very beautiful movie that succeeds in ways some American war movies simply don't. It teaches you so many valuable lessons. It's one of the most underrated movies of all time. It's one of the few movies that changed my life, and one of the few movies that had me holding back tears at the end. This is a must see movie that will change your life. 10/10 One of the most moving, beautiful movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heart-wrenching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few times I have cried in my life,and this film did make my eyes tearful. I'd say its one of those films that I wouldn't have the courage to watch another time. This film is the story of two Japanese kids Seita and Setsuko who struggle for their survival in Japan during the world war 2. In the very beginning, Seita and his sister Setsuko escapes their home and go to their distant aunt''s house. In the meanwhile, Seita learns that his mother has succumbed to the injuries she got in an air-raid.Seita hides this truth from Setsuko. Also, their aunt starts bothering them so,they go from there to a cave like shelter and live there. But, they don't have money to buy food. Its all about the hardships they have to go through in order to survive.This film becomes very hard to view particularly in the last 15 minutes. I'd say only heartless people won't feel sad after viewing this film. Only after Requiem for a dream, I have been moved by any film. This is another anti-war film, which shows that irrespective of whoever the victor is war is always bad for the mankind. I recommend every American to watch this film. In the name of war against terrorism they are waging a war against poor and helpless civilians. So. regardless of your age you ought to watch this flick.I watched this film yesterday, but still I can hear Setsuko's voice when she calls Seital. Though, you'll fell upset but that is necessary. I give 10/10 to this film and two thumbs up. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Studio Ghibli's best achievements!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an animation fan, I love all of Studio Ghibli's works (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, etc). Today, I watched another movie that Studio Ghibli also made and this is the film. I was with my brother the same age as me and after we watched it, we were crying our tears out. It's a depressing film at first, but it's so moving and beautiful that I personally agree to those who love it that this is indeed one of the greatest Japanese anime films ever made, if not the greatest.The story is awe-striking because of how the "World War II" setting was presented. It also has some sad moments (especially it's slow moments that gives the characters a lot of depth) that would make you shed a few years and such. The characters on the whole are very interesting and we got to know them better throughout the film. The music is great too as is the voice work, but the best part would have to go to the animation. It's breathtakingly lovely with beautiful backgrounds and solid character animation.Overall, Grave of the Fireflies ranks with some of Studio Ghibli's other films and this would be recommended to those who haven't seen it yet! Besides, I haven't stopped crying yet. *cries*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film that imprints on the heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story of a teenage boy (Seita) who's left to take care of himself and his little sister (Setsuko) in World War II struck Japan, this movie magnificently depicts what a young boy would go through in such cruel times.The beauty of this film lies in the realistic emotions that Seita goes through during his struggle. In such adverse conditions he can still find joy in spending time with Setsuko in the farms, running on the beach and with the glowing fireflies at night. While he initially manages to cope well and even finds a shelter exclusive to just the two of them, the gravity of the situation takes its toll, especially in tending to little Setsuko. Resorting to unsavory measures to feed themselves, one of the most touching moments of the film is when Seita breaks down weeping and embraces Setsuko after being roughed up by a farmer for stealing crops. His unconditional love for his sister forces him to brave every adversity and every tragic news he receives about his parents, shielding Setsuko from every disturbing trouble . Its not a coincidence that he gives up on life after losing the battle to save his sister's.life This movie goes a long way in leaving a deep impression and realising how war times don't spare even the most innocent, pure and bravest of souls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>once upon a time in Japan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hiroshima may have been the most famous bombing of Japan, but the air raids were often just as destructive. One such firebombing is the setting of Isao Takahata's "Hotaru no Haka" ("Grave of the Fireflies" in English). It looks at both the struggle for survival and loss of innocence that accompany war. I've never seen any other anime, but is one movie that should truly be required viewing for everyone. Not only in looking at how the brother and sister try to maintain their hope amid hardship, but two lines in particular stood out. One is where someone mentions that the war is eating up Japan's resources, making it harder and harder to feed the people. Another is when the brother learns that Japan has surrendered. Long taught that the Japanese Empire was invincible, he now has to realize the unpleasant truth. These are important reminders for everyone. The fact remains that the common people will suffer the most in any war, and the movie makes that very clear.Like I said, a movie that everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies and very rare times where movies actually made me cry or broke my heart, this is one of those movies and times. This to me is one of the best and most important anime films for me, it's not the easiest movie to watch but afterward it made me appreciate life more than ever.Loosely based off an autobiography of a World War 2 survivor, this film is not just a film it's an emotional experience that has a hold of you from beginning to end. I really love how the animation of the background of Japan in a time long gone, there's sort of a documentary like feel to it from certain cinematography shot of an inanimate object or building it gives you that sense of geography and place. As well as the conditions the town was in, in a time of war from the bombing and the aftermath of them which I found unnerving. The music score is great it has a somber and even tone to it.But of course it's the two characters Seita and Setsuko that drive this film. The way the film handles them is something I rarely see much these days because they don't feel like animated characters they feel like real human beings. What makes this even more heartbreaking is that sense of familiarity to it, their hometown has that feeling like any other hometown that I've lived in. The character Seita I can't help but see a little of myself in because I actually was like him when I was his age. Setsuko is a character that is just about my niece's age. These were one of the reason why I felt heavy pathos for the two but also love them.This is a story about the struggle to survive in times of darkness but also a story about how life truly is precious and none of us ever have as much time as we think. Seita is the older brother who is forced to adulthood so soon as he is doing his best to keep both himself and his younger sister alive but also trying to maintain their childhoods that are beginning to seem far long gone. Setsuko is of course just being what she is a kid and doing what kids would do. As the movie goes one we see both of them afflicted by the cruelty and delusion/stupidity of the selfishness of people, bad conditions that have limited them to things like a disabled economy, government, communications, jobs, and resources. This unfortunately renders most of Seita's efforts to becoming fruitless.There are moments where it's not dark but in a way joyful from the time at the beach both of them were in or even of course trying to catch fireflies, these moments I found precious and important it made me think about certain things I did when I was a child like playing out in a playground or backyard with other kids and the games we play. As Eric Draven from the film "The Crow" stated "Nothing is trivial".But of course there we're moments that were really sad, once scene in particular, from the time when we see the aunt is about to trade their late mom's kimonos for more rice, we see Setsuko try to stop her but it's no use and she just cries. When I saw that or even heard her cry, it just put me in tears just knowing those kimonos were one of the last things she had of her mother, there's even a brief flashback afterward of Seita, Setsuko, and their mom and dad together in a park getting their photo taken making the emotional weight heavier because I knew that was the last time they were all together.It then comes to the final minutes that were haunting and heartbreaking, it made me just break down and cry for the longest time. What makes it all the more heartbreaking was there was nothing I could do about it.Seita and Setsuko will live on in my heart forever, they look to our present, we look to their past and wonder about the future.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Japanese Anime Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a Japanese animated anti-war tragedy film written and directed by Isao Takahata. This is the first film produced by Shinchosha, who hired Studio Ghibli to do the animation production work. It is a film adaptation of the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Akiyuki Nosaka, intended as a personal apology to the author's own sister who died from malnutrition during the Second World War that features Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi, Yoshiko Shinohara and Akemi Yamaguchi.The film opens on an evening in 1945, after Japan's surrender at the end of World War II; and in a train station, the young Seita dies alone. The rest of the movie tells us, in flashback, how things have come to this. Seita and Setsuko are two young Japanese children growing up in the waning days of World War II. Much to Seita's pride, their father is in the Japanese navy, and they live fairly content lives in Kobe despite rationing and the other privations of war. When their mother dies from burns suffered during an American fire-bombing raid, a distant aunt takes them in and conflict eventually forces the children to try to survive on their own. At first,Seita and his little sister enjoy their idyllic lives in the country, but harsh reality eventually settles in as Seita begins to understand the difficulties of taking care of a young child when both food and compassion are scarce. Isao Takahata's powerful antiwar film has been praised by critics wherever it has been screened around the world. The writer-director who happens to be a frequent collaborator of Miyazaki's at Studio Ghibli, adapted a partly autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, and his handling of the tragic story is masterfully understated.Added to that,it is an achingly sad anti-war film that is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works that it gives the viewer an emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.Overall,it is a wonderful example of the beauty of anime film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad and extremely moving, but very rewarding animated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very moving animated film from Japan, based on an autobiographical novel. Set in Japan in the final months of World War II, it is about a couple of children ? a boy of about 12 and her sister of about 4 and how they try to confront their awful circumstances. Their father, about whom they haven't had news for a while, is supposedly at sea, being an officer in the Japanese navy ? they live with their mother, but she is soon killed after an American air raid. They go to live with an aunt, but she's so nagging towards them that they soon leave and decide to live in a cave for themselves in the terrible final weeks of the war. Haunted by bombings and hunger, they nevertheless try to keep their spirits high, one of their few amusements being seeing the fireflies light up at night. I don't want to tell more, but the ending is far from happy. The movie shows why in wars, innocent civilians are the ones that suffer most. The delicate drawings help a lot.</fullReview>

Please, do not watch this in English (or any other language) it would offend this film!This film is truly something entirely different from what one expects from cinema. Roger Ebert once said that this film is "an emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation", however I might add, it forces a rethinking of cinema, since I cannot think of any other film that approaches this film in terms of raw emotion.Incredibly powerful and emotionally draining, this film makes any other drama look like an Adam Sandler film. Take other war films, such as Schindler's list or Full Metal Jacket, these films are great and moving, but they simply do not operate at the same level of excellence as this one does. Best war movie ever made, by far. Watch it now if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate anime tear jerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the animated movies that I've seen in my life, this has to be the most heartbreaking one. It is depressing and bleak, and yet it is incredibly beautiful, being a memorable experience that has to be seen in order to be believed.Never before in the history of cinema any other movie expressed with such haunting poetry the horrors of war, in fact, what makes this movie so effective and haunting it's the subtlety of it: Unlike other war movies, this movie doesn't portray big scenes of destruction, but instead of that, shows, with an incredible level of realism the consequences that war has in the everyday lives of innocent people (In this case, the two main characters)Some detractors accused this movie of being way too sordid, but personally I think that it was way more subtle than most of the war films that are released every year. Let's take for example another anime film that takes place in the Second World War, "Barefoot Gen", which shows with an incredible harshness the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima (Though it is a pretty good movie too) "Grave of the Fireflies" doesn't need the use of very explicit material to express all the absurdity, brutality and horror of war, and how it affects everyone, even the people that weren't supposed to be involved.The animation and the music are magnificent, like in all the productions done by the Studio Ghibli, but what makes this movie an exceptional masterpiece is the powerful story that it has, being one of the most stunning tales of survival ever made.Despite the incredible bleakness of the plot, I still consider this movie a must-see for everyone, not only to the anime fans. This is the kind of movie that shows that animation isn't something exclusively for the kids, being able to have the same (or even more) emotional impact than many other live-action films.10/10 (And I would give this eleven stars if I could)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So sad, yet so visually stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies came as a real shocker in the times, when Japanese animation studios produced tons of rather 'interesting' material, such as erotic and brutal anime, cartoons about robots and the supernatural, or simple heart-warming tales for children.Isao Takahata was able to create a truly tragic tale about how two young siblings struggle to survive during the War, but present it in such a way, that may be very easily called beautiful, in its own subtle sense. I mean, the visual side of this animated picture is so stunning that even time doesn't concern it. It looks as fresh in 2012 as it did when it first came out in 1988.Even though the depicted story happens on the eve of World War II, it doesn't actually present the disastrous effects that it had on the Japanese community as such. It's rather a tale of lost youth, and how the overwhelming cruelty and hatred can affect children and change their peaceful lives into a living hell. Those harmful and pure little creatures are afflicted by the selfish conflicts of grown-ups in the most striking way, and that shall be the power of the message that the movie provides.The film starts with a scene that actually indicates how this gruesomely sad story will end. Setsuko is dying on a railway station and nobody cares to help him. After a while he is reunited with his little sister as a ghost. He is now the narrator and we see the whole picture through the eyes of his vivid memories. From now on every sequence accompanied by a flaming red aura is the one, where out of this world experiences melt with reality.From the moment their mother died after an air raid, Setsuko and Seita are left totally alone in this vicious battle for survival. With nowhere else to go they decide to stay in their aunt's house. However, as we quickly find out, she isn't very happy about that and she does almost everything to discourage the kids and thus delicately persuade them to work and earn money for their own food, or simply leave her house.After discovering an abandoned shelter nearby they realize that the only wise choice is to move there and strive to endure on their own terms. Unfortunately, as they soon find out, it isn't easy in these hard war times. They can't work, their money supply is about to end, they don't have anything to exchange, and they're soon accused of stealing crops. What's more, Seita is getting weaker every day, because of malnutrition. The situation seems really terrible. How can two innocent kids be able to get along without any support?The sudden transition that Setsuko and Seita undergo is presented in a very realistic manner. It's very rare to see such a truthful representation of a child's suffering and agony in a movie, much less in an animated production. Their emotions are very real. The way they gradually learn to understand their situation is convincing, and most saddening.I previously mentioned that the movie could certainly be called a thing of beauty, due to its perfect visual presentation. Here's why: it's somehow idyllic, because even though there are signs of war everywhere around (the sirens, air raids, burnt houses and corpses), most of the time we see the two main characters staying in a dream-like hideout place, surrounded by untouched nature and jolly fireflies. In those (very brief) moments when they tend to forget about their problems, it is as if the viewer suddenly changed the movie for a more joyful one. But then the mood changes 180 degrees and we are back in the horrible times of war.Most people like to call the movie a tearjerker, and this statement can't be undermined. But there can also be a different approach to The Grave of the Fireflies. As much as heartbreaking and mournful it is, Isao Takahata shows that even an anime movie can be as graphic as a feature film. It's not easy to watch the story, but it's enormously pleasant to watch the movie. Those are two different things. And this achievement should put a smile on the face of any movie fanatic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, amazing, stunning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during WWII in Japan, 14-year-old Seika is the only one to take care of his 5-year-old sister, Setsuko, after their mother is killed in an aerial firebombing of their village, that also destroys their home. Their father is off fighting, and they have to go to live with their aunt, who scolds them at an increasing rate and level. After a while, they move out, into a shelter. This follows their struggle to survive, on dwindling food supplies and sudden plane raids. In the way of a classic tragedy, this hints at its inevitable conclusion from the very beginning. This doesn't make it "predictable", as the point is not to surprise; it renders it even more powerful, as we find ourselves losing the battle in trying to deceive ourselves of where it is headed. I have not read the novel and can draw no comparisons. Like the other Studio Ghibli pictures, this feels very true to life and natural. The astonishing attention to detail, the immense realism, the tiny little human aspects, these have you forgetting that you're not watching live-action(the mood is spot-on, and you're transported directly into the situation). And the animation is impeccable. This is deeply moving and engaging(and it is more focused on this than the plot). If it does not tug at your heartstrings, you are officially a robot. At the same time, it isn't manipulative, and your sympathy and empathy are awoken in an honest manner. The sound design is excellent(and it uses the absence thereof, silence, to fantastic effect), backing up the visuals in recreating something very close to the real world. While there is stylization, and not everything in this is what it appears, it doesn't betray this objective of credibility. This builds and maintains atmosphere extremely well. Whether it's the siblings having trouble getting by, them playing together, an explosive assault from above, it comes across as genuine. The pacing is perfect. At about 90 minutes, this is not in a rush, and it lets you absorb the individual parts of what's going on. The acting is phenomenal. I base this on the original version, not a dubbed one. There is a bit of highly disturbing, bloody, violent, gory and brutal content in this. The DVD comes with a feature-length track of alternate angle storyboards(and another 10 and a half minutes of extra ones), two interesting interviews(one with the writer/director that comes in at 17 and a half minutes, the other with film critic Roger Ebert, that has a running time of 12 minutes), an informational 12 and a half minute documentary ("Historical Perspective"), a 6 and a half minute Japanese release promo, a 4 and a half minute DVNR featurette, a 3 minute art gallery, one US trailer and one Japanese(both 2 minutes). I recommend this to fans of Anime and drama. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Elegaic and riveting" -- NYTimes review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is based on a popular Japanese semi-autobiographical novel of the same name which the author, Nosaka, wrote to atone for the death of his little sister in circumstances similar to that in the film. It shows the struggles to survive of an orphaned 12 year old boy, Setsuko, and his 4 year old sister, Seita, in the weeks just before and after WW-II when food was scarce.It's directed by Takahata of Studio Ghibli (after he'd previously collaborated on many films with his more famous colleague, Miyazaki); it's deserving of all the honors it's won--and more, and certainly of much wider viewing and recognition.It's currently ranked 123 of IMDb's all-time best 250 movies as well as on Roger Ebert's list of "Great Films" and he extols it enthusiastically.One critic said it's "....about the capacity of the human spirit to love. Watching it feels like a privilege." It has sad moments, true, but IMO more than that, it portrays realistic tenderness and caring between the two children and we become very close to them. As another critic has observed, this animé film is far more emotionally realistic than if filmed with actors. The film's emotional tone and message glowed within me for hours after.This is NOT a film for most young children; it carries a Parental Guide Advisory.It's a truly great film, a real treat to have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart Wrenching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This had to be the most powerful movie I have ever seen. A young boy Seita who looks after his younger sister Setsuko during World War two. Set in the time where Japan allies with Germany to bring themselves fortune and fame through war. Yet in a small little village Seita and his family are raided by US and English bombers which sets back his town to the stone age. With both their mother gone from extremely serious injuries, Seita and Setsuko stays with a family friend who seems hell bent on making both of their lives as miserable as possible by making Seita feel guilty for not being more of a man and to aid their family. Seeing as they might becoming a burden, Seita and Setsuko then leave to live on their own, only to realize that finding food and medicine is even tougher than the war itself. This was one of the most tragic and beautiful stories I have watched in a long time. The music was top notch as was the characters who gave a really fine performance whether nasty or not. Setsuko was the real deal, seeing her dwindle to become a malnourished and diseased ridden little girl was more than I could bear, but I could not stop watching through tears. The idea of how war tear people apart is as true today as it was in history. Nobody should have to go through with what Seita and Setsuko went through. Determination was the mainstay for Seita, his ability to give his sister food by bartering or even stealing, is enough to show how far people go to save their own family. And to see others just dismiss or even shuck away the youths in the face of dying is enough to reach out and grab their throats. It's amazing how far people will go with excuses to protect their own interests. And with Seita and Setsuko in such dire straits, I was surprised the old farmer did not relent to sell some food to them. This movie held every aspect of the human mind under extreme circumstances. Wars kill all people, whether bombs drop or not. The children are the most important, and in this film it shows that even children succumb to the drastic red tape which the adults roll out without so much as a conscience. Great film, highly recommended to those who love war stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grave of the Fireflies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away are really good Japanese cartoon films, from Studio Ghibli, to feature in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and I was really glad I spotted this one when I did. Basically fourteen year old Seita (Tsutomu Tatsumi) is dead, but the narration continues to tell the story of what made him end up in that way. He and four year old Setsuko (Ayano Shiraishi) are brother and sister living in Japan during World War II, and they witness a mass bombing in their home town. Coming out of the wreckage of the air raid, they find a temporary home with their Aunt (Akemi Yamaguchi), and Seita is devastated when he sees the body of their Mother (Yoshiko Shinohara) and obviously near death. Seita is the only one who knows that their mother has died, and he writes to their father over seas to try and get out of the danger zone, so they stay with the Aunt in the meantime. It is obvious that Seita and Setsuko are getting on the Aunt's nerves, so they leave and make their way to an abandoned shelter to live in. All they need to stay alive is the roof over the heads, to care for each other, and find any food they can, but they still have fun as well. It becomes apparent that Setsuko is sick with hideous rashes developing on her body, and the doctor concludes that it is because of the lack of food. With the low supply of food, they can only entertain themselves while looking gazing at the beautiful light of the fireflies. Eventually Seita finds that his fears about his father being killed over seas are right, and the sick Setsuko confesses that she already knew that their mother was dead also. Seita decides that because she is so sick, Setsuko needs a serious amount of food, so he takes out the money from the bank to get a good supply, and she does take one bite of watermelon, but it is not enough and she dies. The story is nice and simple, it may not be dubbed into English but it doesn't matter, the use of colours was well assorted, and it is quite harrowing viewing which makes it essential. But what I enjoyed most about this film was the beautiful music by Michio Mamiya, not many cartoon films compel you with just some images and the use of excellent music score, but this one definitely does, a most worthwhile animated Second World War drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grave of the Fireflies, 1988</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sad, deeply emotional and depressing is what best describes this beautifully crafted movie. The honesty in this film is deeply emotional and the director's use of scenes are excellent.Trust me, it is heart wrenching to start of with a simple statement 'On September.... I died.' Right from the start we know that the children Seita and Setsuko will die. The director plays a cruel trick on the audience, though we may see the characters living, having fun, with every second, every minute the audience knows the end is drawing.I love the use of colour in this film. A dull red is used to portray the dead. Red and black... of course the fireflies are white - purity, calm... peace. It saddens me that some reviewers or comment-writers make such threads as 'Oops, shouldn't have bombed Pearl Harbour.' The main point of this film is not to blame, in all of the film it does not accuse any nation, it is simply to tell the story of the people who have become caught up in the war.Though some people may argue that Seita was lazy and didn't get a job, think about this. Everyone is short on food - the farmers already have workers and even then need every plant to harvest their food, jobs have been taken by older men and Seita has just seen his diseased Mum. He is also caring for his sister, Setsuko, and feels that he needs to protect her as well. Imagine how depressing it would be, bombs raining down, food low and being hungry.The film is formed in a series of flashbacks, that together form a deeply depressing picture.The film paints a depressing yet emotional view on the innocent people caught in the cross-fire of battling countries. It certainly deserves a strong 9. ****1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Sad Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very sad story. Two orphans, teenager Seita (J. Robert Spencer) and his toddler sister, Satsuke (Rhoda Chrosite) must survive on their own at the end of WWII. It doesn't get much sadder than this.Japan, 1945. The war is nearly over, and Japan is being pummeled by constant air raids by the Americans. After the death of their mother, Seita and Satsuke must find a way to survive (their father is away in the Navy).The film is strongly reminiscent of Cinderella and "Life Is Beautiful." The former because the two siblings go to live with a distant aunt at first, but leave because she is cruel. The latter is because of the relationship between Seita and Satsuke. Seita tries to keep his younger sister from experiencing the trauma of their situation. Therefore he tries to make everything fun and exciting for her.One of the notable qualities about the best anime is that the dubbed voices are always good. Miyazaki's films have it, but unfortunately, this one doesn't. The only voice that works is J. Robert Spencer. This is a guy we can all love; if everyone had an older brother like this, we'd all be very happy. He's very nice and pleasant towards Satsuke, to the point where it almost becomes unfair. Rhoda Chrosite is not successful though. It sounds as if a 30 had imitated a four year old, and instead of tearing at our heart, it becomes annoying. Amy Jones has stilted delivery as the aunt, but she's okay.Although this is a very sad movie, it lacks the real emotional punch that many of the best tragedies have. This is not a tearjerker, however, and calling it that would do the film a great disservice. It's a good film that should be seen, but it is not always easy going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen a more beautiful animation than 'Grave of the Fireflies'. Not only is the imagery gorgeous, but the scenes are composed and arranged with the same care as seen in the best of art-house movies; and the horror of the fire-bombing of Japanese cities (seen by some as sufficiently terrible to make the nuclear option a morally superior alternative) is fully conveyed. In fact, this is such a serious movie (in all senses of that word) that it begs the question: why was it made as an animation at all, and not as a conventional film? Perhaps the answer is that in the flesh, it might have been so sad as to be unwatchable; at the end of the day, this is simply a story about two people who starve to death. Indeed, the film even begins with a (strictly unnecessary) flash-forward, as if the director did not want to betray any hopes we might otherwise have mustered of a happy ending. Raymond Briggs's 'When the Wind Blows' obviously comes to mind, but this film is broader in scope: it's as much about social breakdown as the war itself. The fireflies, a metaphor for lost souls, linger on in the mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Grave of the Fireflies' is an absolutely wonderful animation that is a must to see. It leaves a tremendous emotional impact and a lot to think about.The war-ridden world is beautifully depicted through the eyes of children. Their innocence and naivety collides with the cruelty of reality showing how insignificant a human life is during war.It is true that this story is very upsetting and might bring you to tears many times but that shouldn't discourage you from watching it. In fact, that's why it's so good. I can't think of another movie that left such an impact on me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great depressing story. A must see for those who can handle sad movies. It was a heart-wrenching experience for me. Long after i finished watching this 1hr 30min movie i still couldn't get off my mind the hardships faced by the people affected by the war. Especially children were the most affected. This film is very honest. The background score matched well with the emotional tones of the film. I watched the Eng-dubbed version and maybe that brought down the depressing tone a little but it was haunting enough. This is one of those very few films that reduced me to watery eyes. Once you see it you may never watch it again{I think I'll never see this again}...Easily one of the best Anime films and maybe one of the best movies that shows the true cost of the war. This is one of the GEMS out there, Don't miss out.WARNING: Be prepared for an emotional ride. 9.2/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be my favorite of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but I just had to write this. I was just playing a little game by going through each genre on IMDb and picking my favorite movie from each genre. For animated movies there was no doubt for me: grave of the fireflies was number one. When I came to drama's I just thought about the movie that had touched me the most. Again I ended up picking GOTFF. Finally arriving at war movies, I also picked this movie.The greatness of this movie is all in making the spectator realise what war does to people and for a moment you don't think of war casualties as just casualties, but you start to imagine what people have gone through before dying and how the acquaintances have to deal with the loss of a loved one. Takahata creates this pity very well. He gradually makes you fall in love with the main characters (especially Setsuko). It also shows that a war affects both parties. Even though Japan was one of the 'bad guys' in WWII, this movie helps you emphasize also with the people living over there. To make a short story even shorter; this is definitely one of my personal all time favorites. It shows you (even though it's animated) more than any other movie does what the effect of war is on normal civilians like you and me. I know it might sound cruel but I'm a bit tired of all the soldier war movies. It even has gone to a point that I can't be bothered by war anymore if it's shown in the form of a military movie. This movie, however, has put me right back on the ground and made it all real again. Definitely a must see!P.S. Too make it even sadder for you than it already is: the story is based on WWII experiences of the writer himself. He was Seita...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anime unlike any other anime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a possibility of minor spoilers in the following review, but I didn't tick the box, because I'm not sure if they pose a problem or spoil the movie for you.I have yet to find another anime that is similar to this title. And for the record, that's meant positive. I'm a fan of anime, and I don't care what some might think of that, but this is a movie I recommend to anyone. So to those that hold prejudgments to anime, be it because you really don't like it or because you just don't know better, watch this movie.From start to finish, Hotaru no Haka intrigues everyone that watches it. The opening scene has been criticized a lot, but to me it was done brilliantly. Based on a novel, Isao Takahata had a urgent need for a proper narrator in his film. And when you think about that, you even marvel at the first scenes more, for he has found the perfect way to present the story he is going to tell. Though it is true some scenes were perhaps to long and to sentimental, they didn't bother me. If you were drawn inside the story from the beginning (that is meant to happen), you would barely notice and those scenes would give you some time to reflect about what you just saw.Having seen this with subtitles, I cant say anything about the English voice-actors, but the Japanese have put together a splendid cast in this one. Many inexperienced seiyu have given their all, most notably the youngest (Setsuko) who was but five at the time. But the most important thing in this movie is the story, and the meaning behind it. How difficult is it for humans (let alone teenagers) to swallow their pride? Thats watch it's about. You can easily sympathize with Seita (age +/-13) and you could feel at that very moment you could've done the same. But when you think of it later on; Was it the right choice? Was it OK for him to step outside the system?It is clear where I'm taking this I guess. If you are an anime-fan you should've already watched this. If you aren't watch this and keep possible prejudgment about anime aside, for they do not apply. That said, Grave of the Fireflies manages to present a realistic war-torn Japan in which two children try to survive outside the system. Just the fact that there isn't a single trace of humor (don't confuse it with pity and other emotions) and virtually no violence alone, make this movie worth a view.</fullReview>

What they have produced is a masterpiece of anti-war story-telling Shakespearean in its simplicity. For GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES speaks loudly for the innocence always exploited in all conflicts in all places and in all times. No Disneyesque surrealism or anthropomorphising here, just two human-beings at their most vulnerable shown as it has played out countless millions of times from our start and as it will continue to play out until our eventual end.

		<fullReview>I went into this film with the knowledge that it was sad, and all the way through I could see how things were being set up for a sad ending. But it still got to me, which is a credit to the film. The depiction of the dead mother is unsettling, and the story of the brother and sister is heartbreaking. The scene that really got me was when Setsuko died, and the images of her life are shown. Particularly the part where it shows her playing by herself when her brother was out finding food. The movie is so effective is saddens me just writing this. I admit that this movie brought me to tears. The music and the images compliment each other beautifully. Unfortunately, the whole storyline seemed a bit rushed and unfinished, without much justification given for certain actions. For example, the story of the aunt isn't really told. The movie was still great, but could have been enhanced with a more detailed storyline.</fullReview>

I expected a certain amount of sentiment throughout the movie but I certainly did not think the realities of war from the point of view of two orphans would be this harshly portrayed. The film was quite hard to digest for the simple fact that the older brother, Seita, can be easily sympathized with but at the same time, we realize that the situation he is in is his own doing. His pride came in the way and watching him struggle with his sister is just too heart-breaking. I really didn't expect an anime to produce *the* most depressing ending ever and I was totally not prepared to witness it but i am still glad I saw the movie. It was simply terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me just state before anything else: 10/10. And not just a begrudging, 'I can't find anything wrong with it soo...' kind of ten, but a very solid and well earned and freely given 10/10. OK, now that we've gotten that out of the way. Wow! This movie reminds me of the phenomenon James Joyce describes in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as 'aesthetic arrest'. Basically, he divides all media into high art and pornography. He states that anything purporting itself as art that resorts to playing on the emotional responses of the consumer is actually just pornography. So if you find yourself overly moved on an emotional level, you have actually experienced low, pornographic art. If, however, the film (or other work) causes 'aesthetic arrest'; a feeling that transcends emotion and makes the consumer nail him or herself to the spot and experience the work over and over; makes one question his or her own responses and definitions of truth, beauty and the like; the consumer is in aesthetic arrest and the work represents high art. In short, low art affects the glands whilst high art affects the soul. 'Grave of the Fireflies' certainly seems to fit well in that latter category. I found this movie so amazing because it always had me on the verge of tears but never made cry. At 88 minutes, every image and every sound carries significance with nothing in just for the sake of bathos and sentimentality. Rarely does one find a cartoon where inanimate objects hold such deep symbolic meanings on their own, with no attempts made to underscore or personify them with wacky celebrity voices. Making this film as anime was the obvious way to go. If it had featured live-action, I think the sadness of the story would have overpowered the beauty of the message. I don't think I would have been able to watch real actors go through the events experienced by the animated characters. These animated performances somehow seem to transcend acting. They seem more indelible, more real to me. I am tempted to buy this movie, but then, I don't see why I should since one viewing seems to have grafted these images onto my very soul. Indescribably haunting, human and surreal. Best cartoon I've ever seen and up there with Citizen Kane, Naked and the other Great Ones</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Out of all of the Studio Ghibli films this World War II animation is my favourite. Set in Japan during the Second World War the story follows Seita and his little sister Setsuko as they survive in a harsh war torn nation in which food and luxuries are short due to wartime efforts.As the narrative progresses the emotional strain of the war is apparent in the way the plot flows. The emotional bond between the brother and sister and the sheer effort of survival.As the film reached it's climax I began to shed tears. Some films move you but Grave of the fireflies simply shatters your hope and well being. As you sympathise with the characters their deteriating condition simply tears away at you emotional strings.The animation is a gritty realism, rather different from the standard principles of animation in which exaggeration is almost necessary to translate emotion to the viewer. But Grave of the fireflies is done so well that even with realistic animation the emotion of the scene translates to the audience.For those of you who haven't seen this film I truly envy you. Because you get the opportunity to watch one of the greatest films of all time for the first time, an experience I wish I could relive.</fullReview>

The way everything is done is so well-thought out. If it were done with even a single thing out of place, it could seem sadistic, or just plain pessimistic, but as it is, it feels like a story that needed to be told. I had read the internet synopsis beforehand, and was a bit skeptical, as I don't particularly like war films, but when I watched it, I was attached to the characters from almost the first line, and I cried on and off for almost the whole film the first time I watched it.I would recommend this to almost everyone, although I would suggest you make ready a box of tissues as well.

		<fullReview>...a little girl asked.And I wish that I had an answer.The title (Grave of the Fireflies) probably sounds more fitted to a horror movie. Perhaps it is, but a different kind of horror- it depicts the horrors of World War II.It follows the story of Seta and Setsuko, two Japanese army children whose father is at war, and whose mother dies of burn injuries following an air raid on their city. They then go to live with their aunt on their father's side, who treats them as second-class members of her household because unlike her daughter and husband, they do not work.As a result of their aunt's demeaning attitude, a naive Seta decides to leave with his very young sister Setsuko and find some other place to live.The movie is unlike any movie of its type that I have ever seen- more or less because of the attitude of Seta. He always possessed a bright and happy disposition in the midst of hardship and tried to allow his sister to live as normal a childhood as possible. The movie focuses on the innocent, joyful moments that the two had together, including playing and bathing together and their oft hobby of going out to catch fireflies during the summer nights. We never feel unaware that a war is going on or the struggles the two are facing, but at the same time the special relationship between Seta and Setsuko is more highly emphasized than many of the tragedies going on around them.The animation of the movie is smooth and life-like. Of course, the coloring and shading of modern anime works exceeds that of this movie, but I can still watch this and be nearly as impressed with it as with either of those.The fact that it is animated detracts nothing from the feel and flow of the movie. In fact, in many ways it adds to it- at least for me. Those cute moments are made even cuter than they could've been without this; the flashbacks to memories are made even more hauntingly sad.Either way, this is a movie that cut me like few that I have ever seen in my life. Some movies have made me sad, but only three have brought me to tears. After the movie, I was eating a Popsicle- of all things- and suddenly everything hit me all at once and I bursts into tears.It was less of an emotional roller-coaster the second time around, but not less of a movie. It's definitely a must-see in both the tragedy and anime genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Much Different Aspect to the War Genre of Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few films capture the aspect of war that doesn't deal heavily on combat. Grave of the Fireflies is one of those rare films. It is a powerful tale which will make you weep and fall into a reminiscing state, that it's unbelievable.Grave of the Fireflies tells the story of two young orphans, Seita and his little sister, Setseko. Two children living at the edge of the world, bounded together by the shivering effects brought by the war and the dreadful bombings. This movie does not tell the story of war, but how two children manage to cope with it. Viewers will find Grave of the Fireflies hard to swallow, because this is unlike any film they will feast their eyes on for years to come. Let us venture into these two kids. Seita is the older brother, no more than 14 years of age, who pretty much cares for his little sister, while trying to manage their current lifestyle. Setseku is a four-year old girl, who isn't dexterous enough to understand the war, and the death it has brought. Their relationship varies throughout the film, and this is what makes Grave of the Fireflies rewarding. This movie has the most realistic characters I've ever seen in a film. I've heard that a five year old Japanese girl was hired to take Setseku's role, and it shows significantly. I followed these characters throughout the film, falling in love with them, Setseku in particular. She laughs, cries and throws a furious tangent. On the other hand, Seita is a young mature man, who is somewhat ignorant and proud to an ugly extent. Their love is so significant, it almost makes me jealous of my relationship with my little sister. The movie sucks you into the characters, so they're embedded in your mind,which makes Graves one of the saddest films ever made.You'll find out later.Grave of the Fireflies is definitely labeled as a anti-war film. The movie portrays war as a very ugly event. People need to realize that soldiers are not the only ones stuck in a plight, people like us are affected deeply, especially when we have no involvement. These two children could never live an insouciant live, they are always under distress. The movie easily shows relevance to the novel, Farewell to Manzanar. What happens to people who don't fight in the war, but are stuck in between? Japanese citizens suffered greatly from our attacks. Innocient people. We have heroes in the U.S celebrating myriad times on their flag plantation on Iwa Jima(who actually turn out not to be the real heroes), we don't realize there is a back door to the situation.I don't need a spoiler to tell you people die. Grave of the Fireflies is clearly labeled as a tragic film. I learned in school that when tragedy comes, someone always dies. The question is who, and you'll find out when you watch the film. I will note future viewers to watch in Japanese. English dub is fairly poor, knowing Central Park Media is behind the dub. I highly recommend Japanese so the viewers can get a real taste of the characters and mood of the film. The actors are natural, and it's best to keep it that way. All in all, Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most powerful, if not most powerful war movie ever made. It's definitely worth a purchase, because if you are like me, you'll watch it for years on end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having lived through the 2nd world war in London and subsequently moved around the World, often as Master of some small vessel or the other, I'm not easily moved to emotion. However, this beautiful animation, somehow it had to be an animation, conveys the brutal reality of how we allow ourselves to be controlled by monstrous people. It lets you follow, almost as an unseen intruder into their plight and their brave suffering and spiralling decline. The pathos and poignancy being heightened by the knowledge that it not only happened to hundreds of children in Japan at the time but is still going on, all around the World today. So will it as long as there are dictators, politicians, rulers and military.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The frame for frame best anti-war-movie I've seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ghibli-studios truly deserve the reputation they have. "Spirited Away" won the Oscar, "Princess Mononoke" was the most successful Japanese picture (and possibly still is, I'm not sure) and the movie I comment here really is the best anti-war-movie I've seen. And I've seen not too few of them. The helplessly overrated "Saving Private Ryan", the excellent "The big red One" and of course "Apocalypse Now Redux", "Platoon" and "Full Metal Jacket". But why is "Hotaru no haka" or "The last fireflies", who it's called here, the best in my view? I find it portraits a totally different attribute of war than for example "the Deerhunter" or "Full Metal Jacket", where the loss is humanity and the souls of the soldiers. This movie here shows with it's cartoon way of telling the horror war always brings to the civilians. It sure shows only the very top of the iceberg but in this context, I find this is an appropriate action. I personally got truly cured from every thought about joining any army and going to any war by this movie. The biggest quality of this excellent anime lays in it's rough and authentic tragedy. It's not even the death of the little girl, but the lack of sense in it, that manufactures most of the horror. I admit, I shed a few tears. And so did anyone I gave the DVD to watch. And this is something no other movie about war ever managed to do: Making me cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartrending and poignant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I think I have seen the best of what Studio Ghibili has to offer, I find another gem that matches or exceeds all that I've seen before. This film about two war orphans in Japan at the end of WWII succeeds at many levels, not the least of which is the ability to make us care deeply about the two lovely main characters. It's a touching story, showing the reality of life in a war torn country. People are essentially kind, but when they must struggle just to find food to put on the table, it is difficult to think about the needs of others. Cracks in the system appear and some fall through. Like the fireflies of the title, a human life may shine brightly but all too briefly. It is a testament to the people of Japan that although they suffered much from the American bombing raids that took place regularly during the last days of the war, little resentment or bitterness lingers. But we shouldn't forget the suffering, and this beeautiful, heartrending film is a poignant reminder of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is Isao Takahata's very first movie for Studio Ghibli.It was shown along with My Neighbor Totoro back in 1988.What unique about this anime movie is it's more like seeing a live action film than an animated film.It shows how much the Japanese suffered during the WW2 period.Those who think anime is just for kids will be proved wrong with this one. It's just as good as an Accademy Award movie.This movie is tempting in a way. Reason why is that it has allot of deaths, sad moments, and bombings in Kobe.Please know this is not something for little kids to see. I recommend 13 and older. Idon't see a little kid watching this movie. It has allot of people that die from the bombings and a few moments of blood.I recommend this movie to those who like powerful/serious animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real tale about war told in Buddhist form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Through violence, you may 'solve' one problem, but you sow the seeds for another.Apparently some believe in the unrealistic idea of a hero forever caught in a battle with the bad guy. Well for those who follow those heroes, Grave of the Fireflies isn't about praising war, conveying pride for one country or blaming others. This is about how our brothers and sisters on the other side of the world in the past and in the present live during war. There is no "hero" and our enemies aren't "cold hearted barbarians" everyone is a human being. No one is greater or more powerful than anyone else. And for those who haven't notice the movie represents Buddhism and just about every other religion around the world. The theme is universal, there is no end to human suffering and that is true even today as it was then.I'm not an expert on Buddhism but while reading upon it I noticed how true the Noble Eightfold Path explained the scenes in Grave of the Fireflies. There are three categories. The first is wisdom. Seita's wisdom or right understanding was to become less dependent on his aunt for he and his small sister Setsuko's survival. By living in the bomb shelter Seita believed they could survive on their own. The second category virtue was difficult for Seita to follow. Virtue in Buddhism means to stay clear from any form of stealing or lying. But when a Man or child is desperate the virtue of keeping your promise to not disobey is avoided. Seita steals peppers from an impoverished farmer's yard to feed his little sister. And he can not be blamed for becoming a thief no one else would help him. Finally the third category-concentration Seita is able to put away his greedy ways of stealing to take care of his young sister. Well it's not easy to explain the aspect of Buddhism but you might want to check it out before seeing Grave of the Fireflies also recommend learning Japanese Culture as well...Info for Noble Eighfold Path provided by wikipedia.org: Buddhism/Noble Eighfold Path</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animated reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To reiterate what another reviewer said, the film is haunting. From the opening frame to the last (especially the last), that is indeed the best way to describe this excellent film. I have no idea how to explain how an animated film about orphaned, starving children in war-time Japan can be watchable, but this one is. Probably the fact that it's animated has something to do with it (and consideration of that possibility brings to mind comparisons to Art Spiegelman's comic book Maus, which employs cartoon animals to depict people in a biographical account - Spiegelman's father's - of Nazi death camps). In any event, a live action film would not be possible (or very difficult) for, I think, somewhat obvious reasons (the most obvious being the fact that it would be very difficult to effect the appearance of malnourished children). However, the fact that it's animated does not make the story any less sobering (just as the cartoon animals in Maus didn't soften the brutal reality of the situation).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm still in mourning (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't prepared for how sad this movie was. It's the most powerful anti-war film ever (animated or not)!The children, Seita and his little sister Setsuko, could be of any nationality and the same for the warring factions. The 'collateral damage' caused by war is the same whether it happened 60 years ago or today.I mourn for Seita and Setsuko as if they were members of my own family.Seita is a typical arrogant, prideful, know-it-all teenager. He is only 14 and was living a sheltered well-off lifestyle until his world was turned upside down. He is not a street kid. He doesn't realize the harsh circumstances of surviving in a war.When their Mother dies from her wounds Seita has to take care of little 4 year-old Setsuko until his Dad returns from fighting the war. He must keep Setsuko's spirits up (that's his job as he sees it). So they go to live with the only close by relative they have. He doesn't tell Setsuko about Mom's death ("we will visit Mom in the hospital when she's better"). Setsuko would lose it if she knew the truth. He can't mourn for his mother now.The relative (a distant Aunt) is not happy about having to share their rations with the children. And when she finds out that their Mother is dead she lets the children know how much of a burden they are and tells Seita to take care of their rations himself. Seita uses some of his family's savings in the bank and sets up separate food preparations for him and Setsuko.Seita would have left if it wasn't for Setsuko. He waits for news from his Dad. Dad will tell him what to do. Maybe Dad will tell him how to find Mom's relatives in Tokyo. He loves his little sister very much and tries to keep her entertained. Setsuko misses her mother and is very frightened by all the bombing raids.While taking shelter during one of the raids Setsuko says she doesn't want to go back to Auntie's place (she sees how unfeeling her relative is) and Seita is very happy to oblige ("Let's live here in the shelter. We can live the way we want.")But Seita is out of his depth trying to find food for the both of them when food gets harder to come by and people are less willing to sell or barter the little they have.What is most heart wrenching is seeing what the war is doing to Setsuko. She is the cutest and bravest little girl. She knows her big brother (Nii-chan) is doing his best for them. Once they are on their own, away from the Aunt, she lets Seita know that Auntie told her Mom is "in a grave". This is the first time Seita can let go and cries for his Mother. How long had she known? She didn't want her grief to burden her brother. As food gets more and more scarce Setsuko gets scared and tells Seita about her stomach always aching and the frequent diarrhea. How long had she been enduring malnutrition symptoms? Again, she didn't want Seita to worry.Seita is scared and desperate. He decides to go to the post office and the bank one last time (where the hell is Dad? Why haven't they heard from him?). But Setsuko is scared she might die before he returns ("Don't leave me. It's OK.") Seita tells her it will be the last time. He won't leave her again after this.While at the bank he finds out the war is over and the ship his Father was serving on was sunk. He and Setsuko are now all alone ("DAD DIED TOO! DAD DIED TOO!"). He manages to buy some food and races to Setsuko. But Setsuko is really bad off. She managed to hang on just long enough to tell her brother goodbye ("Nii-chan, Thank you").Seita is all alone now. His grief and guilt (not being a better provider for his beloved sister) takes over. He quits.This is the saddest and the most profound film I have seen. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>casualties of war. apocalypse now. platoon. born on the fourth of july. these, among other countless films, pale in comparison to the breadth and emotional power of the grave of the fireflies. and what's even amazing is that it's in animation. i have never seen a film whose camera chooses to show the atrocities of war and the children that are affected by them. what's unique about the film is in its painstaking efforts in letting us see the details of childhood and innocence lost, the quiet moments between siblings, the horrible effects of war. nothing is wasted in this film. a shot of an abandoned pail of water near a well evokes a deep symbolic meaning. we were fortunate enough to have seen this movie during a film festival held in our university. everyone came out in tears. this is not to say that the movie is wretchedly sad, as it also evokes a firmer resolve that something like this should not be permitted to happen. GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES is the best war (or anti-war, whatever that means) movie ever made. and i'm glad mr. ebert included this gem in his golden movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Step right up and join the ranks of the most depressing movies ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine asked me what I wanted for my birthday recently and I asked for a DVD copy of this movie. I had heard a lot about it and was curious to see it. I got around to watching it last night and went to sleep feeling absolutely miserable. This one ranks right up there with those other cartoons that I consider to be sadistic, i.e Charlotte's Web, Watership Down, The Velveteen Rabbit, the one with that Tin Soldier and his girlfriend getting shot to pieces, etc. I'm glad that I saw this movie now at 29 than if I had years ago because it might have caused me emotional damage. To put it bluntly, I strongly recommend that you don't watch this movie if you are anywhere near a good mood because your good mood will be a thing of history after watching this.The story revolves around a young boy and his younger sister, struggling to survive during WWII. They face the threat of air raids constantly. Food is scarce due to strict rationing. The children are hardly given a second look by the other people, including other family members, trying to piece their lives back together. The two children are a joy to watch together. The relationship is sweet and loving, with hardly any bickering between the two. It is perhaps this aspect of the film that made me feel so terrible at the end of the movie. The little sister is so cute that you just can't help but smile when her face lights up with happiness. The older brother tries to carry on, with the weight of their survival on his shoulders and it's heartbreaking to think that any child should be burdened with such a responsibility.I want to cut my review short here, as I don't want to give away too much. I think this film should be watched by all but I warn those of you who haven't seen it to prepare accordingly. I was in tears at the end of the movie but ultimately, I was glad to have finally seen it. Rating: ****1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no haka) takes place in Japan during World War II, where a young boy (Seita) and his little sister (Setsuko) must survive America's deadly air raids. The movie is very emotional from the introductory beginning to the conclusive end. I never, ever cried seeing any film in my whole life, but watching this one broke the barrier of my emotions. It's simply amazing how Seita tries his best to survive with his little sister during hard times, how happy he tried to be even though war was at hand, and how the heart-breaking ending made this film an emotional masterpiece.If you want to see a very moving anime film, then buy Grave of the Fireflies.

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Animated Films I've Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is no knock on "The Lion King", "Beauty and the Beast", "Fantasia" or "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs", but "Grave of the Fireflies" has done something very few, if any animated features (I feel) have ever done. The film has an emotional power, which is drawn from its serious topic of war and the human spirit. Plus "Grave of the Fireflies" is rich in animated detail and human feeling, which towers this film above most animated films.Perhaps one of animation's few downfalls is its simplicity. Animation for the most part is viewed as a child's medium. There are many reasons for this, but "Grave of the Fireflies" proves without a doubt that this is a falsity. Director Isao Takahata shows that animation has all the capabilities of approaching difficult issues (like war and its consequences) with a personal heart and creative touch.The story is about a brother (Seita) and a sister (Setsuko) who deal with a great tragedy and struggle after a bombing during World War II. Yet this film has so many moments of beauty to respond to the moments of horror. The moments of Seita and Setsuko swimming or of Setsuko burying the fireflies are absolutely wonderful in their subtlety. There's not a ton of action going on in those scenes but they're so richly detailed in the animation and narrative that your eyes stay glued to the screen.This film is a testament to the human spirit and living life to the fullest. I will not lie, this film is fairly hard to swallow, it deals with difficult issues. Yet it is because of this challenge that this film stands above about every other animated films. It proves that animation is not just for children, but for everyone. This film made me smile and almost brought me to tears at the same time. "Grave of the Fireflies" is truly one of the greatest animated films of all-time. A 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The odd thing is that this tragedy is so touching even though it is a animie, I really tried to tell myself that this wasen't so bad because it was not a live motion picture. Oh man was I wrong. When I *SPOILER* *SPOILER* *SPOILER* saw the litle girl dying I was sitting in front the screen sobbing like a child. When I thought about the fact that children al over the world is experiencing the same, or similar things I got even more depressed.But altough it is such a sobber it is still a great film, the chracters are really well made and so is the story and the animation.

		<fullReview>I am a Japanese-Canadian and saw this movie in 1990 on a video cassette that was sent to my parents from some of their friends in Japan. I was 18 at the time and thought that I'd sit and enjoy another typical Anime film. Boy was I wrong. This movie tore me apart. So much so that I never wanted to watch another Anime feature again without reading a plot synopsis first.I purchased and viewed the DVD version again yesterday. Even with full knowledge of the outcome and story, it still tore me up. "Princess Mononoke" was good. So was "Akira" and "Perfect Blue." None of those movies has stuck with me like "Grave of the Fireflies" has. It made me realize how lucky I am to have grown up in the place and era that I did. It reminded me of how spoiled we are. We don't need to feel guilty about how lucky we are, but a movie like this makes us appreciate it.There is no good and evil in war. In WWII both sides did their share of evil deeds. "Grave of the Fireflies" shows us a human element that extends beyond the soldiers.I will not re-hash the plot since many fellow IMDB members have done so. I will say that the scene that touched me the most was the scene in which Seita pours water into the empty fruit drop container for Setsuko to drink. For some reason that sequence wrentches my gut. At that point I realized that metal container symbolized Setsuko herself and how all that was left were traces of flavors. She is happy in the scene, but that is what makes the scene even more difficult to watch. At least you do have the knowledge that when her spirit is released at the beginning that she is not only reunited with her brother, but with her precious candy as well.It's funny that in the novel that this movie is based on, the metal tin is barely mentioned. Only as a container for Setsuko's cremated ashes. The director made it a point to make it a more important element of the movie.In closing I'd like to say that I highly recommend this movie. However, I'd be emotionally prepared before I do sit and watch this. As one other reviewer said, it is better to watch this with someone so you can discuss it during and afterwards. It does stay with you even if it doesn't tear you up as it did me.</fullReview>

Grave of the Fireflies is one of the finest movies I've seen.Grave of the Fireflies is a story about how a fourteen-year-old boy and his little sister tries to survive in a village in Japan near the end of World War II.Without going further into the plot and revealing anything, I can say that this is to date the most emotionally exhausting film I've ever seen. Films like Dr Zhivago, Deer Hunter and The Killing Fields fade in comparison (although those are excellent movies as well). When I had finished watching this movie, I found myself crying.

Or what a man at the train station at the beginning of the movie poures [hope I spell it right] out the candy tin. At then, of course, I didn't know yet what the dead boy had put in it (it lookes like sand) but when I found out I was furious at that man. It is a very touching and sad movie, but although it doesn't seem to have a happy ending in a way it has. Now there is no-one to bother Sieta or Setsuko, nothing to hurt them. And during the movie al you want for those two is to be happy and have nothing to worry about. That is the situation at the end. Although I wasn't able to fight back any tears, I had a little smile on my face as well. Everybody who isn't sure about watching, just do it, you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of story you wish they'd make more of.Yes, it's animated, but no, it's not like a Disney movie and no, it's not like the usual japanime people usually think of. This is way different.It's about a story of a boy (Seita) and girl (Setsuko) living in Japan during the near end of the Japan vs. US part of World War II. Their father is out fighting the war, their mother is seriously hurt in a bombing, and the two kids fend for themselves. It's told in a way that doesn't beg for tears, but sure as hell gets them. I don't want to give too much away, but there are times when you just have a gut reaction to what's happening to the kids. It's sad and haunting, and is a movie I highly recommend.Look at it this way, it's under 90 minutes, it isn't that long. And, having seen the quintessential anime movies (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke), Grave of the Fireflies is a level above them, and above most other movies, animated or otherwise. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart wrenching, a true dramatic masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film proves that animation can get across just as much emotion as a real life film. Most anime is fast action and suggestive humor, and while that's all and good, "Grave of the Fireflies" breaks all the trends in the market. Beautifully directed by Isao Takahata, the movie's tale of the United State's bombing campaign and it's impact on the Japanese hit home and really make the viewer question the reasoning behind the bombing of any city. With a somber, bleak, yet incredibly moving score by Michio Mamyia, this movie should be seen by all owners of a DVD player. I suggest English viewers watch the dubbed version because its dialog quality is far above the average anime and really helps get across the emotion and despair of the protagonists. A great film that belongs in any serious anime/war/drama fan's collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** In a time when practically everyone is worried about the education of Americans youth, it is a wonderful refresher that a movie of such caliber exists, so much in the fact that it should be shown in history classes nationwide. "Hotaru no Haka", a longtime favourite novel in Japan, transfers beautifully to film, following two young lives' survivals and demise in Kobe during late-WWII: a 13 year-old boy Seita, and his 3 year-old sister Setsuko.(Spoiler info)After a violent fire-bombing by Allied troops, Seita does everything in his power to hide the status of their mother's condition from the delicate Setsuko. They travel to a distant aunt's home, who is kind to them at first, but soon becomes verbally abusive and begins hoarding the food for herself, her daughter, and a lodger, barely giving any to the growing children. She constantly badgers Sieta, telling him to go to school, get a job, or, even more absurd, to help the men during the air raids, although she will possibly not care for Setsuko if Sieta dies during a raid. Finally, Sieta has enough of his sharp-tongued aunt and takes himself and his sister to a live in an abandoned shelter near a lake. But soon, money becomes thin, food is scarce, and Setsuko grows weaker and weaker.(End Spoiler info)I bought this on DVD the other night, along with all my other Powerpuff Girls fluff. The DVD contains background information about the time period and some historical notes. My boyfriend, who is big on German war movies and Kurosawa epics, read the info and just sighed "Oh, no, Kobe." He knew exactly what he was in for and by the end of the film, was grasping me for dear life. I find this WWII anime to be more emotionally stirring than "Barefoot Gen", which covers Hiroshima and is much more graphic violence-wise. The story is also semi-autobiographical, the author's way of coming to terms to with what happened to him and his family all those years ago. It also shows the harshness that the Japanese felt towards their own kind in times of war. It was definitely Survival of the Fitness, without a doubt. And for the orphaned children of WWII Japan, survival was all they knew, up until the bitter end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've come to watch this movie not on purpose. So I hadn't had any preconception or vague information at least. What I felt while I watch this movie was strong involvement itself. As many other Japanese movies, the pace of this one is seems to be controlled rather slow to make a kind of calm and meditating impression. That made me very relaxed, and I could sip the story scene by scene. The story ,supported by a classic plot of tragedy, was so touching I could see a male person keeping himself from weeping, and I was almost dropping tears. That sweet character Setsko ,who would remind anybody of their own little sister or daughter, was banging my heart to see a human being among all those -real- things in the war. And her guardian Seita would easily make an audience identify himself with him, I believe. That should be the cause of involvement and delivers the heart-breaking sorrow.</fullReview>

After watching the movie it is hard to look at the boy and girl on the box without feeling for their tragic situation. This movie knows its purpose and sticks to it without any cheesy tear jerker shots of the atomic bomb. It sticks right with the two children and lets you be apart of their world.

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a very sad movie. It really shows that even though the west "won the war" and "stopped the threat," innocent people suffered on all sides. It's a well paced film, if a bit slow in places, but the message sent is clear.Seita and Setsuko are portrayed extraordinarily well. The pain that they endure really shows that life just isn't fair. Grave of the Fireflies shows that life cannot only be unfair, but unbelievably cruel. I just saw the film for the first time with a friend of mine who doesn't watch anime. He was just as moved as I was by it. It's sad that war causes so much pain for so many people. This is one of the best examples of a WWII movie that I can think of, because it's just so true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An anime must see, but be warned it is a powerful, emotional film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew Grave of the Fireflies was going to be hard viewing. But, that did not lessen the impact when I finally did decide to get the DVD and view it. Although the story takes place in World War II, showing the fire bombing of Japanese cities (mainly the city of Kobe) by American bombers, the film is not anti-American. If anything, the story makes a point of the apathy of the Japanese adults towards the children. It must be understood that Japanese culture requires the saving of face - like the British stiff upper lip - in adversity. This is one reason (among others) that the adults are depicted as being so cold towards the children. It must also be understood that the two main characters (Seita and Setsuko) come from a military family. That means a reserved, proud nature and unlikely to apologise to another - even when it could mean the difference between life and death. Bearing that in mind, you can better understand Seita's actions and those of the adults in the story.The production quality is first rate. I have seen Princess Mononoke in the theatre and Grave of the Fireflies has the same production style and quality. The background scenics are very moody and quite suitable to the environment that existed at that time. Definitely not your typical animation movie! Of course, the subject matter, too, is not your typical animation movie!The story is based on the real experiences of the Japanese author who wrote the original short story. You can tell this as you view the movie - this one is from the heart and from real life. That's why it is so powerful and so accurate in its depiction of events and life at that time. The base story line is derived from a traditional Japanese storytelling method, which is why the events are told in the manner that they are in the film. Even though you know what the outcome will be at the start, this does not lessen its impact once you get there at the end of the film. My greatest feelings came from little Setsuko. The scenes of her at the end hit home the hardest.You have not seen all of Japanese anime until you have seen Grave of the Fireflies (Hotaru no Haka). Keep in mind the social mores along with the circumstances that existed for those people at that time and then watch it. The emotions and powerful images will be a part of you for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we have all been seeing war films that have been wonderfully shot. They usually deal with the soldiers and the horrors they go through. Saving Private Ryan is a good example that shows the horror and chaos that surrounds the people during wartime. There have even been films about what the ordinary people have to go through. But almost all they time they deal with the American, Canadian, or the English. Here is one film that shows the war from the eyes of a young old boy trying to keep himself and his sister alive after the firebombing killed his mother. Although this film is animated it still stirs up emotions and shows who suffers the most during war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best animation I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hotaru no Haka, Grave of the Fireflies, is one of those films that really makes one weep. Even watching it for the second time, consecutively, and after reading the script, and knowing pretty much everything that happens. This is probably the best done film about war that I have ever seen, the only one that moved me (and I've seen lots of Holocaust films, POW films, etc).The music is well done, not spectacular, and it reinforces the animation well, particularly in the beautiful scenes with the fireflies. The animation is not technically sophisticated, by which I mean, it does not use computer graphics (I think) or any of the jazzy animation techniques that Disney favours, but the motions used, the poses, angles, and actions--the true meat of the animation, that is--are very difficult to draw, let alone animate.All in all, I would say that this is the best animated film I have ever seen, and should stand as a benchmark by which all other animation should be measured. That in Japan, they produce films like this, with animation, while we blunder about with "The Black Cauldron" or "The Little Mermaid" or whatever was Disney's 1988 film, really brings home the shallowness of the modern American developments on the art of animation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough Back Story = Indifference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched other Studio Ghibli films, I had high expectations going into Grave of the Fireflies. However, I must say that I was left feeling exactly the same as I did before it began. While countless other viewers are saying that it was "one of the most emotional and powerful movies of all time", I can't help but disagree. The biggest reason for my indifference about the characters was the lack of a back story- the time in most dramatic movies when the director shows how happy and care-free life used to be. As viewers, we don't obtain a good sense of what life was like for the children before the war. In fact, most of the movie was just Seita and his younger sister looking for food and shelter with strange music playing in the background. There might be 10 minutes or less of dialogue in the whole hour and a half I wasted watching the movie! Who is Seita? What is he like? What does he like to do? When did his father leave? Was he a good father? What was it like for the family once he left for the war? None of this is answered. Therefore, it's hard for me to feel anything for them when they die. You may be thinking that this seems quite heartless of me but I must say that I am often quite emotional when it comes to dramatic movies. Titanic, Where the Red Fern Grows, and Bridge to Terabithia are enough to leave me with tears running down my face. Grave of the Fireflies was NOT powerful enough to do this. It had the potential to, but not enough back story was present to make you feel sad for the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the Chinese perspective... ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good film, because the characters are so human. Unlike most Communist / American war films where the protagonist is a saint, in this film you get the feeling each character is a real person rather than some stereotype. All of the characters are imperfect, and make mistakes, and do bad things. The love portrayed in this film is just so real, I think any human being can relate to it.I was trying really hard to hold my tears back all the way through the film, especially in the playground scene. But when Seita brought the water melon back, and it became so obvious what was about to happen, my tears just came streaming down. Despite knowing right at the start of the film they were going to die, it's just... ... The humanity of it all. As for the Chinese perspective, I think it is obvious that after 60 years of falsifying history in both China and Japan, we have a very different understanding of the war. Japan still holds the view "We did nothing wrong during the war", and likes to portray the war as inevitable. While China holds very strong views about Japanese war crimes and atrocities. This is very much underlying the huge defence budget increases in both countries since the 1980s, and that's likely to lead to the next war... ... Which is why I like this film so much, because it is films like this that makes you remember, it does not matter whether you are Chinese, Japanese, or American, if you are human, then you need to eat, you need to drink, and you are flesh and blood. At the end of the day, we are all the same, so why spend all that money on trying to kill each other?I hope to see more films like this, from RoC (Taiwan), PRC (China), Korea, America, as well as Japan. And I hope such films can be distributed freely in all of our/their formal enemy countries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The African savannah has an old proverb: "When elephants fight, the grass gets trampled." This movie, based on the real-life experiences of a World War 2 survivor, wishes to teach us that there were victims on all sides. One of the harsh realities of the war was that a great many attacks deliberately aimed at civilians, something none of the Allied nations had done on such a massive scale before.The story is completely straightforward. A brother and sister lose their home and mother. Forced to seek shelter with one of the mother's sisters, they struggle to cope in a nation that is rapidly running out of all the essentials. Food, water, medicine, work...and basic human compassion. Indeed, the steady, interminable dehumanization of the aunt (who is actually very warm and friendly when she first takes her new guests in) is tough to watch; she's every bit a victim of the war as her sister.As time passes and the brother and sister are forced to move on, we see that no part of the once-proud empire has been untouched by war, and the famed Japanese politeness has warped into callous indifference. And yet, the brother and sister endure and get what they can out of life to the very end. Even as the last illusions are shattered and the hopelessness of the situation sets in.Is this a sad movie? I don't think so, at least not the way I understand sad movies. Most of the tragedy happens early on; the rest is how two children deal with it. Personally, I found their righteous struggle against despair right up to the final moments inspiring. The ending (which admittedly is fairly ambiguous and can be interpreted a number of ways) gave me a sense that the original author just wants to put the past behind and move on. No vendettas, no hatred, no pining for the old empire. Life goes on.All in all, it's simply a very pretty story, the kind you rarely see in anime, and quite moving, if not necessarily to tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece, both in its skillful animation and its heartbreaking tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched 'Grave of the Fireflies' about five minutes ago. I immediately recognised it was one of the best films I have seen, animation or otherwise. I sat, stunned through the ending credits, listening to the beautiful score. I love animated films that make you feel something, and I rank this next to 'Happy Feet' as one of the best animations I've ever seen.The storyline revolves around Seita, a fourteen-year-old boy, and his little sister, Setsuko, who is four. The film details their journey of survival during World War II, and their tender and poignant relationship.The animation is beautiful, and sometimes amazingly detailed and realistic. It makes sense that a film about Japan would be done in a Japanese animation style. The version of the film I watched was the English dubbed version, which I think detracts from the film as you notice that the lip movements do not quite match the words. So, I would recommend the Japanese version with subtitles.The first line of the film shocked me, to tell you the truth."September 21st, 1945 - that was the night I died." - Seita.This line shocked me because September 21st is my birthday. I actually rewound the tape to check that's what Seita actually said. I think the film's opening is fantastic, because knowing how the film ends only makes it more tragic, because you keep on hoping for a different outcome. It gives the film a sense of wholeness, having the end at the beginning, and then the events beforehand, thereafter.It's really quite moving, which some people might find really weird seeing as it's an animation, but the animation is poetic and not distracting. I think I'll be recommending this film to a lot of people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies, set in Japan during the hellish summer of 1945, tells the story of a boy who takes on the duty of looking out not only for himself but also his toddler sister under some of the most dangerous conditions possible -- a catastrophic war with a horrible famine -- after his mother is killed in an American air raid. There's much work to do, but practically no food.The son does surprisingly well in letting his little sister be a little girl, introducing her to the beauties of nature and the Japanese culture even under the extreme conditions. Two things are lacking -- food and safety. Not all the fireflies are the innocuous insects; some are the small pellets of incendiary thermite that the US Army Air Corps drops upon the wooden buildings that are the norm in Japan. To go further I would have to spoil the movie ending. The animation is excellent, the symbolism is effective, and so far as I can tell, it could only have been an animation. The situation is simply to dangerous for live actors of any age, let alone children, and the destruction necessary to establish the true horror of war and hunger would be violate every ethic. A must-see, a classic anti-war film that puts the lie to the idea that the common Japanese people of World War II were unfeeling automatons who deserved what they got.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies gives you a horrifying glimpse of war. Dig a little deeper, and you will also discover complicated symbolism about war, pride, and fireflies. Kudos to the writers.BEGIN SPOILERS: The movie's message is not simply "War is horrible," but "Pride is horrible." The boy Setsuko represents the proud Imperial Japanese navy and emperor. The girl Seita represents the Japanese homeland. During WW2, the Japanese navy is away fighting its war, refusing to surrender, while the homeland suffers badly through Allied bombing raids. During the movie, Setsuko is incapable of providing for himself and Seita (as evidenced by Seita's malnourishment), but he is too proud to beg for help from their aunt (who represents the West) who would berate them but also sustain them with shelter and rations. In the end, Seita dies of starvation and Japan is fairly demolished. Setsuko, his loving mother, his powerful father, and Japan's Navy are also destroyed. Everyone has suffered as the result of too much pride. I find this a much more satisfying message than simply "kids are innocent. war is bad."

After their mother died they went to live with an aunt but after a few days, living with her was intolerable. Leaving the house of this woman, Seita and Setsuko went to live to an abandoned refuge where they went through what many of us never knew in childhood, hunger, malnutrition, suffering from being alone without family, etc. This is a movie but it happens in real life and that is what left me wanting to do something good for people who are in need.Setsuko will make you remember innocent children who are to be loved and saved from suffering.

		<fullReview>I honestly don't know how I feel about this movie. It wasn't at all like I expected; very, quiet, subdued. A lot seemed unoriginal, flat, just played out for dramatic effect. I didn't like the unrealistic animation; at times it seemed to be out of sync with real movement.But then there are moments that completely contradict everything I've just said. The quiet combined with the very unchanging surroundings at times produced some amazingly subtle and beautiful imagery like at the beach scene or the strafing fighter. The first bombing is so much more effectively surprising and horrific because of the empty, quiet streets; when Seita is confused by the napalm sticks, so are we.Perhaps the most confusing thing about this film is the emotions it raises. I did not cry and yet after finishing it I felt empty and cold. I felt like this film is like watching a slow death and it's horrible. It ends on a whimper and a whisper and it is truly tragic, despite what I said above :)</fullReview>

It was also the first anime I bought on DVD just so I can introduce it to my mom. She didn't like it though. The English dub wasn't my taste though. The original in Japanese and with English sub was more believing.After every time I watched it, I discover something new that I missed the first time. It's a great movie about the aftermath of war and a brother and sister trying to survive. After watching it a few times, I noticed that it didn't end bad at all. Either people hate it because there was nothing happy about it, or they love it because of how well it was done and the story. I love Grave Of The Fireflies. The DVD was worth the buy and so was the poster.Some say that it would be better if it wasn't in animation, and that maybe more people would be introduced to it. I agree on the second. I'd like to see some acting done with this. Just to get the flavor of both. However, I do hope they don't butcher it.In any case, I gave it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respectable effort, but I wished for more depth to the characters, as well as less frustrating character actions!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SOME MAJOR SPOILERS) Animation is often a favourable genre as far as I'm concerned regardless of the maturity of the content. 'Grave of the Fireflies' tackles a tough issue, and is pretty much an animated film for adults or older children. As the content deals with the children who are left behind during any-given war, and how they become adjusted to a new way of living.Naturally, being an anime film, it takes the Japanese perspective of World War II, and how the American fire bombings affected the civilians, particularly from the viewpoint of teenage boy, Seita, and his extremely young sister in Setsuko. In the opening scene of the film, it displays the tragic outcome of the lead character, so we immediately know that this isn't going to be a very happy film! The journey of Seita and Setsuko is an interesting one, but also, a frustrating one to watch.I found myself a little annoyed at some of Seita's actions, although it can be related to youthful rebellion and ideals of being able to survive in the wilderness on your own. The conflict between the Aunt towards Seita and Setsuko seemed extremely harsh, and there could have been more depth to the Aunt's intense dislike of her relatives, cause I think it was needed. Although, I did like the play on the Aunt's use of provisions, and her sense of worthiness when allocating them to her immediate family- even though Seita had provided those provisions. It was a subtle way of showing something deeper to the relationship. The Aunt seemed to think they were ungrateful, yet she was equally ungrateful for what they had sacrificed! The scene where the Aunt asks Seita about school is priceless in displaying the undertones of her manner towards him, revealing the nature of her contempt for him- but I still wish there was more exploration as to why she disliked a young boy and his four-year old sister so much. It seemed a little harsh that any person would treat children like that after a horrendous aftermath to their living situation, and especially during wartime survival, and that's why I think there should have been more exploration of that family unit's history. There was a subtle hint at the Uncle's cowardice, but again, his character was hardly in it to be given depth.The other problem I had was Setsuko. She was far too young to be realistically left in the care of her brother, and she seemed to be able to comprehend far too much for someone so young, and as a character, I found her slightly annoying. There was some touching moments between her and Seita though, especially when she follows him to the police station, as well as when he's trying to shield her from the horrors of war. 'Grave of the Fireflies' really gets over the desperation of trying to cope with hunger, shelter in the aftermath of war- but it just lost me with the lack of humanity of Seita's closest relatives, and with the irresponsibility of his later actions. Even during the first bombing, I seriously doubt any mother would leave her youngest daughter out of her own sight. So, while some people may say this film is the essential war film, or more precisely, "anti-war" film- I personally think that is tad overstating its importance. A good animated film that is anti-war- and shows the aftermath of it in a realistic manner-- then perhaps that is fair! However, it's not the essential anti-war/war film, and if you can cope with the characters, then this film is pretty rewarding and somewhat haunting! It is, however, a tad overrated in my book! A reasonably good animated film for adults showing the repercussions and the aftermath of war! ***? out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hotaru no haka is a 1988 Japanese animated war drama film written and directed by Isao Takahata and animated by Studio Ghibli. It is based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical short story Hotaru no haka by Akiyuki Nosaka.The film stars Tsutomu Tatsumi, Ayano Shiraishi, Yoshiko Shinohara and Akemi Yamaguchi. Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, the film tells the story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko, and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Second World War. The film was critically acclaimed. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times considered it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his "Great Movies" list. Two live-action remakes of Grave of the Fireflies were made, one in 2005 and one in 2008. It is commonly described as an anti-war film, but this interpretation has been denied by the director.The film begins at Sannomiya Station on 21 September 1945, shortly after the end of World War II. A boy, Seita, is shown dying of starvation. Later that night, having removed Seita's body, a janitor digs through his possessions and finds a candy tin which he throws away into a nearby field. The spirit of Seita's younger sister, Setsuko, springs from the tin and is joined by Seita's spirit as well as a cloud of fireflies. Seita's spirit then begins to narrate their story accompanied by an extended flashback of the final months of World War II.When I watch the film, I am filled with grief. I can imagine what war is and how people live during war. We should never happen war again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredibly moving and brutally honest masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Grave of the Fireflies and wow. Just wow. I am at a complete lost for words. Until this point, I had only watched a few animes but this heart-rending tale isn't your typical animated film. No, it is SO much more. It has unexpected depth. It has soul. It has a genuine message that shan't be overlooked.This is an extremely poignant and moving story about a young boy and his little sister struggling to survive in Japan during World War II. Above all, it is based on experience, situation and exploration. And this film offers us a tragic look into real atrocities, real horrors from the perspectives of two joyful kids, Seita and Setsuko. They share a magnificently uplifting and eternal connection (the latter quite literally, as many would argue) that makes you feel all kinds of warm inside just watching them interact with one another.The animation in this film is simply breathtaking. The painstaking attention to detail, particularly with the surrounding landscape is awe-inspiring. Certain images like the luminous fireflies at night, the glistening pond outside where Seita and Setsuko reside and the beach they visit with its magnificent sunset will resonate with me for a long time. It is hard not to appreciate animation of such quality and finesse.The impact of this film is heightened with a mesmerizing score and the introspective pauses that are not only tolerated, but encouraged, in Japanese animation films. Majestic sounds used throughout also add to this captivating, almost dreamlike vibe. And yet, it was the true to life storytelling that made this film such a realistic, enchanting piece of art.I was somewhat confused of the beginning without any context and I later re-watched it after the film's end. It is a beautiful beginning (or rather end) and makes you appreciate the film even more than you thought you did. This wonderfully crafted film deserves a viewing from anyone at least once. It is not simply a movie about war per say, but about the beauty of life and the blissful ignorance of youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwrenching Brutality of Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As it is already well known, "Grave of the Fireflies" is without much of a doubt, the most saddest animation film ever made. I was already well aware of the films attributes, when I finally got a chance to see this with original Japanese soundtrack. But... I still wasn't prepared for the roller coaster ride of an experience I won't, and even more importantly, can't never, ever forget. This movie will rip your heart apart during its 89 minute duration. It will turn like a sharp needle through your chest, unless you are made of wood, this movie will make you question morality of mankind, it will force you to reckon what is humanity's guilt or responsibility for one and another. And this movie is relentless... It won't let you go of its depressing grip, even for a moment. And it will twist, turn and tear your soul apart in ways that you never thought were even possible, no matter how tough you think you are. And all of this only gets worse and worse, more closer to the end you get. So... does this mean it makes poor entertainment? Well.. yes, when speaking strictly about how this movie will (or at least should) make you feel. But.. is it a good movie? -YES! Without any question about it -This IS one of the best animations ever made, both visually and by its story content. I had previously only seen the movie dubbed in English, which I have to say, is a travesty, near criminally bad. The original Japanese voice of "Setsuko" (by "Ayano Shiraishi") is simply so heart warming and so touching. And it's difficult to believe that nothing of this sort comes through from the bad English dub, which is just wrong, wrong, wrong!To finish this off, it must be said, that even knowing all of the above, before actually seeing the film, there really is nothing that would properly prepare you for this extraordinary emotional experience of a life time. It is a must see film, a masterpiece by it's own right, and has more than earned its place on the IMDb Top 250 list. (When I'm writing this, the film is at position 60.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an easy watch, but very thought-provoking and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stark and harrowing tale of orphaned teen Seita and his younger sister Setsuko as they try to survive on their own in war-torn Japan. Right from the start the film really pulls no punches in its depiction of the horrors of war. Images of air raids, burning homes, mass destruction, injured citizens and mounds of bodies are just a few of the searing images which present themselves within the first 30 minutes of the film. Interestingly though, there is a stillness to this first section of the film even in the midst of such horror. Not only is there very minimal music, there are many scenes with no sound at all save for the voices of the characters speaking. We don't hear the groans of the injured, the shuffle of the displaced townsfolk, or the crackles of the fires. It's an interesting decision which gives this opening section a very solemn and observant feel that forces the viewer to confront the emotional horror without dramatization or distraction.Beyond the shocking opening, the core of the film goes on to examine how the siblings cope with the death of their mother and loss of their home. At first, they take refuge in a paternal aunt's home who is less-than welcoming. A major theme of the film explored here is how the family unit and society is affected by war. There is a "circling of the wagons" portrayed here where the immediate family is given precedence and the individual begins to fend for him/herself and becomes less willing to offer help to others. Even from the start Setsuko and Seita's aunt seems less than enthusiastic about letting her niece and nephew stay with her and her resentment only grows from there. The lack of food supplies and extra mouths to feed puts a strain on her and she begins to favor her own family over Setsuko and Seita. This theme repeats itself with the other townsfolk as well who are hesitant to share food even as Setsuko grows sick and malnourished. The bond between neighbors slowly dissolves and a sense of impersonality develops. We as the audience watch as these two children are essentially excommunicated from society and even who we would normally consider "honorable" citizens like a police officer and doctor ultimately turn a blind eye to their suffering. The war itself is portrayed with a similar impersonality. We never see any of the soldiers fighting or hear any of their stores. We simply see these nameless, faceless airplanes flying thousands of feet overhead, dropping their bombs and flying on, unaware and uncaring of the suffering that directly results. It feels like a commentary on the depersonalization and dehumanization that must take place for such acts of violence to be carried out.The film also makes good use of its central firefly metaphor for a few very poignant scenes. From what I gathered, the fireflies in the film essential represent those lost to war; they are the silent remnants and glowing reminders of the departed. Keeping this in mind throughout the film gives many scenes an eerie quality. Setsuko and Seita are often seen surrounded by fireflies which essentially feel like harbingers of the death that will eventually befall them both. One scene in particular struck me: the two spend their first night in the converted bomb shelter after running away from their aunt and fill the space with fireflies to keep it lit. It's a beautiful scene on the surface, but with a very dark undertone. At this point, even before their deaths, Setsuko and Seita have left the land of the living and are already taking their place among the dead.Another particularly powerful scene directly follows. Setsuko reveals that she has been aware that their mother has died for some time now, a detail which Seita thought he had successfully kept secret from her. Upon hearing her speak these words, Seita breaks down into tears and this is the first time we see him truly emotionally react to the death of his mother. Up until this point he had shouldered the role of protector, keeping a straight face and trying to protect Setsuko from the horrors that have befallen them as much as possible. It is at this moment that he realizes how futile that action has been, as the war has already made its irreversible impact on Setsuko. At this moment, I feel he is crying not just for his mother, but also for the innocence that he knows his sister has lost despite his best efforts.Although it isn't an easy watch by any means, Grave of the Fireflies is a powerful statement on war and its devastating personal and societal impacts. It feels very fitting that Seita goes against the advice to cremate his younger sister in a church, instead opting for an open field. After being denied help and care from so many of his fellow citizens, he has recognized the grave societal change which has taken place and has all but abandoned tradition or custom. He chooses to grieve the loss of his sister (and himself) only among the fireflies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most powerful animated film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies don't often have the ability to make me weep, and never has an animated film done so, until I saw this film. I found myself in tears for several sequences of this movie. It has the incredible ability to come off the screen and make me feel all kinds of emotions I didn't know an animated movie could make me feel. I laughed, I cried, I was shocked, I was surprised, this movie did it all.The film starts off with a young boy dying of starvation in a public train station. A janitor finds the body and, upon going through his belongings, finds a candy container. The janitor throws the container away in a nearby field, which opens the container, releasing the souls of the young boy and his sister. We find out, through flash back the boy is a 14 young man named Seita and his sister is a four year-old named Setsuko. The two live with their mother in Kobe, Japan, while the father fights in the navy. The two are forced to live with their aunt after a bombing raid critically injures their mother. They find out that their aunt is a very mean spirited lady who steals from the kid's mother and belittles them constantly. The rest of the story revolves around Seita and Setsuko and we figure out how these two ended up dying.I think that some people may have a problem with the fact that the movie shows you that these two are dead within the first couple minutes. However I would argue this is actually an incredible strength to this film. Not often is a story told this way, in fact none that I've ever heard, and it's really interesting and ambitious. Sure there's no mystery as to what happens to the kids. But the movie is done so well, that there exists suspense because it doesn't tell you how the girl passes away, or the status of the mother or father. This also works to the movie's advantage because it just makes you want to jump into the movie and tell the two main characters that they're in danger, because you want these two to make it. And the fact that they don't just makes it all the more heart breaking to watch.The voice acting for this film is absolutely spectacular, some of the best I've ever heard. A lot of this comes from the voice actress playing Setsuko, who does a phenomenal job, especially for a child actress. The actor playing Seita is great too, conveying that sense of a false sense of hope that is present throughout most of this film. These two work off of each other so well and are so well written that it's hard not to support them and their efforts for survival. Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie is it's Kafkaesque feel. This meaning, a sense of feeling like you're in a bad dream. Sometimes I feel as though Seito is in such a state of sorrow and panic that he's in sort of a dream like state of shock as to how bad his situation really is. The world is also in this sense as well. Everything, and I mean everything, that can go wrong, does and it's all so surreal but at the same time, totally believable and plausible. This poor kid is almost driven to the brink of insanity and ultimately death and it's hard to watch but at the same time, hard not to watch.Then, of course, there's the animation. How can I not talk about it? The whole film looks fantastic, some of the scenes when nothing is really happening and no dialogue is spoken, the animation really sinks in and I can get really wrapped up in it. The song by the shelter looks beautiful, even though it's just some boring river. The scenes where it shows the city after being completely destroyed by a U.S. air raid is spectacular is how sad and powerful it is. I feel like a lot of the imagery will have the "American guilt trip" effect without even being live action, which is really impressive.In conclusion, this film has clearly given me a lot of things to think about and reflect on, which for me is the trade mark of a great film. It will make you feel things you didn't know that an animated movie can make you feel. If you're looking for a powerful, animated film, than this is right up your alley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do fireflies have to die so young?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie a while back until recently I decided to give company to my friends who were watching it for the first time. When the movie ended, nobody could utter a word. You know you have watched a masterpiece when words cannot do justice to the range of emotions stirred by the movie.I am a huge war-movie buff. Most war movies leave you hurt but also with a sense of glory and valor. However, grave of fireflies is the true ugly face of war. Not many filmmakers dare to go into the dark corners of war to bring out a beautiful yet heart wrenching story. What I'd want the viewers to take away from this movie is, if you ever run into a little kid who needs help, please remember this movie! I am sure you won't have to think twice about helping that kid. Who knows, you might be saving a life!'Arigato' in advance for your compassion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those rare film that makes you appreciate your life. Don't expect much. There is no flashy action not much drama and not much complicated plot. Just a short story of two siblings living in the period of war. Yet if you grasp the true message this movie is trying to deliver, you'll realize how beautiful 'grave of the fireflies' can be. This movie really portrays how much war can affect us and how cruel it can be to those who are not involved. I did not expect much from the film the first I was recommended. But this turned out to be a masterpiece and a heart wrenching one. It's like experiencing a journey of sad and happy moment yourself. The director did a good job directing the film and plot. It was built up just enough time for audience to get attached to the characters. The animation and art style was quite old considering the year it was made, but it gave a nostalgic feeling and it really suits the plot of the movie along with amazing soundtracks and voice acting. This movie is incredibly sad. It's the type that you would call one the best but would never want to watch again. This might not be for anyone but I highly recommend this film for those who like the adult-type of movie.</fullReview>

A film about memory, to remember the horrors of war and the irremediable consequences resulting.

		<shortDescription>A very sad tale of Japan in World War II</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie a very sad reality of what had happened during World War II. What really had me stoked was that Seita looked after his beloved sister Setsuko until her death. He gave up his young life just to protect her from the air raid, feed her and look after her. I found it was very depressing that she died of malnutrition at such a small age. Then poor Setsuko died from starvation at the age of 14. Unfortunately in World War II, many children had died from starvation and of course, the bomb blasts.It was too bad that the aunt wasn't any use to looking after them. I suppose she was too stressed out by the fact, her husband and her daughter were fighting in the war. But still, it wasn't the children's fault that the war has happened all so horribly. I would just love to shake that woman and tell her it wasn't their fault that food is running low!I found this film so sad but absolutely excellent!</fullReview>

And up until today, I still can't forget the emotions I felt when I first watch the movie. Even remembering that things that happened to them makes my eyes swelled up.

You will be able to feel a lot of emotions while watching this movie. This is not your typical animated movie. This is by far the most underrated movie out there. A MUST WATCH FILM.

		<fullReview>I had to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles to understand it. But this turned out to be a boon as the original voice actors are possibly the only people who could do justice to the voices of the innocent children going through this tough period of time. The actors especially that of Setsuko is just amazing. The movie makes a lasting impression on the viewer which shows the Second World War from a perspective that is very rarely, if at all, shown in western movies. The animation is executed fantastically well, right down to the details. The movie makes you laugh and makes you cry with the protagonists. The characters are very endearing and show a great bond of love and affection. They not only love but understand each other. The young girl (Setsuko) understands their situation and behaves very maturely with some outbursts of childlike silliness that she is entitled to. This title made me realize the magnitude of civilian casualty that the war saw which most western movies fail to show because they either focus on the soldiers or the Jews in concentration camps in Germany. It makes it visually obvious that the life of an innocent human being was also not spared. The one line that Seita narrates near the end in which he states that his sister 'never woke up again' is very shocking and tear- jerking but the stone-faced emotion with which he says it adds a layer of despair into it, of a boy who has lost his entire family.One of the best foreign movies and movies in general, that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies I've seen can bring me to the brink of tears, and only a handful of those can actually haunt me days after seeing them. Grave of the Fireflies is one of those rare movies I've seen that did this to me. Very few films have EVER made me feel as bad as this one did. Try to think of the saddest movie you've ever seen, Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition), Saving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition), anything, and this movie blows it out of the water. This film has the power to devastate you, to move you, to bring you to the brink of tears and then push you over into a chaotic world. This is Grave of the Fireflies.Set during the last days of WWII, while the US Air Force was fire bombing Japanese cities, Grave of the Fireflies is a movie about a young boy named Sata and his little four year old sister Setsico. When their mother is killed in the firebombing of Tokyo Sata is forced to care for his little sister in a nation ripped apart by war and famine. With his father far away serving in the Japanese navy, Sata is the only one who can care for his sister. The love shared between these two siblings is something that will forever leave an impression on me. As an older brother myself I could very easily put myself into Sata's situation. His need to give his sister the very best he can while not being able to provide for her is a very real feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched a 'howls moving castle' and 'laputa castle in the sky' and few others and so thought this would be similar but without the improved animations.. I never thought a 'cartoon' would bring me to tears! Even after several days I wake up and remember the final scenes and I feel like I've got a lump in my throat. I watched this over a couple of days as didn't have the time to watch in one go, it took a little while for me to get into it but I was gripped by the end, I remember feeling so involved with the characters at one point I suddenly thought to myself, oh no I hope she doesn't die.. and literally the next scene is where he narrates that 'she doesn't wake up again' that whole part of the film has just haunted me since.. It's strange cos at first his little sisters voice is a little annoying and she seems a burden on him but as time goes on you get so attached to her, the hardest scene to watch is when she is laying down almost motionless and rolls over to face him and says that she's made some rice balls which in fact are just a couple of rocks.. I don't think I can watch that scene again without having to sit down.. I don't think I've ever written a review but this film moved me so much I felt I had to have an attempt at writing something.. The cost of war in my mind is only felt by the very innocent, the decision makers rarely suffer to the same levels.. The things some children go through you cannot even imagine.. when he doesn't tell her that their mother is dead but she already knows because their aunt told her, she mentions it while she is burying the fireflies, the thought of how much burden she must be holding inside.. I know this is a true story and there are probably hundreds like this which do not make it to the screen but it is a truly frightening view of war through the eyes of the innocent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming and tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film for the first time when I was 7- I didn't understand much of it then but I'd heard my dad talking about it and demanded to see it. I watched it again when I was 13, remembering vaguely that it was about war which was a subject I was fascinated by at the time. I loved this film from the get go. The style and plot were very different from studio Ghibli films I'd seen in the past but worked very well. The film is beautifully animated, brutally honest and really captures the true essence of what war is really like. Not on the soldiers but on the civilians, family and friends they left behind. I also liked it because it was from a different point of view. There are hundreds of films based on the British and their allies during the war but not many on those who we were fighting. The relationship between Seita and Setsuko is heartwarming which only adds to the tragedy of the film. I found myself crying at multiple times throughout and even forced my friends to watch it so they could cry with me. I would definitely recommend this film no matter what film genres you're into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about this spectacular film? It's superfluous to add more praise to an already established classic, so I guess the best I can do is reach for the tissues while I try and connect to the swell of emotions that filled me, each and every time I watched it, tormenting myself with the most beautiful and humanistic pain of empathy and compassion. Not since the death scene of E.T that made me cry pools at my childhood, nor since the defibrillating Russian roulette scene in the The Dear Hunter was I so sucked into pain, questioning existence, finding anew the love for fellow men.This creation talks directly to the heart of the most tenacious Timonist. It tells its bitter story and from its placid remoteness watches as the heart sheds layers of cynicism by which it is painfully renewed.A film like no other, and one of the best ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful but utterly heartbreaking experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to say, you must not expect an action-packed movie.This is a movie that honestly shows horrors of wars. And it's filled with emotions, real and devastating but also heartwarming.It follows the story of a boy Seita and his younger sister Satsuko when they are left practically alone during and after the war. The boy takes care of her in any way he can, and tries his best to stay strong for her. But there are moments when he just gives in to his grief and then his sister shows that, even though she is very young, she understands him and even tries to comfort him. They try to make the best out of their situation, and stay positive, but that's hardly possible when life throws the worst at you.The events of this and similar movies should always be kept in mind, as the reason why wars should be avoided no matter what. To teach us to love and care about each other, help out whenever you can. I was at first bothered with the way movie ended, it does not leave us with new hope at the horizon, but ends in a questionable way. Which is more realistic, we don't know what happens later, that has to be decided by each of us, and we all need to find our path, our strength, our purpose, our meaning, our hope in life ... even when that seems hard and unachievable, and lesson we learn mustn't be forgotten, ever.This movie will probably make you cry, but that is a natural reaction if you are indeed human being with even a little bit of compassion, with tiny bit of soul. And emotions you feel during watching it, should be preserved always - when you are in a situation that you can help someone and maybe save his/her life, or just help in any other way.This movie is in my opinion truly a Masterpiece, it described one of Million heartbreaking stories that most certainly happened throughout our history filled with destructive wars and if we don't do anything to prevent that from repeating, there will be more. And the purpose of this is to cherish what we have and never allow another war to happen.I would recommend this, but be warned of its content. It is beautifully devastating movie. And I gave it a 10/10 without a second thought. But probably, I will never watch it again, because my heart can't withstand more sorrow that emitted from this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that shows both the cost of war and the idea that animation is not just for kids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is possibly one of the saddest film I have seen. It isn't one for a feint heart but one for those who wish to see the true cost of war. It should be a required viewing for teenagers maybe...maybe it's a bit sad for that but it probably should be anyway.The main character are Seita and Setsuko. The film starts at the end and the knowing idea that what happens happens is part of the depressing nature of the film. Seita is a wonderful older brother but it shows how powerless a young citizen such as himself can be in time of war.This is not a film for a lot of people but it should be shown to that many. It is depressing but for all the reasons that it should be.8.9</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're looking for a cheap way to permanently damage your psyche, consider Grave of the Fireflies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that wastes absolutely no time yanking at the heartstrings. Based off a semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, "Fireflies" tells the story of 14-year-old Seita as he and his young sister Setsuko struggle to survive the final months of World War II in Japan. It depicts war from a point of view strikingly different from western film; there are no heroes or villains, no triumph or defeat, no good guys or bad guys. There is only reality, and a grim reality at that. Two ordinary people tragically forced to live through the terror of a war they never asked for. Seita and Setsuko are not extraordinary. Their story is not one of grand adventure with a happy ending. They are just children dealing with very real tragedy and very real trauma in a very real way. From the opening narrative to the final credits, Grave of the Firefiles drags you on a powerful and emotional roller coaster of a journey and will not stop until the last tear falls. Do NOT let the medium fool you; this masterpiece is powerful and mature, shattering any preconceived notions of what animation is "supposed to be".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beware, this is not a movie for people with weak hearts. Keep a box of tissue ready with you always while watching.I read a lot about Grave of the Fireflies before watching and this kind of research generally leads to decrease in intensity of the film while watching as one generally expects what is going to happen. However, it didn't happen with this. It was not only more overwhelming than I imagined, it was more overwhelming than I could have imagined. As soon as the movie starts, you know how it's going to end, but still can not bear to watch as scene by scene unfolds and you are hoping and praying that the scene does not end in the worst possible way.You are hoping to end the misery for the little kids as much as for you. I am very certain that I will never watch this film again as I can not go through the pain. However, I recommend everyone to watch it at least once.The things I liked about this film were: 1. Amazing portrayal of a war situation. You will not find any more realistic and sad portrayals of the effects of war 2. Contrast: The contrast of the innocence of kids with the hatred and suffering of war 3. Helplessness: There is nothing more heartbreaking than the face of a helpless child. You get to see it so much in this film. It is truly heart-wrenching. 4. Special moments: This characteristic is very familiar in almost all Ghibli films, where you get an amazingly real portrayal of exchanges between two people that is almost impossible to create artificially and that is what I like so much about all Ghibli films. E.g. the scene where the brother and sister are taking a bath, among others. 5. Untouched/Non-discussed subjects: Subjects such as guilt, depravity, etc. are more than touched in this film. This makes it unique among animated films or even among live action films.I remember very few films that have such an effect on me. Perhaps, none will ever will and that is the importance of this film for me.This, according to me, is one of the finest Studio Ghibli films ever made. It is one of the most moving films I have ever seen and will probably ever see in my life. It doesn't get the recognition it deserves. When people start watching Ghibli films, they generally tend to focus on Hayao Miyazaki films, and films such as these get neglected. However, this film by Isao Takahata is up there with the best films ever made animated or non-animated.I don't get the fact that people say that this deserves a live action film. I say that live action films don't deserve this script. I don't understand the hatred for animation and the movement towards effects rather than story. I for one, am a fan of animation, and this credit goes only to Studio Ghibli. Hats Off!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, I do not know how to describe Grave of the Fireflies (1988) in words but this film is so... innocent yet depressing. Although it is a lesser known film from Studio Ghibli and is released as double feature in parallel with My Neighbor Totoro (1988), this film is undeniably beautiful and powerful. This film can be interpreted in various ways but it certainly is able to leave audiences speechless and/or tear their eyes out. Usually both, though, as this film is one of the saddest films ever made.With superb cinematography, brilliantly utilizes colors and depicts simple joy of life as well as tragedy in high precision, Grave of the Fireflies (1988) is truly one of the most heartbreaking films ever made!!All in all, please, consider watching this tragic film as it has the ability to change you in some ways! It shouts never underestimate the power of story telling through animation and the importance of film making!PS. This is definitely one of my top favorite animated feature. No further review needed. And, this is the only film I rate 10 stars on IMDb!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Grave of the Fireflies' is an unforgettable masterpiece (and an award-winning film at the International Children's Film Festival) which tells the story of two Japanese children whose parents have died in the war. It is a stunning portrait of the struggle they have to face just to stay alive in the face of apathy shown to them by their relatives and countrymen. This hauntingly poetic story is delivered with breath-taking visuals and a riveting narration that most animation films don't even come close to achieving. 'Grave of the Fireflies' is an emotional experience so powerful that it leaves you reeling in shock as you witness the true cost of war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you look up beautifully haunting in the dictionary you will get 'Grave of the Fireflies'. When I first watched this film it was late at night &amp; I was alone in my room. The movie's final climatic act hit me very deeply. But it was not until my second viewing of it that I more deeply looked at the brother/sister relationship we see in the film. During the second viewing of this film I invited my little brother to come watch the film with me. While watching the film I began to realize that the relationship between Seito &amp; Setsuko was in fact very similar to my relationship with my younger sibling. I do think the film shows us a strong anti-war feeling when we're done viewing it, but it doesn't feel like it's trying to push its beliefs down our throats. During the films final act while we see flashbacks of what Setsuko was doing while Seito was away us already knowing about her demise, I began to look over at my younger brother. He was not really feeling the emotional touch that I felt (mostly because he was fiddling with my watch the entire movie). I looked over at him playing with my watch &amp; I saw how he like many other children are basically another Setsuko &amp; for a child to be in the position she was it just put me to tears. I stayed there until the end crying into a pillow while my brother looked on. Dark at times but beautiful in the moments we least expect. 'Grave of the Fireflies' did to war, what 'Requiem for a Dream' did to drugs. In conclusion, this film is a masterpiece with beautiful sceneries &amp; a beautifully touching story! A must watch not just for anime fans or family people but to anyone...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there were more than 10 stars to give</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father was a B-29 pilot part of the 315th Bomb Wing in Guam. Growing up, he never talked about WWII, ever. Despite a first class American education, I never learned about the fire-bombing of Japan. Having watched this great film, I now know why, and more importantly that it happened.I watch and rate lots of films and rarely give any film 10-stars. If there were more to give, I would. Besides being a great film, beautifully made, at an emotional depth I feel otherwise impossible, I understand my father's reluctance. He chose to be buried in the Houston National Cemetery and was interred there In June of 2004, so his role in WWII was of obvious importance to him.The film's impetus, however, was to look deeper into that role, to understand it from the eyes of two Kobe war orphans on the ground under those fireflies laying waste to their lives, their cities, their nation. War from the perspective of civilians and their great casualty. For that, I'd recommend Mark Selden's excellent article "A Forgotten Holocaust: US Bombing Strategy, the Destruction of Japanese Cities and the American Way of War from World War II to Iraq".Because it continues. Because it was then and is now a crime. Because it must stop.I thank the artists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an animation film you would expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually don't watch animation films since I always feel they are for kids even they might portray some adult points of views. However, they are just not deep enough to worth spending time on. Surprisingly, I watched this film twice. Just like Roger Ebert's review about how this movie was made, it leaves the room for the audience to process without telling everything out front. I always believe graphic scenes only applied necessarily to tell stories. A lot of films use them to exploit audience. This is definitely not the one. My parents grew up in Taiwan under Japanese ruling in WWII. I think the experiences of their childhood changed their views of lives profoundly. The scare and shortage of materials threatened their survival. So they are not all kind and nice to others. Competitions are common among people and even in families. I may say majorities of their generation are dysfunctional. Even when the environments present no threats to their livelihood anymore, they still could not abandon their intuitions. This movie contrived the impacts of wars truly. It should be seen by leaders in those aggression regimes. They might think twice to wage wars against others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously don't know how to put this. I'm flabbergasted by the story and the lesson learned from this. Words cannot describe.

After watching this beautiful (but painfully saddening) movie, the very first thing that came to mind was that a certain group of CHILDISH warmongering/war worshiping people MUST watch this to understand the bitter REALITY of what happens during a war.I seriously cannot believe how can anyone ever think that war would be "cool". Not going into further detail on how childish and immature the minds of some can be.This animation brings out 2 things that really hit me the hardest by reminding me that 1) the bitter tragic reality of war and its implications. 2)Lives and emotions are involved. (Truly have to mention. Before watching I thought this show was going to be cake walk.) I cannot explain as a young adult how this really impacted me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw this film recently, after only just discovering the amazing Studio Gibli, and looking for new films to share with my Younger sibling, but I am glad I watched this one alone, I couldn't put a young child through that.I had my doubts whether to watch it at all, as from a very vague synopsis I understood this would be a sad war time film... no the kind of animated movie people would pick to watch, but in respect for the art and beauty of the studio i watched it myself. I suspected sadness but ultimately a heart warming type of film, i never imagined how sad, realistic and emotionally draining this film would be. Their struggles are so far away from anything I could ever imagine in this day and age, with nobody to turn to, its just painful to watch their plight unfold and ultimately end their lives. But while it shows this pain and horror, its a beautiful movie that protests war and opens eyes to the truth of all those affected by war in every little way.One thing I will suggest, to others who have already seen it and may be very shook up... Watch the beginning again. It didn't really make a lot of sense to me the first time i watched it, but i watched the intro again, and its almost like a hidden happy ending where you finally see the two siblings reunited, with plenty of the fruit drops, their one and only source of happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost unbearably depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie so painful to watch that I could only do it in 15- minute spurts (until the end). Perhaps some of the impact on me reflects my having spent four years in Japan and having recently visited friends in Kobe, where the film is set. The movie is lyrically, beautifully sad. It's fascinating that American critics view it as an antiwar film, whereas the director said it's not about that at all, but rather about the necessity of living in society and making the best of it. It's one of those divergences of opinion that gaijin experience while living in Japan, of people seeing things in such a remarkably different way than you do.Reviewers here who have criticized the young man for not working for food don't realize just how short food was in Japan at the end of the war. I worked with a man who told me how his family ate rats to survive. We Americans, for the most part, simply have no comprehension of that. I watched the English-language version; according to Wikipedia, the voice of the little girl is far more poignant in Japanese. Even though I gave the film a 9, it's hard to say I recommend it. Once I saw how sad the film was going to be (or, at least, how I was going to experience it as such), I almost stopped watching it. But then I felt rather ridiculous about that, considering the millions who've experienced -- and continue to experience -- what these characters go through.</fullReview>

I watched this in my English class our teacher told us to make a summary of this movie. At first it made me boring because you can hear a boy who was telling a story. After a few minutes there comes the story it's kinda boring if you were not yet in the climax of it but if you were in the climax it will make you feel sad or utterly bad, because of the little girl who was struggle to live and had a serious sickness and they went out for help but nobody help them because they don't have enough money to sustain medicine. Until they don't have anything to eat and the little girl died, and the brother became so sad then he become a complete mendicant and died without pursuing his dream. After the movie most of my classmates cried and even me. It was a tragedy not only tragedy but super tragedy that will make you cry and will haunt your mind often.

It is an extremely sad story about a Japanese boy and his little sister during the WW2. Coincidentally, two of the most touching film for me so far are both from Japan. But this one has a much deeper message to get across to the audience. Everyone should watch this movie. For it teaches you the REAL cost of war from a simple story. Also who are the real sufferers during a War. So in a way this is an anti-war animation. It will be a painful experience to watch Grave of the Fireflies. But still you must watch it. Because this is one of those movie that will make a grown man weep like a baby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is set in Japan during World War II. The story is about two orphaned siblings Seita age 14 and Setsuko age 4 who try to survive through the harsh realities of war. This is not an anti-war movie where America is seen as the villain. For me it became so much more than a World War II film set in Japan. It could have been set anywhere. The story focuses on the plight of the two children in a war-time setting. I have to say that this was one of the best war movies I have ever watched. I also think it's the best animated movie from Studio Ghibli and it definitely ranks as one of my favourite Studio Ghibli animated movies (all-time favourite is Spirited Away). It irks me when people write off animation as silly cartoons like it's nothing but child's play. I always tell them their perspective would change when they experience at least one of the works created by Studio Ghibli. And this was no exception.In any case, it really wouldn't have mattered what medium was used because the story stood on its own. This happens when you have the perfect marriage of a solid story and a fantastic studio of animators. Yes, it is a heavy and heart-wrenching movie and some would say Seita's pride led to their downfall but don't let that deter you. There was such innocence, love and affection between the two siblings. The moments of joy and laughter they shared together despite all the difficulties they faced was so beautifully poignant and bittersweet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, when you watch a War-movie, the point of view is from the military force or the political figures. Yet you will be really ashamed, if you see the war from the innocent children eye. And this movie, got that all.What does war cost? Just a billion of human lives, or the damage of the environment, or maybe just a shock in national structure. No, the war actually costs the memory of loss, the great deal of melancholic sense. Deep sadness, with million of innocent people must feel. From the eye of young brother and sister, they see them all, they feel them. Very unique perspective, that can make the leader of country think twice to decide war.As I thought before, war is just a chess game, which is played with the war lord. They must trade of their pieces, as they trade of the human lives. The pawn is like a soldier that fight in the front line. But the heart of the war is the civilians, as the back pieces.And again, the civilians view is showed by only one tragic story. Yeah, real affection in a deep message to the world. Amazing one!</fullReview>

This is a movie you don't want to watch again,not because it was rubbish or it was boring,its only because you don't want to cry again,not feel the pain again.

		<shortDescription>Well worth the watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet, melancholy tale of sibling love. My 12 year old has vowed to never see it again, (for reasons that would give away plot points) but I am sure she will come around when she matures a bit more. This is not a lighthearted film to watch and then forget about. This film will pull many different emotions out of the watcher. The fear and panic when your village is bombed. The bickering between siblings that have a sense of normalcy even during war situations. This movie shows the harsher side of the battle that happens to the people at home, struggling to survive bombings, lack of sustenance, and poor medical support. A sobering, thought provoking film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but sad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a grievous movie in all ways. I've never been so empty after a movie but yet still understanding. It feels like someone want to tear you apart and tries to make you feel as doleful as possible - BUT, this is what makes the movie so good. A great anti-war movie where fireflies becomes the potent symbol of fragile and beautiful life.However, the sadness and grief in the movie never gets to much - the only thing you think about is there must be away, there is always a way. With this sentence I leave you to watch this movie and hopefully you will "enjoy" it as much as I did, though enjoy can imply different things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films simply have it; that deep connective tissue between the audience and the main characters that make you care almost beyond bearing for them. To make you Care about their fates and their plight in a way that is truly rare and special. Grave of the Fireflies is among those films.Grave of the Fireflies is an incredible animated film about two siblings struggling to survive war-torn Japan during the tail end of World War II after being made orphans by the war. It is about their struggles, their plights, and their love for one another. It is also well known as being one of the saddest films ever made. It also might change the way you look at animated films.While the film is indeed incredibly sad. There are moments of beauty, levity and humor. The relationship between the siblings is treated with an unequaled tenderness. But because of how the film begins all of these moments occur under the shadow of inevitable tragedy and alter the way you will feel from these moments. The animation is beautiful. Showing off sweeping and awe-inspiring vistas of rural Japan. The film does a magnificent job of juxtaposing natural beauty and man-made destruction, which mirrors the relationship of the brother and sister ? beautiful but surrounded by tragic circumstances.One of the running themes of Grave of the Fireflies is the cruelty of indifference. While these children struggle to survive, the surrounding adults ignore them and offer little help. Some are even overtly cruel towards them, particularly the children's' Aunt, who seems only interested in using them for extra rations, and then treats them with disdain when those rations are no longer available. While the war is to blame for the circumstances that put these children in this position, society as a whole is equally to blame for allowing the selfishness that makes this story possible and believable. Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most devastating and emotionally affecting films I have ever seen. It has one of the most haunting conclusions I have ever seen. It is a film of such profound power that it can change the way you look at the world and increase the sympathy you feel for those around you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film that left me in tears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no choice but to give this animated masterpiece a 10 out of 10. I had never seen it when it came out and decided to get it. I had heard it was very sad, so I knew it might not be a kiddies movie. But boy was I taken on an emotional overdrive! The story so compelling about a young boy and his little sister trying to stay alive in war-torn Japan changed the way I feel about war and children as a whole. Any movie that could bring about such a profound change in me will forever be in the upper echelons in my favorite movie collection. Kudos to every single person involved in making the movie. The story so deep and the sadness even deeper. And even sadder still is that it happened during those dark years and still happening now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a beautiful sad dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is beautiful like a dream, yet has some of saddest emotions I've ever experienced from a movie. I usually don't cry in movies but this one had tears raining down my eyes. It has taught me to appreciate my life, my friends, and my family more. Even though it is animation, you walk away feeling like these characters were more real than most other live action characters you've watched. It is a powerful yet simple art anyone can understand. It doesn't try to blame the US or Japan, but instead we see the world through the eyes of these two innocent children. There is a lot of little details in this movie, details that we all have experienced but is often overlooked in other movies. This is what makes this movie so realistic. At times it feels almost voyeuristic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best (anti) war movies ever. There Will Be Tears.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie hit me like a ton of bricks. I was fairly new to anime at the time, I think I might have seen AKIRA before and perhaps one other title, Ghost In The Shell probably. In other words - nothing that could have prepared me for this... Went in knowing it was gonna be an anime, and that it was gonna deal with WW2 "in quite a serious manner I think", as one of my friends who was a bit more into the genre explained to me. Boy, was that an understatement. This movie is unbelievably strong and uncompromising in conveying it's vision to the viewer. So effective. The movie deals with terrible, terrible things. And I was completely devastated. Towards the end I was weeping openly in my seat. Afterwards, walking out, I felt mainly depressed, and kinda empty. But there was also a sense of "This is so messed UP!" and "We have to DO something!". Join an organization that is against nuclear weapons, join Amnesty, become Conscientious Objectors, whatever. One of the most powerful (anti) war movies I've ever seen. To this day still. It's animated, but don't let that scare you. It would be your loss, and a substantial loss at that. Give it a try even if you are not a fan of the format. This movie transcends it's genre effortlessly. Should be shown in schools. Exquisitely sad though, so there should be plenty of tissues handed out...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Story of What War Can Do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this on YouTube as I've heard about it before. To me the movie is sad with its powerful storyline about what war can do to families. Loosing a family member from death, starvation and survival. The animation and the music make the movie emotional too, especially the death of the boy and his baby sister. The animation is incredible. The lining colour and backdrop really made this movie great along with the storyline. Though I don't much like the Voice acting that much. The teenage boy sounds a bit bright for a movie like this, but it's not annoying as I know he sounds like that just to make his baby sister not too worried about her mother. The ending was nice too. It shows us the spirits of the two kids now looking at the modern city in Japan. Though I would love it if were the whole family being reunited together and enjoying their afterlife together as a family again. But seeing the two kids was emotional to see and a nice way to end a great movie. The creator says that the movie that it's not an anti-war film but I think the theme shows what war can do to a family. It breaks them apart by death and starvation. The movie is a great one and definitely deserve a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Beautiful animated feature, about a brother-sister and their lost family, set toward the end of WWII when Japan is under constant air raids.The story has been told in a flashback by Seita's (brother) spirit. The essence of the movie forbids war and it basically shows how a society pays for a war, how innocence (read young Sutsiko) suffers.One might argue technically movie is not as accomplished as some of today's animated features but that would be a folly as there is a unique liveliness in the 80's animation and the background music compliments it perfectly ? rendering it extraordinarily moving.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is sad, but that can be a beautiful feeling too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, it is a sad and emotional movie, but at the same time a beautiful one.Lately, I have been trying to watch all the Studio Ghibli movies, and this one was the next on the list. It definitely looks and feel different from the other movies of the Studio (it does not have all those fantasy characters and worlds, it tries to portray reality), this is probably because this movie is directed by Isao Takahata and not Miyazaki.I believe every person might take this movie in a different way, based on personal experiences. I took it as an example of the sacrifices you can make for somebody you love (in this case Seita's fraternal love for Setsuko), and how this love sometimes can lead you to make mistakes, such as was the case of Sentai, where he tried to do what his sister wanted and not what she needed.I do think it has an anti-war message (although I think it is not the principal theme of the plot), it end up being the background of these 2 kids journey. The animation is not as good as other Ghibli films (it is from 1988!), but still manages to portray properly the attitude of a stubborn teenager and the way of acting and innocence of a 4 year old.To sum it up. It is melodramatic, yes, but that is just a tool to deliver it's message. It personally reminded me of the way me and my sister interacted when we were kids, always looking after each other, and how that type of love and interaction with your family should never change, because our life is pretty short (as the fireflies).Score (8)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first watched the film, I had no idea about it. Me and my friend ordered a pizza and we just wanted to watch a fun movie while eating. Some other friend of mine gave me the movie earlier. It being an animation film, we though it would be light and would go with the mood. So we started it and was not really paying attention at first. But that did not last long. Within fifteen minutes or so our whole attention was in the movie. Around the middle of the movie when Seita was laughing I was on the verge of crying. I couldn't because my friend was there. (Later on she admitted the same)Being the older sibling in my home, I felt the complete helplessness and agony of Setsuko. The film gives an extremely strong anti-war message without even directly pronouncing it. It is completely devoid of propaganda, moral advice or blame politics unlike many other typical war movies. It is my all time favorite animation film, if not all time favorite movie. And I'm angry because it did not get the awards it more than deserved while some very ordinary and mindless movies are getting the same.I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most heart-wrenching, achingly sad movies out there.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people look at animated movies, it's not strange for them to dismiss them. Many people see these movies as nothing more than "kid's movies", and immediately turn to something more "mature." It's a shame many of these animated movies are overlooked as so, as a lot of them are fantastic pieces of film. Grave of the Fireflies can be included in this latter statement. One of Studio Ghibli's lesser known gems, Grave of the Fireflies is fantastically written and directed by Isao Takahata, and manages to be one of the best anti-war movies, and animated movies, of all time.Grave of the Fireflies is a rather deep and emotional film. The movie follows a semi-autobiographical story about two siblings in World War II -era Japan: Seita, a 14 year old boy, and his four year old sister, Setsuko. Living in a time of constant air raids and bombings, these children, as well as everyone else in the city of Kobe, have it rough. Food must be rationed, and supplies are hard to come by.After their mother is mortally wounded and killed in one of the many firebombings experienced in the city, Seita and Setsuko, emotionally wounded by the death of their mother, live with their cruel and unforgiving aunt for a short time. She refuses to ration their rice meals fairly, keeping most of it for herself. Seita and Setsuko then decide to leave and live on their own in the country.Grave of the Fireflies is a punishingly emotional film, and with good reason. Unlike the more whimsical films Studio Ghibli would create in the future, Grave of the Fireflies is more grounded and down-to-Earth. The tale of Seita and Setsuko is essentially one of survival, and, although a few scenes go by slowly, the plot and characters are interesting enough to keep you hooked for an hour and a half. By the time the ending sneaks up on you, you'll be crying like there's no tomorrow.The movie overall is basically an anti-war movie. Grave of the Fireflies tells just how bad the victims of World War II had it. The movie doesn't make Japan the good guys, or America the bad guys (in fact, you don't see any Americans other than the planes); it tells how, sometimes, the enemies of war can be your fellow citizens and townsfolk.Like other Studio Ghibli works, Grave of the Fireflies is wonderfully animated. Environments are very well detailed, making everything crisp and enjoyable to look at. Takahata takes the time to show small little objects in between certain shots: maybe a flower in one, and a firefly in the next. Even the most minuscule details, such as the planes flying overhead and the flames burning in the streets after a bombing, are hauntingly beautiful. The characters themselves also look great. It's especially cool, and saddening, how the characters look when they cry; seeing the tears slowly build up in their eyes is chilling. Grave of the Fireflies is one of the most heart-wrenching, achingly sad movies out there. Even though it's release was 25 years ago, the fantastic animation and saddening plot and characters make this worth watching once, even if you can't handle a second screening of this wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was putting off this film for the right moment given that everyone was telling me how sad it was and those people were absolutely correct. Part of the reason for this was due to the film being so understated and this just adds to its beauty. The story is simple and by no means is that a bad thing, if it were a grandiose one it would have much less of an impact on us as viewers. A criticism charged at this film is that it is one sided and this is a fair comment except... What more do you expect? The film was a display of what young Japanese people felt at the time of the war. Which is refreshing from the usual war time films. That isn't a criticism of classic war films, it is merely a comparison. Finally, the art work for the film - as usual for Ghibli Studios - is absolutely beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Heart Cries........:-(</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film proves without any doubt that animation isn't just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seita and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II. The greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko's sobbing or illness, it doesn't force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It's completely honest to it's own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don't need to see anymore. Another of it's strengths is that it really doesn't comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Animation, equally great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An enjoyable, lovable, and depressing film. The story and characters develop slowly, but effectively. (I'm going to try my best to avoid writing spoilers for my first review; spoilers honestly defeats the purpose of this review) The movie focuses on a beautiful relationship between a young brother and sister. They do everything a typical child probably does; they play, they learn and read, and help out at home. But during the fire-bombings of Japan, they are forced to abandon their typical lifestyle as they deteriorate from abuse from their neighbors, family, and their own pathetic struggles to survive during the war. As the kids realize and succumb to their own desperation and struggles, I just couldn't stop crying.What makes the movie brilliant is its animation. Sure, it could easily be done with live action, but there's so much that could be done in animation; The character look ironically cheerful; emotions are dramatized as tears are enlarged 10 times. The houses burning down are slowed down; they aren't graphic, but they reveal the severity of Axis Japan's situation.As a 16 year old, I've watched a whole lot of films. Not all of them are good, and even fewer animated movies break out of the shell that they are made "just for kids." But out of all the movies I've seen, this is honestly one of the best. It is emotional, powerful, and unforgettable. I can't explain the magnitude of the movie's greatness, from the scenes that make me smile wryly to the scenes where I sob uncontrollably; It'd be best to experience the movie instead.</fullReview>

The author of the book on which the film is based drew in part upon his personal experiences with firebombing of Japan during WWII. I almost never cry during a film, but I cried during this one.

		<fullReview>Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli has churned out consistently high- quality 2D animation in the last few decades. Grave of the Fireflies is a lesser-known Studio Ghibli production. As per any Studio Ghibli film, the animation is top-notch 2D, lovingly hand-drawn and the story is simple but relevant. Fireflies tells the story of a brother and sister who are orphaned after their village is bombed during WW2. We follow them as they face their struggles; from living with an unsympathising relative to making a home for themselves in a couple of crevices on the river bank. As the days go by things get more and more desperate for the siblings, as food gets scarce and illnesses start to take their toll. What I like about Ghibli's movies is that they're astonishingly brave; there's no comfort zone here, nothing's sugar-coated. The final scene tugs at the heart- strings and will stay with you for a long long time.</fullReview>

However i discovered a masterpiece, a movie that even after 2 years and more than 18 time played i could not take out of my mind. The characters are so pure, the story so real, the art so genuine that i instantaneously fell in love. Happy ending or not does not matter, it is what it is: The 8th wonder of the world.I have watched thousands of movies but none have ever touched me like this one. I recommended it to everyone i know and everyone either cried out of sadness or out of love for Takahata.Grave of the fireflies is more than a story or a message or an ending. The characters are real, the feelings are there, the war is present, the sadness all around. You will laugh and cry at the same time and you will still wish you could change the story every time you see it. The good news is, you can. All around us are stories like this that want to be found, we just have to look for them.I hope one day ET will learn from it what the human race couldn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film but is NOT DEPRESSING OR VIOLENT AS PEOPLE SAY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While there may be films that I don't yet know about, I can say that Grave of the Fireflies is BY FAR THE MOST POWERFUL movie I've ever seen. But I am surprised that this movie is so misinterpreted even by those who praise it.First off, this movie is NOT outright depressing. Based on other reviews you'd expect to be be completely struck down by grief from beginning to end. This is simply not true.What people probably mean is that this movie reaches you at a emotional level that other films do not by making you care about the two characters.Second, contrary to popular belief, there is actually very little blood or violence in the film. The most graphic thing you will see is the body of a woman who has been badly burned by the firebombing. And even in this case, the body is mostly covered in bandages and shown only briefly. Overall, the presentation of the film is very beautiful and tranquil. The animation is colorful and simple, like Totoro or Howl's Moving Castle.Other than these two points, I agree with the praise this film has received. I have honestly never met anyone who has seen this film and not loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most powerful anime ever created</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm usually not the sort to be "moved" by a movie, therefore the prospect of an anime being able to sadden me was one I dismissed. However, I could not have been more wrong."Grave of the Fireflies" made me feel more empathetic, more saddened and more "moved" than any other film to date. Visually, Studio Ghibli have done tremendously well as always with their animations. However, the soundtrack of this movie is what I found most striking; every instrumental is moving and ensures that the action on-screen is incredibly engaging.In addition to this, the characterisation is incredible. Every relationship and interaction between each and every minor and major character throughout this movie is believable and honest. I have never felt deep empathy or such a care for characters in any movie before (or at least not to this extent).Perhaps what makes this movie so powerful and haunting is the brutal honesty throughout. There are no subtleties when exhibiting the costs of war; just hard-hitting portrayals demonstrated by characters that are all wonderfully easy to relate to - despite their predicaments.What prevents this movie from being perfect in my view, is the ending. I wont go into detail as I do not wish to include spoilers, however I was just left feeling a little unsatisfied and unsure what to think.Overall, this movie is a must-see. Not only is it the most powerful anime ever created, but one of the most powerful movies ever created. "Grave of the Fireflies" is engaging yet haunting and moving yet saddening. If you have a tendency to shed a few tears during sad films, this will have you weeping throughout. An unmissable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a fairytale-ish melancholic tearjerker. Oh yes, this film could make you cry, and it *is* beautiful - but most of all, it's desperately tragic. It's a combination of beautiful imagery, strong storytelling and soul in the characters that really pulls you into the film.I rarely watch anime and it took some time to adjust to it in the beginning. However, as soon as the story was rolling, I was hooked and I didn't care about it anymore. Although I'd like to see this as a live action film, there's undoubtedly a beauty in these drawn scenes. What I love the most are the scenes with the fireflies...The relationship between Seita and Setsuko is also one of the most touching parts of this film. Despite their hardships, they stick together, creating little happy moments and stealing little smiles here and there. This film, ultimately, reminded me to be grateful about my own life and try to enjoy little pleasures in this world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched it thinking it to be another animation movie, with a cheerful end. But, I was wrong.The movie not only depicts the hardship the children went through during the wars but also showed a very touchy and human side of the relation of a brother and sister. I am still at loss of words recollecting each scene from the movie.The struggle for food and shelter the basic necessities of life has be so touchingly depicted. Getting happiness out of small things in life which we tend to ignore and never value has been touched.This has to be one of the most brilliant animated movies ever made. It made me very sad but at the same time I am happy that I got to watch it. It's really a work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was first skeptical when I was going to see this. I really liked Spirited away and was afraid that this would not be as good as Spirited Away. I do not think this is as good as Spirited Away, yet it is equally as good. Seita is an orphan who tries to provide for his four year old sister and himself. It takes place towards the end of world war II in Japan. Air raids are everywhere. The newly orphaned kids mother passes away from the air raids. Yet, they are not alone. Instead, they go stay with their aunt to tries to provide for both her own family and the two orphans. This movie is made with Japanese Anime, and done beautifully so. This seemed like a subject that could have been hard to do in Japanese anime, but they pulled it off. There were some gore in it, but it is just for a couple of moments or two. There were some very sad moments that could make a few people cry. One being when the little girl dies at the end. That was such a sad and emotional moment that was dealt delicately. A terrific world war II movie that deserves to be called "a classic"10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is hell, especially for children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally decided to write a review after reading other peoples reviews for past few years because this animation deserves it. I won't include the plot in my review since almost every other reviews contains brief plot.First of all, this is the second anime that actually made someone like me to cry (first one was Clannad, which I recommend all anime fans to watch, also I think I should note that not a single movie made me cry, although Steven Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence almost did).There were many beautiful, happy and sad scenes in this anime, but I'll point out few that made me drop tears: 1. When Seita came back to the shelter they were living and find his sister Setsuka trying to eat a marble thinking that's a fruit droplet(most likely due to hallucination caused by her disease) and dies after saying "Thank you". It seemed me to that Setsuka's consciousness became clear for a moment before her death and the "thank you" means "Thank you for caring for me all this time brother, you've done more than enough", also it's so sad that Seita didn't seem to realize this meaning of his little sister's last words.2. The scenes before Setsuka's cremation, about her, playing around the shelter alone waiting for his brother to come, trying to overcome her loneliness and sadness unconsciously by keeping her mind occupied, even playing paper-scissor-rock with her own reflection on water was so unbearably sad to watch.This is my very first review and I'm not a native speaker who learned basic English from subbed animations and movies, so I bet my review is quite poor, but I hope people will understand my point and find it a little helpful</fullReview>

This film is not just about the horrors of World War II. This film is about a teenage boy Seita and his kid sister Setsuko and how they struggle to live during the war-torn times. This film is about the innocence of the little girl and the growing maturity of her brother. The love between the two is unconditional and so pure that it lingers on in your mind even days after you have watched the film.This film never tries to be pleasing to the audiences. It is to-the- face, blatant.I recommend the viewers to watch it in Japanese with English subtitles.This is definitely not a children's film.This is the best animated film I have ever seen and I feel each of us should watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Grave of the fireflies' is a kind of movie which makes you shed tears every time you watch it, or even think about it. The brutal and in-your-face style of portraying events really makes this movie a truly heart-breaking experience.I have never rated a movie with the whole 10 points. This was the only one. Because, no other movie has stayed with me and has twisted my heart in as many ways as GOTF did. I hadn't known about any other works of studio ghibli. But after I had seen this one, I made up my mind to check them out.What makes this movie so disturbing is the events and the close exposure they give to very innocent and very devastating aspects of life almost simultaneously. The contrast between them is as painful as the contrast between a blinding bright light and a blood curdling darkness. The story is about the atrocities faced by a young boy, Seita and his little sister Setsuko in a village in Japan. The time is World war 2. The animation is typical-Japanese and is very effective. The story is told very well; so well that its almost impossible not to get uneasy and cry. In the 90 minute length of this movie, not even a minute goes by without making you fear and hate war, the most dehumanizing act we humans commit.Watch this movie and understand how bad and how fragile life can get and how hard, how stupidly and sincerely our love and hope keep fighting for survival. Interpret this movie in any way you want. I'm sure it will not be so pleasant.Simply, a must-watch. It deserves to stand in the history of movie-making along with other classic war movies like Schindler's list, though they are both different and effctive in their own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching and sad story about survival during wartime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(ENG dub, ENG sub)The story is about two young children; Seita, a young teenager, and his little sister Setsuko, around 4. Due to air raids their village gets burned down and they've to abandon their house. With their mother soon passing away because of heavy burns and their father in the navy, the two become orphans. They move in with their aunt, who rather soon starts to act cruel and give them less and less food. Being unwelcome and criticized, Seita decided to move once more and they choose the caves on the hills as their new house. There, they enjoy the light of the fireflies. But as the war continues, food becomes scarce. Pure out of desperation to feed Setsuko and himself, Seita starts stealing crops. But unfortunately the health of Setsuko is deteriorating fast due to malnutrition. Her smiles and laughs are gone; instead she becomes more and more quiet?The emotional story unfolds itself very slowly. A lot of effort is put in the seemingly unimportant events, which gives the characters more depth. It's great to see how Seita copes with the situation at hand. He has to be strong, not only for himself, but also for Setsuko. It's rare to see so much beauty in an animation. There are some breathtaking and dramatic scenes, which I won't spoil of course. It's safe to say, this animated movie will move you, it's that real!My score: 9 out of 10 My rating: PG or 6 (NL)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm, beautiful, and undeniably tragic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know that a movie is going to be a downer when the main character dies in the opening scene...Two Japanese children, Seita and his sister Setsuko, are left orphans when their mother is killed in the firebombing of Kobe. Their father earlier sails off to sea aboard a warship and is presumably killed in action (although that is never confirmed). The two children are eventually left upon their own when food shortages force their own aunt to abandon them. The children at first find their newfound freedom exhilarating, but the carefree adventure turns increasingly scary as food ultimately runs out and the food-strapped locals have none to offer. Eventually, little Setsuko dies of malnutrition and her own brother has to cremate her remains. I challenge any viewer to not shed a tear when Seita carries out that duty with a somewhat dazed stoicism...Unlike Reiji Matsumoto's rather offensive film, The Cockpit, this film does not depict the war in a romanticized manner. The war itself is distant, and even the B-29s dropping firebombs upon Kobe are depicted with an almost graceful beauty. I was also surprised that the film was not anti-American in the slightest. The only scene which might imply otherwise is when an American plane strafes a line of refugees (apparently out of mistaken identity). The film also avoids either depicting or mentioning the atomic bombings, either out of cultural sensitivity or simply to avoid weakening the story's focus.All in all, I strongly recommend Grave of the Fireflies, with it's message of hope and beauty even in the face of great sadness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic. One of the best animated films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is impossible to watch GotF and not feel sad at the end. This film is so beautiful, and yet so heart-breaking, that it has to be one of the greatest animated movies in history. Disney is good and all, but the death of Mufasa &amp; Bambi's mother and Snow White's funeral, while pretty saddening, are not as gut-wrenching and endearing as the masterpiece that is Grave. Set in Kobe, Japan at the end of World War II, the story tells of a teenage boy (Seita) and his 4 year-old sister (Setsuko) as they struggle to survive after their mother was killed in an air raid. A story such as this is undoubtedly going to ultimately turn out tragic, and it does. Not wishing to spoil anything, however, I shall not go into details, but to see Seita taking care of Setsuko, something which becomes increasingly difficult, does nothing more than make you feel for both of them. This is no typical Hollywood romantic love story; this is a story of love between a boy and his sister, which makes one feel for them even more. The animation, the music (notably the song "Home Sweet Home"), everything is as it should be. Nothing more to be expected from the great director Isao Takahata. If you do not like tragic films, then maybe this isn't for you. If that is not the case, then watch it. The experience is nothing short of beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the saddest movie I ever saw...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is one of the saddest (if not, SADDEST) movie I ever saw and I have seen a lot of movies. Even though you know from the start that it is going to be a tragedy, you still can't help but feel sorry for the 2 main characters. I brawled my eyes out when little Setsuko died because the scene is so powerful, it evokes emotions like never before. Part of it is because throughout the film, we get to know the two main characters deeply. Their actions are like any typical pre- teenager/toddler and you really feel for them or even think that you know them. And it is with dread that you know it can happened to anyone if you are in their situation. The film succeeds in telling us how cruel war is and ultimately, the ones who suffer the most are the innocent (particularly children. It should sent a strong message to people who glorify war because there is nothing glory in war. Only blood, gore and hunger. I urge everyone to see this film at least one and I can be sure (at least for a while), you will not think that winning a war is glory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic, emotional film everyone should see, if only once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I'm anything but macho, I have yet to cry at any film. I came close with this one. It is brilliantly orchestrated tragedy based around a brother and a sister trying to survive in war-torn Japan. The whole film is basically a struggle for them as they lose their parents, then they leave their oppressive aunt and stay in on old bomb shelter begging, borrowing and stealing to stay alive. The animation, as in any Studio Ghibli film, is fantastic, the beauty of it reflecting that of the deep but playful relationship between the brother and sister.Here's the tragic part and the spoiler- the brother ventures into town to buy his sister, who at this point is at death's door due to malnutrition, leaving her in the shelter. He comes back to her and excitedly starts to unpack the food telling her of all the stuff he's got and how things will be better from now on. As he places a fruit drop- his sister's favourite sweet in her mouth, she utter's her last words, "thank you" and then dies. I probably haven't sold it with this description but this moment is heart-wrenching.There are a couple of flaws- firstly i never understood why the brother didn't immediately go into town to get food and save his sister from dying? Secondly, we are told right from the first scene, which is the last scene, a trick of Tarantino's, that the brother also dies. Why did we need to know that? And lastly, the reaction of the townspeople to the sister's death is all too cavalier- "need some coal to burn your sister's body? Here you go, have a nice day!" But that's nit-picking. It's an amazing film which you should check out, if only once- no real rewatch value there.</fullReview>

Again, the Japanese psyche is always trying to deal with WWII, and this movie gives so much emotional weight to the destruction that war causes, regardless of what side you are one.One cannot say that animation movies do not get you emotionally involved until you see this film. From the opening sequence, so craftly done, to how it all ties in at the end, this movie will pull at your heart.Especially as it nears the end, when all hope is lost. Yes, there is not much hope in this film, as the circumstances get graver and graver till literally, all is lost. But in that sadness, the characters live on, and nothing is left to sugar coat the truth.I give this film a 10 out of 10, because it left me speechless.</fullReview>

I knew that the Main character, the mom, the dad, and his sister was going to all die. BUT I still was emotional. I thought i was ready for this movie since I watched war movies like Valkyrie, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,and Life is Beautiful. However this one made me the most emotional since I knew what was going to happen. The part where the main character was burning her sister was real painful to watch. Maybe because I watched it in Japanese that it was so emotional, but many American viewers say that they cried too so they must of done a good job in translating. I would recommend this movie to people who wants to cry because they are too happy in their life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it: it's an experience like no other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's terribly sad, and you if you read the other reviews for this film here in the IMDb you will be certified by that, but I have to tell you that the most important is how beautiful and honest this movie was made and how it can really move in a way that you rarely seen. It's a Japanese movie, so many aspects that most people are used to is to watch a movie without knowing how it is going to end. Looking for a big climax, and, of course, after all the suffering that the characters are going to go through a happy ending. But, this movie is about the scars that the war left for a proud and defeated country, and more tragically, to the people of this country, and therefore it's unlikely that it ends well for our characters. And the main character of the movie is going to leave this message pretty clear right at the start of this movie informing the viewer that he died, alone in the platform of a train station , from what it seems from starvation, and in shame by the people that pass by him.The main character, Seita, is teenage boy that it truly can be recognized as a hero. He lives with his mom and little sister, Setsuko, in a village that it's getting bombed by American airplanes, and then they need to flee from their home. From there, you start to watch the struggle that this boy goes through to live and to lookup his younger sister. I can't tell here the series of terrible situations because it would spoil the story too much, but I need to tell you the reasons why this is a so must see film. You will not find in another film a history of a love between brothers so innocent and authentic as you going to see in this movie, and by the end of the film you will be probably be feeling that you lost a younger brother yourself. You will start to wonder how things could have been any different. What you would have done in his place to survive and take care of this little girl with her 4 to 5 years in the middle of a place that was burned to the ground and where the people were also struggling to survive on their own? If a movie can inflict these kinds of questions into your consciences then you know that it is a one of a kind experience. I consider that a filmmaker that plans and create a movie that has the capacity to indulge the viewers to this kind of feelings, whatever is filmed with real actors or animated, then I know that as an artist this person succeeded, because isn't this the true meaning behind the concept of "art"? Aren't the stories that a person tells to the other, however it be, if it's through a chat, or written in paper, or in a theater, or drawn into something, one of the most impressive abilities of human being can do? This is how remarkable it was to me this movie, it's truly special. Adult and serious animes sometimes appears with some really good stories, but with Grave of the Fireflies it's even more than that, it's a very emotional story mixed with an excellent production, especially for the actors that dubbed the original version of this movie that transmits such a realism to the scenes that gets into your soul. It's this impressive. It's more than a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Love Story of a Kind...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is probably one of the best, saddest movies I've ever seen. I had been warned to get the tissue box out, but in all honesty, I didn't find the movie that sad or depressing. I mean, I cried a couple of times, and it's quite hard NOT to cry at times, but I was so worried it would be too much for me when it wasn't. Like, I can tell you that I'm known to cry at the drop of a hat, but I was expecting me to forever be depressed by the film, which kind of scared me at first! Before watching this movie, I had read a review which mentioned that the opening 5 minutes were the saddest of the whole film. Now, when you're watching it for the first time, you kind of wonder how you can say that, as you don't really understand what's happening yet. But because this movie was SOOO good, I had to watch it a second time, and when I re-watched the start, I realised how sad it was.But this movie was so touching for me because Seita cared so much for his sister, and was willing to sacrifice everything for her. It's a love story of a kind and I completely felt for the 2 orphans after their parents passed and their aunty was so harsh to them. The thing that mad my cry out loud (and will probably make me cry every time I think about it) was at the end after Setsuko had died, and there were all the flashbacks of her. That was truly depressing.All in all, this is probably the best love story I've seen, and I would be happy to watch it over and over again on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely heartbreaking masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie last night and I am still upset just thinking about it. This heart wrenching look at the aftermath of WW2 tells the story of two orphaned children and their struggles to survive. It is much deeper than any other animated picture I've ever seen.This is definitely a departure for Studio Ghibli. It is rather dark and bleak compared to most of their other movies. Although sad, it is still a very wonderful movie. And by sad, I mean it is SAD. I cried a few times during the movie ,but I sobbed my eyes out for the last fifteen to twenty minutes and I'm not ashamed to say it.I applaud the unflinching look at the way war hurts everyone, but especially those the most forgotten during war, the children. I was inspired by how selflessly Seita cared for his little sister. Through the good times (they did have some believe it or not) and the bad, he put her well-being before his always. It is a love story, although not the way one would usually think of.As hard as it is to watch at times, I recommend everyone to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hotaru no haka / Grave of the Fireflies is the only movie made me cry for more than 15 minutes. This movie talks about a 14 year old boy and his 4 year old sister... The name "Grave of the Fireflies" says the whole story line in a single line. I really don't wanna to give a review for this movie, i just wanna to tell how i felt while watching this master piece.i was a bit sick of watching some of these DOOM DOOM, BANG BANG, KICK KICK &amp; 110 minute sh*t and 2 minute twist movies..(i like watching them 2) but this was !! huh amazing. Watching this movie was like a sizzling sail in a smooth cold river... you can laugh along.. you can think along(specially face palm for WAR!!) &amp; finally for the last 15 mins you can CRY!!!(tip - if you are using a DVD after the last 15 mins watch again the first 7-10 mins for an extended depression!!) i would say watching this movie was experience for me and it was fabulous,Totally it didn't feel like an animation..characters were amazingly realistic and i gave 10/10 ten for its course and full filling its course in a tremendous way.p.s-don't miss it!p.s.s-watch it in peace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film just changes everything, the way my life was and the way I used to think of it. I believed in isolation, and enjoying life at thousands of miles away from home. This movie just reminded me that there is no point of success or anything if I cant stay and share it with my family. I will be going back soon to stay with my family so that I don't miss the moments that was taken away from those two kids by war. Grave of the fireflies tells a story of courage, love for life and family in the midst of brutal war. The tears that we get at the end are the pearls, which we, ourselves did not know were hidden in us. Little Setsuko calls you back to those childhood days and cling to those moments that are not going to come back. Little Setsuko calls for food and help not only from Seita but for all the brothers who watch it and asks to protect their loving family from all these mishaps. I will surely watch it again, but not now,because Setsuko will stay in me for long for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful experience..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the fireflies is a fascinating animated story revealing the horrors of war. It is a movie so powerful that it is hard not to get emotionally choked up at the end of the movie (speaking through experience). It tells the story of a teenage boy along with his five year old sister made homeless by the bombings during the World War. They become separated from their mother during an air raid only to find out her dead a few moments later. Their father is a naval officer serving for the country in hostile waters. With no other place to go Setsuko (5 year old girl) under the loving care of her brother Seita, settles in their aunt's house. As time passes their aunt complains about Seita not doing anything to earn food, and starts treating them cruelly. Eventually the two siblings find themselves a cave to reside despite its poor conditions. Here he does whatever he can to feed himself and his sister, while acting as a father figure to her. This desperation to live; fabulously brought to screen will move you beyond anything imaginable. One of the greatest gifts this film has is its ability to show the emotionally draining scenes in an effective manner. We first get to see the playful, cute and cuddly Sestuko having fun only to see her lying helplessly due to starvation. I shouldn't write further for it might spoil the surprises. No other movie has moved me so deeply than "Grave of the fireflies". It is a masterful creation to be watched, dissected and most importantly to be learned from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favorite Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seen Grave of the Fireflies early this year and i can't get the movie off my mind.I guess the reason i can't forget about it the way the movie unfolds before your eyes.You know in the first minute of the movie that the characters died.The really heartbreaking thing is the way Seita's and Setsuko's spirits have to relive their last few months of their life.The Happy scenes really are misleading into giving viewers false hope that maybe just maybe they will pull through.The beach,fruitdrop,firefly and bath scenes really can't prepare you for the last 12 minutes of the movie.I tired to blame the Seita character after all he is partly to blame for Setsuko's passing,realizing he was only really still only a child himself how really could i pass judgement on a boy Seita's age,would i do the right thing? He did the best any 14 year old could do under the conditions.Setsuko is the character that is really dear to my heart and it really saddened me when she passed.The character is to me one of the most endearing characters in movie history.Some may say i'm nuts,but that is how much Setsuko touched me.Anyone would be heartless not to be moved by the little flashbacks of Setsuko playing in and around the bomb shelter while waiting for Seita.Finally her cremation when Seita takes his last lingering look at Setsuko,the look of devastation in his eyes is just heartbreaking.Lastly Isao Takahata should be praised for the this profound and precious film.I will even go as far as to compare him to the great Japanese director Yasujiro Ozo.Takahata has given the world a heartbreaking masterpiece that many will cherish for years to come.I think i'm a better person for having seen it.</fullReview>

It was very emotional and moving unlike most world war two films it was sad but you can image it being a true story as families were split up and destroyed through the 2nd world war. I was crying when the credits rolled my eyes were leaking uncontrollably I wasn't sobbing or crying but just unable to stop my eyes from tearing. I'm so glad I watch it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I found it so damn sad! But at the same time I would love to heard my friends comments about it to see if they cried too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is the best film (animation) i have ever seen i would recommend everyone to watch it. the message the film gives is very important. the fact it is an animation which gives out such strong emotions which are very realistic makes the film fantastic. Many people feel that the film gives a strong anti war message, i agree with this. Further more the film shows how society behaves in times of desperation and how humans are selfish. If seita was not full of pride his sister would not have died. if his aunt had been more understanding, seen seita as being stubborn then she should not have continued to hassle him and maybe both of them would have not died. the fact that the farmers had so much food and when seita said his sister needed the food they should have given him some. the saddest part of the film i found was when the little girl made food out of mud and ate it, that brought tears to my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many others, I was emotionally destroyed by this film. I'm writing this a day after I saw it and my eyes are getting misty again. Surprising for a cynical old misanthrope such as myself. The character of the little girl is incredibly endearing and believable. While I was watching it, I wondered why such a gifted film-maker would tug at the audience's heartstrings in such an unrelenting, manipulative way. Then it became obvious - beneath the surface is a fierce, white-hot hatred of the politicians and military leaders who are willing to destroy lives in the name of ideals or "national interest". The absurdity of Japanese goals during WWII is made clear by the final shot. There is also some interesting implied criticism of the brother, who I feel was a symbol for well-meaning leaders who may have sound tactics but misguided strategies. If the welfare of others is in your hands, you'd better be not only well-meaning and honest, but smart. Maybe listen to people who know what they're talking about once in a while, instead of just going it alone.I caution anyone who is feeling fragile and depressed that if you're going to see this film, you'd better have some pretty good coping mechanisms. Especially if you have kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On November 12th, 2006 was the first time I ever saw this film and I must say, wow! Beautifully made and voiced. The directors and voice-actors make this film convincing. I was beyond moved and highly recommend this film to anti-war movement people and war hawks alike.If you are not in tears at the end of this film, then you are not human. I cannot get over this film and WILL show this to my high school government class when we discuss the cost of war.War is definitely not the answer!I am not a fan of Anime (I am a Warner Bros. stooge) and I have never seen a film about war that was so moving like this film. Compared to other WW II films, like "Saving Private Ryan," "Bridge Over the River Quai," and "Empire of the Sun," this film ranks equally or surpasses in both content and emotional impact. The author of the book and the makers of the film show how two children are impacted by war. I recall my great-uncles telling me very little about the Pacific campaign and how horrible, bloody, and tiring it was to them. They didn't say much about the war and I can understand why. It was a bad time for them and I could tell in their voice that this was a subject that they did not want to discuss. I cannot imagine being a child during war time and I only wonder at how horrifying the U.S. occupation in Iraq with all of the devastation that it brings must be to the little one's of Iraq.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A distraught experience that will leave you bereft of emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has often been quoted that films have a diversity of emotions and moods, with Grave of the fireflies I had the unfortunate duty of being over encumbered with the negative qualities of human life. Many war films inevitably depict the macabre account of three key aspects that are contradicted in the process of it's moral conclusion, those of course being survival, death and loss. This film's notion lucidly conveys the domino affect war causes and that the bullets go beyond the front line and pierce's the purity and innocence of youth. That being said Grave of the fireflies is a unique viewing, it's one of the few war films that observes the situation rather than criticize it.Rarely do you see soldiers or battles no the viewer is subjected to the darker spectrum of war such as famine and disease. The two protagonists Seita and Setsuko are a visage of the impact World War 2 has left on their society. In addition to this they are both characters you can sympathize with, Seita is very aware of his surroundings, however he remains optimistic and only periodically he is burdened with mental anguish, Setsuko on the other hand is a noble infant who's only catharsis is the death of their mother. The film is constructed similarly to a three point arc which brings me to my earlier statement the initiation being death, the median which is survival and the denouement being loss. A meticulously crafted film that equally measures the dream like qualities of humanity and the desecration of all things natural.</fullReview>

To keep it short and simple, it's one of those movies that make you ponder silently to yourself for a while when you're done watching it. It's real sad, and if they were ever to make a live action out of this anime, it would win countless Grammy awards. You should definitely watch it sometime because it will touch you deeply. People might think differently because it's animated. I, myself loved it because I've seen movies on WW2 where it's all about how America suffered, but this anime will broaden your view on what else was going on, not just Pearl Harbor. This is just my opinion, you'll just have to see it for yourself.</fullReview>

His father is a marine and the war has escalated to the point of daily air-raid sirens. With a bunch of unfortunate events, the boy and his sister try to survive.The film is really very touching, and you wont be the same again for a while after you've seen it. Several people have cried while watching this movie (though I didn't).I wouldn't say it is a movie suited for children, not because of the content, but because they will not appreciate the message as much as adults or teenagers.And I thought the end of 'Castle in the Sky' was sad...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This comment may contain spoilers, though it doesn't re-tell the story, there may be hints to certain things.Hotaru no Haka, or the grave of the firefly(/ies), is the perfect choice for everyone who want's to learn about the impact of war on mankind ... or in this case more specifically: on children who lose their parents because of war.One shouldn't watch this movie when in good mood, because the mood won't last the movie. Not even the first 5 minutes, when we see Seita the first time. The movie understands to effect one's feelings in a way one will never forget. I once read: "Anybody able to watch this movie without crying is no human being whatsoever" (meant metaphorically) and I think that it is the best way to describe the feeling of the movie altogether. Another thing I read, which describes the development of the feelings while watching the movie: "As the movie continues you will feel your throat being laced up tighter and tighter" The movie reaches this unique feelings by working with below-center shots that clearly show the position of these children in this world (a grey, grey sky and nothing in it and Seita in between), scenes that simply tear your heart apart (alluding to every scene Setsuko's in, especially at the end) when children cry for food and a topic that concerns everyone: war.But Hotaru no Haka doesn't start and say: We (the Japanese) feel that any country is responsible for anything. It remains neutral, keeping the topic to itself not expanding on what caused the war or the situation, but the effect it takes upon the people. Doing this, Hotaru no Haka doesn't halt to show any scene of cruelty. Burnt cadavers, fire mass-burials and children with the worst signs of malnutrition (and who doesn't feel bad seeing a malnourished kid?).Summed up: Great movie. I voted for it with 9 points because I think this movie's telling a great story and overbrings a great message. Anyone who's seen this movie will think twice about making a war-joke, or even wishing for it (therefore: very educational!). It's not 10 points because there are some allusions in the movie I'd have rather left out ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is actually the first 10 out of 10 that i've ever given. it's unbelievable. i recommend watching it with someone who will hold you when you cry, a box of tissues, and chocolate. it makes you want to die in the end, it's so sad. it is set during world war II, in japan. these two kids, sato and setzuko (sp?) try to make it on their own. watching this movie gives you the feeling that everything that is happening, is happening to you. it's not pity sobbing, it's flat out sobbing. i absolutely do not recommend watching this alone. it's way too much to handle. at one point in the movie, i almost turned it off because it was THAT sad. when they released the movie, they had the viewing of this movie, and immediately after the viewing of "my neighbor totoro" because they didn't want to send people home so completely depressed. you might want to do that. just rent them both and watch this one first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!! This is a story about the life of a little boy and his younger sister trying to survive during WWII in Japan after their mom is killed in an air raid. The little boy does everything in his power to keep his sister and himself sheltered and with enough food to survive to the next day, even if he has to steal it and put his life in danger for it. The first time I saw this film several years back I was amazed at how great it was. Just to think how people live during a time of war... I cried more than I did with any other movie I have ever seen. Not just for the sad parts, but the happy parts too. It was a really beautiful film that I can't compare to any other. Even if it is cartoon, you really feel what the characters are feeling! You feel their joy as well as their pain. I saw it again not so long ago and felt the same way I did the first time I saw it. I recommend this film to everyone, no matter what your age is. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of The FirefliesMade in Japan in 1988.Also known as 'Hotaru no haka' in JapaneseIs there any bond stronger than 'Love'??.Love which has so much depth that human beings never understand it fully Is there any crime greater than killing humans by humans??Grave of the Fireflies tells the story during World War 2.U.S bombers used such bombs against Japanese cities which creates fire storms.Among such cities was Kobe.It tells the story of Sieta a young teenager and his sister Setsuko who is 5 years old.Their mother is wrapped in bandage struggling in hospital.Their home,school everything burnt down Then starts one of the most beautiful and hauntingly emotional journey of struggle for survival And also embarks the faith of love between a brother and sister.Grave of The Fireflies is an animation flick.But the beauty of story is so much realistic that it leaves even a more powerful impact.The story of survival gets stronger and stronger as the movie moves on. They are given sheltered and food by a relative.But as we know our shadows even leave us in our bad times The brother and sister moves in a hillside cave and their survival story gets even strongerThe story is not only about survival and struggle but also the evil and ghostly effects of war. The story is about love and caring attitude which Sieta shows towards her little sisterThe biggest asset of the flick is that it never tries to be melodramatic but it moves like a poetry Some of the most remarkable moments include when they catch fireflies to light up their cave and next morning Sieta finds his sister burying those dead fireflies Another moment is that when Sieta tells her sister that their mother is in hospital and she starts crying For a moment he keeps quiet and then starts rolling trying to make her sister laughBut the most impactfull and tearjerking moment comes when Sieta brings many things for her sister to eat while she is ill and founds that her sister had made 'rice balls' of 'mud' and asks him to have it.This was one of the most 'Unforgettable' moment of cinematic experience.The truth,the beauty,the love,the struggle,the hunger and the soon the fate they are going to achieve all involve in this scene makes it 'One of the most haunting and depressing moments of a movie'As being made in Japan many people haven't watched this.But with release of English dubbed DVD it is reaching to more and more people. Watching it feels like a privilege.Grave of Fireflies is one of the most haunting war films.And in spite of being animated one can feel for the characters which is the biggest triumph of this flick.Elegance,tearjerking,sad and yet so much beautiful and cuteThis is the best animated movie which beats all animated movies without having special effects with its touching storyline.Moments and dramatic events are not forced to create impact.But the story moves with so much elegance that the impact is spellbounding.A story told so beautifully that can melt everyoneTo sum up this is the most humanly animated flick which has far more impact than most of our humanly flicks.One of the most beautiful and emotional flicks ever It's a film about death, but the film itself resonates with life. This is not only a flick this is a treasure10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well when I saw this movie I was duly impressed. This movie wasn't half bad. It had a really strong story. And Oscar Worthy Screenplay I might add.The story of this follows two young children in the closing days of WWII right up to October 9, 1945. (History buffs will know this as the time of the Great Divine Winds, that struck Japan that should have saved Japan from defeat. I wrote a big story on this) After losing their mother in a Fire-Bombing, Seita (voice of J. Robert Spencer) and his sister Setsuko (Rhoda Chrosite) try to survive. They go to live with their aunt, but the hospitality runs out quickly. (What a Bitch) Seita decides to leave his aunts home, and live in a bomb shelter (it's really more of a dugout-of-the-hill-side-type-area, not like a rock solid shelter) But as time moves on food becomes scarce, and Setsuko is slowly dying of malnourishment. Eventually she dies in her sleep, and Seita cremates her.The film is based on the True Story of Author Akiyuki Nosaka who lost his sister, to malnutrition during the War. He wrote "Hotaru no haka" (A Grave of Fireflies) in 1967 to come to terms with it. I do hate to say but I have gripes with it. Really it lacked in original music. A story like this, I was expecting a great Original Score. (Much like Samurai X: Reflection) But it just didn't have it. (To bad they didn't have Hans Zimmer) The animation, oh well not pleasing, but oh well. Real and good, so no need for the flashy Anime, and seeing it's age.Featured voices include: Chrispin Freeman, Veronica Talyor (breif) Dan Green (breif) And the ones mentioned above. So very very good dubbing quality, from a purely independent company.A pure tragedy, but a fulfilling story, make all the difference. It's a wonderful movie, you should see it. You will cry, so gather a box of tissues.I can't wait to get this on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. "Grave of the Firefies" Such a powerful film. I remember seeing it as an 11 year old, and crying my eyes out. I saw it again yesterday, and still tears come to my eyes. This is the story of a young boy and sister (Setsuko and Seita) living in Japan. They are struggling to survive as there are constant air raids due to World War II.They live in an abandoned shelter, and depend on each other.The little food they have is not enough to stop their on going hunger. They entertain themselves by playing with the fireflies nearby.This film shows the world just how terrible war is, and how it affects people. This really does open people's eyes to how some people live. Some people struggle to get food in their stomachs.A touching, powerful film which everyone needs to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story that teaches us a important Lesson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of Grave of the Fireflies I was interested in the movie to see what it was like for the innocent civilians of Japan and especially for the children during the American bombings of Japan. I feel that in order for all of us to kinder people we need to learn from both sides of the war. Here in America we hear about the attack on Pearl of Harbor, but what do the average American know about what happened over in Japan when we did the bombing? Nothing. This I believe is one of the best description of what they went through, my heart goes out to the innocent of Japan. I brought up what they went through to a friend and he was as cold as dry ice towards the innocent victims of the Japan people. I hope if there is one lesson that we can learn from this is, even if the Nation is hostile to another we must learn sympathy towards them or we all will end up like those children.

		<fullReview>I had no clue what kind of movie this was before I saw it. It completely threw me back and chocked me. It's been a very long time since I last got this emotional about a movie. I think it builds up the characters very well. You really grow attached to the kids and therefore their destiny is even harder to accept. The voices are very good as well. Setsuko has one of the best voices ever. After quickly hearing the English dubbed voices I'm extremely glad I had the Japanese sound on (eventhough I always do).To sum this up... Watch the movie alone and you'll be in for a very very shocking yet lovely experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest war dramas of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always been a great avid reader of the Japanese retreating struggle and the ultimate defeat of world war 2.I had read the user reviews and downloaded this movie from a bittorrent file.This is without doubt the most emotionally heartbreaking film of all time.The piognancy of the siblings struggle to survive the American bombings is elevated beautifully by an extraordinary background track.I had always read about kamikaze,kaiten and mass suicide attacks organized by Japanese in order to adapt to the superior allied firepower and wondered about the will of these amazing people(Japanese).After seeing this movie i realized that they were just victims of a cruel empire.They fought without hesitation for their emperor sacrificing their livelihood adopting extremist suicide tactics.But for what end.They were just driving themselves to extinction against an army with greater numerical and technical superiority for the sake of a meglomaniac(emperor hirohito).I have always been a great fan of anime like Naruto and FullMetalAlchemist,but they pale in comparison to the simplicity and directness of 'Hotaru no Haka'.An absolute masterpiece of an anime,A must see for anybody interested in seeing a different movie.This movie neither eulogises Americans nor Japanese.It just shows war from the viewpoint of a boy called setsuko.Just spare your time and watch this brutally honest film,I am damn sure you will not be disappointed.This movie is undoubtedly one of japan's greatest contributions to the movie industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quit simply one of the best animes that I have ever seen. As far as emotion goes, I don't think any real life actor or actress could have done anything even close. Just make sure that you watch it in Japanese with subtitles to get the full effect.Apart from the superb animation the story is very engrossing. The plot is simple. A brother and his baby sister are struggling to survive in war-time Japan. This movie will make your eyes water if you have a soul left. This in not your typical anime. There are no magic creatures or ridiculous guidelines. This is the horrors of war in your face. This is what happens when civilians are targeted in war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful War Drama in Anime Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Isao Takahata's Only Yesterday, Anne of Green Gables, and Pom Poko. These drama films cannot be compared with Grave of the Fireflies' extreme melancholy. War is reflected in the intense emotion that the viewers feel in empathizing with the two young and innocent protagonists. Its message is so potent since war is seen in the eyes of a child, and viewers feel its vicious impact when war considers its fragile victims. It is absolutely heart-wrenching, and every politician should see this film before declaring war against any country. This film will always remain fresh since its approach to war is so simple, that I began to realize how people look the other way and make war as a commercial endeavor. Takahata successfully makes his name unforgettable in creating such an anime masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend showed me Grave of the Fireflies and I was instantly moved by how tragically the movie started. I was shocked by how tightly the opening scene in the train station gripped me. More than a year after seeing the film, I can still feel it. I was told that the movie was very sad, but I effectively dismissed those comments as irrelevant as if they were coming only from those who cry easily. Once I began watching, though, I realized that 'Fireflies' was heartbreaking like no other. Grave of the Fireflies suits anime aficionados and newbies alike. The characters are well-developed and the animation is exceptional. If you have not seen it yet, then be prepared to watch a film with the potential to change you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fireflies and they died</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening sentence (which you would know the fate that will bestow on the main character) to the scrolling credit (which you then would have experiencing how it happened), you will find yourself in a journey that will likely wrench your heart, jerk your tears, change yourself no matter how subtly and at the same times reflect about the life itself (and everything in it). No, this is not a pretty show but one that shows you the reality of whatever war, how it effects children especially ones that so young and so unlucky. Yes, it's ugly. As someone mentioned in previous review, when fireflies died, no one even care their graves. And so are the children in the movie.I highly recommend this animation movie for people over 13 yrs old and especially adult. This is not mere animation, this is a brilliant visualization. It is so finely done (from the music to the graphic to the colors/composition) with a story that is so real and achingly sorrow. The theme is universal without mentioning a single country who responsible of the war.I don't think I am going to watch it again within a short time, but I will keep it in my desk and show it to my friends at anytime.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies had to be one of the most tragic films I've ever seen. If your new to anime, or don't like it I can guarantee that this movie is as real as any animation, with no giant robots or space invaders. Try to look past the enormous eyes and the non-interactive backgrounds and just focus on the characters and the story. Then you'll understand why I hold this movie in such high regard. This sweet story about a teenager taking care of his younger sister in a time of great tragedy, that is just so sad. The movie had some excellent scenes where the boy tried to cheer up his sister when he was struggling to control his own emotions himself. The story has so many great scenes where it's two children attempting to survive on their own. The true moral of this movie is: You can't beat the system. I have recommended this movie to all my film friends, and it's a very emotional film (I cried). Defiantly worth a watch.</fullReview>

It's not a movie for children, it deals with deep human feelings and it's got a very strong social appeal, because the whole thing happens during the World War II. It's incredible how the director was able to pass emotion with such a traditional animation process. I've seen the japanese version, subbed in portugese, and the audio is just amazing, the voices used, the music, etc.It's highly recommended for those animation enthusiasts.</fullReview>

It's the sadiest Japan animation movie I've ever seen, too sad to see it second time! I'd seen it in dormitory when I was a college student with my roommates, and many details I forgot. I remembered the little brother and sister were bullied by their only relative, their selfish aunt, if the ending could include she'd got deserved something bad, it would be better. She's so wicked for she steal their only one property, her sister's valuable Kimono, then saying something to force them leave their house so she didn't need to raise her sister's children. Bad blood! Seita is too young to know he must endure her unfriendly attitude, just 13 year old,he didn't think of life became very hard after he try to stand on own two feet. Some of you mentioned he had 3000yen? Oh my god! 3000 yen not only to compare USD 3000, it can't even compare NTD 3000!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Problems of Youth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of anime, this movie focuses very heavily on very general problems of youth with the war as a background. The two central characters is a fourteen-year-old brother and his four-year-old sister, who may sometimes be portrayed as being uncomfortably intimate. Orphaned by the war, the older brother struggles to make a decent living for himself and his sister.We find out at the beginning that the two are doomed to fail. The rest of the film is a flashback. What's at stake, then, is why or how they fail.It is in this respect that the film is surprising and very much worth your time. Don't expect the couple to die from invaders, shrapnel wounds, or other cliches of wartime heroism. Their failure results from a very believable combination of social indifference, psychological anguish, and quixotic naivete. The protaganists partly struggle for physical survival, but also to a very large part struggle for happiness, fullfillment of desires, and other idealistic goals. "Grave" asks, what is the cost of dignity?This movie is also very much worth your time if you're a fan of anime. Anime from "Akira" to "Princess Mononoke" has distinguished itself by containing cutting edge portrayals of the idealism and energy of youth, to the extent that the central male figure of these movies may come together to form an archetype of what is considered noble and admirable behavior. Only, in "Grave of Fireflies", idealism is shown to have its consequences. To me, this is why "Grave" stands out -- it is a clear-eyed examination of what exactly it means to be young and idealistic. And, this time, the answer isn't all that uplifting.</fullReview>

My japanese is so poor i couldn't tell him how i loved this movie, and all the others ( yes i've seen them all, now!) how it made me cry like never before, how i will never forget the first time i watched "hotaru no haka". I just felt very stupid, but happy to "meet" him at last.Though it's something that must have been written before, I remember some people around me found this movie horribly "pervert" and depressive. I think those people just don't want to watch the reality of war.I'll add i really did not like Nosaka's book. Consequently i have not finished it either. Nosaka does like scandal and perversion. Here in this film only beauty and sadness remains. Sickening incestuous relation between the brother and sister is unsaid. And that's precisely what's great about Takahata. He knows perfectly how to pick up everything he needs in stories which aren't his. And this is valid for all his movies. From "jarinko chie" to "my neighbour the yamadas". Not mentioning "Only yesterday"...Well, i wanted to do short, so please watch "grave of the fireflies" and make an opinion for yourself.

		<fullReview>I really don't know how to preface my impressions of this movie and how it affected me. This is an animated feature, but with none of the kitsch that Hollywood has inundated the genre with. The story deals with the plight of a young boy and his little sister when they are orphaned in wartime Japan. It's a simple narrative with very clear-cut characters, no multiple layers or gray shades operating here. The clean hand-drawn animation, which eschews flashiness for a consistent simplicity, gives immaculate credibility to the story. The characters are rendered beautifully with gestures and expressions that articulate their emotions and reactions in the most consummate manner - this is flawless work. The voice-work especially for the little girl Setsuko is so believable it's heartbreaking. The story, if I'd heard it on a third-person basis, would have probably struck me as melodramatic, but seeing it unfold - I suppose it caught me in one of those fragile moods ? I was in uncontrollable tears at so many moments in the film. I don't want to go into explicit description for fear of spoiling it for those who haven't seen the movie, but suffice to say that the film-makers don't try to force happy circumstances. Even now, when I think of Setsuko and recall the tone of voice in her various moods, it wets my eyes and I have to keep my throat down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well told story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a great movie about a boy and his young sister during WW2. It's a rather emotional movie, and it's often called one of the best anti-war movies ever. I don't buy that this movie is at all anti-war. It's much more of a personal experience than anything. This is a story about the human spirit. The film never seems to point fingers or lay blame.First off, this is indeed an extremely good movie. The story is great and the characters are very likable. The Japanese voices are spot on, even the girl. All the parts are well written, and very believable. Nothing seems stretched to the absurd.The art is simply beautiful. Fans of movies such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Mononoke will notice things feel very familiar, due to being these all being from the same studio. The colors range from dark and sad to bright and cheery, sometimes fitting with the mood and other times as a stark contrast to the reality around them.At any rate, it's a really good story and one that's hard to forget. It's well told, it's memorable, it's likable, and it's at times quite sad. If you're looking for something different and serious rather than the normally light-hearted crowd of anime, give this a shot. You won't be disappointed.- Rirath_com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most wholly depressing movie I think I've ever seen, Hotaru no haka (aka Grave of the Fireflies). It is an almost unbearingly beautiful and heartwrenching work of Japanese anime which tells the tale of a young boy and his toddler sister who are orphaned by the Allied assault on mainland Japan and struggle to survive, seemingly subsisting only on hope, love and denial.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not by any means a film critic, but my friend lent me a copy of this title, sincerely recommending it to me. Ok I've never really been into Japanese anime, but I tried it after being awed by Spirited Away. Grave of the fireflies was a film that touched a nerve, which I can't say a lot of films have done. You can really feel the characters in this, which is what makes it so pleasant and a joy to watch. It is a moving art piece, full of emotion and very tocuhing. By the way don't watch if feeling down. I loved it even more watching it second time round. If you haven't seen it yet, do now!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a rather big fan of animated films, I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I read the reviews by other people on IMDB but I was not fully prepared for what this movie was about.In this day and age when war is still rampant, seeing two orphans trying to survive when their entire village is in a state of panic was devastating.Having seen dozens of Anime films, this movie went beyond anything I have ever seen.The story line is strong and it was so easy to see the desperation that the characters felt. This movie is very emotionally charged and it shows why people around the world are against war for very good reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie though it is anime, makes more of a statement than any recent big budget, Hollywood, realistic (propaganda) war movies I've seen.The films heart is so relevant to the present day happenings in our world. I do not have any personal experience in times of war but It is easy to see that the real victims are civilians at the mercy of their government. Grave of the Fireflies is beautiful, touching ,and a ground breaking animation that will also break your heart. You will love this film if your are not afraid to feel. In order to kill people you must first dehumanize them. This film highlights the humanity of its characters showing both their strengths and weaknesses during times of war. But it delivers the message in a pure, magical and innocent way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is not JUST a cartoon, its a great film in its own right. The animation is very subtle and the behaviour of the young girl is very well implemented. The Japanese version should be the one of choice since the voice acting in some of the characters in the english version do spoil it a little. I thought Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away were a tad too long but Grave of the fireflies is the perfect length at just under 90 minutes. The score of the film also deserves a mention! in short an exceptional film!!9/10 for its time(8/10 by todays standards set by Spirited Away etc...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've become a fan of Anime since Spirited Away and have been gobbling up on Studio Ghibli's wonderful anime collection. Many of these are so much better than what we get from Disney and the like but none of this prepard me for the Grave of The Fireflies.This is such an emotional and powerful movie for its poignant depiction of those innocents afflicted by war. It reminds us that in any war, many innocents are caught in the cross-fire between any opposing forces - and couldn't have come at a better time especially at a time of war.Definitely the best of Studio Ghibli's collection, and the best anime/cartoon of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is a movie set in WWII Japan in the port city of Kobe. It is narrated by the spirit of Seta, an eleven year old boy found dead in a train station with an tin of candy filled with ashes. We follow him as he tells us the moving story of his last days. This movie is visually gorgeous, emotionally wrenching, and lyrically directed. This movie moves slowly, with long shots of a brother and sister living their lives. There is one shot of Seta doing flips on a bar in a parking lot trying to cheer his sobbing sister up. This is one of the greatest movies ever made, do not let the fact that it is animated bother you. It is up there with the greatest war movies of all time, with The Best Days of our Lives, and The Pianist.The Grave of the Fireflies captures the horrors of war and the wonders of childhood better than many live action films could ever hope for.</fullReview>

I have talked about this film with about 50 Japanese people and they all say it completely tore them apart, when I lie and say that you didn't cry they look at me with serious disbelief and wonder that someone could be so insensitive.... I even had one person on the verge of tears talking about it.... Grave of the Fireflies is broadcasted every August on national TV to commemorate the end of WW2.. there should be an international rule that everyone especially war minded political leaders see this.. Seeing Setsuko face terrified and shaking as she clings to her brothers arm just after they escaped the firebombing of Kobe and many other heart wrenching scenes must have a profound effect on even the most hardened war mongerer.... This is perhaps a perfect film in many ways.... mostly it's unforgettable impact on your emotions......... send a copy to George W Bush.. and Saddam</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT for the kids!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason animation can move me more than any feature film, real life people acting, are just that, and you know that deep down, no matter how good they are, but succesful animation will really have you believe you are in another world, and for 90 minutes these people are real, and their emotions can be expressed within one single brushstroke. Good Animation is life exagerated and condensed into one great art form. And a film like Grave Of The Fireflies, is one example of animation doing what film could never ever do. Sure the scenes could easily have been shot as live action, this isn't Akira. In fact as a feature film, it would cost next to nothing to make, but it just wouldn't have the ability to even come close to capturing the dream-like beauty and utter emotion of it..Next to Monster's Inc this is probably the only animated feature in recent years to really move me to tears, though while i could watch Monster's Inc again and again, and with no moral concern with a bunch of kids, i could not watch Grave Of The Fireflies again so easily, and definately not with a youngster. It has humour, but there is a very dark and real-life message, and it's told so simply that any child will get it, and it will depress the hell out of them. I'm 21, and during the whole second half and the few hours before going to sleep i was just numb, no other film has EVER done that to me, and i've seen my fair share of movies!In fact i've seen mostly all the war greats, but this for me has to be by far the most effective anti-war film i've ever seen. If you're an adult, i would recommend watching this film with my highest praise. (PS- make sure you don't watched a dubbed english version, it sounds like a saturday morning cartoon! ) IMDB compares the film to Empire Of The Sun, and the setting and themes are pretty similar, that film as a kid had my eyes open and aware of the peril of war, but that film is Disney compared to this.. Parents you have been warned!!And definately make sure you watch it in the right mood. It will be one of the most beautiful, depressing and moving 90 minutes you'll ever spend sitting down in front of a screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the most depressing film I've ever seen. Enough to make anyone cry. This is also one of the most chilling films I have ever seen. The message is there and it is relevant.The story involves a young boy named Seita and his 5-year-old sister Setsuko. They both must survive on their own during the horrific firebombing raids in the final months of WWII.Many films portray America as the "hero" of WWII. This movie convincingly portrays it as a "villain". I had the chills after watching this because I realized, "America did this to Japan."Highly recommended even though it is depressing and horrifying. Grade: A+Rated PG-13 for images of graphic violence, mature thematic elements, and language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This anime is one of the greatest films ever made. It could easily be ranked with films like "Broken Blossoms" by D.W. Griffith (1919). It is a classic tragic play. One not only sympathizes with the characters, but through the skill of all involved in making this work, one identifies with them. Their misfortune becomes your misfortune. It is your misfortune, for as the film points out: nations that are enamored of their destiny do not care about people, especially those too young or too weak to fight. The consequences of their do not fall on those responsible, but upon the innocents, the children.It is also a film about the unconquerable nature of the innocent spirit: the downtrodden children are more alive than those who are not starving. They experience life, they do not merely pass through it. Even in their misfortune, their destiny is eternal.Do not pass this film by. See it and think about its message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Important Animated Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hotaru no Haka ('Grave of the Fireflies') is arguably the most important animated film ever made. One thing is a near-guarantee: after seeing this film, you will be in a different state of mind. The setting is Japan, shortly before the conclusion of the Pacific War (WWII), when the US initiated the incendiary bombardment of Japanese cities. Though not as well known as the Atomic events at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the death and destruction caused by the incendiary devices against Japan's major cities was actually far greater. This is a story of two young sibling children caught up in the events, winding up orphaned and without a place to live. They must find a way to survive without the luxury of adult care, because the adults are also desperately trying to find a way to survive. There is really no way of discussing plot or even the point of view of this film without revealing too much. All I can say, with emphatic voice, is 'SEE IT.''Grave of the Fireflies' is available everywhere in video rental stores. The only version I know is subtitled, so my usual admonition against a dubbed version doesn't apply. I give this film a 10 out of 10 rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is proof that anime is not just a little kids. This film deals with the suffering caused by war on civilians, and the children. This is an excellent cautionary tale about the consequences of war on innocents, and should be required viewing for high school and college history classes that deal with the time period of WW2. I would NOT recommend it for children not yet in high school. Film students should also watch this, to gain an understanding of how an emotionally powerful film does not need special effects or cloying plot twists. All a film needs is a simple, powerful script that is genuine, with a direction that does similar service to the message. I won't claim nobody can watch this film without crying, or at least feeling choked up. However, the number is very few. My eyes were certainly moist towards the end of it.</fullReview>

Not knowing the contents of this show (I thought that it was a funny cartoon or something like that), I happily watched it.I cried.Well, I managed to fight back a little, but nevertheless I still have tears in my eyes some time after the show. It was rather weird for someone to cry after watching a cartoon, but still I recommended my friends to watch this great show. You'd expect them to laugh at me. I watched this cartoon again (rather reluctantly, 'cause I don't want to cry in front of my friends) last weekend with two friends, and I can't believe that I heard sniffles from them during the show. I didn't really cry, since I've watched the show before, but it was still very sad.9/10. The storyline, animation was perfect. The characters (especially Setsuko)were really life-like (she kinda reminds me of my little sister =)). I would give this one a perfect 10, but I hate sad shows.</fullReview>

Besides, I can't BELIEVE that it's rated "PG" in the US, this movie should be rated 18 just because of depressing content!

It could've been any nation involved in any war, but the fact still remains that this is the one war movie that stands as the most heartwrenching movie I've ever seen, an Anime, at that.If you're expecting your standard Anime with violence and sex, you're going to be surprised. This movie revolves around children, a 14 year old and his 4 year old sister. The violence is limited to fire from bombings, there is no swearing or bad language, and there is absolutely no nudity. It doesn't need any of that to be effective.What you see is beautiful art and animation, and a powerful drive for survival. From the very start, you know what is going to happen. You know their fate before the flashback of their life even starts. Seeing them so happy together further stresses your heartstrings when you know what happens in the end. The symbolism in the movie is exceptionally striking, the fireflies, the kimono, and especially the fruit drops. In the end of the movie, it reverts back to the opening scene to end the flashback. You can't help but think "They're in peace now, nothing can disturb them further. Death is pretty, in a way."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't appreciate people who look at this movie as an anime. Yes it IS an anime, but if you focus in on the story, it is far more than that. I lost touch with the animation early on. The story is really something else. Most people do not have an idea of what life was like in Japan during World War II. Just like those who suffered under the nazis, the japanese suffered too. And this movie is a great example which shows in detail their trials and tribulations. I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a wonderful achievement in both animation and the portrayal of two childrens' lives, Seika and Setsuko, who unwillingly must face their challenges alone but together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to summarise the emotional impact of this movie suffice to say it's by far the most heart breakingly sad film I've ever seen yet it doesn't once come across as schmaltzy or contrived at any time.The story revolves around a young Japanese boy who, with his younger sister, is orphaned in an American bombing raid during WW2 and their subsequent struggle to survive during times of hardship and rationing. To divulge more would be to spoil.This is prime "thinking mans anime" and yet again proves the the genre has more to offer than big robots and dubious Hentai.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one film that can describe the brutality of war with the least amount of violence, it's this. Hotaru no Haka is one of the best animated films, even one of the best films i have ever seen.The reason why this is not in the top 250 is a mystery.It's one of the most powerful films along the lines of Rain Man. They have one thing in common: It works at putting you in the place of the troubled character (Rain Man/Raymond, Hotaru no Haka/Setsuko) and have the same exact feelings of the character.This film has nothing objectionable to parents except for the intense thematic material, and I wouldn't call it a family film. In fact, if you are a parent and want your kids to see this, make sure they're READY. This is the only film i've ever cried through, and it's been two months since I saw it and i STILL have an impact from it.If you liked this film, I'd recommend you to see Hadashi no Gen (its on sale at amazon) and, if you're an iMDB user, maybe even give it a vote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grave of the Fireflies" is such a masterpiece, it's impossible for me to do it justice here. You just have to watch it. If you thought "Bambi" was sad, you'll be surprised with this movie. The story is of two siblings, Seita and his little sister Setsuko, and how their lives were affected during WWII. I think this movie will have a greater impact on younger viewers. My father, whose own father fought in WWII, didn't care for the movie and didn't get the message it was trying to get across. It doesn't focus on the war itself, but on two innocent children who are living in the midst of it. This is a very tragic film, as the viewer will know from the beginning. The movie begins by showing the childrens' demise; Seita has just died on the floor of a train station. A worker spots his empty candy container and throws it outside, releasing Setsuko's ashes. Her spirit appears and as she's about to run towards Seita's body, his own spirit joins her and the two are together again. From there, the spirits lead us through a flashback of how they helped each other and later died. It's like watching "Titanic", you know the ship's going to sink, but we get to see the events leading up to it. Don't pass up this gem just because it's animated. Honestly, I forgot it was animated at times, the characters are so real and so is their story. I don't think I'll ever see a more emotional, intelligent animated movie than this. A must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is one of the best films i've ever seen. It's a shame that not that many people know about it. It doesn't receive the publicity and recognition it deserves. This movie is very, very, depressing, and the storyline is more or less just a succession of events without any rising or falling action. The animation is simple with many still image shots (and no computer animation). The score is perfect for the tone of the movie. I could go on about what was great in this movie, but instead, i advise you to feel the effects yourself after watching it. I'll never forget the last scene where Seita holds his sleeping sister under the red glow and looks to the camera--reminding us that this story from the grave of the fireflies isn't just a movie to entertain us. It is just one example of the many TRUE tragedies that innocent families went through in Japan during WWII. This movie is the "Schindler's List" of animation.</fullReview>

Seita and his sister Setsuko are two of the most likable and adorable characters in all of anime, you really feel there suffering as the movie goes on. If you are planning to watch this film like most other anime, don't. Where as most anime is graphically violent with a pop theme, this movie is a gritty, realistic, and all together heartbreaking film that stabs at your soul with a pitchfork of depression. One person I lent the film to cried for most of the movie and was depressed for the rest of the night.

		<fullReview>If you're looking for sword fights, fantastic creatures, extreme violence or comedy, this Anime is not for you. If you are however, looking for an Anime with excellent music, a moving story, characters that you end up caring about minutes into the movie and animation that holds up well today... now you're talking. This Anime is for you.In Grave of the Fireflies you are introduced to Seita and his younger sister Setsuko, two children struggling to survive in Japan during the heat of WWII. To avoid spoiling anything, I'll leave the summary at that. I will say this though, it's a somber story but one that any true fan of quality Anime shouldn't miss.As for dub vs. subtitles, personally I found the dubbed voice or Seita to be just fine, while I preferred the original voice of Setsuko over the dubbed one. If I had to pick one over the other, I'd say I prefer to watch the Anime with the original Japanese voice acting with English subtitles. The strength of the original Setsuko voice being the deciding factor for me.If you're looking for a moving Anime, look no further.</fullReview>

I read a review somewhere that "most movies are successful in creating sadness and tears, but this movie creates grief and deep depression".I borrowed this from a local video store. The title sort of pulled me in and I didn't expect such a ride of emotions from this film. Then, a few months later, I let my father watched it. He thought he was humoring me by watching a "cartoon" with me. But he cried. And he dreamt about it that night. My mother walked out of the room halfway. Somehow, this gives me great satisfaction.I think if everyone is made to see this movie at least once in their lives, there would be a lot more people who will be unwilling to enter War.Watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I consider myself an Otaku, and own a drawer of Anime and Manga, most of which is considered great. I wanted to look for another Anime, so I went on IMDb, and found this at the top of the list. I went out and rented it, not knowing what to expect. However, when I saw it, it was better then any movie I've ever seen, Anime and Live-Action alike.It had beautiful animation, especially the extremely detailed backrounds, but unlike other Anime titles, the characters' mouths just opened and closed, unlike other Animes where the mouth movements are based on how the voice actors' mouths move."September 21, 1945. That was the day I died." You see a young soldier, Seita say this, and then you see his lifeless, barely breathing body lying against a pillar in a subway station. Several people just walk past making comments, but one stops, looks, and gives him a bag of food. He slumps to the side and dies. A Rail worker sees him, and tosses a candy can he was carrying to a field. In the field, you see him rise, in uniform, and then you see Seita's sister Setsuko pick up the can, and take his hand. Then you see thousands of Fireflies rise from the field. You then see Seita and Setsuko on a train, while Setsuko eats candy. The movie then switches to a flash back, where Seita and Setsuko's village is in panic, and you hear people yelling, "Air strike!" as they pack up struff to take with them to a shelter. Seita sees his Mama, and tells her to bring her medicine. She then leaves, and Seita carries his sister while he packs things in a bag like a picture of his father, and other things. Him and Setsuko leave towards a shelter, but the bombing begins, as the fiery sticks down pore. it then begins to rain from all He gets to the school, after the bombing, where everyone has been stationed, and finds his girlfriend who takes Setsuko and tell Seita to go see his mother. His mother is sleeping, heavily wrapped in bandages from severe burns. He then finds that they were unable to find her heart medicine. Later, when he thinks she is being transfered to a hospital, he finds that she passed away. He deciedes to withhold this from Setsuko for the time being, and they set off for their Aunt's house in another village. For the next 45 minutes or so, they must overcome lacks of food supply from the constant bombing, which cannot be smothered out because the oil spreads, along with dealing with people. This is where there story begins from the rest of the movie.Excellent animation, touching, sad, angering, and something you want to watch over and over. 10/10.</fullReview>

I was intrigued by the comments to the tune of 'best film i've seen and i'll never watch again' or 'amazing film, don't see it!'. But I can see their point, this film is more than just touching or upsetting, and I'm afraid I cannot articulate on what level it affects. But affect it does. Others felt that Schindlers List (who some have compared this to) was somehow more poignant because of the sheer number of lives destroyed in it. I felt that this simple story of survival said everything that could be said about War while avoiding the politics and propaganda so often associated with movies like this. That said, there are no movies like this. It is singularly beautiful and has some absolutely perfect moments. The animation of the little sister Setsuko is incredible. The English dub is also excellent. It's hard to analyse this movie in terms of it's component parts because the overall effect is so overwhelming. I'm prone to letting myself fall into a movie, but this film is something else. This should be a standard text, like the novel,Catcher in the Rye it's something everyone should experience at least once.</fullReview>

The film tells the story of a boy and his sister, who are forced to live in miserable conditions due to war. The movie follows the trademark of Ghibli films i.e display of hope and will power of humans. PROS:The film picks up pace from the starting. It focuses properly on the content and starts developing the major characters from the beginning itself. The kids animated are as always, very cute. The first half seemed to be easy and there was not too much burden about survival on the kids, but the second half slowly moves to a very emotional situation. The second part also signifies that it is better to fight oppression. The movie depicts simplicity in its best way. It also puts a question that whether it is OK to go by the rules. It is the best example of war time movie with a different take. MESSAGE: "Always give your best shot."VERDICT: "A recommended watch."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie took on an added poignancy for me as I kept thinking of my own granddaughter, who's age approaches that of the young Setsuko in the movie. How horrifying a prospect to be left homeless under any conditions, let alone to deal with the death of a mother with no place to turn. The plight of Setsuko and her older brother Seita is dealt perhaps an even more severe blow by the indifference and even hostility of their countrymen and fellow citizens. I was probably more disturbed by the idea that so little compassion was offered to these two troubled wanderers. I rarely watch animated films, and this is actually the very first anime feature I've ever seen, recommended by it's standing in the IMDb top film rankings. The picture is gorgeously rendered, and there's a lyrical quality to the quieter moments when the siblings take comfort in each other's presence against a backdrop of war and devastation. Be prepared for an emotional response to the heartbreak of loss and separation, exemplified by a brother and sister who mean the world to each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, but maybe too much for young children</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A touching film about the ravages of war. A young teenage boy is left to take care of his young sister after a bombing raid on Japan during WWII. You have to feel for the two young main characters in this film, it's a tough situation for them to be in.Although Grave of the Fireflies is considered a children's film, personally i think some of the concepts in this film a too much for some children to comprehend, especially young children. While not gory, "Grave" can be very intense &amp; graphic in its depiction of bombing raids. I think some children may find this unsettling, but I must admit I am writing this without having seen this film with a child.A great film for fans of film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conflict of Values</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was talking with a friend of mine (we both share an appreciation of anime) and he suggested that I watch "Grave of the Fireflies". I went over to Amazon and put the DVD in my cart, me being pretty sure that I was going to buy it (if one of my best friends liked it, I surely would too). But I went into town and I remembered that there was a video/DVD rental store that specialized in anime. I saw it there, picked it up, rented it, went home.As I started watching the movie, a couple of things were clear to me. This isn't just a film about World War II, it's about the human condition during war times. The context surrounding the movie is Japan during and just after the war. It's quite powerful, breathtakingly honest and emotionally brutal. I'll even admit that I shed a few tears. It was hard watching Setsuko, Seita's very young sister, slowly die from malnutrition. And knowing she dies from the almost the very beginning of the movie doesn't make viewing any less harder. Most of the film revolved around Seita's drive to help and spare his sister any more pain than necessary. It is heartbreaking, and one of most tragic movies I have ever seen.While I was watching the film though, I was deeply conflicted. I am Korean American. I will not and cannot feel sympathy for the Japanese during that era. It literally makes me sick for me to feel sorry the Japanese, considering the horrors they caused and perpetuated for people like my grandfather, my father, my family, the people of my ancestry. This movie is supposedly on Roger Ebert's "10 greatest films of all time", and while I can understand why that is so, I'll have to think long and hard before I go Amazon and purchase the movie.The Japanese today are a great and prosperous people. But this movie tries to glorify and sympathize the sentiments of the Japanese during the war. They would like for the rest of the world to forget that they had hand in genocide (just like the Nazis in the European war). They're history books generously omit the fact they caused as much suffering as portrayed in the film to the two children. I bring light to the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi who (despite huge protest from the Korean and Chinese) visited the Japanese war heroes grave late last year, paying tribute to the generals and officers who committed crimes against humanity. This is who the Japanese are, and even in today's age they would like us to forget what truly happened, to feel sympathy to their civilian casualties. Remember, more American lives were lost in the Pacific war than in the European war.Setting aside this argument, Hotaru no haka (Grave of the Fireflies) is worth watching. On the basest level, this movie is (like I said before) truly powerful, breathtakingly honest (to the human condition) and emotionally brutal.I would recommend this film, but I would warn to viewers to not forget the context in which the film is portrayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a nice film. Interesting, good characters, at times beautiful. Sad, then, that's there's absolutely no reason to watch it.Don't know that war is bad? That it affects innocent children? That some people are horrible? Want to spend some time crying, and spend the rest of the evening depressed and/or haunted? Then this is the film for you.For the rest of us, applaud the film and the obvious effort that's been put into it, and stay away.I'm glad this work exists, as a document of a historical time. And occasionally I'll look back and remember some of its beauty. But I almost wish I hadn't seen it -- my life needs energy and beauty rather than depression -- and it's the only Miyazaki film I wouldn't recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprising movie that will affect the emotions if you can relate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't wrote a review on IMDb in awhile and there is some movies deserving of one that I should review it but this one... man it hurt me, in a good way sort of speak. This is a story of a man that simply is trying to do his role as a husband and father by making sure his family is taken care of. He comes from a background that I'm sure those from the Philippines will relate to and decides that life in the big city will give his family a change of pace. He instead finds that the city is full of betrayal and lies with the people he meets. Not to say everyone there is out to hurt someone but it shows the realism of what some people go through simply trusting in someone they don't know. This is not a action movie but a movie that is sort of a thriller and moving like... sorry, my terminology isn't there for movies. The movie is a tearjerker as they say and I'm a black man who actually don't mind movies like that. This movie I didn't expect to be tearjerkish and I really don't go looking for those type movies. Every time "Oscar" the main character had something happen to him, it affected me and that goes to show how EXCELLENT a job Jake did in this role. Everyone played their parts right even down to the adorable daughter of his. At times I was concerned his wife would leave him... just had me that in tuned. Everything about the movie is gritty and surreal that you feel as if this is really happening; someone just taped it all somehow. What happens in the end brought me to tears because I am a human that sympathize and understand a bold move people will take for their family. It just pains me that I can only wish I could tell folks I know about this movie but they won't give it a try because it is a foreign movie and don't want to read subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>relentless depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the most depressing films I have seen... well in a long time and in terms of being uncompromisingly grim, possibly the most depressing ever. Even film's like Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark (2000) had a glimmer of hope that things would be OK.I loved how much an animated feature could make me feel so strongly about something and I understand that the point of this film was how relentless war is, but watching this was just like watching depression-session-misery-torture.There was no way of it ending up with any form of hope, joy or optimism, not that I wanted it to, but I wanted to think that it could. I do not mind something not having a happy-ever-after ending, in fact I'd usually complain when things are too happy-happy but I think that the best tear-jerker moments and the ones that have the most impact are those where either unfortunate events, to a certain extent come by surprise, or more specifically that you know there could be something horrible about to happen but you are still not sure and there is still the chance of everything being alright. The shattering of this built up hope leaves you feeling more vulnerable and therefore increases the effectiveness of the narrative.By showing you at this film's opening that the main character dies and joins his little sister in the afterlife, once his mother dies in the opening act you know there really is no way out for the doomed little boy. This does succeed at showing the uncompromising relentless nature of war but it really was tortuous and difficult to watch. In a way I admire the film's approach but at the same time I didn't really enjoy it.Twitter: @destroyapathy www.destroy-apathy.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Because it is the truth and quite possibly telling a story of a real life family in Japan during the time of war.Real sad that the war had cost so many lives and that the people in their own country suffer harshly as a result of it.This movie tells the story of a boy who is doing his very best to look after his little sister and his struggle along the way in trying to look after his sister. This involved not telling her of what is happening in Japan to keep her comfortable.Warning: This is not a typical Hiyao Miyzaki film where it is an adventure and some heroic ending occurs. Or some happy ending. This is a film that has an ending that will leave you shocked, crying. This is perhaps Hiyao's best film ahead of Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie showed the horrors of war very well. The story is indeed very sad and touching. It is indeed one of the best animation movie I have ever watched. SPOILER ALERT. The reason why I gave such a low score is that I was quite disappointed with the ending. How come he waited so long to get their mother's money from the bank to buy their supplies? They had money, yet he chose to wait until his sister is about to die to buy food for her. Frankly I find the ending lacking. I might have looked at the movie in a different perspective. I just stared at my screen and can't believe that he was so st*pid and kept their money instead of buying food and necessities. I get it that it was set in the midst of war, but he was stealing valuables to trade for food so their money would still be worth something right? Besides, he was able to buy stuff after he withdrew the money. Sorry for all those who loved the movie. Just stating my observation. Don't get me wrong. The movie is worth watching.

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers that really don't give much away.On the surface the film is about war and the effect it has on children. However, at doesn't take long before the viewer realizes that this is only the most superficial meaning of the film. On another level is is about the relationship of two children trying to care for each other in a world that seems to have deserted them. The beauty of their relationship and the importance of that relationship even in death is one of the purest and most innocent portrayals in any film. On another level it is about Japanese pride and the self-defeating inability of the Japanese to admit defeat. For example, Seita, the boy, refuses to give in to those who have insulted him even to the point of putting his and his sister's lives at stake. How similar to the Japanese refusal to surrender near the end of the war, even when there was no hope. They were willing to die to the last civilian. It was only the total shock of the A-bomb that got them to do it. On another level it is about the briefness of life. Like the fireflies, life is brief and beautiful. It is the beauty of life that is important.It is not a sad film, it can bring you through the emotions, but even from the beginning when the ghosts of the two children are united, we can see that their love has transcended death. Some politically minded people have described this as an anti-war film, a condemnation of American atrocities in WWII, or a film ignoring the atrocities of the Japanese and blaming their situation on the allies. It is none of these things.If the director is critical of anyone, it is of the Japanese people themselves. He shows the Japanese as fanatically committed to winning the war and supporting their country even when they there was no hope of winning. In contrast to this is their callousness toward the two children who obviously need help. Do anything for the group but ignore the individuals, seems to be their attitude. The children themselves - at least the boy, share this attitude. He is willing to become a thief a liar and even endanger the lives of his own little "country" (himself and his sister), rather than surrender to his relatives. So while there are many anti-war films out there, this is really not one of them - it sharp critical look at the Japanese character.The film is not without flaws. While the animation is usually quite beautiful, at times the animation is too static. Generally the pace is good, but at times it is slow. At times points are over-emphasized and made more than once. At times you want to say, for example, "Okay, I got it. You don't have to show me again that the sister is dying." When the director over-emphasizes these points, it can be painful.However, the positive aspects of the film are so strong that they easily make you forget the flaws. The strongest theme of the film is the beauty of the relationship between the two children and the beauty of life even when it is brief. You walk away from the film feeling that life is worth it even in the worst of conditions. Not a small accomplish for any work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose I enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies about as much as I enjoyed something like 2009's "The Road", a film with an atmosphere and a 'look' more-so a character study; a narrative arc or an actual spine. The comparison to a film set post-apocalypse is somewhat fitting here, since Studio Ghibli's 1988 effort often has the feel that the world is coming to an end; that there isn't much hope left and what the central characters have is the best they'll get lest they be dead. What IS coming to an end, however, is not the world itself but The Second World War ? something which, if you're in the likes of Berlin; Paris; Hiroshima; Tokyo, or anywhere else synonymous with the conflict, is going to be a lot less pleasant than if you're situated in the United States, or even parts of Great Britain. As a result, towns are flattened; people are fending for themselves; food is hard to come by and to escape the threat of further dangers; one appears to have to flee to the countryside: this is a post-apocalyptic drama if ever I saw one.Like most of its ilk, story and character sputter to get going out of the fact it's the end of most of what's left in the world and there isn't much left with which to interact. Grave of Fireflies is no different; its elevated status in the popular eye is born out of the fact it's an animation first and foremost, and people often grade such things for its appeal to a child ? thus, when something as adult as "Grave" comes along, hysteria and praise will follow. Additionally, it is a Japanese film and a Japanese film tackling Japanese life at the end of The Second World War; a sum often enough for people to see films from certain countries in regards to certain issues sensitive to said nation as being a bit better than what is normal.As for the film itself, and following on from My Neighbour Totoro, the gleefulness and the ambiguity of the situations young children found themselves in as monsters and supernatural elements ruled their breakaway roost has been replaced by a starker, darker reality. Grave of the Fireflies depicts children veering away from their parents or guardians and into a realm not populated by mythical creatures, of whom are little to no threat, but into the unremitting world of street life in which the reality of actual starvation is very much a threat. We are a long way from the flights of fantasy abound in said example, wherein interaction with monsters and such took kids out of living with parental protection and forced them to fend for themselves.Here, The War is coming to an end and young siblings Seita (Tatsumi) and Setsuko (Shiraishi) suffer the death of their mother during a Kobe bombing raid that additionally destroys their home ? thus, they are forced out and about onto the already dangerous streets of Japan. In Japan right now, the skies are red; ash rains down; the rain that falls in black and they have a mere tin of fruit sweets between them in terms of food supply ? they must, however, troop on in an attempt to find father who's with the Navy. To an extent, the film is reminiscent of the preceding year's Empire of the Sun; a superior film in its depiction of a young infant caught up in Japan's spree of invasion through the Far East at around this time, events which eventually gave way to the Pacific theatre of World War II. On top of this, there is a burning amount of inspiration drawn from a lot of what Italy was producing in the immediate fallout of the war; these neo-realist pictures about an individual (plus, on occasion, a companion) trawling through the proverbial debris in order to get somewhere that may or may not be anywhere in particular.Seita adopts the role of the lead from Setsuko, on account of being much older; their tale in a late-war Japan, a Japan losing two separate wars to China and the Allies, is an interesting snapshot of life at that time, but no more ? a piece not offering as much as one would like beyond the thirty minute mark, by which time we've understood all that's been provided and wait to be challenged with something more. Throughout, the Japanese are resentful and full of spite towards the children; a depiction of aunts and doctors, those of whom you would have thought would show compassion, an instance of few punches being pulled by the makers in what appears to be a set of depictions designed to sync up with the merciless nature of Japanese attitudes at that time.Grave of the Fireflies is no doubt a brave project, with well-constructed, oppressive atmospheres of hopelessness and decent cinematography, but this will only get you so far. The effectiveness of films such as these, projects with later significant deaths and a series of scenes not propelled by narrative but by survival, are often determined by the creativity behind the uncanniness of the scenario, with the likes of 28 Days Later and Dawn of the Dead scoring highly. Grave of the Fireflies, while competent and well designed, is not a horror film per se; its drama is wearing, its runtime tiring, in spite of it being below ninety minutes and its characters two dimensional (they might be of any age and of any background). Its droll repetition, instead of capturing the desperately sad and desperately slow paced nature of survival, instead creates the sense we're being dragged down the same scenes over and over again ? and this is precisely what happens.</fullReview>

Because they had an argument? Their aunt was strict? Sheesh!

If they were made homeless as their aunt's house was bombed, I would have understood. The aunt wasn't even that bad! Overall the only feeling this film provoked in me was frustration: I wanted to grab those kids by the ears and drag them back to their aunt's house and tell them if they run away again i'll kill them myself.

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie on TCM. I've heard such good things about this movie, and I was so excited to see that it was going to be on, but then I was SO disappointed that it was dubbed. Though it's difficult to watch gorgeous Japanese animation AND read subtitles, I feel that too much is lost in translation when the film is dubbed. Two perfect examples of that are "Spirited Away" and "Howl's Moving Castle." I've seen both the Japanese and English versions, and they felt like different movies.Getting back to "Grave of the Fireflies," it was actually a bit of a disappointment. But I blame Miyazaki for that. Once you've become a connoisseur of his work, nothing else compares. It was a very compelling film, beautifully drawn, but it didn't live up to the hype for me.Obviously from the rating I gave it, I still loved it. I really appreciated how such grim subject matter was treated with such reverence (2 things that seem like oxymorons when dealing with animated film; I loved how the suffering and the death was portrayed with such incredible realism (so to speak); and I have to say that I shed quite a few tears during this film, from the first sentence to the last. But one of the things that I found so incredibly compelling was the 2 kids' ability to find laughter and fun even when surrounded by the horrors of war. That aspect of it rang more truly for me than any other part. I'm not sure why.The end was pretty weak when compared with the rest of the film, but then we already know how it ends. I would have done a few things differently to {perhaps} more effectively tear at your heart: *******SPOILERS HERE******* I would have let the watermelon drop off Setsuko's chest when she died; when her spirit was flitting in and out of your vision at the shelter, the one where she was reflected in the water - I would have let her disappear while her reflection remained; and I would have explained how much time passed between Setsuko's death and Seita's, and I would have explained how he ended up where he did. It was a little confusing to know that in the final scenes before we know he died, he had just bought a lot of food, and had withdrawn 3000 yen from the bank.*********SPOILERS DONE******** I think this movie should be required viewing for elementary and middle school children. I used to think that about "Saving Private Ryan," but that movie is too visceral for the kiddies. Using animation in this way, deadly serious subject matter can be effectively conveyed, while the medium softens the blow a bit for the younger viewers. Perhaps there would be an end to war.No matter my complaints I still think this was a marvelous movie. I'm not sure if it's one of the top 250 movies of all time, but it's really good, certainly unique, and well worth watching.Highly recommend. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well crafted film that lacks anything resembling hope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this belief that there are certain "rules" movies are suppose to follow. One of those "rules" is the build and release of emotion. It goes back to Hitchcock talking about a bomb being hidden under a desk: We show two people talking while cutting to short shots of the bomb. This builds emotion.But, the bomb can't go off. If the bomb goes off there isn't a release - just an explosion. All of that tension stays built up inside of you.That's my problem with this movie, no matter how gut-wrenching, sad or even realistic it is, it has a fatal flaw. The audience, in my opinion, is never given a moment to release the tension - just an explosion.This movie, following Hitchcock's example, is a series of tension building moments, followed by small, quiet, extremely depressing explosions.But, maybe the intent of the movie was to build emotion/tension and not release it. Maybe that was the point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is based on a true story. The central characters are an orphaned brother and much younger sister in WW2 Japan. The city of Kobe has recently come under Allied fire bombing and most of the wooden houses have burned down including that of Seita and Setsuko. The children first live with a family friend who quickly becomes very nasty. They then move to a bomb shelter and try to survive the war.I like the fact that this film is anti-war and it does tell a touching story. But, I don't consider it, on first viewing, to be quite the classic it's made out to be. To be honest, I couldn't get into the whole anime thing. Even the faces were not realistic. If this had been a real movie with real actors, it would have been tougher to make, but the impact (for me) would have been far greater. Some of the plot points didn't make sense either. If Seita could access all that money in his mothers account, why did Setsuko have to reach a point of starvation for him to get his hands on it.Please don't let my views on this film discourage you from watching it. Overall, it is a good film and very well perceived by critics and IMDb voters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess only a select group is rating this movie. If the audience would be as wide as with the blockbusters, this movie would have a rating below 8.0. (probably around 7.0 in my estimation)Boring , Predictable and Nice! Doesn't deserve the high rating. So, yes, this movie is a nice ride. And that is all it is. For me personally it wasn't too emotional. I didn't really feel strongly for the characters let alone shed a tear. A big negative factor is a high predictability. Still, it is a nice ride. Kinda depressing, kinda emotional and mostly I have to say, for me personally, it was just boring.I kinda liked the simplicity of the movie. But I don't know, it just isn't powerful enough. Maybe if I watched it at some other time I would react differently , but probably not by much.Real rating: 4.8</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, but not hyped too much for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed this movie, but as a whole I just did not get the emotional impact that many other describe. Maybe because I am cold hearted robot or maybe because I was watching during an unbearable heat wave, but it just did not hit me that hard. There is no real criticism for the movie, but I am not going to go out and tell everyone about the movie. A large part of the emotional impact comes from being familiar with the culture and the whole idea of having to rebuild a life after it being destroyed, but it did not hit me. I would say Seita was an aggravating character and it seems as if there must have been plenty more options than just living in the caves. Other than that a few of my few favorite points is that they do not hide the fact that this was going to be a sad movie right from the beginning and the fact that it began the way it did made it tragic. It was very slow, but the slowness added to the slow decay of the children. One of my favorite parts was the most devastating thing for Seita was when he finds out that Japan "the greatest empire in the world" was defeated and surrendered unconditionally that he finally breaks down. Even when his sister dies he does not show the emotion which shows the Japanesse issue in having to rebuild what was once thought a superior society to conform to something that they must have hated. The fire bombings of Japan is one of the most tragic events of our world's history. The horror of it was lessened a bit, but it was still potent. A very well done movie, but because everyone had told me that this was a great movie it disappointed me a little bit (but it might also be because I am a robot).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, so before everyone starts flaming and wishing a pox on me and my progeny, hear me out...I just rented Grave of the Fireflies on DVD from Netflix and watched it for the first time tonight. Let me preface things by saying I love Miyazaki movies and some other anime - Steamboy, etc. And also that I understand that quite a bit of anime is about the emotional impact or inner conflict more than cohesion.Throughout the film, we see a lot of legitimate drama with the mother dying of severe burns and injury, with some implied lack of sanitation and proper medical facilities being to blame, and later the father is revealed to be dead at sea, which does a good job setting the tone of death and heartbreak that will be felt throughout the movie.Arguably the most major thread (that's supposed to have the greatest impact) in the movie was the hardship brought on by war and the eventual tragedy of Setsuko slowly dying from hunger and malnutrition - and then as we see in the beginning, Seita losing his grip on sanity and eventually life.But where I start having major problems with the story to the point of ruining the drama entirely is when Setsuko and Seita leave their extended family's home to live on their own. We see their hardship and struggle getting enough to eat to the point that Seita begins stealing food and goods to trade for food... when we JUST heard earlier in story that they have enough money in the bank to "live off of".So, the film had some very interesting scenes, it was very artsy and thought provoking, but the real tragedy seemed to me to be Seita forgetting he had assets at hand with which to prevent Setsuko from being hungry in the first place - even if they would have eventually been exhausted.So it's basic logic is what holds the drama in this film back more than anything else. There's no due tragedy. It's tragic, yes, but not in the same way that say a film like "Life is Beautiful" is tragic - all the hardship in that film was undue, unearned, and the characters did everything reasonable in their power to avoid it, which is where the drama comes from.TL;DR I am daring to disagree with the anime fan community, that a movie MUST be great because a little girl gets sick and dies when it would have had some weight and meaning if it weren't for the abundant and obvious relief available to the characters in the last arc of the film.Am I wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sure candidate for the most overrated animated work ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "masterpiece" is thrown around quite a bit. That word should be reserved so that it has merit, but its consistent overuse has reduced the power of what the word once meant. The criterion for earning such a branding should be quite difficult to attain. In the world of anime, nothing has been called a masterpiece as fervently as Grave of the Fireflies. The usually war-torn world of critics is in almost unanimous agreement that the film is "powerful", "tragic", and a "masterpiece". Even Roger Ebert thinks so. All these people couldn't possibly be wrong, could they? I mean, Roger Ebert is famous! Grave of the Fireflies is the story of Seita and Setsuko, a pair of children who find themselves bewildered by the chaos of World War II. Fire bombings have claimed their mother and forced them out of their home, and now they must migrate from one place to another. For a time, they live with their aunt, who really isn't a half bad person, but is painted by the protagonist (through the writing, which feels as though it was written by a resentful teenager) to be a horrible, oppressive witch. Because Seita is so indolent and does nothing but eat, his aunt eventually gives him the choice to either start working or leave.Seita then consciously decides, knowing full well what possible consequences lie ahead, to leave his aunt with his little sister in tow. He decides to live outside with his sister, willingly exposing her to the elements and possible starvation. What happens next is no surprise; the children eventually starve to death, the audience cries, and people shout "masterpiece!". But this is no spoiler; the writer tactfully decided to remove any suspense from the story by letting you know the children were going to die in the opening scene of the movie.Now, children dying is quite sad, of course. But that's because they're children. Unless you're some kind of heartless mooncalf, people sympathize pretty well with children on a very fundamental level without them having to gain your adoration through development or emotional investment. But this is a pretty easy way out of those two things. Setsuko was designed to rip the salty water right out of the audience's tear ducts. She's adorable, innocent, and most importantly, helpless. But, from my perspective at least, this is a very effective ploy to incite feelings for characters that otherwise have no narrative value. And judging by the critical response to Grave of the Fireflies, it's a ploy that's worked quite well.But the biggest problem with the theory of Grave of the Fireflies being a masterpiece is the aforementioned choice (yes, I italicized that earlier for a reason). The fact that Seita and Setsuko's suffering is brought about due to a single choice Seita, who though young is certainly old enough to understand the gravity of his decisions, made willingly rather than a situation where he and his sister were at the mercy of their circumstances completely debases any sense of tragedy the film might have had. Seita is simply lazy and too proud to work for his upkeep, and rather than being responsible, he decides to essentially commit suicide and take his sister with him. The lack of sympathy I have for Seita is almost enough to undo my mourning for Setsuko.Another argument for Grave of the Fireflies' masterpiece theory is that it's a powerful "anti-war" film. This, like just about everything else people say about this film, is overblown and misrepresented in the work proper. There really isn't any strong anti-war statement in the film. We see bombings and death caused by war, but Seita and Setsuko's suffering is a direct cause of Seita's decisions and not the war itself. The only elements of the war we see in the film, the bombings, are merely a catalyst to set things into motion. Certainly, war is horrible, but Grave of the Fireflies does nothing to state this more than the fundamentality of war being bad that almost all of us acknowledge on a base level without help from a movie. This is not Schindler's List: The Anime, people. Get over it.I hate to add wood to this fire, but even the presentational values of Grave of the Fireflies are not very impressive. The animation is mediocre and pales in comparison to almost the entire body of Studio Ghibli's work. Given, this is in part due to the realistic, subtle art style used to allow us to relate to the characters as being human, but even so, the visual presentation of the film completely failed to impress me. The music sounds electronic, and while I appreciate the subtlety, it's almost completely dismissible. The only place where the film really excels is in the voice acting. The cast delivers very sincere performances and the actors are appropriately aged for the characters in the film.Dying children does not make something a tragedy. It's an easy way to elicit an emotional response. Dropping a few bombs does not make a statement against war. In this case, it's merely an inciting incident to get the characters moving. Combining these two elements does not make something a masterpiece. There are many examples of anime I can think of that offer much more poignant offerings of tragedy and anti-war sentiments (Gundam 0080 immediately comes to mind), so if that's really what you're looking for, I'd suggest you find some of them. You'll only find a paper-thin attempt here that covers itself by tossing out the kiddy card. Sorry, folks. A masterpiece this ain't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Grave of the Fireflies is, probably one of the most touching animes I have ever seen. The story takes place in Japan during the end of the WW2 and we get to meet a brother and his sister, trying to survive during the hard times and misery Japan faced at the bitter end of the war. The anime, who is from 1988, feels like it's delivering an old vibe of the anime style, and with a smooth roll the story develops and tightens up into something you never would've imagined before you pressed "Play". Too bad though that I had such big expectations on this piece. I've heard it's "so sad" and that you're about to cry for a lifetime, but hey it's a piece that won't get you to smile but it won't ruin your mood forever either! A 7 out of 10 - and it would've gotten higher points unless it didn't felt so short and empty of action from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but One-Dimensional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did enjoy it, but I felt like it was just a little too one-dimensional. There were moments of good animation, and moments of great storytelling, but it certainly was not pure magic as we have seen from Miyazaki films, nor do I feel it is something "profound" in any way.I felt like there really wasn't much depth to this story. Here's some bad stuff.. and some more bad stuff.. but look, the bad stuff is happening to good people. Depressing for sure, and I got some of the points, but they just weren't enough for me to rate this movie more highly.It sort of reminded me of movies like "In the Company of Men" where they take a depressing idea and beat you over the head with it. Unlike that movie, though, I didn't come away from the movie with some sort of embarrassment on behalf of mankind, etc. The movie went down paths I've been before in much deeper movies, and while the story was quaint and interesting, it simply is not a masterpiece by any stretch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Film, In Spite of its Sentimentality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One common criticism of this movie is the sentimentality. I did find while watching the movie that the child's constant crying did become annoying after a while. Some people are more easily influenced by sentimentality than others, but the sob elements in Grave of the Fireflies seem too excessive to be realistic. The child behaves too much like a child, almost as if the maker wanted to emphasize that the victim was a child to artificially heighten emotions. Towards the end though the sentimentality becomes more effective.My dad walked out on the movie because it was an anime. Anime and cartoons are often seen as childish and some people are too proud of themselves to watch movies they perceive as childish. Dad returned halfway through the movie but complained that nothing was happening, so he left again. All viewers are different. Hollywood executives are aware that a significant proportion of viewers are averse to a movie in which nothing big happens. This leads to a situation in which action (mainly violent action with explosions) is often interspersed throughout a movie -- maybe a chase scene added in the middle of a boring dialogue session or a sex scence for shock effect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Am I the only person who felt nothing but disgust for Seita's having killed his little sister Setsuko? Seita (and Setsuko) received regular meals at his aunt's house, but he refused to do anything to help out despite her and his community really needing help. So they were fed rice. His aunt clearly explained if he helped out he would get the more tasty food that the others who worked in her family did.What does he do? He takes Setsuko away and they live on a riverbank where he decides to steal food to feed the two of them. He does nothing for the community. Ultimately he cannot steal enough to support the two of them, and first she, and then he, die of malnutrition.Yes, the death of Setsuko was very touching (and beautiful in its own way). But she died solely because of Seita's laziness and greed, and I hold nothing but contempt for his character.</fullReview>

Just an exercise in futility.I feel like it took more than and gave. Even if this was an example of a true historical occurrence, this would be one that is rather extreme and not the norm. And if it is close to the norm for that time period, why would I want to watch it. It just seems to trying to pile one horrible occurrence after another. The acting is adequate and the artwork and animation is fine. The main problem is the writing. I don't mind a dark ending, but when there is no hope anywhere in the story, there's no reason to continue watching.

Perhaps it's the first five minutes of the movie that "ruined" that element for me. It was made perfectly clear what was going to happen by the end, so expecting it made it less sad.

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because I will try almost anything once. Based on reviews and comments, I expected a powerful and engaging experience. Instead, I found a movie that was much too relaxed, undramatic, and occasionally too sentimental to be sincere.(Spoiler ahead)Many parts felt unfinished, like the death of the father. This was probably to be expected, but the father is never seen, and this was tossed up so fast that there's very little emotional impact. The only truly shocking moment of the film was with the death of the mother.(End spoiler)This is strange. Due to its modest length, this movie should've been able to tell all it needed to tell. Instead, the story felt remarkably short. Knowing the ending to the story before it even begins is a bit disconcerting as well. All in all, I didn't find the movie I was hoping for. So far, Princess Mononoke remains my favorite anime movie. And considering I'm not an anime fan, that's quite an achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, there's this boy and his little sister, and they go through a lot of suffering during World War II, after their mother dies during a bombardment. However, that's not really the reason for their suffering.They have no place to stay, because they don't want to stay with their evil aunt. But that's not the reason either.They suffer because they're starving. Ah, they have no money for food, and that's why they're suffering! Well, actually... Let me try again.It's tough to lose a family member, during war or anytime else. You could have made a perfectly good film around that alone. Then there's the aunt. How is she evil? Oh, she's angry that the boy hangs around home all day, doing nothing. She also sells the clothes of the boy's late mother (her own sister, I take it) for food, and only gives half to the boy. That makes her evil. (Who wrote this script, an angry teenager?)And then they've got no food.Let's face it, there's really no good reason for them to go through so much suffering, except to make the audience sad.Making innocent characters suffer is a sure way to engage the audience -- however, it's a cheap trick, and a shallow substitute for proper characterisation. The only character we get to know is the protagonist, and by the end of the film, he still seems like a bit of a cipher. Okay, so he loves his sister a lot, briefly mourned the death of his mother, and kinda looks up to his father... but mostly, he just loves his sister. Oh, yeah, and he's going to die (we learn this from the beginning). The next hour and a half is his slowly drawn out death sequence.All other characters are ciphers, easily summed up in a word or two: The sister? (Sickeningly) cute. The aunt? Evil. Farmer? Wise. Their late mother? Nothing less than perfect.The film sucker-punches the audience to cover for its outrageous characters and aimless plot, with the sole intention of making the audience sad. I guess it worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is the film Grave Of The Fireflies, a Japanese War film from the perspectives of back at Japan, and follows 2 kids trying to get through it after their mother died and not knowing what happened to their father.Okay, My opinion is that it is NOWHERE near the depressing war film everybody is describing (watch something like Downfall if you want depressing). When a family takes these 2 kids in they want to leave after a while and lives in an air raid shelter that leads to the young sister's death for lack of food, as a character said "why don't they just go back and apologise?" or something like that, usually I care for characters deaths more if it wasn't something that could be easily avoided I have seen much better films out of this genre. I could complain that they completely demonise the other side when shown. Aside from the 2 protagonists being young kids there would be no reason to care for them in this movie.Oh and another point that just came to mind. What was the point of the animation? An animated War film sounds ridiculous, I like movies that may sound ridiculous as long as it is pulled off but however it is not pulled off here.I'm guessing that because this movie has such a high rating on IMDb that I am going to get bashed for this, maybe you might have cared for the characters but for me in some way I didn't care a bit for the characters.Here is also another thing, The fact that you realise all the main characters will die within the first line "September the 12th 1945, that was the night that I died" just as a quote for how obvious it is, The movie as one critic pointed out is 2 kids slowly dying, I would rather watch a movie with development to the characters before they die instead of this where you have 90 minutes of nothing but kids dying.Don't expect the hype around this movie because that will make you disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoiler, though you know about a character(s) death in the 1st 15 seconds anyways) This is NOT a story about 2 kids fighting for survival in war-torn Japan. This is not about kids begging for food. This is not about kids scrounging for food. This is not about kids staying with adults who feed them. This is not about kids who line up to get their rations. This is not about kids who go to an intact city with their money and buy food.This is the story of a moron who unfortunately had the care of his kid sister. The social commentary here is that society was so broken down that it did not notice the brother abusing his little sister.This got a 4 for story and animation. It did not get a higher rating because I really do not like stories about helpless morons who cannot do what it takes to survive but who refuse to see they are unable to care for anyone else. I also did not like that most of the reviews make the moron/murderer into a hero and seem to admire him. I felt deceived by the reviews as I was expecting a sad story of kids who TRY to survive but are unable to. I did not expect a story of a kid who refuses to survive except on his own terms and who makes his loved one live those same terms. He must have been a clueless elitist. Other Japanese were/ are quite good at survival.Within about the 1st 15 minutes, you can tell Seita is a moron and too good to work. It just takes awhile to get to the murderer part. I should have followed my instinct to stop watching the movie when he puts his sister in danger gawking when planes are flying overhead. I really wanted to bash his head in at that moment --- Let me think: save sister vs shoes; save sister vs. watch planes, save sister vs talking to people...hmmm. Perhaps there is another statement in the movie -- that Japanese males were/are like this -- shoes before baby sister.Mothers will starve for their children . . . why do so many reviews seem to admire Seita and call this a struggle to survive? I thought the movie was more a statement that in war, some people will always choose to die, re: Seita, but most of society moves on. Unfortunately, the deathwishers will also sometimes take other people with them, usually those they love the most. Ah...I finally figured this movie out -- this is a drawn out story of a murder/suicide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Throughout the film the kid's given opportunity after opportunity to get money for food...to work instead of living off his relatives and instead he just loafs around like a bum. Sure he's a kid, and its sad, but mostly the movie just made me angry at the main character for what he was doing to his sister through his laziness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stop The Madness Of Good Votes For This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this had been a live action movie done with the style, acting, and gravitas of, say, "Schindler's List", it would deserve a place in the IMDb.com Top 10. And it could have been done that way with very few special effects. But it wasn't, and that's exactly what I find wrong with it. I feel that this was a horrible, horrible choice of material for an animated feature. Shouldn't an animated feature give us what can't be done in live action as movies like "Spirted Away", old Disney features, and anything by Pixar so incredibly do? As it was, I could not help but feel the strain as the movie makers tried to turn this into a movie that gets the viewer completely sucked into the emotional aspect of it all. Personally, I got more choked up watching "Spirited Away", and for that matter, "Finding Nemo"!I understand why and how badly people want to like this movie, but for me it didn't work at all. And I find the elevated ratings for it ridiculous. There are much better anime flicks out there than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People say this is a good movie so I bought the DVD to watch it for my first time. A WW2 anime has some potential. But this is about this kid stealing food and getting yelled at like the whole time. It moves so slowly and it's just so BORING. And the animation is not even anything special. It's surely not as good as Princess Mononoke, Ghost in the Shell, Vampire Hunter D, or just about any other anime movie I have seen. On a scale of 1 to 10, this movie is horrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps because I had such high hopes for the movie, but I was so utterly disappointed by this movie. The kids? In a deplorable situation, abandoned by all. But as the relative pointed out, the boy could have tried to find any kind of work to afford things to eat. Before the strike in his neighborhood, he had worked at the local factory, after-all. He kept on waiting for his father, lamenting his sad state of affairs, but in effect, not doing anything about it. Also, the voice of Setsuko really started to get on my nerves about twenty minutes into the movie. Oh, boohoo. The boy was so obviously in denial about everything, the death of his mother, no contact from his mother, his sick sister. I got quickly sick of this movie. To me, the stubbornness and denial of the boy character represented the Japanese Empire's attitude towards reality before, during and maybe even after the war. To that end, I felt no sympathy for the children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[/!\ Spoiler ahead] The plot is a pretext to make a melodrama.From the beginning, anyone can foresee what is going to occur at the end. The movie is a boringly long succession of clichés and deja-vus aimed at making cry the most hardened men.None of the soundtrack, scenes or characters are unforgettable. The idea of the fireflies, among other important symbols, should have been exploited more powerfully. The fireflies are actually treated as a mere element of the setting. Same reproach as regards the historical background.It is no hard a task to make a sad film if its main character is a child who eventually dies, nothing to be proud of. This movie is a piece of gratuitous cruelty and pointlessness. Too dark for kids, too childish for grown-ups.The short music clip passage after the death of the girl (when we see her happy, playing innocently and fading to transparency as a ghost) is ludicrous. Awful! It reminds me of the black &amp; white scenes in Baywatch to evoke happy remembrances. It is as though, at the end of the movie, they judged that its emotional impact was not sufficient and added this scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why do they start the way? If they know what would happen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>if i didn't remember it wrong, the Japanese is the ones who started the war. (unless the story is talking about some fictional country.) They started invading and killing innocent people. Now they're telling this one sided bull crap about how they become the victim of the war? Just a deluded idea to start with! The movie has great visual, and the typical cute Japanese characters. All serve to create such illusion. Plot is okay, if it's describing the Jews all other groups people, I would give it a higher rating. But for now, my prejudice play a major role, and I can't seem to get the premise out of the way when I'm watching it. I just don't understand, if they're aware of the gore and destructions a war brings, why start one in the first place? Or do they think the lives of people from others nations doesn't matter as much? Either way, I'm writing this review as if I don't have sympathy toward humanity, but the reality of history tells another story. And I respect history more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People suffer during war...get over it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an opening scene, the Americans are firebombing a Japanese wooded city. One of those made of wood buildings and so this is one of the great war crimes. Far worse than dropping of nuclear weapons in terms of the number of people killed.One Japanese women in the movie asks "Why?".Of course the Kamikaze campaign, the torture of prisoners and civilians alike, the tendency for Japanese soldiers not to surrender even in defeat causing huge loss of life on the part of the US and Allied forces, combined with the near bankruptcy of the US government and the fast approaching, vastly superior military might of the soviets (who actually won WWII, at least in Europe) meant that the US were doing whatever they could to force the Japanese to surrender.But such things are not examined in this "we are not really the bad guys" version of Japan's history.Such a retelling of history was so jarring to me that I turned off this movie. Maybe it is a great movie, and yes the innocent suffer greatly during war..but without showing the same suffering outside of Japan the movie ends up lacking balance, it is like a bully crying to a teacher when someone hits them back.</fullReview>
