		<shortDescription>A highly important movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*High Sierra* is almost excruciatingly important in the development of cinema, laying to bed the "gangster picture" of the 1930's while simultaneously giving birth to American film noir. Oh, and it made Humphrey Bogart a major star while it was at it. Therefore, I'm not entirely sure that your film collection, if you have one, can survive without it.Based on a pulpy novel, it chronicles the story of Roy Earle, sprung from a life sentence in prison so that he can knock over a casino along the California-Nevada border. It's easy to miss, but notice the first minute of this picture closely: it's of course the Governor -- bought off by a mobster -- who gets Roy released from his life sentence, indicating that the corruption has finely infested the top of the social order. This is the usual tough-minded, whistle-blowing gangster-picture stuff that Warner Bros. specialized in. But there's also something else at work here, perhaps something new: one gets the sense that what happens to Roy in this movie has been engineered from On High, in advance . . . in other words, he's in the Jaws of Fate. And thus we're in the unforgiving world of Film Noir.More than the opening scene, it's Bogart who almost single-handedly invents film noir with his groundbreaking work in *High Sierra*. Not cocky like Cagney and Muni, not psychopathic like the early Edward G. Robinson, not as smooth as Raft, Bogart is a ruthless professional with a wide stripe of sentimentality. His Roy never shirks from killing, but he doesn't get off on it. He's more a rebel than a gangster, a poetic soul denied respectability, a man longing for the innocence of his youth. Unfortunately, he thinks he finds in the personage of a transplanted Okie farm-girl (Joan Leslie) a reasonable facsimile of that innocence. Competing for his affections is Ida Lupino, a sour "dime-a-dance girl" who's been up, down, and around the block a time or three. She's the baggage that comes with the two new-generation hoods whom Bogart is assigned to babysit for the casino heist. Not until later in the picture does Bogart recognize Lupino's better suitability to his own temperament and experience. (They share in common, among other things, suicidal impulses, a desire to escape a corrupted world.)Roy Earle was a new type of character -- the truly romantic criminal. Bogart would play variations on Earle throughout his career, though he rarely exceeded his triumph here. And while I've given the actor much of the credit, some more credit must be extended to the screenwriter, John Huston. *High Sierra* was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.Oh, and did I mention that the movie -- aside from its importance in American film history, yadda yadda -- is quite simply a good time? Witty dialogue, great on-location direction by Raoul Walsh, a cute dog, and a climactic car chase that wouldn't be equaled until 1968's *Bullitt*, are just some of this movie's other virtues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"High Sierra" was the film that changed the course of Bogart's career and lifted him up to stardom?As Earle, Bogart was expanding on the criminal characterization he had already mastered in a dozen earlier films, giving it greater depth by adding contrasting elements of warmth and compassion to compensate the dominant violence? Bogart helps a clubfooted girl, Velma (Joan Leslie), who repays him only with disregard and indifference?Bogart's interpretation already showed signs of the special qualities that were to become an important part of his mystique in a few more films?Here, for the first time, was the human being outside society's laws who had his own private sense of loyalty, integrity, and honor? Bogart's performance turns "High Sierra" into an elegiac film? As a film, "High Sierra" has other notable qualities, particularly Ida Lupino's strong and moving performance as Marie, the girl who brings out Roy Earle's more human emotions? The movie was remade as a Western, "Colorado Territory," with Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo, and as a crime film in "I Died a Thousand Times," with Jack Palance and Shelley Winters in the Bogart and Lupino roles? Neither came up to the stylish treatment given "High Sierra" by director Raoul Walsh from an exceptionally good script by John Huston and W. R. Burnett?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>W.R. Burnett's novel High Sierra is maybe his best book; it's certainly a classic of its type, and very readable and moving even today. The movie version of the book isn't quite as good, but it does something few adaptations do: it captures the spirit of the original.The story is about a John Dillinger-like criminal, Roy Earle, just released from prison, and his planning of his last 'heist', as he moves from the Midwest to California. It's as much a character study as anything else, and here the book is better, as Burnett seems to get inside the heart and soul of Roy Earle in ways that screenwriter John Huston and director Raoul Walsh can't. This isn't their fault. Burnett gives us Earle's inner life in interior monologues, and movies simply can't do this. Nevertheless, we get a feeling for Earle, a lonely, extremely sentimental and romantic man, essentially a frontier type, or with more brains an artist, who cannot fit into modern life. The reason is simple: he doesn't understand it. He is driven by two things, strong emotions and extreme professionalism. The problem is that his profession is crime. Between these two extremes he is unsocialized, or rather doesn't understand the subtlety of contemporary life. To put it in current parlance, he's not hip, which is to say he has no detachment, no capacity for pulling back and reflecting, unless, that is, he is in love, and even then he gets it wrong by misunderstanding an attractive, crippled girl's reliance on him for love, and taking her country girl disposition for naivite (i.e. like him), which isn't true. This tragic aspect of Roy Earle is beautifully and perceptively described by Burnett, and while it's present in the film, it makes Roy seem obtuse, while the truth is his emotions run deep, and are sincere. He wants to give up crime and marry a small-town girl so that he can go back and get it right again. In the lead role Humphrey Bogart gives a major performance. Superficially he's wrong for Roy Earle: too urban, flip, smart and clever. But he trades in his natural big city persona for a moony, brooding romanticism, and it works. He doesn't seem the least bit sophisticated, and in his quieter moments he comes off like a man who can kill the way other men write checksHe has a true girl-friend in Ida Lupino, but he doesn't realize that she's more his type: life-weary, straightforward, deep and caring. He prefers the one he can't get, and this gets him in trouble, as his commitment to her puts him in a dreamy, dissociative state that is dangerous for a man in his line of work. The story builds on little things, and the bucolic mountain and small-town setting of the film is terra incognita for Roy, and we sense this even if he doesn't. He is, for all his professionalism, way out of his league, and is looking back to his idealized, romanticized early life, and longing for an ideal girl that he can 'fix', rather than doing the right thing and going off with Lupino and stating anew, which is his only chance for happiness.Roy is a man who lives in two parallel worlds, the real, vicious one he must cope with, and the fantasy one he longs for and sees in the crippled girl he so tenderly loves. There is no in-between for him, as his head is in the clouds much of the time. It is therefore fitting that the movie ends up literally in the clouds, or so it seems, atop a mountain, as Roy shoots it out with reality one last time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything that was good about the Warner Brothers' machine comes together here. A gangster movie, "High Sierra" doesn't fit the template of earlier ones like "Public Enemy", "Little Caesar" or "The Petrified Forest." Roy Earle is a remarkably complicated character. In love with a shallow girl, he eventually comes to accept the affections of Ida Lupino and, finally, the mongrel Pard, who proves his undoing. Bogart could be pretty good as a comedic actor but you wouldn't know it from his performance here, which is the working out of a tragedy. The script is by John Huston and it shows. He was a good writer. That little lesson Earl teaches the youngsters about how a Thompson submachine gun goes off (he taps his fingers three times on the table) is memorable. There are other good lines. Bogart and the young girl have a folksy little exchange about how, if you watch the stars long enough, you can almost feel the earth turning beneath you. The Doc, Henry Hull, describes Earle as "rushing towards death." Okay, Dillinger said it first, but it was Huston who put it in the script. Mediocre score but good photography. Skidding cars leave clouds of dust during the final chase. (The road to Whitney Portals is now paved.) And without intending to, the movie makes one nostalgic for the simpler world of 1941. Not simply unpaved roads, but a different world all around. When was the last time we saw a "small town" that was not a bedroom community, part of urban sprawl?A good movie. Catch it if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie Goes From Bad To Good Guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aw, the film that launched stardom for Humphrey Bogart and changed him from the perpetual villain to the "good guy."The movie doesn't feature a lot of action but it keeps your interest. You have two women in here: the hard-boiled Ida Lupino and the soft-and-sweet Joan Leslie. Both are entertaining to watch and both demonstrate a few surprises in the personalities of the characters they are playing. Bogart does the same: goes back and forth between tough guy and softy.Another key member of this unusual crime story/film noir is "Pard:" a little dog! Human supporting roles are supplied by some familiar and solid actors such as Arthur Kennedy, Alan Curtis, Henry Hull, Henry Travers, Barton MacLane and Cornel Wilde. Most of the people in here, including "Pard," are that endearing but there are so many different angles to this story, it's always interesting to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ida Lupino easily equals Lauren Bacall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to bear in mind is that there are actually TWO movies."High sierra" and its western remake "Colorado territory" (1949),both Walsh 's works.The latter is probably superior to the former,since the final is more impressive,but you should not underestimate it though;Humphrey Bogart is much better than Joel McCrea and Ida Lupino is at least as good as Virginia Mayo:actually,except for Lauren Bacall,Ingrid Bergman and Katherine Hepburn,rarely a Bogart's female partner had such an intensity,such a presence :sometimes she even steals the show,particularly in the last scenes.There are two female parts in Walsh's movie -as in the remake,in which the second one is played by none other than Dorothy Malone- Lupino's bad gal with a strong heart,whose stature keeps on growing during the whole movie:a gangster's moll at the beginning of the story,she becomes a tragic character whose pursuit of happiness is moving at the end.On the other hand the crippled girl,who seems a sweet ,romantic (check the scene of the stars),and touching heroine,becomes an hateful silly goose when she's had the operation.And she 's changed physically as well:she grew into a sophisticated girl,we hardly know her in her last scene.The car chases are masterfully filmed ,the grandiose landscapes lovingly filmed as if they were seen through Bogart's eye ,this man who had been in jail for a long time and who longed for freedom...this freedom he would earn anyway.Ida Lupino's last words will move you to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogey is picked to lead a jewel heist at a resort. When he meets the rag tag team he has to work with, he senses trouble brewing. This is the film that brought attention to Bogart's leading man skills and Huston's peerless writing. Many remember the classic ending with Bogart hiding out in the mountains for one final stand against the law (and fate). Ida Lupino is one of my favorite actresses from the 40's and does fine work here (and looks stunning). Many fine moments with Bogey...including a memorable speech within his cabin hideout. This is one of the best portraits of a desperate outlaw in film history. A blueprint for all the antihero films that would follow over the years...great fun! Seek it out and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart Stands Out In An Interesting &amp; Well-Crafted Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even aside from its impact on Humphrey Bogart's career and on the noir genre, "High Sierra" is an entertaining and interesting movie that is worth seeing in its own right. Bogart's portrayal of Roy Earle, along with Ida Lupino, a talented supporting cast, and some well-chosen settings, are all fit together nicely to tell an interesting story.Though it's hard now to experience Bogart's gangster roles as they would have appeared to their original audiences, it's still easy to see why this and similar roles attracted so much attention at the time. The character is interesting to begin with, and Bogart makes him even more so. The tension between Earle's ruthlessness and his sense of fairness, and between his desires and his practicality, makes for some interesting possibilities.Bogart makes good use of these opportunities with his distinctive style. The other characters and the plot developments furnish plenty of material that develop Earle's character and give Bogart lots to work with. Even the sequences that might seem unlikely or out of place are used to add depth to the character and the story.The climactic sequence in the mountains ties everything together nicely, in a very appropriate setting. "High Sierra" is the kind of movie that classic movie fans can enjoy both for the chance to see its influence on later movies and for its own interesting and well-crafted story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Mad Dog' Meets a Poetic Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart's screen name in High Sierra is Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle. But it's clear from the outset that if Bogart is anything he's not crazy. Bogart may have been a wild guy in his youth, but he's now a middle-aged man who is fully aware that he can't do anything else, but continue in a life crime. He's got the resume and the reputation for that and nothing else. What else can he do, but accept an offer to crew chief a heist at an expensive resort hotel in Nevada.He can't pick the men he'd like, they're probably all dead or in the joint. He gets some young punks assigned to him by Barton MacLane who is acting as a middleman for boss Donald MacBride out on the west coast. Bogey gets Alan Curtis, Arthur Kennedy, and an informant at the hotel, Cornel Wilde. Curtis and Kennedy are getting their hormones in overdrive over Ida Lupino.On the way west Bogey meets up with a near do well family headed by Henry Travers and he starts crushing out on teenager Joan Leslie. They represent to him a simpler time before he took up crime as a living. The first half of the film sets up the characters, the second part is the robbery and it's aftermath. In that second half High Sierra moves at a really good clip. Not too many went out for popcorn when it was shown in theaters back in the day.High Sierra was one of three films that George Raft turned down and were given to Humphrey Bogart that established him as a leading man. The other two were The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca. Raft must have had some agent back in the day.Of course Bogart is playing a gangster, but this one is a three dimensional character and a fine piece of work. It represented a big advance from some of the villains he played at Warner Brothers during the late Thirties.High Sierra was directed by Raoul Walsh and another Hollywood icon director, John Huston, co-wrote the screenplay. There's a lot of similarity with this and Huston's later classic, The Asphalt Jungle.High Sierra was remade twice, as a western with the miscast Joel McCrea in Bogart's role and in the Fifties as I Died a Thousand Times with Jack Palance. I daresay it could be made again quite easily for this generation, it's story is timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a great Bogart vehicle. But what makes Bogart look good is the fine screenplay. Not having read Burnett's book is a disadvantage for me to judge the contribution of Burnett and John Huston to the screenplay. Being familiar with Huston's screenplays, I tend to think it was Huston who probably made all the difference to the screenplay.Huston loved to play on the good side of men that became sometimes comical and sometimes their folly. In "High Sierra" the goodness in the "mad dog" is played up: the bad guy looks good. Huston did that with aplomb in "The Man who would be King". At the same time he reverses the role of the poor girl with the clubfoot into an ungrateful woman. Only animals remain the same...The lines are made for Bogart's style. The direction of Walsh is not bad but not striking either. I will remember the film for the strong screenplay alone, without which the film would have floundered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent star vehicle for Bogart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a very complex film for its time that combines elements of the old tried and true gangster film, film noir, and melodrama. It makes for good viewing today and is a very good showcase of Bogart's versatility as an actor. The main character is Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle (Bogart), a man released from prison by a wealthy old associate so that he can pull off a big jewelry heist at a resort near the California/Nevada state line. On his cross-country trek to reach the destination of the robbery, Roy meets the Goodhue family. The Goodhues have lost their farm and are on the way to stay with relatives that just happen to live near Roy's destination. When Roy arrives where the rest of the mob is staying, he finds two tough-guy wanna-bes, Babe and Red, that are constantly fighting over a girl - Marie Garson (Ida Lupino). At first the younger hired guns don't respect Roy. They think he is old and washed up. However, he soon shows them who is in charge and they don't challenge him again.Only a few of the minor characters are painted totally good or bad - such as the elder Goodhues on one extreme and Babe and Red on the other. The major characters have subtle shades of both good and evil in their personalities. This is particularly true of Roy. He longs for the simple life among good people that the Goodhues remind him of, yet during the course of the robbery he must pull off and its aftermath he thinks nothing of killing in order to accomplish his aim. Roy is actually capable of great kindness, helping out the Goodhues when they get in an auto accident and don't have any insurance, and even paying for Velma's operation to remove a birth defect so that she can walk normally. Roy falls in love with Velma, one of the Goodhues' relatives, believing her to be a simple and decent girl. However, he finds she changes into the most hard-boiled of people once her handicap is removed. Her final rebuff to Roy is filled with almost unwatchable cruelty.The woman who actually cares for Roy is Marie. It takes time for Roy to accept this, since it seems hard for him to believe that people can have both good and bad in them, even though this is very much a trait of Roy's own character. Marie has a background completely opposite that of Velma's, mentioning how she was beaten by her father as a child and then went on to work for a "dime a dance" place before winding up with Red and Babe. She has great heart, but she lacks judgment, which she herself admits. The odd piece of symbolism built into this movie is Pard, the "hard-luck dog", who has seen each of his owners die untimely deaths. In spite of this, Roy makes a pet of the dog, seeming to confirm the fact that he is indeed "running towards death". In the end, it is this friendly little dog that is in fact Roy's undoing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that made Bogart a top-billing star.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imaging these days but there was a time when Humphrey Bogart was nothing more than an actor who always played secondary character roles, in the shadow of the movie its main character. For instance behind George Raft, who was a much bigger star at the time but also female leads such as Ida Lupino, who also stars in this movie. But Raft then turned down roles for movies such as this movie "High Sierra", "The Maltese Falcon" and "Casablanca". All roles that were then past on to Bogart instead. Roles that truly launched his career to an amazing height, surpassing George Raft by far. Still, he didn't received top-billing for this movie yet. That honor once more went to Ida Lupino, even though Bogart's role is much bigger and is unquestionably the main character of the movie. Ida Lupino was just a better selling name, which says something of the time period and point of Bogart's career this movie got made in. This movie really marked his big breakthrough and after this he would mostly only land roles as a top-billing actor, in movies such as "Casablanca", "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and "The Maltese Falcon".But what makes this movie so great is not just Bogart but also really the movie its story and directing from Raoul Walsh.The story is written by John Huston, who is better known as an actor and director than a writer, even though he wrote the screenplay for many fine movies. This is also truly one of those movies. It's really no formulaic story and truly highly original and therefor also compelling. The main character is in love with a girl who isn't in love with him, while there is another girl who is in love with him, though his heart is still with this other girl. Sounds melodramatic and perhaps confusing but it's something really refreshing to see and makes the story and character developments progress in a way you wouldn't always expect it to. On top of that there is a main plot-line involving a robbery but really the movie is mostly about its central character. This movie just has basically everything in its story that is needed to make a great movie with. Add to that the performance from Bogart and the fantastic directing from Raoul Walsh and you have a great, tense, entertaining, fast going and original classic movie.It's not really fully a film-noir, since that genre was still pretty much non-existent at that time and was still a work in progress. This movie does show some noir tendencies, mostly with its lead character, female roles and the main plot line involving a robbery but it's not quite noir enough in its style to fully consider this a pure film-noir. It's the other Humphrey Bogart from later in the same year, "The Maltese Falcon" that is widely considered to be one of the first real film-noir's. Ironicly it was a movie directed by John Huston, the man who wrote the screenplay for this movie.The movie also features some surprising good action sequences. You have to remember that this is an 1941, when the action genre was still something non-existent but director Raoul Walsh knows to create a couple of good looking action sequences with camera-positions and editing you would expect from an action movie that is being made this present day. Especially the car chases within this movie are memorable.Interestingly enough director Raoul Walsh himself remade this movie 8 years later into a western movie "Colorado Territory", that might not be as good as this original but it's just as good, intriguing and entertaining on its own and remains an under-appreciated movie.A real perfect classic and still an unique movie to watch.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roy Earle, a man out of prison, and out of his time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy Earle is released early from prison thanks to a rather shifty pardon. A job is there to be done, maybe Roy's last one before finally finding love and straightening out?, but Roy is finding out that this is a different world to the one he left behind, the one before he entered the Big House for his stretch. Crooks he's not familiar with and women turning his head, hell even a canine has him at odds with his machismo sensibility, but all of it will come crashing together amongst the magnificent High Sierra!.It's a really funny thing now, you buy two DVDs and they both tell you that the respective film from 1941 is the breakout role for Humphrey Bogart. I am of course referring to both this fabulous film and the equally brilliant, Maltese Falcon, what a double that is eh!. Truth is, is that both films merely showcase what a talent the great man was, and crucially, that he could imbue his characters with terrific results. Here as Roy Earle i personally feel Bogey gives one of his best 40s performances, made to look far more aged than he was {well done Perc Westmore}, he manages to make Earle a tough and gritty man, yet at the same time he pulls the audience on side with a hardened professionalism that has us admiring the obvious qualities that reside within him.Directed by the great Raoul Walsh, scripted by one John Huston, and starring Humphrey Bogart, it's obvious that this take on W.R. Burnett's novel is in safe hands, playing out as one of the gangster genre's last hurrahs, it's clear to me that some future great Western directors were clearly taking notes, for what drives High Sierra to being great is it's man out of his time pulse, sensitivity seams thru the picture without ever cloying the tension and feel of the picture, the best Adult Westerns would theme this arc with considerably great results. Backing Bogart up is the top billed Ida Lupinio {strong and perfect foil}, while the likes of Alan Curtis, Arthur Kennedy, Henry Hull, Cornel Wilde, Henry Travers and Joan Leslie {badly overacting without hurting the production} help up to put High Sierra firmly in the drawer that holds classic crime pictures from a golden age. Not just a close look at deep and elegiac characters, High Sierra does not lack in the action department either, in fact Walsh does an incredible job of knitting together heart and gusto with intelligent results. Come the finale at Mount Whitney {High Sierra a constant looming presence in the film}, the thrills have more than catered for the inclined seekers of that particular bent, but ultimately as the credits role, Walsh's camera leaves us in no doubt as to what has driven Roy, and High Sierra, to it's point of meaning, a special and great movie indeed, 9/10</fullReview>

Sprung by a crooked Governor, Roy Earle (Humphrey Bogart) is out to do one more job.What really caught my eye, however, was the fact that he went to the park first, and was watching stars, and was amazed at the mountains. A clue to those not in the know, that jail is the worst place to be.Bogey also got out in that this picture, probably the first film noir, sprung him into the spotlight and allowed him to go one and make the great Casablanca, as well as The African Queen, The Caine Muntiny, and many more.Imagine getting second billing to Ida Lupino, who was really go in this film, but not in Bogey's class. Even Pard (Zero the Dog) could not match Bogey, as cute as he was.This is a great caper film, with backstabbing and tons of action, and a great car chase up the mountains. It should be seen by everyone who loves film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie reaches film stardom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People mistakenly think that the two films that made Humphrey Bogart a star were "The Maltese Falcon" and "Casablanca". In fact it is this film, made the same year as "The Maltese Falcon" and directed by Raoul Walsh, not John Huston and Michael Curtiz. Based on a novel by W.R.Burnett (author of "Little Caesar" and "The Asphalt Jungle"), it is quite well written. Roy Earle (Bogie) is a clone of Dillinger (like Bogie's first notable role of "Duke Mantee" in "The Petrified Forrest"). He has been in prison, but he gets an early release (by bribes) engineered by an old friend (Donald MacBride, in a good serious performance). MacBride is planning the robbery of a luxury resort, and needs Bogart to do it. But Bogart finds that MacBride's assistant (an ex-cop played by Barton MacLane) is untrustworthy. He also worries about the young men he has to work with - especially a too friendly inside man (Cornell Wilde in one of his first roles). And on top of everything else there is the matter of a young girl with a club foot (Joan Leslie) that could be Bogart's daughter. He falls for her, and wants to help cure her. He can when he has the cash - he has a friendly doctor (Henry Hull) to assist him. But he is so hung up about the girl that he ignores the signs of another, tougher woman (Ida Lupino) who does show an interest in him. Also, he tries to ignore the stories of demons and doom regarding an adorable little dog that a caretaker (Willie Best) tells him.The film is a first rate one, just a smidge less impressive than "The Maltese Falcon" and "Casablanca" because of the strength of the script. "High Sierra" is well written, but it has no memorable quotes, like, "Of all the gin joints...." or "I enjoy talking to a man...." Willie Best's details about the ill-luck pursuing the dog is the best stretch of real dialogue in the film, and today (due to feelings about racial stereotyping concerning Best) many people tend to overlook how it sets the stage for later levels of the tragedy in the film.The only problem I have regarding it is Jerome Cowan. He is given one of the lead positions in the credits, but his role (a reporter who appears in the last ten minutes of the film) doesn't merit it. He also has dialogue directed to Ida Lupino suggesting they met or know each other somehow. There appears to have been cut scenes in the film. Was Cowan in those cut scenes?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster's movies specialist Raoul Walsh reaches his highest level on this (not-so)typical story that tells the story of an outlaw (Humphrey Bogart) that has just come out of prison and gotta make one last hold-up. In principle everything in High Sierra follows the patterns of this glorious genre, but after watching it several times you come to the conclussion that this movie is much darker than the most of gangster's movies. This Gangster, this Roy Earle (Bogart at his best) is not heartless and cruel as james Cagney's Scarface (for example). No. This Roy Earle really wants to quit on being an outlaw. He wants to go back to the farm where he grew up, and start a new life. He meets a decent girl (Joan Leslie) and falls in love with her... But leaving the underworld is not that easy. Once you've killed and robbed, you're forever marked. And that's the cross that Earle's gotta carry. Finally he realizes that this life he's dreaming about, the good girl, the farm, kids running around... it's not gonna be possible. So he put up with being an outlaw and loving the bad girl, the flirtitious one (Ida Lupino, great woman)... , the one that really loves him, because she understands him, because they both came from the same place. Much more than a simple ganster's movie, High Sierra is a drama about what means to be a marked man. Raoul Walsh does an outstanding job (as expected from such a giant). The script is signed by none other than Mr. John Huston, and "perfect" would be the aproppiate word to define it. The dialogues are powerful, dinamic, maybe a "little" sexist, but it was 1941 and, anyway, Roy Earle treats women much more gently than many of men. Lupino's and Bogart's characters are just amazing; and they both perform one of their best jobs. The car chasing at the end of the film is one of the best sequences ever, and there's no doubt it's been copied hundreds of times in subsequent films.So if we have Raoul Walsh, Humphrey Bogart, and John Huston nothing can possibly go wrong. High Sierra = EssentialMy Rate: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an exceptional crime movie, more than anything for what the writers, Walsh and Bogart do with the protagonist, and romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roy "Mad Dog" Earle usually isn't the kind of guy you want to say the wrong thing to on the street or in a store. He's an ex-convict, with a record of robberies and other criminal endeavors, and now that he just got busted out by a crime boss he respects, he wants to pull off this next score and maybe call it quits. He has that stone-cold face of a man with plenty of grit in his system, and he won't settle for an shenanigans- or anyone messing around with a woman the wrong way. Raoul Walsh, the filmmaker, and screenwriters John Huston and WR Burnett know this very well about the character, that he's the tough guy who SHOULD be the villain of the story. But he isn't, and High Sierra marks a crucial step in the crime films of the 30s and 40s by making Earle more than just a brutish guy with money squarely on his professional mind. He's also one who can be vulnerable, and fall in love, or possibly be one to deep down deny how he might "crash" at some point. We see this last part very clearly and compellingly when Earle is sleeping, and in some kind of bad dream, and the woman he's with looks on at him, drifting in and out of talking, saying "no..no, not this, don't crash." Rarely has any crime film allowed us to get the un-certainty in a psychological vein as this, at least in the straight-laced era of the 40s.Bogart, then, is the best choice for this character, and he embodies Earle with the same velocity he gave to his more one-sided tough guys from the gangster pictures of the 30s, but he also carries the side that is meant to be more affected by the opposite sex. In a noticeable sense Bogart's Earle has two sides, the one he's normally best at showing, to either his boss- Donald McBride's Big Mac, one of the best actors in the film even in just one scene- or to his criminal cohorts, and the other side, where he gets involved with a small-town family, where the daughter (Joan Leslie) has a foot condition, and he decides to get it fixed for her thinking perhaps that he might ask her hand in marriage. This gets complicated, however, when the personal side creeps into the professional, and Marie (Ida Lupino, proving her acting chops before she proved those at directing) falls deep for Roy, like I-can't-live-without-you attachment. Seeing the transitioning of romantic interest is a great measure of characterization in an of itself, because Bogart plays it at first with Lupino straightforward- don't get involved with me, and don't get too deep in the job- but this changes as the reality of Roy's interest in Velma is made clear. How can a criminal really involve himself, and not expect to be rejected, by the more conventional small-town family? A lot of these scenes help raise High Sierra above the typical paint-by-numbers in a high stakes heist picture, but Walsh also doesn't forget to give the audiences what they want. There's some fine tooling with the heist sequence, for example, to show just how shabby a thing like this can be without the right planning, and in fact how it's not too much of a surprise how it could be a set-up (gun-shots galore). And as the tension mounts, the techniques at Walsh's disposal are to the point, but also in some stylistic flourishes. Like when Roy suddenly has no choice but to hold up a teller at a store for money, that he may or may not be owed, and the call goes out to the authorities in super-impositions, mechanical things going over people's eyes and faces very quickly. And few chase scenes go for the length but excitement that happens as Roy's being chased by the cops on the mountain roads. The simplicity of style, of Walsh's professional focus on the job at hand, is matched up wonderfully with the screenplay's handling of making these more realistic than is expected: you feel for Roy, not in a despising way as a villain, but who is left to the haggle of circumstance and fate, and there's even a moment of sadness up on that mountainside as authorities and Roy go head to head.I can't say which I would prefer, this or Colorado Territory, as I've yet to see the latter. But if you're a fan of Bogart in the slightest, it's surely worth the rental, and it may even appeal to today's fans of crime films (well, not all of them, of course) looking for a lesson in the embracing and subversion of the genre of the period. Plus, it has one of the great endings in the crime genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart, the sympathetic gangster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Bogart's breakthrough film. Though Lupino got top billing over him (on account of her film-stealing performance the year earlier in another Raoul Walsh work 'They Drive By Night'), it is Bogart's performance that makes the film so memorable.He plays Roy Earle, a Dillinger-like gangster from the 30's who is released from jail with a dodgy, paid-off pardon. He is to lead one last big jewel heist, but finds himself displaced and at odds with the new, 'jitterbugging' 1940's society. Instead of being chummy with the new lot of crims, he finds he has more common with the dispossessed Oakies, figures from his past he can sympathize with. He is a man caught between two worlds (Perhaps what Dillinger would have been like if he had lived? The Dillinger likeness is hard to ignore, with his name cropping up a couple of times in the film), and this is a film that is sort of 'caught' between two genres. It marks the transition from the gritty 30's Warner Bros. gangster films to the pessimistic, low-budget 40's noir. 'High Sierra' has elements of both, so it is an interesting study.In my opinion, this is one of Bogart's best performances, and best characters (That said, Bogart played so many great characters in his career that it is very difficult to pick and choose). We have moved on from the portrayal of the psychotic gangster in the 30's by a Muni or a Cagney- Earle is a sympathetic gangster figure. He is given definite human qualities, he has a heart and a soul. He's also willing to 'play the sap' for a dame, and this is noticeable in his unrequited love for a much younger girl, Velma. His care and attentiveness to the girl, who has a club foot, is character building a beautiful component of Bogart's performance. The fact that Roy is rejected by Velma, who becomes wanton and selfish after her foot is repaired, only serves to endear him more to us.Roy's perfect girl is in the fine form of Marie Garson (Ida Lupino, great performance), a 30's survivor like himself. She's also cynical, weary and downtrodden, and knows about life's hard knocks. She's in love with Bogart throughout, but Bogie only wakes up to this, and her devotion to him, after being dealt a cruel blow by Velma. Lupino, a British actress, is maybe a little unconvincing as the gangster's moll because of her English diction and accent, but she plays the part very well. Joan Leslie overacts in her role Velma, but she was only 17, so it's largely due to inexperience. She handles Velma's transformation with accurate judgement.Raoul Walsh handles the action very well; this a fast-paced film with some terrific and well-crafted sequences.Certain racist elements are apparent in the film, with the all-too requisite 'idiot black' making an appearance. Looking at the film now, it's a backwards portrayal, but at the time nothing would have been thought of it. Perhaps we should be glad that an African-American actor was actually getting a chance in the films, not condemning a film that is very much a product of a bygone era.I never thought that I would be crying at the end of a Warner Bros. film from the gangster cycle, but this film leaves me in tears at it's conclusion. We know that Earle, as an outlaw, must ultimately die, but by the end of the film we are rooting for him so much that it is a painful, saddening blow when the inevitable occurs. The famous last scene in the mountains is justifiably brilliant, with Lupino terrific in her emotions and Bogart in his desperation. They make a great team, Bogart and Lupino. Oh, and 'Pard' too.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By 1941, Humphrey Bogart had nearly a dozen gangster roles to his credit, but in "High Sierra" we get to see a criminal with a heart. That aspect of Roy Earle's (Bogey) nature is played out with the chance meeting of Pa Goodhue (Henry Travers) and his pretty niece Velma (Joan Leslie). Though their age difference is plainly visible, Earle experiences a pang of feeling for Velma, even though she is handicapped with a clubfoot. The story within a story of Roy's white knight effort to cure Velma's malady and find a way out of his life of crime is eventually derailed, but not before the viewer gets a chance to observe a tough guy's soft side.But then there's his hard side. Fresh out of Mossmoor prison, Roy Earle wastes no time in hooking up with former gangster friend Big Mack (Donald MacBride) who had arranged his early release, and has already lined up Roy's next big payday. Roy will have to get heavy handed with two rookie sidekicks (Arthur Kennedy, Alan Curtis), who between them are juggling a pretty "dime a dance" girl along for the ride. The would be moll is Marie Garson (Ida Lupino), who with one look at Earle instinctively knows her two companions are in over their head. Roy tries to keep his distance from Marie, but when Velma makes it clear that she's marrying another man, Earle's romantic interest in Marie is driven up a notch.The film makes good use of Warner Brothers stock players. Barton MacLane is on hand as a rogue cop who's taken up with Earle's boss Big Mack. Henry Travers is put to good use in a role that serves as a warm up for that of Clarence the Angel in "It's A Wonderful Life". Cornel Wilde and Jerome Cowan find themselves in limited roles, Wilde as the smarmy Mendoza who sets up the hotel heist, and then rats out Roy to the authorities. And let's not forget Old Pard, the friendly mutt with an attraction to people who wind up dead. Pard had a good acting coach, he was Bogey's real life pet dog Zero.The newspapers hang a 'Mad Dog' tag on Roy following the botched hotel heist and Earle's shooting death of Jack Kranmer (MacLane). Presumably seeing Marie off to safety, he finds himself on the run and seeking refuge in the shadow of Mt. Whitney. Reacting to a radio broadcast, Marie retraces her steps back to witness Roy's stand against the police, knowing that he'll never allow himself to be taken alive. However Earle's final defeat doesn't have the defiance of Cagney's in "White Heat", no 'top of the world Ma' challenge to incite the authorities. In the end, a big time hood falls in disgrace. By then, you get the feeling that Marie already knows the answer to her own question when she asks a reporter - "Mister, what does it mean when a man crashes out?"You may be surprised as I was to learn that Ida Lupino was actually top billed over Humphrey Bogart in "High Sierra"; I'd be curious as to the politics involved in that decision. Though her performance is very good, her actual screen time is considerably less than Bogey's. Lupino also excelled in another team up with Bogart, that of the vile and conniving wife who murdered her husband in "They Drive by Night". Catch that one for her intense courtroom scene, it's a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Sierra or how Raoul Walsh makes a martyr of great American actor Humphrey Bogart !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface "High Sierra" appears to be an ordinary film but it is really amazing how over the years it has established its reputation as a classic film.All artistic credit for this film must be shared by two giants of American cinema Raoul Walsh and John Huston.Famous Hollywood actor Humphrey Bogart is also to be remembered for this film which enabled him to cast his dynamic spell on viewers.The best thing about Bogart's role is that he appears more like a troubled soul although he convincingly plays a tough criminal.There are no so many actors in Hollywood like him who can play roles depicting troubled souls with a criminal bent of mind.Some serious viewers might complain that it is rather bizarre that acting talent of Ida Lupino has not been properly used.She was made to content herself by mouthing some very ordinary lines.It is funny that High Sierra has been touted as a heist film but it is not exactly what one should call a 100% heist film.It has its fair share of dramatic elements too which are interlinked including the final car chase sequence which was all for the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enter the Anti hero, 1941, not 1971</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excellent Warner Bros crime drama with sensational outdoor photography and luscious talented Ida Lupino.... and Bogart on the cusp of super-stardom. In the 1970s I had the opportunity to meet Ida Lupino and I missed her... something I regret to this day. Then I only knew her from ISLAND OF DR MOREAU 1977 and was not yet acquainted with ROAD HOUSE or ON DANGEROUS GROUND or HIGH SIERRA. and other truly superb roles of the 40s/50s. Other comments here will tell you the story, but I won't, I just want to tell you to go find this now on DVD and stare at it several times from start to finish and see if you can guess how many other later films this one influenced. I got to 10 in a cinema geek contest so here's four to start.: DUEL IN THE SUN, THE BRIDE CAME COD, DILLINGER, OUT OF THE PAST and those mentioned above. (not Moreau).... Ida Lupino was one of the great B actresses who delivered A level performance in A+ movies even if the script was a B. ... and I missed meeting her... and I miss her in films now. As with the late great Ann Sheridan these two women deserve a major retrospective on DVD... and be treated as major female talents who spanned 3 decades. See Sheridan in COME NEXT SPRING (1956) and the work backwards through her films to the 30s... likewise with Lupino and you will agree. Interesting to me is the fact that Mad Dog Earle, as played by Bogart and written by John Huston is the first real anti hero I can establish in the 30s/40s: the killer criminal who is the hero of the film... and we all thought it was Dirty Harry or some 60s Nicholson role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Others have talked about the importance of this film and its' influence on Bogart's career. I'd just add that he is a very underrated actor. He telegraphs his emotions but in such a convincing way. Bogart had incredible appeal because there was something real about him. The scene when he first meets the Ida Lupino character is a perfect example. We know right away of his discomfort with having a woman involved, but we don't know why. Bogart had an incredibly expressive face and voice and was in fact one of the great actors of his time, which is why we can still enjoy High Sierra today. Ida Lupino who later directed films is equally good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sublime film. Probably one of the most melancholic pictures ever made in the classic period. It is one of the earliest and strongest portraits of the tragic hero, so recurrent in Walsh's filmography. Bogart's character, a mournful, resigned old-timer who witnesses the gradual downfall of the world as he knows it, dresses in black all through the film, like the mute and only assistant to his own funeral. As other Walsh anti-heroes ?notably White Heat's Cody- he must reach the heights before him dies. One wonders what would have been of the Bogart, Cagney, Flynn or Raft persona without their significant roles in the Raoul Walsh films. It's remake, Colorado Territory, is even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bogart's Roy Earle is a Forerunner/offspring of William Holden's Pike Bishop from "The Wild Bunch". Both are charismatic bandit leaders who have no place to go in a world closing in on them, both have a sentimental streak in them, but it is firmly wrapped in steel. It is what's appealing and frightening about these human wolf pack leaders. Earle is not cut out for the world of the Corleones, he's an independent who gives his loyalty to those he feels are worthy of it and not out of fear. His sentimentality involving the farm family and the crippled girl , Velma, in particular clouds his mind with visions of a life that he can't have and wouldn't endure- foreclose his place? Better bring the National Guard. A professional surrounded by the hotheaded youngsters the crime is doomed from the beginning but he carries his part through. Only his "fast stepping" girl played by Ida Lupino can understand him. That and a little dog who is a reminder of a lost youth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1941 was a great year for Cinema : it made Bogart a star ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has a climax been so illustrative of its own meaning than that defining moment from "High Sierra" where Humphrey Bogart, surrounded by L.A. cops during a tense siege, climbs his way up to the highest peak of USA in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, only to get shot by a sniper and fall to his death.That sequence alone elevates, so to speak, the film to its tragic dimension, a bizarre suggestion of nobility within the one who died without surrendering, owing his demise to a dog's barking averting about the presence of the woman he loves. Whoever lives by the gun perishes by the gun, but in the movies, it's often by the heart. Little Caesar, Tony Camonte and Montana ultimately failed because of their softness and Roy Earle was no exception. And Bogart gave his finest early performance as a criminal with a chilling record but a warm heart, doing such peculiar things as gently walking through a park or helping a crippled girl. And as condemnable his criminal actions are, we distance the actions from the man, with Bogie, it becomes possible anyway.Directed by Raoul Walsh, the film also marked the ending of the first gangster period, outdated by World War II. But the most defining of the talkies' era needed a grand finale, and it's not James Cagney, not Edward G. Robinson, Paul Muni or George Raft who'd provide it. Indeed, it's the eternal outsider, sidekick or antagonist, that man who played ungrateful roles of treacherous low-rate criminals to better fool the audience with one of the best anti-heroic performances. The fifth wheel of the Murderer's Row finally got it, but just like the heart-pounding car chase from Lone Pine to Sierra Nevada, it was a long and tortuous before reaching the peak, Bogart drove his way, carefully and patiently, swallowing all his frustrations and counting on talent and luck.Fate finally helped when Raft turned down the role after Muni's refusal, Muni was the first choice to play an aging gangster but demanded so many changes he'd be finally cut out. Raft who played the lead in Walsh' previous "They Drive by Night", also refused, following Bogart's tactical advice not to play another 'heavy who gets shot at the end'. What do you know, Bogart knew he had a chance to take. And all these fortunate chains of events lead reluctant producers to give the eternal supporting actor a shot at 'Mad Dog' Roy Earle. And Bogart gives the performance of a lifetime as if he could finally implode the frustration he had to repress for being so many times snubbed. Much more, a pre-HUAC committee that suspected him of Communist obedience was harassing him and before his name would be cleared, he had that anger-toward-society-mark graved in his face.Bogie was indeed as mad as Earle, the convict released after a friend pulled a few strings to obtain the governor's pardon, but not without selfish reasons. Earle would thank him by robbing a resort in Palm Springs during the holiday season. But pioneering the plots of many caper films, the heist matters less than the set-up and the obligatory doomed aftermath, "cherchez la femme"? her name is Ida Lupino, the 'human factor' that would make Earle take wrong decisions for good reasons. And for her sensational performance in "They Drive by Night", she got top billing? maybe another fuel of anger in Bogart's performance. And this time, it's not the dull and no-nonsense Raft confronting her, it's a man as boiling and passionate as she is, and their interactions certainly cemented the film's popularity. "High Sierra" foresees Bogart's gift for romantic roles as the story is also a beautiful romance between two underdogs who got everything to lose by sticking together, except the essential. And Earle is sure capable of kindness, there's a magnificent scene where he shows the stars to a young Joan Leslie, feigning to caress her hand. Jack Travers' character, a brave little farmer, can see in Earle that he's one of his own, a man of the land, good people, Bogart fooled him like he fooled us, and the Code, so vigilant to highlight the criminal's darkest side. Ironically, it was more blatant in the Walsh' similar film "White Heat" where Cody Jarrett, played by James Cagney, was portrayed as a more sadistic individual, despite his devotion to his mother.The Sierra Nevada was Earle's "top of the world" while "White Heat" can be regarded as the missing link between "High Sierra" and the future gangster movies to come, coincidentally heist movies like "The Asphalt Jungle" and "The Killing". Sterling Hayden would also play a Roy Earle-like character who'd try to have a last connection to his past a before his demise. Bogart's performance pioneered the popularity of heist movies and the figure of gangsters as existential characters rather than charismatic villains. The film would also pioneer the use of specific locations to give a film a unique touch, establishing an eternal connection between the condition of a gangster and the thirst for escapism, a recurring theme in Huston's movies along with failure.And it's another masterstroke of fate to have had Huston on the writing department, as he'd become rapidly fond on that "newcomer" named Bogart, before the gangster genre would be dethroned by film-noir. It was a close one for Bogie, because his performance caught the eye of Huston for some movie he would make the same year, one involving a sort of bird-like statuette ? the curtains were closed for Roy Earle but opened for the most legendary Hollywood star, who'd never got second billing ? ever again.So mirroring its iconic climax, Bogart was born to play Earle because in a way, they were the same, misunderstood, tough but sentimental guys, and like Earle, Bogart would finally climb the highest peak of Hollywood, but no one would ever make him fall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Sierra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was always interested to see the film that made the leading character actor of Casablanca and The African Queen a star, and it seems it was this one that I found listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from writer John Huston (The Man Who Would Be King). Basically Roy 'Mad Dog' Earle (Humphrey Bogart) has just been pardoned and released from an eastern prison, but the experienced bank robber is wanted by aged gangster Big Mac (Donald MacBride) to lead and take charge of a California resort casino heist. He starts by driving across the country, meeting the three men that will assist him in the heist at a camp in the mountains, they are resort worker Louis Mendoza (Cornel Wilde), and camp residents 'Red' (Arthur Kennedy), and they are also joined by young woman Marie (Ida Lupino), who after argument is eventually allowed to stay. Marie falls in love with Roy, but he does show any of the same feelings, he instead has affection for young woman Velma (Joan Leslie) who he pays to have an operation on her deformed foot, but she refuses a marriage proposal because she is seeing someone else, so when her fianc shows up he does turn to Marie and they become lovers. All the plans for the robbery are made and they go ahead with the heist, but they are interrupted by a security guard and it goes wrong, the three assistants ends up in a car accident, Red and Babe are killed, and the police interrogate Mendoza. The police put a search out for 'Mad Dog' for the public to identify and catch him, Roy and Marie leave town together, but they separate so she can get away, and he hides in the Sierra Mountains. It is sunrise when the police catch up to Roy, and he tries to shoot the officers below, and it is when he hears Marie calling for him that they get the chance to shoot him, and they do and he falls to his death, while she sobs and is driven away. Also starring Henry Hull as 'Doc' Banton, It's a Wonderful Life's Henry Travers as Pa and Elisabeth Risdon as Ma. Bogart is usually the charming good guy, here he is a likable criminal, I can see reasons why he became more popular following this film, the film itself does have a bit of cheesy feel and corny story, there could have been a bit more heist action, but it is I suppose paced alright and a not bad crime thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe a serious study should be made about how deceiving this film is.- we're meant to root for a bank robber even as he plans one last heist, in the process lamenting the film noir crook, while no reason is given why we should.- nostalgia for older, simpler times, presumably when his type could freely roam the open prairie, on the other hand no one forces his type to hold-up banks.- there is a crippled young girl that Roy helps out, a very decent farm girl, only to turn bitchy and petulant when her leg is fine, and of course suddenly there is a loving boyfriend who wants to pay back Roy for the medical costs, if so why didn't he take care of that all this time?- a heroic last stand against police and the modern world, high up in the stark Sierras, on the other hand a cop is shot in passing and no one thinks twice about it.The problem here, as you may have gleaned, is not the amoral world, that is fine and expected from noir, even though the film comes at the start of the cycle when there wasn't any solid genre as we know it now. I'm sure the film was conceived as a gritty crime flick, typical Warner bros, the twist being that it will be told using codas from the western. The innovation is that those codas are about the passing of the West, something the western was not going to pick up until the late 50's at least.The problem is the tear-jerking sentimentality applied on noir cosmology; small human beings at the mercy of cruel gods, this is rendered as Roy being sprung from prison, given a new lease of life, but only to serve the heist.Now traditional western heroes had a mean streak in them but were basically decent human beings, so if the film rhapsodized their passing, that was okay, they were the kind of man you'd like to be or call a friend. Later in Italian westerns they were amoral scoundrels who maybe did the right thing because it was on their way to money, but Italian westerns were never sentimental about their exploits.But you can't be emotional about the noir schmuck, you can't arrive at conclusions for us. My opinion is that one has to push his understanding beyond the level of fates, beyond immediate chaos on the human level, that some of us are born bad and only rushing towards death, and grasp mechanisms that control these things. The film grasps little.On the other hand, you might want to see the classic finale, with our hero surrounded by landscape that reflects him, harsh, barren, proud, while down below watches the audience, of course expecting violence and tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Warner Bros gem in which performance , dialog and direction is crisp and exciting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being released from prison , notorious criminal alias Mag Dog ( Humphrey Bogart as bad guy) is contracted by his old boss (Daniel MacBride) to help a group of inexperienced thieves ( Arthur Kennedy , Alan Curtis , Cornel Wilde) scheme and carry out the robbery of a California resort. Meanwhile Roy Earle or Mag Dog Killer establishes an enjoyable relationship with a family (whose grandfather is a likable Henry Travers offering an interest contrast) and pays for the operation who corrects beautiful girl's (a gorgeous Joan Leslie ) crippled foot , but he then finds his love interest is misplaced . Later on , Roy on the lam and runs through from police who relentlessly pursues him .This Warner Bros production is a classic Noir cinema packed with drama , noisy action , thrills , a love story , being fast moving and pretty entertaining . Humprey as Mag Dog killer, at his best , he plays as an outlaw with a soft heart of gold . Impressive and moving ending on the mountaintop including the appearance a well-trained dog . Ida Lupino is very fine as the moll as well as Joan Leslie as innocent but ungrateful person . Ample support cast formed by known co-stars who subsequently will have a long career as Cornel Wilde , Alan Curtis and Arthur Kennedy . Thrilling screenplay by W.R. Burnett and John Huston based on Burnett' s novel . Rousing musical score by Adolph Deutsch and atmospheric cinematography by Tony Gaudio . Also shown in horrible computer-colored version . Well produced by Hal B Wallis and Mark Hellinger , the latter a prestigious producer of classic noir films as Naked city, Brute Force , The killers , The roaring twenties and They drive by night. This terrific caper gangster is stunningly directed by Raoul Walsh . Rating : Above average , the interesting drama and action make it of the finest of Mark Hellinger genre entries.The W. R. Burnett's novel is remade various times as in Western format titled Colorado territory (1949) also by Raoul Walsh with Joel McCrea , Virginia Mayo and repeats Henry Hull and I died thousand times(1955) by Stuart Heisler with Jack Palance , Shelley Winters , Lee Marvin and Lori Nelson .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"When a man crashes out"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the golden days of Hollywood they had an established star-making process. A promising youngster would be plucked, often from the stage or sometimes the ranks of extras, groomed, maybe tried out in some smaller roles, but more often than not would have a picture commissioned for them and become a lead player in their very first role. The trouble is it didn't always work. Who now has heard of someone like Anna Sten, one-time golden girl at Samuel Goldwyn's studio? Even Tyrone Power, one of the star-making racket's biggest successes, is hardly of legendary status and was never an amazing actor. However many of the brightest stars of this period are ones who emerged gradually, working their way up from bit parts, through supporting roles over a period of years before they hit the big time. This is how it was for John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracey and, of course, Humphrey Bogart.Bogart had been around for over a decade before this, his first leading role, and was even fairly well-known. His parts in the late 30s tended to be, not primary bad guy, but some despicable demi-villain. If he was a good guy, it was normally something like the hero's brother, as he was to George Raft in They Drive By Night. High Sierra has a similar cast and crew to They Drive By Night, and Raft was set to star but for some reason turned it down. Bogart stepped in, but made it immediately clear he was no sloppy second. Finally allowed to take centre-stage, and break away from characters you are supposed to either despise or disregard, he exudes an effortless, laid-back charisma ? that extra something that separates a star from a mere actor. Of particular effectiveness however is the way he is able to believably portray the conflicting parts of Roy Earle's nature, crucially the fact that he is a nice guy, someone we would feel we could hang out with. Raft could certainly do a mean gangster act, but if we saw him put an arm round Henry Travers and say "You're alright Paw", the moment wouldn't have that same genuine warmth that Bogart gives it.High Sierra is also the perfect starting point for Bogie because there is no-one else around who is really able to upstage him. A young Arthur Kennedy, who plays one of the gang members, was very good, but in a quiet kind of way. Kennedy even at this early stage in his career was great at smoothly and professionally plugging up gaps in the cast, playing his part to perfection but never demanding the attention be upon him. Joan Leslie is the closest we come to a distractingly poor performance, but luckily her part is smaller than we think it's going to be, and in any case her character is more supposed to represent something than be a fully fleshed-out individual. Finally there is leading lady Ida Lupino. Lupino is constantly doing stuff with her hands and eyes, and gives the impression of someone who has studied the acting manuals, worked really hard at being an actress, and yet ultimately has no natural flow, her performances looking too thought-out. No wonder she became a director. Still, she is nowhere near as hammy as she was in They Drive By Night, and her reasonably restrained turn here is a good compliment for Bogart's easy-going presence.Bogart is also lucky to have a very fine director in Raoul Walsh, a man who certainly knew he had a star on his hands. As much as the role suits Bogart, this also happens to be perfect material for Walsh's somewhat romantic take on the outlaw life. High Sierra takes the gangster movie away from the streets and speakeasies and into territory more reminiscent of a Western, and this sense of open space is important to Walsh. Look at how Walsh handles that early sequence after Bogart gets out of jail ? a potentially throwaway moment with no dialogue, but Walsh builds up its significance. A truly idyllic scene of kids playing in the park, with point-of-view shots looking up at those tall trees, giving a real sense of physical freedom and unlimited possibility. That feeling is echoed in the frequent shots of mountains and plains, in which the emphasis is on vast, inviting emptiness and the breathtaking magnificence of the land. The point Walsh is drawing out here, is that when Roy Earle is fleeing for his life into the distant peaks, he is closer to freedom than he would be in any cosy homestead. This is by the way one of Walsh's finest jobs, and if there was ever a year he deserved an Oscar-nomination this was it.And so, with this fast-paced and fascinating gangster fable, Bogart announces his arrival. A piece of good timing perhaps, or perhaps not seeing as Bogart had waited so long for such a break. Still, Hollywood's next decade, where pictures so often bridged the gap between grittiness and touching humanity, needed a Bogart far more than the thirties. Take Bogie out of Casablanca, The Big Sleep, The African Queen or High Sierra itself, and they wouldn't be half the classics they have become. That is what star quality means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent crime drama/early film noir. This was the first in Bogey's 1-2- 3 punch, followed by The Maltese Falcon then Casablanca, that took him from resident Warners tough guy villain to one of the studio's leading romantic stars. He plays Roy "Mad Dog" Earle perfectly showing him as ruthless when necessary but with a core of decency that hasn't been ruined by years of hard knocks. Matching him every step of the way is the always outstanding Ida Lupino in one of her best portrayals. Her Marie is a classic hard luck case, tough on the outside but vulnerable underneath. She and Bogart are an ideal match, a shame then that this was there last film together and the only one where they were paired as equals. The rest of the cast is terrific in support, including Joan Leslie, a variable actress but well used here as a seemingly nice girl who is exposed as a thoughtless, shallow grabber. Walsh's direction is aces as well with wonderful use of shadows and spaces to convey the isolation of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lupino owns the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solid gangster yarn starring Humphrey Bogart. Between this and The Maltese Falcon, Bogie would emerge from 1941 Hollywood's biggest star. He plays a gangster just getting out of prison. Like all gangsters, he immediately hooks back up with his criminal friends and starts planning a heist. Among the crooks he partners up with is Ida Lupino. Bogie's fine, but High Sierra belongs to Lupino. She's such a pathetic but lovable character, desperate to hook herself to someone who's not going to smack her or leave her flat. Bogart's character is something of a famed criminal, so she immediately tries to get with him. He finds her too low. Hoping to get out of the business after the archetypical last big score, Bogart is drawn to another young woman (Joan Leslie), who has a club foot. That whole dream is a little corny, but at least the screenplay (adapted by John Huston and the original novel's author, W.R. Burnett) knows that. Still, the scenes with Leslie and her family really drag. Also, the cute dog is overused. Arthur Kennedy also co-stars as one of Bogart's gang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What works best about this film is the drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without Bogart's romantic aspirations the film would have been dreadful and empty. Also good: Bogie's hair and him showing a warmer side than in many other roles in which he played gangsters. The film's problem is that many of the dramatic turns and conflicts are too obviously constructed and unnatural. Whenever they want to get the plot moving or it is time for some unexcitingly staged action they make one character do something unmotivated not to even say something out of character. Either that the next scene just comes out of nowhere. The big heist that we see the characters setting up every once in a while throughout the movie until they execute it at the end of the 2/3 never is intelligibly communicated to the viewer and once we see it happen we understand that there really isn't much to it. Not much preparation had to go into this heist and even less preparation went into it given the outcome. The finale didn't do much for me either. A car chase with sped up film (you really shouldn't pan the camera uncontrollably if you intend to speed up the film later, but OK, it's 1941) in which the cops never even come near Bogart's car and a trapped on a mountain situation without much pep, character insights,... All in all a film that makes me wonder why this script was picked up in the first place.ONE scene in the movie I was impressed by, though, was very early into the movie. After Bogie comes out of jail he goes to the apartment of this guy he's never seen before to talk business. At the end of the conversation the guy makes a snarky comment about Bogie and what does Bogie do? Without even thinking about it he gives the guy a relatively light slap in the face and leaves. The guy was just standing there humiliated not knowing what to do or say. That's the kind of thing I'll have to incorporate into my everyday life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie Heads to the Hills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The majority of this Raoul Walsh crime thriller is standard issue, but it does boast a knockout finale set in the gorges of the Sierra Nevada mountains.Bogart plays a brooding thug "rushin' toward death," who's hitched himself to one last scheme -- knocking off a ritzy hotel -- that will allow him to rest easy for a while. But this is a film noir, and the life of relative normalcy that Bogie's character chases remains just outside of his grasp, and fate has other plans for him. One circumstance after another intervenes to prevent his having a happy ending, and he meets his tragic fate in a climactic shoot out while his girlfriend (Ida Lupino) looks on.A good part of the film's narrative concerns a rural family who Bogart befriends, and in particular the young woman (an annoying Joan Leslie) who Bogie sees as a path to domestic happiness. I understand the significance of this plot line, but it slows the film down considerably, and makes it feel longer than it even is. On the other hand, there's an inventive and memorable subplot about a dog who may be a harbinger of doom.The mountains themselves are used to tremendous effect, representing both figuratively and literally the insurmountable environmental factors that will always hold Bogie down.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I wouldn't give you two cents for a dame without a temper."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps more completely than John Huston's 'The Maltese Falcon (1941),' Humphrey Bogart's first outing of 1941 set the standard for the film-noir movement that would dominant American cinema for two decades to follow. Other precursors to noir had already been released, of course, but few had captured the essence of the style more adeptly than director Raoul Walsh, who, incidentally, made a leading man out of Humphrey Bogart in the process. There's our stoic but tragic main protagonist, driven by fate's bitterly-ironic sense of humour towards a wretched conclusion. There's our femme fatale ? not quite the predatory black widow of later experience ? but nonetheless a dangerous dame, with whom a close association will inevitably lead to no good. There's a good selection of suitably nefarious characters, each with their own furtive intentions and all to be treated with suspicion. There's also an adorable little dog ? yes, a dog! ? but even this lovable little pooch (Bogart's own pet, named Zero) has a hand in Roy Earle's eventual downfall.When a hardened criminal (Humphrey Bogart) is pardoned from a life sentence, he immediately falls once again into a life of crime. While he and three inexperienced criminals draw up plans to rob a Californian resort casino, Roy Earle attempts to reclaim the simple humanity of his long-forgotten past, and he aids a poor farming family by financing an operation to help young Velma (Joan Leslie) overcome a walking disability. However, when his romantic approaches towards Velma are rebuffed, Earle turns his attention to Marie (Ida Lupino), a former taxi-dancer who means well, but can only lead to trouble. 'High Sierra' differs from many gangster pictures of the 1930s in that it encourages the audience to sympathise with its main character, to such a level that we're almost willing to imagine Earle as a hapless innocent who has fallen into the inescapable trap of past loyalties. Also very evident in the film are the foundations of the classic "heist flick," and co-screenwriter John Huston would return as director to popularise the sub-genre in 'The Asphalt Jungle (1950).'However, for all its good moments, there are also many that don't quite work. Bogart was evidently hesitant about his on screen relationship with Joan Leslie, who was sixteen-years-old at the time, and he twenty-six years her senior. The contrast is so jarring that any credibility their budding romance might have had dissipates almost immediately, and the subplot would have worked more effectively had Earle sought a father/daughter association rather than a marriage. Other scenes in the film, perhaps their impact stifled by dozens of successors, lack the intensity of Bogart's other great film noir entries ? such as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' and 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' ? and the latter film, directed by Nicholas Ray, did a superior job of highlighting Bogart's alienation amid a society into which he can't assimilate. Nevertheless, with its strong acting, interesting story and highly-influential themes, 'High Sierra (1941)' is a high watermark in the film noir timeline, and proves a suitably entertaining crime picture in its own right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roy Earle is a convicted bank robber, not afraid to kill. He gets thrown to jail and after 8 years he gets released. He comes to work with a couple of noobies and their woman, named Marie. But, Earle falls for a young woman named Velma. She is crippled and Earle pays for her operation, only to find that she doesn't really love him. Earle then realizes that he loves Marie so he buys her a ring and they get married. The ending was also really good and touching, and the whole movie was just awesome. This is the movie that proved Bogie could be in leading roles, the thing he was born for. I highly recommend this beautifully played film to everyone, knowing that all the Bogie fans will love it just as much as I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put Bogart on the Map</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bank-robber Roy Earle (Bogart) may be outside the law, but he's a lot more sympathetic than those functionaries carrying out the law. Of course, they get him in the end, just as the production code of the day said they must. In the meantime, however, we're treated to a zeitgeist glimpse of the Depression Era, as captured by screenwriters John Huston and W.R. Burnett. Together they underscore Earle's connection to ordinary folks, whether passing time with a dirt farmer, befriending a penniless crippled girl, or shooting the breeze with her folksy father. Clearly he's an extention of them, and when he 'breaks free' at movie's end, we know audiences of the day break free of their own oppressive conditions, if only for a moment. This is a milestone Bogart movie, the one that catapulted him onto the Hollywood A-list as the soft-hearted tough guy that would become his signature. Good as he is -- and looking like John Dillinger in a prison haircut -- I like Ida Lupino's soulful gun moll even better. Together, she and Sylvia Sydney defined the downtrodden, yet gutsy, lower class woman of the time. Here she clings to outlaw Earle and their ugly mutt like it's her last shot at life. And it probably is, the script discreetly implying she's been passed from man to man for years. So at film's end, when, ennobled by true love, her eyes uplift and a beatific glow calls forth, we know that a dignity is restored and a past transcended -- and the "High" in High Sierra comes to stand for a lot more than hard-scrabble mountaintop.</fullReview>

This is the first time he's collaborated with John Huston, that spawned series of great movies with him. The story is simple, but the movie has a mood all its own. Is this the magic of Bogart ? Since nobody else's movie has this mood, I'd have to put the credit where it's due. If it wasn't for him, this movie would have been just another gangster movie, but you feel special sympathy for Humphrey Bogart's character.Ida Lupino was great in this movie too.A classic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Mad Dog" With An Achilles Heel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "High Sierra" Humphrey Bogart plays an ageing gangster who's seriously conflicted. On one hand he's a career criminal who's utterly ruthless and readily kills people who get in his way but on the other he's also a rather nostalgic, sentimental and compassionate person who hankers after a calmer and more decent lifestyle. The fact that he's rather old for the crime business and that he's surrounded by younger people, contributes to his feelings of alienation which are also reinforced by the difficulties he experiences in adjusting to everyday life, after having spent many years in prison.Bogart's gangster also recognises that his life of crime has put him on a course from which he is unable to escape and that he has no alternative but to follow where fate takes him. This man's Achilles heel is his tendency to be soft hearted and this is, unquestionably, a fatal flaw for anyone who pursues a life of crime.Crime boss Big Mac (Donald MacBride) pays for Roy "Mad Dog" Earle (Humphrey Bogart) to be released from prison on parole because he wants the experienced bank robber to lead a gang who are planning to carry out a hotel robbery at a Californian resort. When Roy arrives at the gang's cabin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, he meets Red (Arthur Kennedy), Babe (Alan Curtis) and Babe's girlfriend, Marie Garson (Ida Lupino). Roy soon recognises that the two young men are inexperienced and unpredictable and also that there'll be problems if Marie stays involved.Roy decides that Marie should be sent back to L.A. but becomes more content for her to stay after she tells him that Louis Mendoza (Cornel Wilde) who works at the hotel and is the gang's "inside man" has a tendency to be indiscreet and loose tongued in the wrong places.On his way to L.A. to visit Big Mac, Roy calls on the Goodhue family, Ma (Elisabeth Risdon), Pa (Henry Travers) and their granddaughter Velma (Joan Leslie). Velma is an attractive young lady with a deformed foot and Roy pays for her to have surgery to correct the deformity. Later, Roy proposes to Velma but she rejects him for a man closer to her own age. When he meets Big Mac, Roy discovers that his boss is very ill and as a consequence, the money that he'll earn from the robbery will be very important to him.When Roy's driving away from the cabin on the night of the robbery, he's followed by a mongrel dog called "Pard" who has a reputation for bringing trouble to his owners. Although he doesn't want to take the dog with him, Roy allows himself to be persuaded to do so. The robbery goes badly and Roy shoots a security guard before escaping. Red and Babe are killed when their car crashes and Louis tells everything he knows when he's questioned by the police.From that point on, all Roy's plans unravel spectacularly, as he and Marie become fugitives and fail to capitalise on the jewels they stole from the hotel. Roy decides soon after that it would be too dangerous for him and Marie to remain together and so they separate. The police then continue their relentless pursuit until the story eventually reaches its extremely dramatic climax.Ida Lupino is excellent as the tough, streetwise Marie whose affection for Roy remains strong even after he tells her that he wants to marry Velma. Her devotion to him is unswerving and she continues to remain undaunted throughout all the dangers and setbacks that they experience together.Bogart's exceptional performance in this movie conveys very convincingly the complex nature of Roy "Mad Dog" Earle. He talks tough through clenched teeth in some scenes but also shows genuine kindness in others without ever losing any credibility. It's this ability which is so impressive and no doubt, was a major reason why this role was the one which elevated Bogart to the star status that he justifiably enjoyed for the rest of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few observations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Sierra" was the last time Humphrey Bogart would take second billing to anyone. He IS the picture, and I think it's here that we really begin to see a highly-nuanced tough guy. Yes, he can kill at the drop of a hat, but at the same time he can pay for a young girl (Joan Leslie) to have an operation to correct a club foot. I like to compare Roy Earle to James Cagney's Cody Jarrett in the later "White Heat"; Cody has no redeeming qualities except for his over-love of his mother. Yet both, in their own peculiar way, are hard not to like.This is the only movie I ever saw with Joan Leslie where I didn't like her. I think she acts like an ingrate after what Bogart does for her. On the other hand, I'm a sucker for a dog, so of course I like Pard (Bogart's real-life pet Zero). I keep wondering, though, about those scenes where Bogart drives off and Pard chases after him, only to have Ida Lupino make Bogart stop the car and take the dog with them. Did the dog think his owner was going to leave him? And did Ms. Lupino, who directed some things herself later on, improvise so that it wouldn't take umpteen takes to get the scene right? And Willie Best's character wouldn't hold up today, for obvious reasons. But it's Turner Classic Movies' policy to show such stereotypes because the movies are uncut, and it's good to remind viewers how much perceptions of African-Americans have changed since 1941.Finally, I like the period details: the cars, the clothes, the still-very-rustic look of prewar America. And I agree with those who think Roy Earle can return to a simpler time, such as early in the film when he stops at his old homeplace in Indiana.The movie will keep your interest, I assure you, especially the ending; maybe it's not, as one poster commented, Cagney's "top of the world, Ma" of "White Heat," but it's a challenge to the authorities to "come and get me." Bogart: not so much villain as the first antihero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Know Why It's Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Sierra" is a movie that everyone sees and loves but no one seems to understand why... at least I have yet to see anyone else speak to what I feel is the heart of the picture. I've read all 57 reviews posted on the IMDb and I can honestly say I've got a different take on what makes the movie such a classic.On the surface the movie seems like a fairly straightforward crime film- Humphrey Bogart is Roy Earle, a tough guy criminal trying to pull one last job. But in actuality it is about a man's failure to redeem himself and his eventual acceptance of his own tragic destiny. To me, this is the quintessential Bogart film, as he SEEMS to be the hard-boiled heavy of the film, when in actuality it is life and society that are much more cruel and unforgiving; Bogart is actually the victim here.The tough-guy faade is something Roy Earle develops because of the harsh conditions around him, and in this way he represents many, maybe all American men, who are forced to provide a cold and leathery exterior to shield themselves from the pain and heartbreak of everyday life. The robbery plot line is a red herring on which a much deeper story is hung. Roy's weakness here is the weakness of all men, and it is so obvious, so clunky, so perfectly plain that it transcends the tragic flaw and becomes a badge of honor, the face of every American man who has come before or since. His weakness is the desire to love and be loved.Sure, he has the sharp and sultry Ida Lupino but what Bogey really wants is Velma, the child, the virgin, the innocent, with whom he can truly start anew and reinvent himself, achieving an immortality by becoming her father/husband and raising his own daughter/lover. She represents to him everything that is pure and innocent and good in this life, everything he has lost out on. And yet what is brilliant about Bogart's performance is that he knows full well that this fantasy will never become real, yet he cannot help but go through the ritual: the meeting of Velma, the holding of her hand... it's as hardwired into the psyche of every American male as breathing in and breathing out.Velma's revulsion at the thought of marrying Earle can be symbolic of many things: a wife unable to accept her veteran husband after his return, the inability of the cosmos to forgive him for past sins, the irreversible loss of innocence, or the sad fact that for whatever reason Roy was just not destined for any of the good that life has to offer... he is cursed. Who hasn't felt that way at one time or another?The movie has a wonderful feel to it... we all seem to know that Roy is headed for emotional- if not literal- death, and the joy is in watching him play the fool, trying in vain to change his fortune. The secret of "High Sierra" is that we enjoy watching lemmings march to their inevitable deaths... we get off on watching this tragedy unfold. Everyone loves to play God for a day, shaking our heads and laughing at the futility of a man who thinks he can change his Fate. According to this movie, that is impossible."High Sierra" is a slow-motion practical joke on its main character. He enters the world- and the picture- with Original Sin and finds it impossible to redeem himself or his name. The heart-pounding finale is as obvious as it is compelling... Bogart has reached the end of the line- emotionally, spiritually, romantically, and that his why Roy Earle's story is so memorable and relatable. He is backed up against the wall, and his weakness for love- for Velma, for Marie, for Pard- prove to be his undoing. A forsaken man in a cruel world... a classic.GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but never one of my favorite Bogart films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IDA LUPINO was given top billing for this one, although she has considerably less screen time than HUMPHREY BOGART, playing a killer named "Mad Dog Earle". That, it seems, was because Jack Warner was building her up for top stardom after some impressive roles proved she could act. But HIGH SIERRA really belongs more to Bogart than anyone else.He carries the film--not that others aren't on hand and displaying some pretty good talent. But I didn't like the sub-plot that has him falling for a lame girl with a club foot (JOAN LESLIE) who seems all sweet and innocent until she's cured and turns on him. Lupino, as anyone could see, was more his type and their chemistry is what gives the film a boost, especially midway when Lupino's role becomes more prominent.ALAN CURTIS, ARTHUR KENNEDY, HENRY HULL, HENRY TRAVERS, JEROME COWAN and, surprisingly, newcomer CORNEL WILDE all have some good supporting roles--the Warner stock company hard at work.Directed in his usual rugged western style by Raoul Walsh, it's an interesting crime melodrama that gets off to a slow start but builds up suspense by the time it gets to the climactic fight between Bogie and the police among the craggy rocks of the Sierra mountains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogart shaping up for the Cult movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was, as it is well known now, a starting point for H.B. to step out from supporting roles behind Cagney and E.G. Robinson, but also depending on a then bigger name, G. Raft, to turn it down. He used the chance to the max, playing it as cool as can be, befriending a dog and a gangster moll well played by Ida Lupino and helping a cripple girl back to health and self-confidence and in turning him down. However, the whole thing has a feeling of doom over it : The big shot, who organizes the big heist, is deadly sick, his middleman a deceiving ex-cop and his supporting guys at the robbery are 2 gangster rookies burnt in a car accident on the escape. He makes it to the top at the end, but doesn't enjoy that very long. Good movie at the edge of kitsch and sentimental overdose, but fast paced and very entertaining. 8 of 10.</fullReview>

However, he managed to have a kind heart and tried to help a young girl to walk in comfort and paid for all the doctor bills.

Ida Lupino,(Marie Garson),"Jennifer",'53, fell in love with Roy and managed to show him she was a regular gal and he eventually slipped a stolen ring on her wrong finger. Humphrey Bogart got his real start to fame in the film,"DEAD END",'37, were he started being cast as the GANGSTER along with George Raft, Lawrence Tierney, and Edward G. Robinson.

		<shortDescription>Bogey's Breakthrough Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to "High Sierra", Humphrey Bogart had been playing heavies, second leads and the occasional lead in a "B" feature. Beginning with this film, there would be no looking back for Bogey. Although it is Ida Lupino who received top billing, it is Bogart's picture all the way. He plays pardoned convict Roy Earle who is "sprung" by Big Mac (Donald MacBride) to lead the robbery of an exclusive resort. In Bogey's gang are Arthur Kennedy and Alan Curtis as his two inexperienced cohorts, Cornel Wilde as the nervous "man on the inside" and Lupino as a "dime a dance girl" who ultimately ends up as Bogey's moll. A stray dog named "Pard" who seems to bring bad luck to all who adopt him, is also along for the ride. Also in the cast is veteran character Henry Travers as "Pa", Joan Leslie as Velma, the crippled girl whom Bogey helps and falls in love with, Henry Hull as Doc and Bogey's old nemesis Barton MacLane as a gangster who tries to muscle in on the score. Willie Best in a typical racial stereotype of the period, provides comedy relief as Algernon. Bogart's performance dominates the film with able support from the supporting cast. It was with this film, that Bogey established his tough guy image, a part he would play, with little variation for the rest of his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HIGH SIERRA is an adventure thriller and a great spectacle. I'm thrilled with the atmosphere and scenery. The story is a bit dark. The last scenes are probably among the best in the crime genre.Humphrey Bogart as Roy Earle is a notorious robber who after leaving prison waiting for another job. However, it is simmering idea of freedom and peaceful life. The gangster has a good heart. Bogart was created for this role. In his character to break melancholy, hills, joy and disappointment. Ida Lupino as Marie Garson is a girl who can and who wants to keep track of gangsters. Money does not matter. She felt goodness. Marie is modest, devoted and naturally somewhat fatal girl.This gangster movie has all the elements. Speed, excitement and tension, and I would add irony and pity. The acting is solid. Bogart is top class. The film is at times realistic and nostalgic. Gangsters may die, but never surrender.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart is superb as Mad Dog, an ex-con plotting a Los Angeles jewel heist, becoming involved with two very different women, Ida Lupino and Joan Leslie. Intricately plotted adaptation of W.R. Burnett's book (by Burnett and John Huston!) given stylish, exciting direction by Raoul Walsh. Bogie's gangster persona is still surprisingly fresh at this point, and his tightly-controlled acting here ranks with many of his later, more popular performances; Lupino is also first-rate. A fantastic, influential film in gloriously rich black-and-white. Remade twice: in 1949 as "Colorado Territory" and in 1955 as "I Died a Thousand Times". *** from ****</fullReview>

HIGH SIERRA reveals that gasoline cost about 24 cents per gallon in the high mark-up area of California's desert, but obviously inflation has pumped up the price of sex even more than that of gas since WWII. Roy is a poor sap who's been watching too many doctor movies, and believes that he can get a girl half his age simply by underwriting a little cosmetic surgery. Of course, Humphrey himself is so soft that he felt terrible seeing Ida walking toward the gas chamber in THEY DRIVE BY NIGHT, so he writes her a get-out-of-jail-free card toward the end of SIERRA. Unfortunately, Ida's dog "Pard" (Zero) eats Humphrey's homework, so SIERRA concludes with Ida once again chamber-bound. Hanging, frying, or gassing women was a frequent theme of American flicks from this period (remember Mary Astor in THE MALTESE FALCON, among others), since it was the only way one infamous member of the MPAA censor board could get off. This Perv had little interest in seeing the MEN actually most guilty getting their just desserts on film: Note how "Louis Mendoza," SIERRA's "inside man," gets off Scot Free, along with ALL of the well-heeled Crime King Pins wearing suits more expensive than Roy's.</fullReview>

Bogey gives a great performance as Roy Earle, who is let out of prison by his old boss, only to be signed up for the biggest event that will finally allow him to retire from his life of crime.He meets Ida Lupino, beautiful talented actress, who plays Marie, a down and outer, street-smart girl who has led a dubious life. Then he meets Velma, a sweet, unspoiled girl, who he is drawn to. Velma's father is played by that actor who played Clarence the angel in It's a Wonderful Life, and he was terrific too.The script is tight, and the dialog even better. Not much wasted dialog here, as Bogey was always one of the most economical actors ever. Will he find true love, will he be able to break out? Watch this gem to find out. You will love High Sierra.</fullReview>

In "The Virginian" (1914), a silent film, they use "Pard" to mean "Partner". Since this is set in the West, it may have been a common term in the past. Sorry, I need 10 lines. There seems no way to avoid getting trapped on the big mountain. It also would seem that the girlfriend, played by Lupino, would be charged today with aiding a criminal. There are several ways that could phrased. It is a shame that the 2 leads did not appear together again. Being trapped up there with no food or water, and no warm clothes at altitude could have been fatal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Just when he was planning to crash out of prison convicted bank robber Roy Earl, Huphrey Bogart, is sprung by getting a pardon from the Governor of Illinois with the help, who greased the wheels for him, his good friend and fellow ex-con Big Mac, Donald McBride. How Big Mac did it is never explained in the movie we can only assume that he must have had something big on the "Gov" to get him to do Big Mac this favor.As it turned out Big Mac had Earl sprung so he could organize a robbery of this exclusive hotel casino in Southern California right at the hight of the racing, at the Del Mar racetrack, season. It's on his way to meet the two men Red &amp; Babe, Arthue Kenndey &amp; Alan Curtis, who are to help him pull off the hotel robbery Earl runs into after they almost ran him off the road Ma &amp; Pa Kettle,Elisabeth Risdon &amp; Henry Travers, and their pretty but club foot daughter Velma, Joan Leslie. The good hearted Earl pays for the Kettle's gas and repairs but can't keep his eyes off Velma whom he later finds out is crippled with a club foot. Earl then pays from out of his pocket, he and Valma didn't have any health or hospital insurance, the staggering amount of $400.00 to get her crippled leg back in shape so she can, among other things, go out dancing.Meanwhile back to business Earl together with Red &amp; Babe as well as the inside man the desk clerk at the hotel casino Louis Mandoza, Cornal Wilde, make plans for the big heist but complications arise with Marie, Ida Lupino, the gun moll of the trio wanting to take part in the robbery and bring her little cute dog, actually Humphrey Bogart's pet pooch in real life Zero, Pard along! Despite all the planning Earl put into it the robbery backfires due to the screw up of those two nitwit robbers Red &amp; Babe as well as inside man Mandoza who chickened out at the very last moment! This and ended up having Earl ice or kill a security guard, which is a capital crime, when Mandoza suddenly wet his pants and exposed himself, as a member of the robbery team, with his whimpering cries that alerted the security guard!Things go from bad to worse for Earl with his fellow crooks Babe &amp; Red getting cooked when their escape car goes off the road and ends up frying them. Mandoza who survived the crash starts singing like a pigeon, stool pigeon,to the police about who was behind the robbery non other then just released from prison Roy, who's now tagged by the news media, "Mad Dog" Earl. By far the biggest shock that Earl was to suffer after his good friend who got him out of prison Big Mack died on him was being rejected in his proposal of marriage to Velma! It was the smug and full of herself Velma who dropped the poor guy, who made it possible for her to dance the night away, after her old boyfriend from back home in Ohio John Preiser, John Eldredge, showed up at the Kettle's place! This made me, and Earl,feel that Velma's club foot wasn't the only thing wrong with her it was also her bird like brain. Earl who paid for her operation with money he needed to be on the lamb from the cops was rejected by the stuck-up and ungrateful Velma for John who despite being rich, that's why Velma was going to marry him in the first place, and despite him willing to pay Earl back the money, which Earl violently rejected, he laid out for Valma's foot operation was for some reason not willing or was too brain-dead to pay for it himself!***SPOILERS*** It's now off to the races or the High Sierra Mountain range with Earl Marie, who turned out to be his true love in the movie, and cute little Pard for the movie excitingly gripping and heart stopping final. Trapped like a rat or mountain goat in the High Sierras Earl is finally convinced to give himself up to the hundreds of police and state troopers surrounding him when he hears little Pard, who was running up the mountains to greet him, barking at him. Knowing that with Pard in the vicinity Marie isn't far behind Earl expose himself,not like Mandoza did, and is about to give himself up only to get shot by a police sniper that finally put an end to his running from the law. But it wasn't all that bad for Earl as a tearful Marie said at the conclusion of the film, with his days of running finally over, he's finally "Free at Last" "Free at Last" and nobody but nobody could ever hurt Roy "Mad Dog" Earl again!</fullReview>

Bogarts character does so much good in this one, that you actually feel bad when he is closed in on and dies at the end of the movie.There is no wonder about the quality of the film. Raoul Walsh directs a film that breaks out of the typical gangster film of the 1930's. He would go on to break out of the typical western film with Dark Command. Walsh is one of the great directors which is why he has another all star cast here. Bogart and Ida Lupino are two top stars and the story is very good.Walsh's camera work of the Sierra mountains looks good here. While it is shot in black and white, the mountains still look good. The way the characters fit the story is just perfect.Bogart is the tough guy from the east who is sent for to pull a robbery at a mountain resort hotel to get millions of dollars in jewels from the hotel safe. Later you find out about each characters past as each character is revealed like taking the rings off an onion. That is why this story works so well.</fullReview>

The film ends with a great manhunt for Earle in the mountains, one of the most intense scenes ever. Lupino and Bogarts' chemistry is fantastic.

		<fullReview>This was the movie that established Humphrey Bogart as a star.As the trivia note above indicates, however, it was not certain at all that he'd get the part; but it was only after this movie that Jack Warner instructed the publicity department at Warners to turn Bogie into a star... I guess that explains why Ida Lupino got top billing ahead of Bogie ? he wasn't quite there yet.The part of Roy Earle was made for him, no question: Bogie is Earle, Earle is Bogie. So the remake (I Died a Thousand Times, 1955) with Jack Palance and Shelley Winters is good, but lacks the realism of this earlier effort; besides, Palance overdid his effort, I thought.The story is disarmingly simple: old time gangster, Earle, gets out of stir to do another heist with some dumb newcomers; things go wrong, as they usually do; Earle is chased into the sierras by the cops; death of just another gangster. Finale.What sets it apart are, of course, Bogie's ? and Lupino's - performances, the cracking good script and the great setting ? which is genuine, much of the movie being photographed on location. I just loved the old cars and the grinding of gears ? lovely stuff...It's listed as film-noir, but I think that's incorrect: film-noir must involved a femme fatale ? a woman who deliberately brings the hero down, or makes things bad for him. While there are two women in Earle's short life ? Lupino as Marie, and Joan Leslie as Velma, neither fill that role of femme fatale. Some might argue that Velma finds Earle's Achilles heel when he falls hard for her, but she rejects him. I don't see that as fitting the film noir genre at all.This is a thriller, pure and simple, but it does have overtones of irony: Earle loves Velma, but she rejects him; Marie loves Earle, but he rejects her ? until the very end. And, ironically, it is Marie's presence on the mountain slopes that draws Earle out of his cover and to his death.Interestingly, this story has its copiers, most particularly with The Getaway (1972) when Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is sprung from stir to do another heist using dumb newcomers ? and things go wrong, of course. Both Earle and McCoy figured they were on their last jobs too. If you've seen The Getaway, then you know McCoy gets away. No such luck for Roy Earle.This is a must-see for Bogie fans, naturally. And for anybody who likes great gangster movies of the Classic Hollywood era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"High Sierra" is very interesting.Roy Earle (Humphrey Bogart) is released from prison and he goes to a place, high in the mountains, where he meets the people with whom he'll plan a robbery against a high luxury hotel. During the film he'll know two women and try to follow his dreams concerning peace and respectability. His choices will reflect his ideals but disillusion waits for him. The action is fast paced and a feeling of urgency is ever-present, but sometimes at night when the stars shine dreams and poetry are allowed. There's also a small dog, called Pard, that is maybe a symbol for the caprices of fate. Like the one in " Le Quai de Brumes" (1938) he follows the main characters till the end.High Sierra has a neorealist feeling. The characters look like real life people, the dialogues flow naturally, many scenes are filmed outdoors, the camera work registers the action in strong and fast brushes and there's sympathy for the downtrodden.The acting is excellent (especially Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino) and deeply felt. According to IMDb, during the time of the silent movies Raoul Walsh started working for Griffith as an assistant director, editor and actor in "Birth of a Nation" (1915). I think he has known and was friends with people from all walks of life. This is reflected in this film where the outcasts (those on the other side of the law) are portrayed with sympathy. But Raoul Walsh doesn't blame society or shows the police in a bad sight. He tells a story of struggle and despair and Maries (Ida Lupino) words at the end of the film resume what hope is left for those that live outside of society's bonds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best Bogart gangster film of the 1930s and early 40s. This is saying a lot considering all the excellent films he made. What sets this one apart is that the story has much more depth, as does Bogey's character. He's not JUST a gangster but he has fallen in love with a girl who basically uses him. She cannot walk and he mistakes his pity for love. She just likes all the attention he gives her and is more than willing to let Bogart pay for expensive surgery to help her walk again--while showing very little gratitude in the process. Despite his being a killer, you really find yourself feeling sorry for the mug. You also find yourself feeling for young Ida Lupino who loves Bogey, though the love remains unrequited through most of the film. Give it a look--it's well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film Ansel Adams might have made had he been a film director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Sierra" is an early example of film noir and is sometimes cited as the film which made a major star of Humphrey Bogart. It was co-written by Bogart's friend John Huston, who later in the same year (1941) would direct him in "The Maltese Falcon". In most of Bogart's films noirs, including "The Maltese Falcon", "Dead Reckoning" and "The Big Sleep" he played the hero, albeit often a flawed hero, but here he plays the villain. The film opens with Bogart's character, a convicted bank robber named Roy Earle, being released from jail after being pardoned by the State Governor. This does not mean, however. that Roy has been the victim of a miscarriage of justice or that he is now a reformed character. Far from it. His release has been engineered by a gangster named Big Mac, to whom the corrupt Governor owes a political favour. Big Mac (a name which in the forties presumably did not carry the associations with hamburgers which it would today) wants Roy to carry out a robbery for him at an exclusive holiday resort in the Sierra Nevada of California. (Hence the title). In form the film is a "heist movie" comparable to something like "The Concrete Jungle". It shows how Roy and his associates go about planning and carrying out the crime, concentrating more on the villains than it does on the police pursuing them. These being the days of the Production Code, however, when film-makers were forbidden from showing criminals succeeding in their enterprises, it also tells the story of how the robbery goes wrong and how Roy is forced to take refuge in the mountains. Film noir was a genre often noted for its tone of moral ambiguity, and I said earlier that some of Bogart's other roles involved him playing flawed heroes. Here, there is another sort of moral ambiguity about his character. On the one hand Roy is a dangerous criminal; he has no compunction about shooting dead a security guard who attempts to foil the robbery, displaying the ruthlessness which is to earn him the nickname "Mad Dog". , On the other hand, he also has certain qualities which, in another context, could have been admirable ones. He has a professional pride which leads him to be meticulous about planning his crimes, whereas his partners can be careless and slapdash. (He loathes the "Mad Dog" nickname, believing that it denotes someone wild and out of control). He has a code of ethics which leads him to turn down an opportunity to double-cross his associates. (But woe betide anyone who tries to double-cross Roy!) At one point in the film he pretends to be a successful businessman, and it is easy to imagine that, under different circumstances, this is what he could have become. The strangest side of Roy's nature is shown in his relationship with Velma, a young woman with a deformed foot whom he meets while planning the robbery. Taking pity on the girl, and knowing that her family are too poor to pay for corrective surgery, Roy pays for it himself. He does so in the hope that the otherwise attractive Velma will marry him afterwards, but never makes this a condition of paying for her surgery. (In the event, Velma turns him down, but for reasons unconnected with his criminal career, of which she remains ignorant). It is easy to see why this film made Bogart a star, as he gives one of the finest performances of his career, bringing out all sides of Roy's complicated personality, not only his ruthlessness, but also his better qualities, to such an extent that, even during the climactic final scenes of the manhunt on Mount Whitney, we can feel a certain sympathy with him. There are also good supporting performances from the two main female players, Joan Leslie as Velma and Ida Lupino as Marie, the sluttish moll who becomes Roy's lover after his rejection by Velma. The personalities of the two women are sharply contrasted. Velma can be seen as representing the respectable life of domesticity which Roy hopes to retire to after pulling off one last big job which will keep him for the rest of his life, while Marie represents Roy's actual life as it is at present. The film is also notable for its extensive location shooting, especially as it was made in the early forties, a period when most films were shot indoors in a studio. Raoul Walsh's black-and-white photography of the California sierras is very different to the gritty, urban look of most films noirs, but it lends the film a certain epic grandeur. It is the sort of film Ansel Adams might have made had he taken up film-making as well as landscape photography. Huston's script, co-written with William Burnett, is a powerful and intelligent one. This combination of acting, direction and writing makes "High Sierra" one of the great classic noirs, worthy to tank alongside the likes of "White Heat" (also made by Walsh), "Double Indemnity" and "Pickup on South Street". 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bogie Crashes Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film that elevated Humphrey Bogart from Hollywood hoodlum to romantic lead, "High Sierra" deserves respect. It's not his greatest role, or that entertaining a film, but it works insofar as director Raoul Walsh gives his star all the right support to cement a winning impression.Bogie is still a hood in this one, but one with a heart. Roy Earle is a tough-luck robber who wants to go straight but needs one last big heist for a sick old man who got him sprung from prison. Problems accrue. His partners in crime are neither smart nor reliable, and a woman named Marie (Ida Lupino) gets stuck on him to the detriment of both. There's even a dog with a record of bringing bad luck to his minders who attaches himself to Earle.All this works sometimes. It brings out a riveting performance from Bogart, whose ticks and melancholy spirit feel utterly right. You pull for him despite the fact he's not presented to us as anything other than a Hays Code baddie, even calling out one handler for being an retired policeman ("A copper's always a copper"). People talk about this being the beginning of film noir, and while Bogie previously played an anti- hero up against a bitter destiny in "Black Legion," this is really establishes that up-against-the-system vibe for later film use.The problem with the film is how much it plays things on the nose. Right from the start, Earle is established as a guy who likes his freedom when he directs his driver to make a stop at a nearby park. Asked if he's alright, he answers: "I will be, just as soon as I make sure grass is still green, and...trees are still growin'."Later, we watch Earle have a nightmare which amounts to a soliloquy, complete with him making punching motions in his sleep. Writers John Huston and W. R. Burnett, working from Burnett's novel, have the bones of a fine story, but clutter it too much with moments like this. A black character played by Willie Best is brought in to do some crosseyed servile shtick that comes over even more lame in such an otherwise serious flick.Then there's the sweet family with the pretty daughter Velma (Joan Leslie) whom Earle befriends, which slows down the heist story to a crawl. Earle sees in Velma reason for a clean start in life, but cruel circumstance works against him yet again. (Some reviewers here are aghast at the age gap between the middle-aged Bogart and the teenager Leslie. Better not tell them about her and Cagney the following year in "Yankee Doodle Dandy"!) The Velma arc just goes on too long, and plays like a bad joke.But even the weak moments are worthwhile with Bogie at the center of things. In the last scene with Velma, the weakest scene in the movie, there's a moment when Marie bursts in and Earle shoots her the most marvelously murderous look. It's pure Bogart.That's the best that can be said of "High Sierra." Lupino merits interest less for her performance, which is serviceable, but for the way her character is introduced and hangs on with Earle like a proto-Bonnie Parker. She shouldn't have been credited above Bogart, but the story is really as much about her character as his.It's also a treat having come off a Budd Boetticher kick to find myself back on his stomping grounds, Lone Pine and the Alabama Hills around Mount Whitney, served up this time in glorious black and white. The scenics by cinematographer Tony Gaudio impress even when they don't try to grab your attention, and give this pre-noir a deceptively sunny sheen."High Sierra" is worth recommending, to Bogie fans and noir enthusiasts especially. This isn't where it all began for the actor or the genre, but it's where it reached a new height, even if it would prove a mere stepping stone for things to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent and Sad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very underrated film about good and evil, or the perceptions of such. Humphrey Bogart plays a bank robber who gets paroled after 8 years. He immediately gets involved in a new scheme but then meets two women who change his life.Ida Lupino plays the "bad girl" who yearns for a better life but can't get away from her thug boy friend, who is now one of Bogart's partners in crime. Joan Leslie plays a girl with a club foot whom Bogart immediately falls for. Things get complicated when Bogart arranges to have the girl's foot operated on and he realizes that Lupino has fallen for him.This is a film where no is quite what he or she seems to be. The girl brings out the humanity in Bogart's character, but of course after she is "cured" she becomes a party girl and immediately hooks up with her divorced boy friends from back east. She spurns Bogart's offer of marriage. Meanwhile Lupino becomes more and more attracted to Bogart.The robbery at a posh club goes badly. Bogart's partners (Arthur Kennedy and Alan Curtis) crash during the getaway. Bogart has the loot but then the "fence" (Donald MacBride) dies and he's stuck waiting around while they find a way to get cash for the jewelry.The famous finale of this film is filmed on location in the Sierras. As Bogart is holed up in the mountains, the local media goes into a frenzy about him and nicknames him "Mad Dog," which infuriates Bogart. Aside from being a robber, Bogart is of course really a "good" man, just as Lupino is really, underneath the tough exterior, a "good" woman.Lupino (who gets top billing) and Bogart are excellent. Both actors have the amazing ability to act tough and always show their "soft" interiors. Leslie is OK as the gimp. Kennedy and Curtis are also OK as the dumb crooks.Supporting cast includes MacBride, Henry Travers (excellent as Pa), Cornel Wilde (as Mendoza), Elisabeth Risdon, Minna Gombell, Paul Harvey, John Eldridge, Henry Hull, Isabel Jewell, Barton MacLane, Harry Hayden, and Jerome Cowan.This was an important film in the careers of Bogart and Lupino, and they are both just excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Divisor Between the Traditional Gangster Movies to Film Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After eight years in prison, the gangster Roy Earle (Humphrey Bogart) is set free, helped by an old and unhealthy bandit, who wants Earle to participate in the robbery of jewels and money in the safe deposit box of a hotel. While travelling to meet the gang formed by his old friend, he meets a family on the road and has a crush on Velma Baughmam (Joan Leslie), a handicap twenty years old woman with problem in one of her feet. Earl help the family with a doctor and money for a surgery of Velma's foot. Meanwhile, he meets the two small-time bandits that will help him in the heist, and Louis Mendoza (Cornel Wilde), the manager of the hotel who gave the information about the jewels. With them, Earle meets also the strip dancer Marie Garson (Ida Lupino), and a funny dog, `adopted' by them. While robbing the hotel and during their escape, some incidents happen and Earle ends without money, escaping from the police to High Sierra, where his adventure ends. This film is a divisor between the traditional gangster movies to film noir. Humphrey Bogart plays a tough, but romantic gangster. In accordance with a special matter in the DVD, this was the first important role of Humphrey Bogart, and the last time his name was not the first in the credits. The moral and society values of 1941sounds very interesting in the presents days. The car chase scene is amazingly well done. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): `O ltimo Refgio' (`The Last Refuge')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>High Sierra (1941) is interesting for Bogart, who is the obvious star even though he gets second billing to Lupino. The three stories are simple and only moderately interesting -- planning a heist, an older man falling for a teenager, and a lonely woman looking for love.The story begins with bank robber Roy "Mad Dog" Earle (Humphrey Bogart) getting a pardon after 8 years in prison. The pardon was bought and he is expected to leave Indiana and go to a resort hotel in California to make a big jewelry heist. Traveling as "Collins" from Chicago, meets a poor family in a rickety car at a gas stop, in view of Mt Whitney, "the tallest in the United States", says the attendant. Which it was, because Alaska was not yet a state. The grand daughter, Velma (Joan Leslie, only 15), has a club foot and when they meet again at a motor park in California, Roy takes a liking to the girl, asks if anything can be done about her foot, puts his hand on hers while they watch the stars one night in the desert. Later, visiting the boss, 'Mac', who is in bed with a variety of illnesses, gives Roy a chance to ask the Doc about club feet, and takes him to see Velma. Roy "loans" the money to fix Velma's foot, and proposes to her, but she is in love with a man back home in Ohio. Roy is crushed.The rendezvous is at cabins in the woods, the three accomplices initially look at graying Earle and think he is an old cream puff. A conversation about a "gun that went tap-tap-tap in the night", and Earle's no-nonsense mannerisms convinced them that he was a man to be feared. When Roy returns from LA, sees a bruise on Marie (Ida Lupino), gets fed up with Babe and Red and sends them away, telling them to behave or he will shoot them. Marie takes a liking to Roy, but he tells her he doesn't care for her that way.MAJOR SPOILERS follow. The actual heist is surreal. No attempt to hide their identity. Marie in the car sounds the horn for trouble. When a policeman shows up, a guest screams, the policeman pulls his gun, Roy is forced to shoot, in the get away Babe and Red miss a turn, wreck, and die, but Mendoza (Cornel Wilde), with them survives. But when Roy gets to Mac, he is dead, the fence for the jewelry is gone, another must be found. Mendoza squealed and the cops are hunting Roy, Marie, and the dog that always seems to bring its owner bad luck and death. After a chase up the mountain on dirt roads, Roy is cornered up a rock outcropping all night. Marie shows up with the dog, when Roy hears the dog he steps out and calls for Marie, a sniper gets him. That damned dog always brings its owner bad luck! The death at the end was expected, as Roy had said more than once that he would not go back to prison. Regarding his helping Velma, at first it seemed that he just had a soft heart in spite of his life of crime. But it looks like it was only a selfish motive, he thought he could fix Velma up for himself. Roy Earle was just a hardened criminal who looked out for himself, until he actually fell for Marie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone loves "Mad Dog" Collins- a lovable dog, a crippled girl half his age who talks like an eight-year old, her grandpa (who played the doctor in The Invisible Man), and the cynical Ida Lupino. But why? Bogart hardly shows any wit, humour or charisma towards any of the characters. Nor can it be understood why Bogart would choose the childlike Velma over the jaw-dropping Lupina who oozes sex and is practically begging it Bogie-style. "Don't talk like a sap" Bogart tells Lupina, but that would be characteristic of most of the dialogue despite one reviewer's claims that it is "witty." The film seems uncertain as to what direction it wants to take- either a Chaplinesque syrupy romance demanding double-takes, gaping mouths and wide-eyes from its actors and tears and vulnerable innocence from its actresses. Throw in a cross-eyed "coloured boy" who of course is always asleep and a few books short of a library and invulnerable police and you have a film that seems dated even for 1941 standards. As a result the film, already lengthy at 100 minutes, drags until the obligatory final chase (which I must say is creditable). This is not helped by the ultimately pointless diversion involving the doddering old man who is introduced to "Mad Dog" by a pseudonym and yet, the next meeting refers to him by his real name after a contrived coincidence which has Bogart fall in love with a child. www.tracesofevil.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like old black/white movies (1941), cops &amp; robbers, or if you are a Humphry Bogart fan, then this is a great movie. The story moves well and gets you absorbed quickly. Bogy's performance as a gangster is classic. This film was made early in Bogy's career and helped establish himself as a star. Also the 1940s locations are interesting to see. I thought this movie was well done. The acting was good, also good direction, and photographed very good. An "updated" color version of this movie is "I Died A Thousand Times," starring Jack Palance. This movie is just as good as the original, and goes to show you can't mess up a good story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noir in the desert ? this is why this was Bogart's last film where he wasn't top of the bill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Career criminal Roy `Mad Dog' Earle is pardoned from his life sentence and released. He immediately joins with his old boss and forms a group to work another job. While in the California area he befriends a family from east who have a daughter, Velma, who has a clump foot. Roy falls for this innocent girl and helps her get the operation she needs on her foot. Roy also begins to fall for Marie, the girl of one of his gang ? however his number may be up as fate begins to conspire against him.This film bravely took noir out of the dark city streets and put it in a sunny California. The story follows a doomed criminal as he mixes the two sides of his personality ? his criminal side and the side of him that feels akin to losers and giving people second chances. The story mixes these well ? showing Roy's collapse into despair as he is rejected by the innocent he befriends and slowly as we build to his destiny.Lupino gets top billing, but she doesn't have as much to do as you'd expect. The real star here is Bogart, taking his last second billing here. He looks worn and menacing but mixes it well with compassion and makes for a sympathetic bad guy.Overall this is a fine thriller from Walsh ? it may not be as dark as other thrillers, but the darkness and depth is there in the characters, making this a clever twist on the film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pard steals the show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"High Sierra", based on a W.R.Burnett novel, gets the royal treatment from the screen play that John Huston wrote. Raoul Walsh directed with his usual cinematic style. The film remains interesting even after more than sixty years since its original release. Mr. Bogart owes his film career to Mr. Huston, the man that was instrumental in making him one of the biggest stars of all times.There are things that don't make much sense in the film. First of all is the way Velma, with her club foot, at the beginning of the film, gives Roy Earle the illusion she cares for him; standing next to Velma, Roy appears to be her father! When in a matter of days, Velma is operated, she becomes another woman. Velma undergoes a transformation that is hard to believe, but one figures that for a film, concessions must be made, but give us a break, an orthopedic operation of that nature requires a lot of therapy in order to be able to dance! There is also the credibility of Roy's pardon and release from prison in Indiana. He gets off easily, something than in real life, doesn't happen at all.Roy attracts Marie, the girl he didn't want to keep around; they end up in loving one another. We realize from the start Roy is doomed because crime doesn't pay. As we watch the botched robbery at the resort hotel, we realize Roy's days are numbered.Aside from all minor reality lapses, "High Sierra" is a fun film to watch. Humphrey Bogart, who went to do "The Maltese Falcon" for Mr. Huston right after this film, has a great opportunity to shine in the movie. Ida Lupino, a much bigger 'star' than Mr. Bogart, at the time, is splendid in her take of Marie. Arthur Kennedy, a distinguished actor of the American stage and screen doesn't have much to do.Ultimately, the real star of the film is Pard, the cute dog that steals the picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sierra must have been indeed high: on crack.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High Camp in High Sierra.This is the sort of old-school Hollywood cheese that rivals any cheese ever made in France, Switzerland or Denmark. There is no aroma like the smell of filmic cheese.Bogey, the perennial criminal midget with the height of a tall bunny and the speech impediment of a Looney Toons character, leaves jail. No sooner is he out, already is he being involved in a major heist. (At least those silly old movies waste no time.) He meets an "ex-copper", a new associate, whom Bogey instantly dislikes. "I don't trust no damn ex-coppers!" This resentment against "coppers", who are surely the principals to blame for standing between Mad Dog Earle and his eternal bliss, Bogey displays with a quick double-slap! The ex-copper never knew what hit him. Just as I never knew what hit ME: I was laughing, caught totally off-guard by this extremely silly scene that was in no way meant to be comical.Mad Dog Bogey Earle is not just a bank robber - he is Robin Hood. He steals from the rich, and then gives to poor girls with clubfeet. He has a chance meeting with Verna, a wide-eyed crippled girl. Bogey gets the hots for her, forgets about the heist completely (and we forget this is a heist movie!). "That dame wouldn't be half-bad if I did somethin' about that damn limp!" Previously he had met Ida Lupino, but for some reason this hardened criminal who hadn't touched a woman in years totally ignores her: Lupino is anything but ugly, reminding me quite a bit of Susan Hayward. Aren't convicts interested (mildly put) in sex once they finally leave jail? But, no: Mad Dog Earle is an IDEALISTIC criminal. Not only is he a modern-day Robin Hood, but he also cares far more about love than sex. A man in his 40s leaves jail and he wants... love?? Only in a dumb 40s film."The papers called me 'Mad Dog Earle'! Damn them! I'm Robin Hood Earle!"Verna gets to walk, even dance, only DAYS after her ultra-successful foot surgery. Apparently, early 40s medicine was far advanced in relation to anything that exists now."Say, that goyl sure got up quickly! I sure oughta thank Huston's brilliant script for that!" There is something decidedly creepy about a 41 year-old Bogey (looking more like 55) putting his mangy hand on 16 year-old, cripple Joan Leslie. (She is supposed to be 20-ish)."Say, I figure if I fix that damn foot of hers, she'll not only not be a cripple no more, but I'll get to have 'er, too!" Sadly, VERY sadly, Leslie later rejects this noble criminal's sexual and marital advances. However, like a true gentleman - which as we know ALL old-school criminals are - he does not threaten anyone, doesn't even demand the money back that he paid for the surgery. Another such selfless, high-principled display of that wondrous nature was to be seen when he actually decided to follow-up on his dead boss's wishes, written in a letter that Bogey - naturally - hadn't opened out of curiosity BEFORE the old geezer died. (Oh, yeah, did I mention the fact that the dying boss is another criminal with a heart-of-gold?)"Say, how come such two-bit crooks like us are such swell guys?..." Like every noble, selfless, murdering criminal, Bogey does not rejoice when the car with the other gang members blows up on the road. "Say, those two guys crashed! That means mine and Lupino's cut of the loot doubles - and yet I can't and won't celebrate for I am Robin the Hood Earle!" More silliness comes in form of a mutt. Believe it or not, someone who loves dogs (either Huston or the author) managed to turn the movie's mutt into a central plot-device-making instrument. Mad Dog Oyle is the best in the business, a hardened, smart pro - and yet he brings along this mutt ON A HEIST! Oh, them da criminal hearts-of-gold, them's hard to match in goodness...At one point Earle gets shot. He doesn't let a mere bullet bother him, hence he gets up straight away. Later on, the abdomenal surgery hurt no more than the bullet entering his noble flesh, hence he also gets up from the surgeon's table with the lightness of a bee."Say, that bullet hardly scratched me! It must be one of them John Huston bullets that hurt no more than a needle sting." I also love how they used the same plot-device TWICE. Both times when Bogey robs a place, a cops shows up. "Coppers like them da ants: always milling around everywhere!" And I think black people will absolutely ADORE the awfully stereotypical black character...HS is an absurd, but watchable piece of crap that should have you grinning like a lunatic - or, if you're not that bright, should have you writing what a great and relevant movie it is for the evolution of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart (Roy Earle) is sprung from prison so that he can lead a gang in a robbery at a hotel for the wealthy. He meets his gang - Ida Lupino (Marie), Arthur Kennedy (Red), Alan Curtis (Babe) along with the inside man who works on reception at the hotel, Cornel Wilde (Mendoza) and heist mastermind Donald MacBride (Big Mac). However, on his way to meet up with his new crime unit, he befriends a family headed by Henry Travers (Pa) and falls in love with the daughter Joan Leslie (Velma). He retains his connection with this family throughout the film as he plans his robbery and escape. Does he pull it off......? The film has a nice setting and the ending stands out as we watch Bogart battle things out on the Sierra mountain range. There is a standout shot of a marksman looking down from a vantage point on the Sierra Nevada - nice camera-work. There is also a car chase up the mountain which is well executed and the stuff of nightmares as cars tear round bends not knowing what is around the corner. The cast are OK with Bogart as the standout character.Unfortunately, the film does not deliver on what should be an interesting story. It spends far too much time tracking Bogart's friendship with Travers and his family and, in particular, his perverted love for someone who is WAY too young for him - Joan Leslie - the daughter with a club foot. He pays for her defect to be cured and thinks he can swoop her away with him. What a perv. Lupino is a far more suitable love interest for him but I can understand him not wanting anything to do with her because of her affection for a bloody dog called Pard. The writers have given Bogart a sensitive side by thinking "Hmmmm. He needs to be sensitive. Lets get him to love a cripple and have a soft side for dogs. Yeah. That's a good idea." Well, it's not. He should have killed the dog in the first few scenes. And this is where the story gets stupid - he takes the dog with him to a robbery on Lupino's request. Aaaah! How sensitive of him! There is a lot more of that irritating dog in the film - it's really naff. Given the cast, the film is weaker than the sum of it's parts and it is just not gripping enough. Oh yeah....and Willie Best does his annoying black man thing in the guise of Algernon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've wanted to see this for years and finally got a chance to tonight (thank God for Turner Classics!), only to be sorely disappointed. Although there are some early scenes of interest involving Arthur Kennedy, Cornel Wilde, &amp; Alan Curtis as gotta-be-gay young thugs, the story soon goes off a deep end of unbelievable plotting involving two younger women. Bogey seems uncomfortable in the role &amp; should have let George Raft keep the project. Ida Lupino's hairstyle really irritated me; I kept thinking of Carol Burnett's great Eunice character every time Lupino was on camera &amp; waiting for her to utter the kind of snappily bitter line of dialogue Burnett made famous years later, but no such luck. She's a complete, simpering drag here, one of many elements which pull the production down into nothingness. Joan Leslie is the picture of lovely vapidity; considering the later girls in Bogie's onscreen love life, she's got to be the least. Oh, and that horrible black stereotype Algernon (played by Willie Best) is just vile, even for the period; contrast him with that virile member of Bogie's gang in the superior "Petrified Forest" just a few years before. I kept waiting for the gang from Mystery Science Theater to sit down in the front row and rag on the action: yes, it's that bad. Bogie's sleep-talking scene is one of the lowest points in his career on film, just begging for satire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart shows his romantic side in true form in this movie. Ida Lupino is barely believable as the moll, as her classy exterior just can't hide in this movie. You can almost picture her going home and spending the evening at an elegant Hollywood party with literary types, after a day on the set of High Sierra. There is not much chemistry between her and Bogart. He has some natural chemistry with Joan Leslie and you genuinely believe he is charmed by her. With Ida Lupino they seem to be two actors saying their lines back and forth to each other. They never quite connect. Joan Leslie is somewhat more believable as a young girl who is repelled by the thought of romancing Humphrey Bogart. She just wants to have a good time as a normal girl. The ladies clothes are surprisingly well cut in this movie. The end dragged on a bit. But definitely a must see for early noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a comedy but pretty darn close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humphrey Bogart was not yet a star, so top billing was given to Ida Lupino, the woman who made the most funny insane scene in history in "They Drive by Night". Here she doesn't have much of that edge and she is almost annoyingly sweet throughout.The movie was of course a coup for Bogie and there are not many film actors today who could play a gangster and still make him into a rather soft-hearted character without losing his overall threatening demeanor. Look at the way he melts when he sees the mutt who follows Marie (Lupino) and him everywhere.There is a rather silly subplot involving a clubfooted girl who Bogie falls in love with but it all kind of makes sense when we see the scene between Bogie and the mob doctor. Although Bogie is supposed to be in love with this girl, he looks rather uncomfortable. Maybe it was because Joan Leslie, who plays her was still a teenager and Bogie was 40 at the time (a thing that also plagued Gary Cooper in Sergeant York).Anyway, although this movie is grand entertainment it somehow pales when you compare it to Bogie's next film "The Maltese Falcon" because of the rather sickening sweet dialog between Bogie and Lupino. There is just too much "cute" in their shared scenes, especially when Lupino breaks down and begs Bogie not to send her back to Los Angeles.Otherwise, you can count on that you will laugh a lot and not because, as I mentioned before, that this is a comedy, but because of the shear innocence that the movies of those days basically have. Yes, Lupino is supposed to be kind of trampy and Bogie is a killer but is there really any scenes in this movie that are vile? Not really. Ahh, they sure don't make'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sophomoric drivel with good performance by Ida Lupino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart plays his usual tough-guy-with-soft-heart in this unlikely story about a robbery and it's (for the time) predictable consequences. The film is riddled with jarring, corny, 40's-movie, gangster talk, like "take that copper". Then there's the old cliche where the girl can't afford the operation -- blaach.A strikingly beautiful Ida Lupino plays the gun mole with elan. Even so, you should skip this one unless you can't live without consuming every last nanosecond of Humphrey Bogart's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK Bogart Flick With a Dog as Main Protagonist...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raoul Walsh's HIGH SIERRA is not a memorable film, with the exception of some eye-popping happenings on the highway and ridges of the Sierra Madre Mountains. Bogart would fare better up there 7 years later looking for gold in TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE. Interestingly enough, John Huston wrote both pictures, this one a bit implausible, but entertaining at least. Hollywood presents a dog as a featured star, something that has become so overused today, it is almost looked for. What I liked about this slight gangster film was the climactic chase up the Madres. The film is sped up to enhance the pursuit, much to the delight of viewers who can overlook such dated devices. Bogie is the bad guy, a "mad dog" actually, but he is soft after his pardon and is looking for love.Ida Lupino gets top billing over Bogie, in his first ever lead role. She is a sweet, broken woman, used to being slapped around. Bogart has his eyes on a young gal, art imitating later life. (Bacall) No, Lauren is not the gal, but you get the idea. One of the odd things about the picture is Bogie's whacky hairdo. He looks like a Hitler youth officer. The dog is annoying and does some pretty acrobatic, unnecessary things. Still, this is historic in that Bogart established himself as one of the ultimate leading male actors here, and his image was forever changed to the cynic with a heart of gold.The scenes with the young girl seem thrown in and the story should have just focused on "Mad Dog's" plight with some incompetent partners and a job gone wrong. The final third redeems the film, dropping all references to the country family Bogie helps and focusing on what we're watching this for. Its a gangster pic and we want to see some gunplay, wise cracks, and wise guys. Walsh directs with a deft hand, and the ending sequence could have made for a good film in itself. RATING: 6 1/2 of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a bad movie but a disappointing one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't really say anything bad about this movie except to say that compared to other bogart movies (such as the maltese falcon, sierra madre, casablanca or the big sleep) this one disappointed me. It's mildly entertaining in the way that a good television episode of "the practice" or "nypd blue" can sometimes be, but I just can't place it with those other classic films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bogart is very good in this picture which has an interesting premise. It's more about finding love amongst crime, but the one you love slaps you in the face. You can't buy love!All performances are terrific!The direction is good but the picture is let down by a disappointing finale which is pretty predictable.Overall, it's good but not great.</fullReview>
