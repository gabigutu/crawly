		<shortDescription>Will undoubtedly become a cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arguably one of the finest horror comedies of all time is Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead, and since its release in '04, there have been a good number of wannabes. Based on the trailers for Zombieland, however, I thought that the film had some serious potential to match Shaun in terms of quality, possibly even usurp it. Having seen the film, I'm happy to say that Zombieland does just that.Unlike many comedies in recent memory, in which the majority of laughs are already provided by the trailer, Zombieland is filled to the brim with laugh-out-loud moments, thanks largely to the brilliant cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the main protagonist, Columbus, portraying that sense of vulnerability and awkwardness, without becoming too Michael Cera-like. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also terrific as the sweet, yet tough Wichita and the more-mature-than-she-seems Little Rock, respectively. The real stand-out performance, though, is Woody Harrelson as the Twinkie-lovin', zombie-hatin' Tallahassee. Next to that of Woody Boyd on Cheers and Frasier, this is definitely the best performance of his career. There's also a painfully hilarious cameo appearance about mid-way through the film that would be a crime to spoil. Suffice it to say, this is ? hands-down ? the best cameo that I've ever seen in a film.The most surprising aspect of Zombieland, to me, is how much heart there is. All of the characters feel warm and alive, and what drama there is to be found feels extremely sincere. Ultimately, you feel invested in the story and the characters, which ? I think ? is the most important thing any film of any genre can do.Zombieland has instantly become a horror favorite of mine (comedic or otherwise). The ? for the lack of a better word ? quotable dialogue, consistently hysterical tone, and endearing characters, all come together to create a film that will undoubtedly become a cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Pleasant Surprise...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came from a sneak preview held in Baltimore and left the theater feeling very satisfied. You don't normally find a late September movie as good as "Zombieland" was. After dropping you in the action right from the start, the movie keeps coming with constant laughs and good action. There were not a lot of scares in the movie, other than the few obvious scenes where you could see one coming, but horror is not what the director was going for in this film. Laughs, however, come often and from many different directions. Jessie Eisenberg's nerdy, insecure 'Columbus' character and Woody Harrelson's redneck zombie-killing 'Tallahassee' play very well off each other and provide plenty of memorable moments. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are also solid throughout. There is also one unforgettable cameo that had most of the audience rolling in the aisles. The film has a simple, easy to follow storyline that does not provoke a lot of questions. Indeed, if you go to this movie expecting a lot of plot twists and surprises, you're going to be severely disappointed. There is however, good action, good laughs, and plenty of zombie related gore. At about 90 minutes long, it does not drag on and gets to the predictable but satisfying ending, going out in style. There will no doubt be a lot of comparisons to "Shaun of the Dead", which is nothing to be ashamed of, but this is truly a one of a kind movie experience that holds its own with any not only any zombie movie in recent memory, but with any comedy so far this year. As long as you don't go into this movie expecting too much, you'll get your money's worth. Well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly crafted with laughs from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught a sneak preview of Zombieland with a friend and was impressed to say the least.Zombieland has to have one of the flashiest openings in memory. There is no subtle build up. You are dropped right into Zombieland as Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) begins listing the rules to survival. Of course each rule gives you a hysterical example of why the rule is in place. Anything that has been taboo for horror films at one time is met head on. I won't list each as not to spoil the movie but Zombieland has a unique ability to make almost anything seem comical. This includes the fact that for some reason it seems that every zombie in Zombieland has a blood belching problem. Literally every zombie has blood spewing from their mouth. This is captured best in the intro as you almost feel like you are supposed to have the 3D glasses in place.Columbus is funny enough with his phobias and geek lifestyle that proves to be what keeps him alive but it isn't until he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), that things really kick into gear. Harrelson seems to have been born for this role. He has more one liners than any character in recent memory. Each line is typically vulgar but even if offensive it is near impossible not to laugh. Let's face it, if you are completely offended by language or blood then you aren't likely to be sitting with a crowd watching Zombieland in the first place.A little romance is thrown into the mix when Columbus and Tallahassee come up on Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). For a zombie comedy I thought Eisenberg and Stone actually had decent chemistry. Not that much time is dedicated to romance but what is there comes across as sincere and lets us watch as Columbus transitions from geek to hero. Even without the romance the girls are an important part of the chemistry of Zombieland. They help to even out the brawn and the brains between the four characters.Zombieland has a simple story. The guys are loners. Columbus with the simple mission to stay alive and Tallahassee with a never ending search for any and all of the remaining golden Twinkies left on the planet. The girls are sisters who are trying to get to an amusement park in CA where they believe, or at least want to believe it is zombie free. A small part of the film feels like the movie Vacation with zombies. The comical trip with a destination which you can just feel isn't going to be what the characters hope for. Like Vacation it shows that the journey is far more important than the destination.The biggest moment of the film has to be the mystery cameo. I'm glad I didn't know who it was and I won't spoil it for anyone else. I will say that it was brilliantly written into the script. PERFECT! It really goes to show how much they focused on getting Zombieland to be a top notch flick that should go down as a horror-comedy classic to remember. It will certainly fit alongside Shaun of the Dead in my movie collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually quite fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just was exiting the theater after seeing '9', which is also worth a look, when my friend and I were offered tickets to a preview screening of Zombieland, which began almost immediately. I had seen previews for this picture, but I'd say this exceeded my expectations, which isn't to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn't really overstay it's welcome. As you might expect for this genre, it's quite gory, so don't go expecting a light 'R' rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. I'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. Let's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America's answer to Shaun of the Dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a fun ride all the way through. It's lack of scariness(non existent) and *GASP!* gore is more than made up for with the constant flow of hilarity and likable characters. This is by far the optimist's zombie film, as the way things play out are definitely different than any one thats come before it(definitely not a Romero flick, though I think his Land of the Dead actually is second place in this regard). It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch for how each rule makes it's appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in the worst of times. I recommend this to anybody who has a remote interest in comedies, zombie/end of the world flicks, or just having a good time at the theater, and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stylish &amp; polished - Easily the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name Zombieland conjures up a vision of a zombie-themed amusement park -- and that's exactly what this film is. Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said, this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers', Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film, which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear, but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style &amp; sensibility. Jesse Eisenberg (who has a certain Michael Cera shyness/eccentricity to his delivery, but doesn't seem nearly as pathetic as Cera's characters often come off) carries the film well. And of course, everyone is talking about the film's 'secret' cameo, and rightly so. It is absolutely the best and most fun part of an already awesomely fun film -- and it kept me laughing almost non-stop throughout that 10-15 minute section of the movie.This is a zombie-comedy that deserves to take it's place amongst the best of the genre, 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Army of Darkness'. In fact, what I wouldn't give to see a triple feature of these films at a drive-in theater on Halloween... the perfect place and time for a zombie feeding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) The entire world is hit with an apocalyptic infection that turns people into zombies once they have been bitten by an infected zombie. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a young geek who has a lot of phobias about almost everything from clowns, to bathrooms, to checking the back seat of cars. Being alone and scared of the outside world has kept him alive. His new fear is being eaten by zombies. To survive, Columbus has begun making a long list of rules to survive. Each time he gives you one of his rules, you see an example of his rule in action. He decides to go home to Columbus to see if his parents are still alive. Along the highway, he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) a redneck zombie killer who loves Twinkies. They team up and head for Tallahassee. On the way they meet and join forces with two girls, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abagail Breslin). They may be the last surviving people on earth, and they must rely on each other to survive.(My Comment) Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best. You usually don't see a zombie movie as a comedy, but you will like this one. Actually this isn't really a comedy; it is more a funny horror movie, because there is bloodshed in a comic situation. There is plenty of blood splattering, plenty of killing and gore, and even some nudity of a stripper zombie. The film delivers you four heroes that you can root for when the zombies come after them. You will begin to love the scenes with the rules of survival that Jesse Eisenberg explains to the audience in a background voice such as wearing your seat-belt, or the double-tap rule after you shoot a zombie make sure he is dead by shooting him in the head again. Trust me; this is not a wasted shot. Woody Harrelson's performance is terrific, as a redneck zombie killer who misses his puppy Buck, and must find a Twinkie at any cost. There is one unforgettable cameo appearance that will take place at someone's Beverly Hills mansion. I won't say his name, but it is hilarious. There is one thing that I must say about this zombie movie that is not normally in zombie movies, and that is the fact that once these zombies are infected they can run very fast. As a matter of fact that is rule number 1, be sure that you can outrun the zombies, because the overweight and slow people were caught first by the zombies. There are some pretty funny scenes, and you will laugh from beginning to end. (Columbia Pictures, Run Time 1:20, Rated R)(7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new style of comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is hardly a plot-heavy and dramatic masterpiece, but it IS very, very funny, and not funny in a way you're used to seeing in a comedy.There are very few jokes made, the humor is more from people doing things that people might normally do, just filmed very well in a humorous fashion.Oh, and the movie has lots of zombies and other awesome stuff that surround this entire idea of having every situation be the biggest "What the frack?!" you can possibly imagine.The small cast was obviously having a great time when they made it, and all four characters did a very good job of fitting with the style of the movie.Lastly, while the whole movie is hilarious, one scene in particular will have you in fits, one of the funniest single little scenes I've ever seen. But, no spoilers here!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most fun i have had at the theatre in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I mean come on, who doesn't think about what they would do if zombies took over the world. Its a fun, yet serious question to think about. Most movies have it right, by taking the serious side of things. But what if we take a video game approach and just run around killing everyone of them? Uh.......you can more than sign me up for this one. OK, lets face the honest question.......if your some little prissy girl who does not like or does not appreciate zombie films.......then this is the wrong movie for you. This movie takes everything you have learned from all those movies, and puts a comedic spin on it. I mean come on, a zombie stripper wearing nipple tasles running in slow motion.....how could anyone not want to see that? The movie is very basic in its groundwork, but excels in its humor and character drive. Woody is basically a zombie film buff's wet dream. A hoosier red neck who wants to just kill zombies for the rest of his life. Now i must admit, towards the middle of the movie, it almost felt like they weren't focusing on the whole zombie aspect that much........mainly because they were adding a little depth to each of the characters. But rest assured, by the end, it totally quenches your thirst. But through all the hilarious dialogue and funny little zombie killing sequences, the best part of the movie was hands down the cameo. Now if you have not heard who it is by now, im not going to say it........but it is almost genius, and probably the best cameo ever created, and i will stand by that 100%. Trust me, it is that funny. Bottom Line.......i know i love zombie movies, and i might seem a little bias........but damnit, this movie is easily the best comedy of the year. It was the perfect mix of humor and gore........not only that, the story was pretty decent, and very entertaining to watch unfold. This movie is seriously like a fun house at the carnival. It will easily be accepted by the zombie lover crowd, and the general population. This movie is easily one of the 10 best i have seen so far this year. If your looking to have a good time at the theatre, this movie will surely provide that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For zombies, by zombies, vaguely about zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8.4 out of 10. Somebody must have given zombies the vote.* SPOILER ALERT * Except, what's to spoil? The writers ran out of ideas roughly seven minutes into the film. It starts off OK, if not brilliantly. Via excessive voice-over, we are introduced to our first one-dimensional Hollywood cardboard cut-out character ("25-year old, nerdy, Jewish, obsessive-compulsive, A-student, virgin"). He has a set of rules for survival: a nice device, but none of the rules are exactly hilarious.We then meet our second one-dimensional character ("roughneck with barely concealed warm heart"), and our first none-dimensional character ("feisty girl with no logical motivation for anything she does other than to present a series of romantic challenges for her one- dimensional male admirer").** SPOILER ** Hence, the two cardboard men enter a shop looking to help reinforce the film's product placement deal. They kill three zombies in inexplicably unnecessary ways, then enter a back room to find two girls (how have they evaded the zombies?), waiting for real people (how did they know the only other two people in America would be passing by?), so they can trick them (why?) and steal their car (why, when there are millions of cars?) and guns (ditto) and drive off in the opposite direction.Then, they lay another trap for the guys (how did they know they'd change direction from east to west and pass by in that direction, down that country road, at that time?), steal their car again (why, when they have one already?), kidnap them instead of leaving them behind (why? why? why? why? and, then again, why?). Ad absurdum, ad infinitum.The middle hour of the film made no attempt to interrupt the enveloping boredom. With Bill Murray, this is the first time I've seen an actor introduced into a film exactly as if he were a piece of product placement, along with ample cringeworthy toadying. It felt as if the studio had said, "the script's not long enough, and we need an extra 25 pages. Bill Murray owes us a favour, so you can have him for an afternoon, if you like. But you only have an hour to write it." They remark on how much he looks like Eddie Van Halen, which is bizarre, because he clearly looks like Michael Jackson. But maybe they thought referencing Jackson would have felt too much like introducing a joke into the film.The final act was merely a bland shoot-'em-up computer game, but without the intellectual dimension.The role the zombies play in this film is as an uninteresting, unthreatening MacGuffin required to cause occasional distractions from what is in essence the lamest love story between two of the least interesting characters in modern film.It's an insult to America to refer to Zombieland as an American Shaun of the Dead, a film which incidentally has an IMDb rating of just 7.8, against Zombieland's 8.4. Which is rather like Star Wars rating 7.8 against Plan 9 from Outer Space rating 8.4.1 out of 10 because 0 isn't an option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the zombie apocalypse. We meet Columbus, our nervous, nerdy, young hero filling up his car. In voice-over, he gives us a quick rundown of his rules of survival and then demonstrates them when he's attacked by two zombies in a car park.On a deserted highway strewn with the detritus of the old world that once existed, Columbus runs into the crazy but dumb Tallahassee (the characters call themselves after the place they come from so they don't get too close to one another). Played by Woody Harrelson, he clearly is having a great time with his role. Without his charm, the film would really suffer as the younger actors don't bring a lot to the party.Later on, they meet two double-crossing sisters (the older one played by a deep-voiced, huge-eyed Lindsay Lohan lookalike, the younger one played by Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin). These characters are so selfish, mean-spirited and ultimately stupid that it's hard to feel anything for them. The romance between Columbus and Wichita at the end feels forced and phoney.The cameo by Bill Murray is a welcome respite. The affection the filmmakers and other actors have for him and his death in it, raise Murray to the level of national treasure. The world, even at its end, seems a much darker place without him.As everything that happens in the film follows the lead character's rules for survival to the letter, there are no surprises. He seems to know everything in advance. The writers get so caught up in their own cleverness that they don't see the bigger picture of what they're doing. The zombies never really come close to turning the tables on the heroes and that kills any tension there might be (even when they are vastly outnumbered and surrounded, their lives are never really in any danger and they easily find a way out of any situation.) The self-conscious humour and deafening rock soundtrack constantly remind you that nothing bad is going to happen to the heroes.Never as funny as Shaun of the Dead (Harrelson's running Twinkie gag isn't really that funny to begin with and the payoff is a letdown), never as intense as Dawn of the Dead, it falls between the two stools. So it's a good movie, not a great one. It's fun while it's on but never reaches the heights of George A. Romero's zombie flicks or 28 Days Later for that matter. There is apparently a sequel on the way; hopefully it will be tighter and scarier than the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a regular boy with regular gaming addiction, but has serious people phobia &amp; never had any friends in his life &amp; is afraid most of the times. One day, due to the spread of an incurable virus, the whole of USA is over-run by zombies. He wants to see his parents in Columbus &amp; during his journey meets up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who loves to kill zombies. They are conned by a pair of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) &amp; Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). All of them become friends over their crazy journey across America.I seriously loved this film. The comedy is great, we care about the characters, the zombies are gross &amp; the dialogues are seriously cool. This became one of my favourite comedy films of all time, as the character development is strong &amp; there are laughs all the way through. This film has something which lots of films in this genre are missing, it has heart. The characters are warm &amp; the little drama it has is very sincere.The standout performance comes from Woody Harrelson who is Twinkie loving and zombie hating. Jesse Eisenberg is really maturing as an actor. His latest films have all been good. And his rules, God The Rules, that was so much fun. Abigail Breslin plays yet again the girl-who's-mature-way-beyond-her-age. It may sound boring, but trust me it is anything but that. Emma Stone as Wichita, I loved her. All the characters were endearing to me.This will undoubtedly become a cult classic, much in the same way as 'Shaun Of The Dead'. A zombie comedy that's this good has taken too long to come after Shaun of the Dead. But it is definitely worth the wait:) 9/10 -Girish,20</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you wanna watch a zombie comedy like Shaun of the Dead, watch Shaun of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you fancy watching a film about Zombies then something called "Zombieland" would feel like the best course of action. Unfortunately though Zombieland is very far from the rom-zom-com it's emulating, i.e. Shaun of the Dead. Shaun of the Dead had a great love and affection for this genre and played to it beautifully, interweaving sharp comedy with drama. Zombieland attempts this but ends up being a teen road movie that just happens to be set after the zombie apocalypse and I did not want to see a teen road movie. Don't get me wrong there are some good moments and the film starts off quite promising. However after Columbus (Eisenberg)and Tallehasse (Harrelson) meet the two girls it's begins to lose it's shine. The real problem with this film though is the poor writing. For a start the two girls are instantly unlikeable and the sudden attraction Columbus has for Wichita seem tacked on. Tallahasee's search for Twinkie (think thats how you spell it, I'm British so they're not well known over here) screams of smack you in the face product placement. Then there's the plot holes, oh so many plot holes... 1 - How did the girls manage to get past the zombies in the supermarket when they immediately noticed Columbus and Tallahasse? 2 - Why did the girls hide in the back of the supermarket on the extreme off chance that someone not zombie-fied would stumble upon them? 3 - Why bother conning the guys out of their car and weapons when there's millions of cars and guns just lying around? 4 - The amusement park was meant to be zombie free so why smash open the gate with the car to get in, thereby paving the way for zombies to enter? 5 - Since it's shown that zombies can easily climb why did the girls think a paltry 6 foot wooden fence surrounding the park would hold them back? 6 - Correct me if I'm wrong but if you live in a world over-run with homicidal, flesh eating zombies then surely you'd want to keep a low profile? Why then when you finally get to this supposed zombie free amusement park would you turn all the power on, lighting the place up like a Christmas tree? 7 - How did they manage to get on and off the boat ride without someone else to start and stop it? 8 - Why go on the ride that shoots you straight up to avoid the zombies when you know it'll immediately come back down? 9 - And finally, who's running all the power stations? Everything seems to be working without any problem. You can watch TV, pump petrol, even start up an entire amusement park yet surely the power would be the first thing to go?In all the premise was interesting, though not original, and could probably have worked a lot better with some better writing and perhaps playing to the fact it's a coming of age road movie which just happens to be set after the zombie apocalypse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is directed by Ruben Fleischer from a screenplay written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin as survivors of a Zombie apocalypse thrust together on a road trip in search of a fabled Zombieless sanctuary.As it stands now, Zombieland is the most successful Zombie based film in history. Proving that there is still life (no pun intended) in the undead based comedy. Reese and Wernick have stated that the idea for Zombieland was milling around their heads in 2005, a year after Shaun Of the Dead had made such a joyous appearance on the horror/com circuit. You get the feeling that the guys desperately wanted an American version to rival the British torch bearer. They got it.Where Zombieland differs greatly from Shaun is that it unashamedly lives in a cartoon fantasy world. It blasts right out of the blocks with a montage sequence of death, dismemberment, crash, bangs and wallops, and never lets up on its carefree abandon approach. And hooray to that. In fact the film only pauses for breath for a short time at the mid-point, and even then it's to slot in one of the best ever cameo performances to grace a comedy. Away from the tricks and smart gimmicks that gloriously light up the narrative (the rules, baby, are awesome), Zombieland works so well because of its four characters.This maybe a Zombie movie (and what Zombies they are too), but this is about four likable human beings asking us to invest some time with them as they surge from one situation to the next. Something we are only too glad to do. Be it Harrelson (never better) laying waste to any number of the undead, or Eissenberg (hello there little Woody Allen) offering up witticisms that hide a lonely heart facade; these characters prove to have depth. Yes we could possibly argue that both Stone and Breslin (spunky &amp; perky respectively) deserve more screen time, hell they sure earn it, but as a foursome they combine to make one of the brightest buddy buddy-buddy buddy movies out there.It's plot lite, and unlike Shaun, it has no great peril sequences to fully form the horror aspects of it. But it's so funny and awash with carefree charm we have no right to dwell too long on its tiny faults. One of the best crowd-pleaser's of 2009 and proof positive that an apocalypse really can be quite fun after all. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie started weak, following a nerdy kid A little bit of stuff goes on, then as he's walking down a road a redneck picks him up and they go to a store to get Twinkies(That's meant to be funny) And some chicks steal their stuff for no reason, they find new stuff, the chicks take it again And the two boys go with the girls and the movie goes from 6-Zombies-so-far-land to Dumb-bland-crap-land I don't care if you have Bill Murry, when your movie sucks he can't save it At the end there's a big shoot-out but all the characters are stupid as hell, E.G. when the girls are trapped on "the blastoff" with no ammo, they hold the guns above their heads and try kicking the zombies off (why not hit them with the gun-butt?)Over All: Not enough zombies to be Zombieland All the "comedy" felt like it was forced(VERY predictable and unfunny) Bill Murry... I still can't believe that was him (had to be Garfield Murry, because there is no way that's Groundhog Day Murry)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really curious about this movie since I really like Woody Harrelson and the trailer looked so good. Sadly, what you see in the trailer is basically what you get in the movie when it comes to some kind of fun.Main problems with this movie are: - a total lack of rhythm and coherence in the story - bad choice of actors (sadly, even Woody is nowhere near his best performances) - bad acting (cringe worthy) - ridiculous decisions made by the characters (the whole amusement park thing is extremely stupid)One good thing in the movie are "the rules", which at least make sense.Even the generally liked Bill Murray episode just induces facepalms... really, they let him go in and try to scare a man with a shotgun? What a wonderful idea.I don't have the time and the inclination to really go through the plot and list all the problems with the movie. What I can give you is an advice - STAY AWAY from the movie if you have to pay money to see it.If you can see it for free and you are curious, well I guess there is really no harm in that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolute Complete Piece of Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like zombie movies and this is definitely the worst zombie I have ever seen in my life. I am writing in hopes that I will actually save someone 88 minutes of their life. The utter ridiculous actions of the characters and the continuity errors in this film are too plentiful to list, but I'll try to list a few so you can get an idea: **Spoilers** 1) driving cross country in a Hummer without filling up for gas or eating even once 2) finding bags of automatic weapons randomly in cars 3) walking into towns not even paying attention or looking for zombies and there aren't any to be found anyways 4) riding on amusement park rides without being able to shut them off 5) leaving in the morning and arriving at night while driving to amusement park that is just miles away. 6) thinking a girl has been bitten by a zombie without seeing a bite mark or a zombie bite her 7) hanging onto a flying cart with one hand while firing automatic weapons accurately with the other hand 8) dressing up like a zombie and trying to scare random people that you don't know who are caring automatic weapons 9) having electricity, but not any water 10) being stupid enough to turn on all the lights in an amusement park and riding the rides alone knowing it will attract hundreds of zombiesThe list just goes on and on. The jokes aren't funny. The dialog isn't catchy. The characters aren't interesting and absolutely no humans die. What's worse..the zombies aren't even in half the movie. This is just an flat-out disgrace to everyone involved...people who enjoy must have absolutely no standards whatsoever for film-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is a gleefully twisted mockumentary about a world full of you-know-whats, wherein only five living people remain in the entire world. It&#x2019;s gory and disgusting, but most of all, it&#x2019;s terrific fun, with just the right mix of violence and off-kilter comedy.Jesse Eisenberg plays a young man named Columbus (because that&#x2019;s where he&#x2019;s heading, across the wasteland that is the middle US). Columbus is scared of just about everything: clowns, the cloths people use to wipe down tables, bathrooms, you name it. A hot apartment neighbor comes down with this hot new disease that all the cool kids don&#x2019;t want to have, and before you know it he&#x2019;s killed her (well, rekilled) and is on the run, fleeing zombies and making up a long list of rules of how to survive in the eponymous new land. Near the beginning of our story, he meets up with a man he calls Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who&#x2019;s, uh, on his way to Tallahassee, and they in turn meet with a couple of con girls (Abagail Breslin and Emma Stone).Comparisons to Shaun of the Dead are somewhat apt, as both movies are comedic takes on a horror subgenre, and director Ruben Fleischer was influenced by the Simon Pegg-Nick Frost movie. But. Zombieland is both funnier and more sincere; it&#x2019;s not a slapstick comedy, and it&#x2019;s not really a horror film, as Shaun of the Dead was. In fact, it&#x2019;s sort of quirky and genreless.There were a LOT of laugh-out-loud moments for me in this movie, and I think a chief reason it all gels is that the leads are so perfectly cast. Eisenberg is awesome as the protagonist, the vulnerable hero, and Harrelson is a real hoot as the Mad-Max-like (or maybe Ash from Evil Dead) gentle psycho who desires nothing more than to waste zombies and find one, just one, Twinkie. Yes, I said Twinkie! I also really liked Abagail Breslin as the moppet Little Rock. It&#x2019;s always tough for child actors to make the transition into more-adult roles, but she&#x2019;s up to the task here. Emma Stone is tough and sweet as her sisterly counterpart.There&#x2019;s a cameo that&#x2019;ll surely surprise you &#x2013; and what&#x2019;s more, it really works. The actor &#x2013; no spoilers here! &#x2013; really sells the role. Let&#x2019;s just say that he plays himself. Did I mention that the main characters are headed to California and that basically everyone else in the world is either dead or a zombie? Everyone? You don&#x2019;t often hear people applaud during a movie, but applaud we did at a couple key moments. The final scene in an amusement park is witty and lighthearted, at least as lighthearted as mowing down zombies with machine guns can be.Now, granted, there&#x2019;s plenty of blood splattering, plenty of gore, plenty of cursing, and even some nudity. And yes, it&#x2019;s even gratuitous. But not for a zombie movie. For a zombie movie, those things are sort of underplayed a little bit, at least in the true horror sense &#x2013; they&#x2019;re played much more for chuckles than anything else. If anything, Zombieland is a movie that dares you to take it seriously, just so it can pull the rug out from under you and we can all laugh. It&#x2019;s an offbeat look at an overused genre that cranks out the guts and guffaws in equal, lethal doses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe all of the acclaim that this movie is receiving! The movie is aesthetically shallow, lacks an original plot and characters, and ,although being advertised as a comedy, fails to deliver much laugh-out-loud humour. Zombieland is generic in all accounts, a tool of Hollywood for attracting teenage male viewers to the cinema with zombies and gore, and female viewers with a mediocre romance.Like the movie as a whole, Zombieland's cinematography is shoddy at best. It tries to parody the intense camera work prevalent in Romero's work, but with a too-polished look and an overuse of slow motion (probably meant to be funny). It's like watching dawn of the dead if the cinematographer were the same guy that did the 40 year-old virgin. Zombieland, which in many ways tries to be America's answer to Shaun of the Dead fails to deliver visually. Whereas the latter juxtaposed hilarious action with a grim, washed-out physical atmosphere for comedic effect, Zombieland's camera work is too clean, to shiny, it simply lacks flavor, like the whole of the movie.I have come to the conclusion that Zombieland is not a comedy, but a romance containing a few comedic scenes. As many have already said, the main funny parts are advertised in the trailer. The scene where Columbus's neighbor turns into a zombie as she and him are sitting on a couch together is an exception to this, as it is actually funny. Overall, concerning genre Zombieland is a romantic family values movie. Awkward, nerdy boy (Columbus) meets rebellious misandrist (Wichita), and after much mistrust, stupidity and "heroics" rebellious misandrist decides to stop being a bitch to awkward boy, and stay with him, illustrating the genesis of one of films most touching sadist/masochist relationships (sarcasm).The film is advertised as a comedy, but turns out to be a family-values romance on the plane of Disney + ZOMBIES. The most generic monster + an extremely generic plot apparently equals profit. Not surprising in an age where directors like Michael Bay have a career, but I digress.There are two good things about this film: one is twinkie loving, gun toting Talahassee, the most finely illustrated, if not the only finely illustrated character in the whole movie, the other is Bill Murray. At first glance Talahassee is a tough-as-nails barbarian with deep reservations about getting involved with people, for fear of losing them to the zombies. As the movie progresses we learn that he is on a quest for that sweet snack which he most adores, a twinkie. He finally finds his twinkie at the end of the movie, reinforcing the theme of completion. We also learn that the reason Talahassee fears connecting with people because of the loss of his son. He resolves this loss by becoming a father-figure to Wichita's sister, who lacks parents. Talahassee is a dynamic and consistently funny character and works wonderfully as a foil to reserved Columbus. Too bad he was in this movie. Bill Murray needs no explanation, he's Bill Murray.Zombieland is a masterpiece of Hollywood economics. It is a combination of multiple genres, targeting at least two large demographics: males between the ages of 10 and 30, and females between the ages of 10 and 30. The presence of zombies, gore and (failed) badassery are supposed to attract the males. The strong, albeit bitchy, female character and the romantic plot are intended for the female demographic. The attempt at comedy is mostly a failure, but is intended to target the general comedy-loving populace. The film was, arguably, cheap to produce, with only a handful of speaking characters, a few sets (most of the film takes place in outdoor locations), one Bill Murray and zombie effects. The return is of course huge, partly because of false advertising. There is nothing special about this movie. Combine your average Superbad rip-off movie with Dawn of the Dead and there you go: copy, add, paste, the new Hollywood method for making money.Don't waste 10 dollars on Zombieland, wait till you can rent it. In the meantime, if you want to see Zombies and laugh, gather some of your buddies and watch Zombi 3.On a scale of A to Z I give this movie an M</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just might be one of the biggest "end of population" movie fans on Earth. Any movie dealing with an apocalypse...comedy, horror, thriller, etc...automatically starts out with "6" on my IMDb voting list. You can only go up from there. I love the genre so much, I even gave "The Postman" a "9"! To get stuck at a "6" means it was just too flawed. The movie which Zombieland is most compared to, Shaun of the Dead, I gave a "9" vote.First of all, I understand you need to suspend reality before you even step in the theater when you watch a zombie movie. But the stupidity of some of the actions was beyond retarded. I'll explain more later.Zombieland has it's moments. It looked great on the big-screen...you could tell a lot of time went into the appearance. The deaths were done very well (especially a scene where a lady is thrown from her car and her face bounces and drags along the pavement, leaving a stream of blood). Woody Harrelson was great as usual, but the big kudos goes to supporting actress Emma Stone, who was excellent. This changes all the time, but after seeing 'Zombieland', I now want to "plow" Emma Stone more than any other girl on the planet! She's hotter than a Mexican chili pepper in the middle of July! If I had the option of marrying her before I ever met her, my answer would be a resounding "Yes!"...and I'm not the marrying type to say the least! :)But, the bad clearly out-weighs the good. The lead actor, Jessie Eisenberg, was annoying at best and downright terrible at worst. He's no Marlon Brando, that's for sure. I can't recall one thing he said or did that I laughed at. For a comedy, to get zero laughs out of the main actor is a joke in itself. Then there was a completely shameless sub-plot revolving around Woody Harrelson's love for a Hostess product, Twinkies. (They might as well have just stopped the movie halfway through and went to a Hostess commercial). At one point, Woody and Jessie find a Hostess truck crashed into a ravine. Upon opening it, one would think there would be BOXES of Sno-balls or Twinkies there...but what's there? Individually wrapped Sno-balls fall out of the truck like it was packed to the roof with them! Um, I think even a 13-year-old kid knows food items aren't shipped individually like that. Product placement needs to be done a bit more subtle to be effective, otherwise it just blatantly looks like a money-grab, which it was. Uggghhh.Perhaps the biggest laugh and the biggest disappointment came during the same segment. Bill Murray's cameo. I won't re-hash the laugh, but the scene began with something beyond implausible. Murray, as a joke I guess, decides to -- not once, but twice -- "surprise" the pairs of armed guests by pretending to be a zombie. Perhaps the #1 thing I wouldn't do during a zombie attack is surprise somebody who's carrying a machine gun! And even after he surprised the first pair of people and barely escaped with his life, all 3 of them had no problem with Murray pulling the same joke on the second pair of armed people. Not surprisingly, Murray gets shot. Even Stevie Wonder could tell that was coming. Perhaps the 2nd biggest thing I wouldn't do, knowing the zombies were attracted to lights and sounds, is turn on the power at an amusement park right at dusk! How unbelievably corny. Also, in some scenes, the zombies are "28 Days Later" style FAST and ferocious. In other scenes, you could be crippled and still get away with relative ease. Plus, how was electricity even available after 2 months of no people running the power plant?! There are many things like that which you just shake your head at. Gas is never mentioned. All cars have the keys in them already. Seat-belts somehow stop you from getting even a headache after a high-speed head-on collision, much less a scratch. Twinkies are somehow EXTREMELY hard to find. Grocery stores look pristine, like they are ready to go, all powered-up and everything. People con you out of your car and guns, twice, even though cars and guns are easy to come by. Be prepared to roll your eyes a couple dozen times.Finally, I simply can't recommend this movie. I love the genre, but this one was just too goofy. The love scenes were fake and implausible. I would have to think Emma Stone would be more attracted to Harrelson over the complete and utter dork they made Einsberg out to be. And Harrelson attempting to cry and bring some drama to the movie was awful and out of place. It's a comedy about zombies, people -- not all movies need the love interest and drama! Big mistake to try to cram those two things in.I wanted to like the movie, I love the genre...but I just can't recommend it.Thanks for reading! JD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't have any expectations, and it failed to meet that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the good reviews and the bad. Then I watched the movie and, frankly, just found myself asking why I decided to do so. There was absolutely nothing in this movie that redeemed it. I'm almost furious at the review that pops up at the bottom of the IMDb page when you view Zombieland's stats. The plot was predictable. The characters were one dimensional (although they tried to add something with little asides that were nothing short of cliché). I never really felt like there was any conflict in the entire movie. Bill Murry's cameo was a little awkward. I'm not really sure what they were thinking putting that in there...but then what were they thinking green-lighting this film? The main character really seems like a replacement for Micheal Cera, whom I'm not a big fan of either. Why is this "whiny bitch boy" character so prevalent in movies these days? Something I can't understand and I'm even a generation-X-er. I don't want to pay for a movie to hear some guy my age whine, bitch, and moan. I can just go outside my Hollywood apartment and hear that for free.Bottomline: waste of time, waste of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weak appeal to Popularity and a weak film (contains spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I love zombies. I grew up watching Romero films with their brilliant social satire and I will readily admit to constructing a Logan Frankenstein lab in my basement, where I study chemistry and biology with the dreamy delusions of infecting the populous with a zombie plague. That being said (prompted by its undeserved popularity and praise) I must also objectively say that Zombieland is a piece of adolescent garbage.The movie opens to the sweet, sweet voice of Jesse Eisenberg. Ahh, to be blessed with such an instrument of masculine authority... He plays a nerdy character named Columbus (and rightfully so, as Eisenberg is often typecast in such a role and is highly believable to boot). So I sat cringing, waiting for him to stop talking... he doesn't. He literally talks the entire movie, narrating events which require no narration and offering his opinion while you're really just imagining holding his head under water. It's like watching a movie while sitting in a rusty chair that creaks with a high pitched squeal every few seconds as you adjust in your seat, ruining your ability to focus until as far as you're concerned the only thing that exists in this world is that horrible sound. That would be slightly more pleasing than the voice of Jesse Eisenberg.Initially, Columbus lays down his rules for individual survival, and why he is so effective at it, in a post-apocalyptic, zombie cityscape. There may have been minor laughs during this, certainly not while he was talking as I was imagining what my mouth would feel like on the barrel of a shotgun. The story jumps around spastically and is unbelievable. I'm willing to forgive this because, in fairness, it isn't aiming to tell a coherent story but rather indulge in the charm of its own scenes.The lead character breaks his own rules and eventually runs into Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). With this balance the film aims to offset the effeminate, nasally lead character. At one point it seems like it's working but the narration keeps interjecting.Tallahassee embodies what the movie is, what it hopes to be, and what it actually is- macho, coolly stylized and charming, but ultimately insulting and dim. In nearly all advertisements he is the selling point, playing a satirical Snake Plissken-esque character. On paper and in short blurbs this is funny and sounds like it could work well. What is most disappointing is how much of an intended, and obviously contrived, selling point he is. This is further evidenced by the character's manufactured (and poorly thought out) catch phrase "time to nut up or shut up," as it is repeated with patronizing disregard for your intelligence.The next two characters introduced are Wichita and Little Rock, two sisters who outwit the leading males and steal their vehicle. For brief minutes it appears that the movie will almost take a progressive stance in the way it portrays its females. This seemingly progressive standpoint is only surface deep and should be understood for the superficial insult that it is. To understand the movie's actual view of females, simply reference the plot points and what they are literally saying. First, the women take advantage of the men because they are conniving and clever with no moral compass. Of course they are overthrown by the men, as they are physically inferior, but become attached to them anyway. They ultimately make a profoundly stupid judgment call, in a city of zombies... by lighting up an entire amusement park, thereby attracting all the zombies. Of course someone needs to come and save them! Despite being dimwitted, the males are needed to rescue the females (from themselves no less) and are thereby rewarded with bountiful, female loyalty. This is the worst kind of female progression- the patronizing, phallocentric and misogynistic kind.Parts of the comedy are okay. There are funny moments that are so unmemorable that I've already forgotten them. I'm simply trusting my faulty recollection that they exist at all (that could be the Stockholm syndrome talking). And I also have no problem with the Bill Murray scene as it's likable and fun. Unfortunately, Bill Murray alone is not enough for this film's salvation.This movie is an appeal to the people. The creators know that if they include enough popular elements and mimic the sensibilities of the target audience, the majority of that audience will eat it up. Someone walking away with a haphazard "oh that was cool and funny as hell" mindset as already dangerously and unknowingly approved of the set of embellished and insulting values that go along with it. I've probably said "patronizing" more than once, it's because that's simply the case. If you didn't feel that way, you may very well be this movie's target audience and the new era of zombie fan boy-- a dim witted, fifteen-year-old male with a short attention span, who will embrace any negative views, advertisements and pop culture garbage that are jammed down his throat, so as long as it's accompanied by trendy humor-- like sugar to help the medicine to go down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie-busters! (sponsored by Twinkies).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a plot poorly xeroxed from any number of doomsday road movies, this Kleenex-thin 'Horror-Comedy' is exactly the sort of thing you get when a coven of zom-bot movie-execs 'Knowingly' get down with the kids by trying to assemble and programme a 'Shaun of the Dead' imposter and impose it upon an undeserving public. A vaguely explained zombie plague brings about the end of the world as we know it, leading a nerdy virgin and a 'lovable' redneck (played by Jesse Eisenberg &amp; Woody Harrelson) to join forces with two joyriding sisters (played by no one in particular) and embark on a laugh-free road trip to Nowheresville.Along the way, we're subjected to logic-free plot developments, flogged-to-death pop-up survival points, insomnia-inducing romantic interludes and some sporadic, incidental zombie-action to remind you that you're watching 'Zombieland' and not a dumbed-down 'National Lampoons Vacation' remake.Bill Murray drops by at the half-time whistle to say "Hello, I'm Bill Murray! - you might know me from such comedy classics as 'Ghostbusters' - here's a clip from that movie!" before swiftly doing an exit to (no doubt) try and save what's left of his reputation and integrity. On this evidence Bill, probably not a lot.I'd like to pay Kudos to the author of the review on this site who rightly pointed out that this painfully unfunny cameo could possibly be the first time an actor has been used on screen as a piece of product placement. Just when you thought the Hollywood studios had sunk as low as they could possibly go re this practice, they find new depths to plummet to by giving you a backhander with a stunt as shameless as this one. It makes Harrelson's tediously elongated "I must have my 'H*stess' Twinkie!" 'gag' look quaint and agreeable by comparison.'Zombieland' has around 20 minutes of (just about) passable material in it's stretched-to-breaking-point running time. The rest is all filler that implodes the moment it comes under any kind of scrutiny and will have you scratching your noggin as to how something as poorly thought out as this one is gets green-lighted into existence.If you wanna see this kind of thing done properly, then try and get your hands on a copy of 1984's 'Night of the Comet' (a small gem) and leave this piece of under baked gunge on the shelf marked 'DVNL' (Digital Video Naval Lint).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to join the small chorus of detractors of this film. The opening was very promising, but there was little gore and few laughs afterward. Based on the previews, I expected a little more emphasis on the zombie-kill-of-the-week theme, but what you saw in the previews was pretty much what you got (and how does one actually kill a zombie anyway?). Obviously one has to suspend disbelief for these types of movies, but they can be done in a logical sense to some degree, and this one simply defies all logic. How does one run an amusement park ride and ride it at the same time - and why would you even get on a ride when being chased by zombies? By the time the final confrontation occurred in the amusement park, I had actually dozed off. Too much time spent on character-development, and not enough zombie confrontation. My 14-year-old son also commented that the movie was boring. I fully expected to love this movie, so perhaps that was my problem. Maybe if I had been dragged to it, it would have exceeded my expectations. As it stands, I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

Their behavior is completely random: they steel cars when there are plenty of cars around, waste ammo for unknown reason and generally behave like they were 6 years old. This what Bill Murray presented was incredibly stupid: he tried to pretend to be a zombie in eyes of an armed man fur completely no reason. What is the most crazy is that one of the characters is traveling America looking for some kind of candy., two girls are going through half of continent to visit some adventure park and when they got there of course they have to ask for attention of all zombies around. I cannot understand how bunch or total idiots like this could be last survivals of zombie infested continent. Moreover this movie is not funny at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Right from the start, Zombieland demonstrates that it will be nothing more than a momentary pop-culture fad. The seemingly stylized effects and flaccidly aimed creativity bring nothing but disappointments considering well-marketed movies generally follow the trend of high public interest. Zombieland opens with an unmistakable predisposition to waste. Poor casting, less-than stellar visuals, repetitive cinematography and an absolutely awful plot line shelve Zombieland beside films sent to the dreaded "bargain-bin". Footage past the point of unnecessary, distasteful scenes along with poor dialogue and strewn organization plague the film through and through ranging from an idiotic Bill Murray appearance to the unmotivated demolition and raids of retail and grocery stores by the main characters.Even the zombie appearances themselves render as far below mediocre. Traditional zombie cinema has always been adored by a certain collection of individuals (including myself- strongly) seeking the visual entertainment of often flesh-eating, undead beings that terrorize, destroy, and massacre for no objective reason. Films like 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, Pet Sematary, and other cult classics paved the way for zombie-culture?only to have ZombieLAND, which braces us for an epically memorable production and cherry-on-top pleasure, lead us to the frustrating conclusion that yet another genre of cinema has been dragged down by high-budgeting money matters and poor execution. The plot being the main character (Eisenberg) running into a series of jaded Zombielanders (Harrelson, Stone, Breslin) and forming an alliance, following Stone and Breslin running away to a hyped amusement park and being saved by Eisenhower and Harrleson, only to lead to Eisenhower falling in love with Stone, getting kissed for the first time, and driving off with a narrative before credits roll.The finale itself is by far the most depressing moment of the experience leaving the audience with a "Wait, it's over? What?....." reaction- one that should never be bestowed upon viewers. My only credit to Zombieland is that I cannot possibly idealize a greater time for a film like this to be released. Simplicity and toilet humor are at an all-time high and present day society follows aimlessly along. However, Zombieland is intentionally geared towards an audience consisting of both children and adults to enjoy with limited "smart humor" and small motifs (Ex: Twinkies for kids) throughout the film, thus over-inflating its popularity. As far as an enjoyable view, it satisfies the untrained eye. But to anyone that takes film seriously and considers both artistry and substance to be necessary components, Zombieland falls short- even dismally from its quality as a composition being labeled even "alright".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rule 25: don't make the zombies run, especially in a zombie comedy. They're just not as much fun that way.There are only a handful of gags, and they induce mild chuckling, the rest is predictable ha-ha silly/funny-zombie fare. The single most idiotic aspect of ZL is the idea that two teeny-boppers would: a) con the few survivors they meet in the wasteland that is Zombieworld, instead of teaming up with them, and b) that they would actually have the brains to do it.WHY exactly would they or any other half-way intelligent survivor want to con anyone? The stores are open 0-24, absolutely everything is for free, so what possible reason would there be to steal from the only few people who stayed alive? On one hand the two moronic teens are described/defined as "smart, cunning girls", but what intelligent person would try to make human enemies what with the zombie threat that is all around them... Besides, I don't see how they could have survived more than a minute when one considers the poor judgment they display when they decide that it's a great idea to start up the amusement park... So they're idiot savants or what? Autistic?Rule 356: don't make the characters behave dumber than the zombies; it's neither logical nor funny.Comedy works only when there is a trace, a hint of realism behind it. The idea that a pair of sisters would have the need to STEAL from the handful of remaining survivors - when they can take anything they want whenever they need it - is too asinine even for a dumb zombie comedy. If the makers of this forgettable tripe wanted unapologetic stupidity they should have gone all-out, i.e. "Police Academy" style. If you're going to shove into our faces cretinous characters and write infantile plot-twists, you might as well go all the way, and make money off the low-brow viewers who number in their tens of millions these days...They tried to justify the poor logic of the girls' actions by portraying them as "hard-to-trust kids". What flimsy argumentation. What is this, Oprah, suddenly? "I've got trust issues, ya know..." As I said, why even try to explain these characters' motives - as was done on several occasions (as if I could be made to care about these cardboard characters) - when you can go for all-out Pauly Shore "hilarity". If you're gonna be an imbecile you might as well be gung-ho about it and do a zero-IQ farce.Rule 10,380: feature more zombies in a zombie film. But whatever little the movie had going for it was lost in the Bill Murray segment. The idea of having the four idiots go to a movie star's mansion was a good one, but it was utterly ruined with another idiotic/unfunny - because unrealistic - plot-twist: Bill wants to play a prank on the nerd, and VERY predictably gets killed. Woody and Stone (the latter who is supposed to be "intelligent", remember) fail to realize that he will probably get shot at by Eisenberg/Cera. (Stupid and predictable: a safe bet to not make me laugh.) The movie hits its absolute low point - and I mean minus 273 Celsius - when Bill talks with a huge open chest wound as if he were in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Or are we suddenly in a Python sketch? Yet, only minutes later, what follows this dull, surreal scene is an actual romantic(!)/semi-serious moment between Stone and nerd-boy. Who the hell cares! Zero thought has been put into the writing of this crap, and it shows, every five minutes. Pity, because the director's skills aren't negligible and the cast is good. Harelson is great, but even he cannot squeeze out more than a few drops from this drained orange. Emma is gorgeous, so that helps a bit too. Yet again it's the script that is Hollywood's undoing.This is the ideal movie for people who have never seen a zombie film, let alone a zombie comedy. In their wide-eyed inexperience, they probably gape at this, their jaws dropping all the way to their drool-stained smelly popcorn, thinking "wow!". To them - to quote Bill Murray from "Groundhog's Day" - I say: "Morons!... Your bus is leaving!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly overrated tosh for the Facebook generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really can't understand why people like this film. I enjoy zombie movies like Shaun, Dawn, and even Braindead. I love comedies like John Landis &amp; John Hughes movies, Superbad etc.Zombieland was just another annoying, self-consciously quirky addition to the recent glut of movies that seem to be written by, produced by, and made for the washed out, tasteless and cultureless facebook crowd. People like it because they think they should.The narration and self-conscious humour was excruciatingly flat and self-conscious - at times I found myself yearning to see Fight Club again just to prove to myself that good writing does exist. The zombies were uttlerly boring, the story totally tedious (I'm not just saying that, although there were a few inspired moments the story was just completely boring and really had no point). I found the weak attempts to use the zombies as metaphors for people totally stupid as well. The final line was "if you don't have good friends, well you might as well be a zombie". More fitting, perhaps, would have been "if you enjoy this movie, you might as well be a zombie".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how to have a kick-ass time and laugh your brains out with people... and zombies too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inevitably, Zombieland will be (and already has been) compared to Shaun of the Dead, the other most notable "Zom-Com" of this past decade (or in that case 'Rom-Zom' due to it being a romantic comedy with zombies). This goes without noting other notable zombie-related comedies like Fido or involving animals like Black Sheep. But if one has to compare apples and oranges growing on practically the same field, here's the difference: 1) as much as I love Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg's work (specifically Hot Fuzz and Spaced), SOTD started to not be quite as effective, even as it was being admirably tried out technically, when it switched from a really funny and spot-on comedy and spoof of Romero's film to suddenly taking itself a bit too seriously as a zombie movie. 2) I (almost) hate to say this, but... Zombieland ultimately wins on counts of being so funny- or as the kids say, "f***in' funny as hell, OMG"- that it hurts, and giving us characters to take away with that we care about when, you know, they aren't slaughtering the undead one by one. It's also so bad-ass you can taste the awesome, something rare to find in movies outside of the Road Warrior.It stars Jessie Eisenberg as a guy whom we may have seen him sort of play before, more or less, as the awkward kid who hasn't had sex and spent much of his time playing World of Warcraft and hooked on Mountain Dew when he got attacked by the first zombie he met - a girl from apartment 406 who got bit by a homeless man. What does this last part have to do with the plot? Well, only inasmuch that it gives the first incentive for Eisenberg's character, here named Columbus after the city he's going to originally, to craft a list of things to do when confronted with zombies. For example, seat-belts, or the "double-tap" rule which involves shooting a zombie, and then making sure to shoot once more in the head. He keeps this list and lists it almost like out of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket, and as a not-quite-wuss he fares OK on his own... and then he meets Talahassee (Harrelson, good Lord), a seemingly walking-talking-cursing redneck who misses his puppy Buck and just wants a damn Twinkie - and NOT those Hostess Snowball things.It's after they pair up, and subsequently meet two con women (or rather con-woman and con-girl played by Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) who at first just car-jack Columbus and Talahassee. That is until they start riding a bit together and find they need each other way more than they don't. This might make it sound like a squishy story, perhaps with some room for some ample social commentary like a Romero movie. It doesn't really have that. It's more akin to National Lampoon's Vacation, complete with a "quest" to reach a theme-park in Los Angeles, and maybe running into some hijinks and surprises along the way. If one of those may happen to be Bill Murray in his mansion where he's in zombie-garb and make-up to "blend-in", then so be it. Holy crap, did I just mention Bill Murray in a zombie movie? Damn straight, and now you know what kind of movie this is.So yes, Zombieland has the things zombie-movie lovers go for first and foremost, which are really effective looking un-dead, some genuine scares (at least the kind that give easily-impressionable girls watching the movie at midnight the screams), and some really solid action. But it's first and foremost a comedy, one that is focused on character and wit and surprise and ingenuity over just satire, and it fires on all cylinders. I don't think I've had this much pure fun at a movie in a while (not counting the kind of a movie-lover like Inglourious Basterds or the "guy" movie comedy of the Hangover), and its all due to newcomer director Ruben Fleischer and his writers not pulling any punches. Since we believe in the world they're in, pretty much, we can buy whatever comedy springs out, sometimes from simple one-liners like the banter while driving in the car (i.e. Hannah Montana, Willie Nelson), or just the sheer insanity of the climactic battle at the theme park where the rides are used to their maximum, including (yes YES!) a Haunted House! From its opening credits sequence that promises as much and gives an impression of its tone like none other this year except Watchmen, to the odd-couple bond between Eisenberg and Harrelson that works so well you can't see it any other way, to that nearly quirky/awesome way that Columbus faces his fear of clowns while re-writing his own rule on heroics, to... almost every scene with a couple of exceptions, no opportunity is wasted, or just taken upon by its makers. It's so sharp and original a take on a subject nearly beaten to death (pun intended) that its success just shows the potential still there: for all of the horrible and cheapo living-dead product out there, one can go back to this or the original Return of the Living Dead and realize something essential. It's about the people, not the zombies, and the people here, and how zombies are 'treated', simply just... rocks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb, predictable and not particularly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't go into this film with particularly high expectations, but I did expect this film to be watchable at the very least due to its current IDMB rating of 7.7 and a metascore rating of 73. Sadly, I've found myself to be disappointed again.The plot is about four survivors of the Zombie Apocalypse who are all strangers that have a common goal of trying to survive the zombie outbreak. We begin with Columbus (Eisenberg) and Tallahasse (Harrelson) whose names are not their real names, but names of the places that they are travelling to - this is due to Tallahasse not wanting to give his name and likewise he doesn't want to know Columbus's name. Their goals are fairly simple; Columbus wants to get to Columbus to see his parents and Tallahasse just wants twinkies. Later Columbus and Tallahasse bump into Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) who are 2 sisters hiding from the zombies in a grocery store. They trick Columbus and Tallahasse into giving them their gun when Little Rock pretends to have been bitten by a zombie which prompts Tallahasse to give Wichita his gun when she says that she will shoot her sister. We learn that the girls are travelling to Pacific Place in LA to go to a fairground that they went to when they were kids. The girls then drive off in Columbus and Tallahasse's car, but the pair catch up with the girls later and this is when the four of them decide to stick together and try to get to their various destinations whilst killing any zombies that they encounter.There were many problems with this film and the biggest problem for me is quite simply that it wasn't funny. I think I laughed maybe once or twice. It is obviously America's answer to Shaun of the Dead, but aside from being nowhere near as funny there also wasn't much chemistry between Eisenberg and Harrelson. That was one of the strengths between Pegg and Frost in both Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. The script also lacked the intelligence of both of those films.The film was also littered with holes in the script and lapses in logic; why did Wichita and Little Rock switch all the power on at the fairground when it was obvious that all the noise and lights would attract all the zombies attention? One zombie is killed when someone pulls a doorbell and a piano falls on them. How original? Stupid? Yes, but I could have forgiven it if it had been funny.Tallahasse and Columbus stumble across a car that happens to have a back seat full of machine guns when their gun has been stolen from them. How convenient? There was also Columbus's character and his rules; at the start of the film he shouts out four different rules which I thought was quite funny, but then when the old rules are repeated throughout the film with the odd new rule thrown in, it quickly grew repetitive and became less and less funny each time I heard it.Zombieland does get a few things right; I quite liked how Wichita and Little Rock were written into the story. The way that they both outsmart Columbus and Tallahasse on two separate occasions was funny to watch. I felt that the character development was also pretty good (considering the genre) and we learn a little bit about all of the characters along the way (particularly Columbus and Tallahasse both of which I ended up feeling some sympathy for towards the end).The biggest sin that this film commits is that it just isn't funny and the script is littered with holes in it (the latter could perhaps be forgiven slightly as films of this nature are generally not meant to be taken seriously). In the end, it just felt like a lame rip off of Shaun of the Dead. Disappointing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I hoped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT I'll make this review very simple and to the point. Zombieland may be a decently funny movie, but it doesn't have too many parts that make me want to rewind and rewatch them because they are THAT funny. To me, it was a one time watch and move on with your life. It was a forgettable movie experience, which is a shame because I wanted it to be so much more than that, since I had heard it was the counter to Shaun of the Dead (which I love to death).All in all, the characters weren't memorable, the story was predictable (love interest comes in and lead gets girl, yada yada), and the humor was awkward and stale. Most of the humor seemed to be directed at our virgin, gamer lead character who is awkward as all hell and even states himself that he has no place being in this zombie apocalypse. However, he has a few rules he lives by, which is a joke they ride the entire movie. To be fair, they're decently funny, but are a bit overdone. Other jokes, like "zombie kill of the week" and anything involving Woody Harrelson killing things is pretty good.Wrapping this up, finally, I've seen the movie three times and have yet to enjoy it any more than the last each time. So this wasn't just a one time view and I'm basing this off of my initial reaction. Another random thing, it took me til the third viewing to realize that Jesse Eisenberg wasn't Michael Cera. He behaves exactly like him, and has the same feminine tone of voice as him. That'll give you an idea of the kind of awkwardness that is in store for you in this movie. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once is good, but a 'Double Tap' is not recommended</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised with the first third of 'Zombieland' when I discovered it's more like a comic buddy road movie than some dumb horror slasher-fest. The introductory 'documentary' sets the comic tone: right off the bat Zombieland announces that it's not politically correct (a "fatty" is unable to outrun a Zombie on an athletic field). Jesse Eisenberg's narration, with all his neat rules on how to survive in Zombieland, adds to the overall humor of the story (the "rules" are illustrated twice?first during the introduction and then later as we follow Jesse's character 'Columbus' as he must personally survive the wrath of the Zombies). Perhaps the rules that garnered the most cinematic mileage were "Double Tap" (it takes two blows to kill a Zombie) and "Fasten Your Seat Belt" (you never know when you have to stop short and have a Zombie fly through your windshield!).Zombieland is set in a post-apocalyptic America where a strain of Mad Cow Disease has turned most people into Zombies. Instead of merely concentrating on the Zombies for most of the picture, the films' scenarists wisely focus on the relationship between Columbus and his redneck buddy, Tallahassee (well-played by Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee's love for Twinkies and his skill in taking out the Zombies with various weapons of choice makes the character interesting. He's nicely contrasted with Columbus, the obsessive-compulsive nerdy college kid, who needs to overcome a clown phobia before he can finally break loose in his interpersonal relationships.Since I like my fantasy pictures to be as plausible as my true-life dramas, I found the flashback scene where Columbus must fend off the young girl he takes in to his apartment as particularly weak. It's not that I minded her sudden transformation into a Zombie, but what happened to all the other college students in Columbus' dorm? Did they all turn into Zombies at the same time the young girl did? And why didn't we see any news reports that people were turning into Zombies? It's as if the transformation from America into Zombieland happened in one night.Once Columbus and Tallahassee meet up with the two young women, "Wichita" and "Little Rock", I felt the story began to lose steam. I didn't really care that the two women were con men and were able to steal our hapless hero's' SUV. And the second scene, where they all agree to a truce and sort of become friends seemed interminably long.Before they get to Hollywood, there's a rather unpleasant scene where Tallahassee (with the others joining him) destroy souvenirs in a Native-American tourist shop. While the knick-knacks were probably made in China, they still looked pretty good to me and even though this was supposed to be a post-apocalyptic landscape where private property was now irrelevant, the destruction of what appeared to be a part of Native-American culture still rubbed me the wrong way.Somehow, the Billy Murray cameo was supposed to be funny and it makes sense that Murray would have survived the Zombie plague in real life. But the ending of the cameo wasn't funny as Columbus mistakenly shoots and kills Murray after he mistakes him for a Zombie.Tallahassee's internal arc seems to be resolved when Columbus does finally realize his buddy has a sensitive side; he discovers that Tallahassee has been been pining away for his young son rather than his dog.The film's denouement seemed quite abrupt. Columbus and Tallahassee must rush to the Pacific Playland Amusement Park to save the two young women who are trapped there. Card carrying members of the NRA should enjoy all the firepower as the two heroes save the women after blasting hordes of Zombies who have come after them. Columbus's internal arc is resolved when he falls in love with Wichita (now revealed to be 'Krista').And that's basically it. The foursome ride off into the sunset with no particular destination in mind. Presumably more encounters with Zombie are in store for them. Will there be a Zombieland II? Frankly, I hope not. There are just so many Zombies one can take!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny - if you've never seen a zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd noticed the high ratings and reviews that ZOMBIELAND was getting, and sat down to watch it expecting something a bit out of the ordinary; what I got instead was a film packed with tired, sub-standard schtick involving the lamest kind of zombie gags put on screen. Hell, even RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART 2, complete with its moonwalking zombie, was funnier than this! The main problem, I'd say, lies in the presence of such irritating characters. Jesse Eisenberg is the nominal hero, but he overdoes the whiny-geeky thing so much that I almost switched off. Why make the main guy so darned irritating? Woody Harrelson, as a redneck zombie killer with a penchant for Twinkies, fares much better, but he isn't enough to save this film from being near unwatchable. The less said about Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin's supposedly 'with it' sisters, the better, leaving this a movie without a single likable character to root for.The plot less story uses all of its decent gags (i.e. the zombie 'rules') in the first ten minutes and for the rest of the running time meanders from one vapid scene to the next. One extended celebrity cameo is cringeworthy, and clearly thrown in in a desperate attempt to pad out the still-short length. By the time we reach the climax, a lunkheaded set-piece in an abandoned amusement park, I was long beyond caring thanks to the poor writing and sheer senselessness of it all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like intelligent zombie movies, with a plot development and some sense of character progression, then I suggest you skip this one.If, on the other hand, you are just looking for a video game style shoot'em up movie, then you may like this one: A completely unscary, splatstick style, violent-pornographic flick... which as far as i understand has many followers (Which is something I don't understand.)The very interesting scenario that is presented in the well done beginning loses strength after the first 10 minutes. Very soon, the movie becomes more and more senseless until it reaches a point where you understand why the whole thing became so uninteresting: It is made for zombies. There are no questions, no thoughts, no character development, no tension, no suspense. The only thing to see is just a lot of shooting, trashing and killing, filmed in a very cool way, and taken to a higher level with loads of bad-ass rock &amp; roll, big trucks and cool names... The whole thing feels just so childish.It is a shame that the director decided to approach the film as a game. It is a zombie movie where zombies are completely meaningless, not even threatening. They are nothing but targets, the perfect excuse to display all brutality, violence and sadism as possible. So, what can I say? Probably some people will like it but this was the complete opposite of the kind of zombie movies I like (28 days later, dawn of the dead, diary of the dead,...). It feels more like the marketing campaign for a "zombieland" video game where you ll get to chose a character to shoot you way through the different movie scenarios. Nothing else.Truly, a disappointment.Matías Vega</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just an average Zombie movie.Wanted so much to "Really" like it, but the movie just came up short. Zombieland is about a kid who's trying to survive in an apocalyptic world, destroyed by zombies. He even creates a list of "Zombie Rules" to follow in order to better survive. The acting was fine, and the direction was above average. The special effects weren't excessive and there was very little A.D.D. crap, which I really liked.What I couldn't get over, were the plot holes and logic problems. The first list, I can just chalk up to character stupidity, which is hard to do; considering the movie is about a logical list of zombie rules one should follow:1) The girls abandoning the two main characters in a Zombie destroyed neighborhood. 2) Unintentionally setting up Bill Murray to be shot. 3) Going to an amusement park and attracting zombies from miles around.The main thing I couldn't get over was how the two girls manage to ride the amusement park rides without an operator on the ground. If it's possible to do that, please somebody chime in, and I'll give Zombieland a couple more stars. All in all, Zombieland is worth watching if you got nothing better to do, but don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to see this on TV just because it was rated so high here on IMDb. Well majority of the voters must be below the age of 19 or it just must have a big fan base. That'd explain its high grade.I must be too old for teen movies as i just usually skip them and find them really dull. Well this was not an exception. It's a road movie with zombies with nothing original to it. It provides a few laughs and that's not enough for a movie. I understand that the movie itself was not supposed to be too serious but it didn't seem to be too funny either. The horror part is quite dull and fast cut which is usual for movies of this type. So not much of comedy, nor horror then what was it supposed to be? I find it quite interesting that how this movie ever got its funding in the first place. But it just seems that anything goes if it keeps generating millions. I can watch any type of a movie and even find cheap b-movies entertaining in some extent but this was not entertaining at all.Many younger viewers may probably like this movie but it's really not a movie for adults either. I'd not show it to my kids or teens either though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one word I would use to describe this movie is BORING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have very high expectation of this movie to begin with. Little did I know I was about to be proved wrong about my expectations.To keep it simple - it was terrible. Much, much worse than I thought it was going to be.If I'm being completely honest, it actually started out quite entertaining. The list of rules on how to deal with zombies, the guy who played World of Warcraft so much he didn't know about the zombie plague, the semi-deranged middle aged man with the four wheel drive designed for ploughing down zombies. At this point I thought I could have been wrong about this movie... But after all that, it just kept getting worse, and more than anything - boring.I found the two female characters (named Wichita and Little Rock), who cross paths with Tallahassee and Columbus (the males) extremely irritating. I think they were supposed to be witty, maybe? Clever? I'm not sure. But I never built up a likeness for them at all. I didn't care about them or what happened to them. Which I actually found quite sad because I found Abigail Breslin amazing in Little Miss Sunshine.After the two males meet the girls, is when the huge amount of nothing begins and hence the boringness sets in. The film is called Zombieland, but there are hardly any zombies throughout the film (until the very end, when the girls need saving from the zombies. But even then, the end 'fight' as you may like to call it, wasn't very epic either) It becomes more about the dysfunctional love connection between Columbus and Wichita rather than what the movie title suggests. You know your average cliché storyline that gets reused time and time again? Zombieland is a prime example of this type of story. Apart from that, I can't think of very much else to say about this film except its just a whole lot of mindless, un-entertaining cinema . I'm not sure how long there is a lack of action, but I'm guessing a good hour. The actors weren't bad either, which probably makes it even more of a disappointment because it had the potential to be better - but with a totally different storyline, so maybe not...This film was just plain rubbish. The fact that I'm 16 and saying this is a pretty big deal, considering the fact that movies like this are supposed to appeal to my age group. I would recommend you pass on this one. Even though it may look enticing, it definitely isn't as good as you would like to think it is.I rated this movie a 2, rather than a 1, for the good beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B-looting: zombie in Hollywood means cool badass</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically what spoils the fun for me in Zombieland is that you get the production values of a big movie while the storyline feels like a B-movie. At best.I guess this means Hollywood just kneels to pick up some low concept and try to pimp it up like a cool badass movie. I blame Tarantino for that trend: B-looting. He went on to forage it when he didn't feel too self-assured he could do more mature stuff than something always on the verge of self-spoofing.Zombieland starts out OK with an angle, an editing rhythm that makes up for the lack of originality (post-apocalyptic zombieland). But soon enough it becomes all too easy for the guys. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) is too much of a caricature of a badass with no brains. With him the movie veers off and there simply remains no prize to keep your eyes on. Boy meets girl? This is so lightly presented that it looks like it was designed for a Disney cartoon.By the time they get to BM's mansion in Hollywood (see, no spoilers here) the story already was going nowhere, with very little to fear from the zombies (hey they always have an arsenal with infinite ammo close at hand and manage to drive between crowded spots). The party at BM's is a weird pause. Or more accurately a poseur's pause. BM's joke is half-funny and they stretch it to the max... to the point they kill the joke and just decide to move on with the trodden carnival finale.Dimwits may like this stuff, but the truth is they guys who committed that were too lazy to come up with an interesting story and just self-satisfied with their ambition for an half-baked cool zombie ride.</fullReview>

Why? WHY? And is so self-satisfied I wanted zombie jaws to clench on the narrator's windpipe.There were some laughs to break up my long sighs of boredom. All delivered by Harrelson, then Murray. Apart from that it's children running wild, and nobody gets hurt.For me comedy-horror is horror laced with comedy. Black jokes, black irony. When Plymouth Rock lands on us.

		<fullReview>The only good thing about this movie is the fact that Bill Murray is in it who is about as funny in this as much as he was funny in Groundhog's day. The movie has a couple good action scenes but it was trying so hard to be funny but the only funny thing in this movie is Bill Murray's cameo. The main characters all suck except for Woody Harrelson. Jessie Eisenberg really sucks as an actor and shouldn't get anymore movie roles. The two girls are just bitches that should of died in the first half of the movie I mean they stole all the main characters weapons and leave them to die in Zombie land. I have no idea why people like this stupid film except to waste their times. Really, if you want to see a great zombie comedy go watch Shaun of the Dead. This movie's only saviors are woody harrelson's performance and Bill Murray's cameo other than that this film really sucks. I give it a 2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double tap.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early twenty-first century, zombies have taken over America. A shy and inexperienced college student in Texas has survived by following his 30 rules. He travels to Ohio to see if his parents are alive. He gets a ride with a zombie killer headed for Florida, and soon they confront a young woman whose sister has been bitten by a zombie and wants to be put out of her misery. The sisters were headed to an LA amusement park they've heard is zombie free. Can the kid from Ohio get to his family.....This is one of hose movies that is trying to be clever for its own good. He first five minutes are pretty funny with all the listing, but when you realise that this will be an intricate part to the plot, and not just some throwaway joke, you start to feel the smugness of the film.It's trying to be a hybrid of Juno and Dawn of the Dead, and tries to outdo Shaun of the Dead, and that's where it fails miserably, SOTD had heart and real characters you could relate to, here we never find out there real names, which distances you from the situation.Murray pops up for a few minutes, but its not as great as everyone states, it just diverts from the blandness of the rest of the movie, hence diminished expectation,math inking the Murray part is extraordinary.Harrelson and Stone are great, the rest of the cast just stand around, and am I the only one getting fed up of Eisenbergs schtick? He's Michael Cera in disguise, or vice versa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Twinkies commercial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall it is worth to watch once, because on the special effect and well done slow motion beats and falls. Shots really hit, and bodies fall hard. Characters are good, Harrelson is excellent as always, whatever he plays.Poens are well known from films we saw, except a few, but 2-3 good laugh not what I expect for a one and a half hour long comedy. Some scenes are expressly boring or deja-vus.The worst what made me completely get far from the experience of seeing a movie is the smell of commercial. Maybe only I don't get it, because I am not American, but I saw a lot of Twinkies and one big BM commercial. Don't misunderstand me, I am really a fan of Mr. M. But I don't understand what is he doing in this movie. What that scene is all about? Is it a commercial for him (he doesn't need it) of a kind of monument? Anyway, the rules the film says are good for our everyday lives to not get zombies, if you know what I mean. But the packing is a half-success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaun of the Dead? says who?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who is it that loved this? The zombies? When they get to BM's house (Bill Murray), I said to my wife "this must be that slow middle part of the film". Yeah, except that most of the film is dumb and slow. At least Shaun of the Dead had some genuinely scary parts and was far more campy, while this is just crap. I'm glad I got it at RedBox for $1. What a waste! I suppose I have to write more since IMDb has a 10-line minimum, as though there are more ways to say how bad this was. Does Abigail Breslin have the best agent in the world or what? She may have been good as an ugly little kid but she continues to get movie parts based on her ability to.....?....what? Act? Be someones pathetic little sister? All the actors are playing a reprise of their other roles in other movies. Is this the same Woody we saw in Natural Born Killers? Whose idea was it to put in the scene with the hookah? Wouldn't he do the movie otherwise? Emma Stone? Is this Housebunny Meets Frankenstein? Will Jesse Eisenberg ever play something besides an awkward horny virginal nebbish? All these characters are parodies of themselves. They are the real zombies in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever been involved in a project at work where everyone knew from the start it would never work out, but no-one had the guts to actually say it out loud and everyone just stood around looking awkward? That's exactly how the acting in this miserable excuse for a horror comedy feels. There never seems to be any conviction, any life in the 4 lead performances. Harrelson in particular is just phoning his part in. He's not what's worst about this movie, though. Neither are the girls, even though they only serve as eye candy. And neither are the zombies, even though they're as lame and nonthreatening as they could possibly be. No, what makes this flick truly unbearable is Jesse Eisenberg. His performance is so wooden and so awkward that he actually makes Keanu Reeves look alive by comparison. As for the plot, there doesn't really seem to be one. Just a bunch of people riding around in a bunch of different vehicles, running into a few mild-mannered zombies every now and then. As a result, everything looks mundane, as if nobody actually seemed to care what the end result would be like. An embarrassment for everyone involved. As for you, the viewer... think carefully, because this movie represents 88 minutes of your life you will never get back. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor man's Jayne Mansfield</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. This is something awful. Not because it's a not so clever Shaun Of The Dead ripoff, not because it lacks originality of any kind, and "inspired" by almost everything I (and probably you) have ever seen from Brain Dead to Fight Club to Shaun Of The Dead, and back again - no. I hate this movie (first) because the level of its "Cult Classic" wannabe-ness. Arn't you fed up with the genre? Shaun was a bit less entertaining than Brain Dead OK, and was pathetic as a cultie (Necro Files 2 anyone?), but that stuff was almost decent. Repo the Genetic Opera was almost entertaining. Well, if you like the Fifth Element opera scene and want to relive those memories with Sarah Brightman. But enough's enough. Jayne Mansfield was the poor man's Marilyn Monroe, but this stuff is the poor man's Jane Mansfield, and I just can't get its overratingness. Anyways, one star is fair, because Bill Murray is a cool dude, the (spoiler?) "zombie kill of the week" is a cool gag, somehow reminds me the "power animal" flick in Fight Club, and hey! I almost forget to mention the best (spoiler) part: you know Leonard Cohen from Shrek, and Watchmen and like TV talent shows. Now in this film you can't find his music, not even Hallelujah! Thank G_d, thank you all! Hallelujah!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was total waste of my time. Overall:The movie tries to be comedy, horror and action at once. As a result, it fails miserably. I become bored in 5 minutes, because of lack of "horror", good jokes or actions.The Good: 0) Nothing. It is totally average, nothing astonishing. There was a pretty solid work on decorations, the acting wasn't awful, but there was nothing to catch eye and make me enjoy the movie. The Bad: 0) Little character development. 1) Extremely unrealistic handgun handling in certain scenes. You can't hit something shooting like that. 2) No "Horror" feeling. There is nothing scary about it. Things just happen, and looks like nobody really cares. 3) Nothing funny. There were some attempts to make a joke, but they all failed. 4) Unrealistic characters. Most personalities are pretty weak. 5) No drama at all. 6) Appearance of certain star for no reason. 7) The story reminds "left 4 dead" video game too much. 8) Zombie makeup wasn't really convincing, although I've seen worse. 9) Weak plot.Bottom line: It is obvious that some good cash was invested, there is some quality (so it doesn't look like trash slasher or something), but this movie just doesn't offer anything interesting. It is really bad that they are already making the sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got through watching this and it was the most worthless waste of time I've ever spent. I remember seeing the commercial on TV when this movie came out. I didn't get suckered in to the theater to see this, but I gave into temptation and rented it on blu ray today and I hate that I did. This is one of those movies that after you see it, you've forgotten about it 5 minutes later. The movie was totally pointless and meaningless, kind of like Ghostbusters except with zombies. The movie starred some Jewish kid that nobody ever heard of, with veterans Bill Murray and Woody Harellson thrown in for posterity's sake (no doubt, just a marketing ploy to sell the movie to an older audience). To make things worse, Netflix never has it available and i went to Blockbuster 3 days in a row before I finally tracked down a copy. I'm almost downright MAD, this movie is so lame. I think if I hadn't spent so much time trying to find a blu-ray rental copy of it, I wouldn't have even watched the whole thing. At least it was only an hour and 22 minutes long, so I didn't really have to suffer THAT long. They should have thrown in a few Mutant Nija Turtles - it wouldn't have made much difference to the quality of the movie. Totally stupid and pointless. If I could give it less than 1 star, I would.</fullReview>

The acting is reasonable considering the lack of passion given to characters.The story is beyond a joke. It is stupid and juvenile and ridiculous and can only be enjoyed by moronic simpletons.major spoiler here) I cannot even warrant this review with a detailed description of why this film is so bad. the only mildly interesting part in the entire film is when bill Murray is shot by mistake. but that is over in under 3 Min's.if you crave a zombie comedy then this is not the one for you.

		<shortDescription>Not Shaun of the Dead. This movie is a ploy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of zombie cinema, I was pretty pumped to check out this film. The trailers for the movie, I thought, were pretty sparse with anything except for zombies getting murdered, which is always a good time.However, about a half hour into the movie, it dawned on me that this movie was basically shamelessly pandering to the hipster generation. Laced with dozens of indie hits, Zombieland's soundtrack seems to be more interested in being considered cool than complimenting the movie. This, coupled with the constant on-screen titles (Rule #1: Cardio, Rule #2: Double Tap, etc.) seem very self-indulgent. These jokes are funny when initially introduced, but lead to groans when you see them for the 20th time. It is almost reminiscent of Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide, but 'stupided down' for people who don't take the dead rising seriously. I understand that it is a comedy, but to compare it to Shaun of the Dead, an homage to George A. Romero's movies that takes care to establish the nature of the dead, and not rely on the notion that everyone watching the movie 'gets' zombies, further gives the movie the feeling that it is cashing in on a recent phenomenon.Woody Harrelson is amusing, but he is almost out of place in the film, especially alongside a 12-year old member of the cast, who has no business being alive amidst the undead apocalypse. There is a pretty clever scene involving Bill Murray, but considering how long you have to wait through the movie before it happens, and how much more there is after the scene, it hardly makes up for the rest of it.*MAJOR SPOILER BELOW*Not one character dies. This is sacrilege in this genre. Further, it doesn't add an ounce of suspense or depth to the film, because you can tell no one will die from the start of the film. The movie has an atmosphere of being a children's movie (beyond the swearing, which, if they had cut it out, this could have been PG).In summary; wait for it on video, watch it once, enjoy it (or don't), and then forget about it. This movie isn't worth cult status - it just wants to cash in on trends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because it was rated that good. I love Zombie Movies, black humor and also L4D. The beginning of this movie is not bad, they found the tracking button in After Effects to implement the "List" of our nerdy hero in the screen, nice. But why do it over and over again? The Script of this "Zom Com" was clearly made under the influence of some mind altering drugs. Or the writer is still going to the Kindergarden. Every Movie should have its inner logic, but here is none. We find guns in a Hummer? Lets waste ammo! We shot Bill Murray? Lets waste ammo! We watch Ghost Busters? We play Ghost Busters and get stoned! We search a shop? We destroy all items! We find other humans? We rob them! And, where are the Zombies? Half Way through the movie we've only seen a couple of fat zombies! Lame.So don't believe the hype. It's not comparable to Shaun of the Dead, but its a Nightmare :-)!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot is recycled, unoriginal, and is a sampler of ever cliché in comedy horror. Events which are supposed to be "shocking twists" are extremely predictable to the seasoned movie goer. The actor playing the main character, seemed like he went to an acting class which focused on how to imitate Michael Cera (superbad). Woody Harrelson is a the only good actor in the film, and the only reason to not stop watching. The older girl, is the an extremely fake character, who apparently is wearing perfect make up, and a cute coordinated outfit in a zombie apocalypse. The surprise cameo will only be funny to a select crowd. Speaking on humor, there are almost no laugh out loud jokes, and only minor "heh" moments. Combat is extremely fake (shotguns have unlimited ammunition, no recoil. I only mention this because if comedy lacks, there needs to be good action, and this misses that train as well. Overall the movie would mostly appeal to teenage males, with a target viewer being a video game player. I am surprised how well this has been received, and I fear this is a new complacent direction cinema is taking. If your a comedy horror fan, go for Shaun of The Dead over this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Execrable Zombie Swill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A captivating opening credit sequence with blasting Metallica and blasting gore deteriorates into the worst zombie movie ever made. I pity the poor editors who had to watch their beautiful introduction followed by 90 minutes of swill, but I feel more pity for myself for having paid a fat $2 to see the movie. Twitchy Jessie Eisenberg (now inexplicably cast in everything, always playing the same nebbish, virginal dweeb) provides an even more twitchy voice-over that makes the combination of Eisenberg's pompous pre-Raphaelite face and boring, self-deprecating personality an unbearable combination. The female characters are twice as malignant as any zombies wasted on screen. I literally prayed for the 12 year old girl to be killed and eaten within the first 15 minutes, securing her repugnant presence a place right up there with Short Round from "Indiana Jones &amp; The Temple Of Doom". Woody Harrelson's hillbilly zombie-killer is an exhalation of straight bottom-burp, with his podunk antics lifted straight out of some cartoon. Meanwhile, the surprise cameo in the movie earns some laughs, but--much like the Metallica in the credits--neither element redeems this wretched flick. The extensive CG gore made me feel even more alienated from the lurching masses of cheering, morbidly obese geeks in black jean shorts attending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THIS is what passes for a good movie nowadays?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a sad comment on moviegoers in general if this piece of junk has done as well as the trade publications claim. I can't think of a single redeeming feature of this film, other than the fact that it had better production values than most indies. It's not that it's offensive. In fact, it's pretty darned bland. It's just a lot of nothing. (I gave it three stars simply for production values.)To start with, all four of the leads are unlikeable. (And Woody "leads" the list.) I never gave a flip what happened to them.Add to that the total lack of originality in the script and shooting. Whole scenes were taken from other films (survival films, zombie films, vampire films, road trip films...take your pick) with predictable results. There's a total absence of originality, quirkiness, or any other aspect that might make this movie memorable.The movie does make a lame attempt to provide some "guidelines" or rules for survival, but they are idiotic at best. Furthermore, the lead characters all commit egregious errors time and time again, placing themselves in those wacky comedic situations as their lives are once again endangered. ("Hey, dude, you were surprised once before. Don't you think you ought to be careful this time and look behind the hay bales?") Finally, I felt so sorry for Bill Murray. I really do hope that he got a great paycheck and that he can afford milk for the rest of the year.Oh, yeah...the CGI is about average for most video games. Are we EVER going to get back to practical FX in movies?Watching this movie lowered my opinion of many of my fellow moviegoers yet again. A lot of people in the theater (which means about 10 out of all 25 people) were laughing at the stale jokes and puns like they had never heard them before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An average comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been noticing a pattern in the most recent comedy movies. They all seem to suck real bad, yet, for some odd reason, they get reviewed fairly well, whereas actual movies that require some thought (just a little bit) get bad reviews. This trend is the reason film makers and studio executives are getting away (with millions of dollars) with putting out such crap.As for this, I have to say, this is nothing as spectacular as the IMDb ratings and reviews elsewhere indicate. This is just an average comedy movie (with quite a few clichés) based in a zombie infested environment. The only character I even slightly enjoyed was Woody Harrelson's character. The guy provided some laughs (and no, not because of the fail search storyline). See, it's not like I went in expecting to some dark humour masterpiece, in fact, I expected this to be "bust your balls" straight up comedy. By the end of the movie, I wasn't even sure it was a comedy. There was barely anything funny about the movie, and most of the time, it seemed pretty serious (of course, followed by a dumb "comic" twist). Really, even cheesy 80s action movie one liners were funnier than this stuff. If dumb humour was really what was to be expected from this movie, why was there no moment where I was rolling with laughter? In fact, I don't know anybody who was. How this movie qualifies for the IMDb Top 250, I have no idea because there are at least 251 movies greater than this that deserve that accolade. The beginning looked quite promising, and I expected the whole movie to be of the same standard. Geez, I mean, it's almost like they fired the writers from the first half of the movie and employed new ones.Lastly, let me say, I am in no way a rigid movie goer. I enjoy my dumb popcorn flicks as much as I enjoy my "masterpiece" movies. I've watched a couple of movies that rate on IMDb below even 3 and mildly enjoyed them. I don't demand my movies to be of the highest caliber at all times. If not making a movie of a high caliber, least they can do is not insult my intelligence. I mean, there have been movies that have utilised clichés in a funnier way. The "romance" in the movie had me throwing up inside my mouth. Is that the best they can do 50 - 60 years after the art of motion picture was perfected? I've given this movie a 5/10. No doubt there were some funny parts, but just a word of warning to everybody who looks at ratings before watching a movie, do not be fooled by this movie's given rating. It's okay, not a comic masterpiece as the ratings and reviews indicate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad movie, bad taste, all is bad, bad, bad. The "humor" is so grotesque, so inhumane, so over the top that in and of itself it is laughable that this flick is filed as "Comedy." Obviously big budget, the cinematography meets professional standards, but the content of the flick defeats any achievement in its movie-making quality per se.Harrelson, a good actor, delivers a good performance. But how good of a performance can it be if the whole film is so trashy? Zombies eating flesh and running maniacally in traffic, stores and climbing up the superman ride of Magic Mountain? Who pays to watch such movies in the first place? Obvisouly the idea of the producers was to appeal to the younger, undeveloped audience, deprived of parental control, whose peak of excitement is gory jokes and bathroom humor.One of the great lines is: "Can't we drive for four hours like normal Americans!" What is a normal American, if not someone who would not be watching a terrifying flick like this? O, I almost forgot: there is romance. The romantic exchange between the main character and one of the teen females is entirely pathetic at the backdrop of the rest of the zombification galore.There is nothing good, no redeeming value in "Zombieland." Made in Zombieland, most likely by zombies, for a zombified audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZombieCrap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Spoiler Alert** Over the past few years as Gen-X and Gen-Y tastes have begun to skew ratings on sites like RottenTomatoes and all other film review sites and I occasionally get suckered into going to see a film like Zombieland.I think some snarky GenXers spent about 5 minutes over their soy lattes coming up with the concept for this film and then had a 5th grade class spend one period writing the script. It was a piece of utter trash with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. When there is the wonderful Shaun of the Dead out there, why would anyone even try to spoof the genre when it was done so expertly already.Everything that was terrific about Shawn of the Dead is missing from Zombieland. Every single gag in Zombieland has been done before, done better, and to much better effect. The pop-up list was funny once, or twice - but was tedious and stupid as it went on and on throughout the film. The geeky kid as the lead has zero presence and is a blank as an actor. Woody Harrelson merely reprised his role from that bad Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers. The product-placement Hostess Twinkie thing was pathetic. The female actresses were pretty terrible, but with a script like that what chance did they have? The gore of the Zombies wasn't even well done, and the filmmakers couldn't seem to decide between slow dumb zombies and fast mean cunning Zombies (the former is always better and scarier).What a nothing of film. It wasn't worth even a dollar as a rental. Garbage. And a true testament to how far standards of taste have fallen as Gen-X and Gen-Y vacuousness pervades the zeitgeist of the art world.Lastly, the Bill Murray cameo was an utter waste. By showing the audience the Warhol painting of Murray prior to seeing him they TOOK AWAY HIS INTRODUCTION. Morons! These filmmakers obviously know nothing about storytelling. If there had been cameo after cameo or the Bill Murray subplot had been more of a central focus of the story this film would have had a chance, but he was just like the creamy filling in a Twinkie - totally without nutrient value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious Dialogue, Fun Visuals and Some Breakout Performances, It's One Of My Favourite Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Batman v Superman I wanted to go back and watch a movie where I was impressed with Jesse Eisenberg. Zombieland is one of my favourites, so it was an easy choice. They continue to talk about a Zombieland sequel today even though it's been years since the original has been released. I'd like to think that's how big of an impact it made (it was a box office success but it didn't go over like gangbusters). It's probably too late for a sequel with the entire cast moving on and becoming industry headliners, but it's okay though because we'll always have this one.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Our main character is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), since no one uses their real names in Zombieland. We get a brief window into the world as it is now, completely invaded by zombies. Columbus takes us through some of his rules on how he survived like #1 cardio, #2 double tap, #3 beware of bathrooms and #4 seat belts. We then join him in present day in Garland, Texas and he makes his escape utilizing those same rules (he's far from a zombie killing bad-ass though, he mostly succeeds through discipline and some luck). He reveals that he's trying to get back to Ohio to see his family. The odds aren't in his favour though, most of the world has been wiped out. He reveals that he's always been a loner but he actually misses seeing people around. Someone then rolls up in a Cadillac Escalade with a large number 3 painted on the side. The draw their guns on each other but Columbus holds out his thumb and Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) offers him a ride. They clearly don't gel personality wise with Tallahassee being more of an unhinged zombie killing machine and Columbus is a nervous and cautious kind of guy. But they decide to stick together at least for the time being.Most zombie related programming is horror related. Zombieland is less a horror film and more of a dark action comedy. One of the things that makes it so memorable is that it's so funny. It was written by the co-writers of Deadpool (another excellent dark action comedy) and although the actors/actresses bring so much to the movie, one of the biggest stars is the actual script itself. We see the movie through Columbus' eyes as he travels around with 3 bad-ass zombie killers and his interpretation of the events in the movie is so ridiculous by contrast, it's hilarious. Between the action and the comedy, the movie rarely slows down if at all and with a short run time, it doesn't overstay it's welcome either. There's nothing wrong with a movie being long if it has enough material but there's something to be said for accomplishing what you want to get done and leaving before people get tired of it.Looking at the 4 main characters of the cast, you'll easily recognize them as almost all of them populate the A list. At this time Jesse and Emma were both up and coming talents and this movie helped cement them. Jesse really stepped out of Michael Cera's shadow with a great comedic performance and Emma showed that how multi-talented she can be. She was really funny in Zombieland and she hit the more serious notes as well. This was a good movie for Abigail Breslin to do. It helped her transition out of being a child star and while she was still a kid in this film, she more than held her own. Lastly, Woody was already famous so while I can't credit his success to this movie, this is easily the funniest I've ever seen him be in a movie. In an era of the Walking Dead where you have completely serious zombie killers, his character was more laid back and enjoyed channelling his internal pain into brutally killing the undead. Woody makes his character somebody you want to follow and it's always fun to see how he's going to deal with the zombies in the next scene (whether he's swinging a banjo or using hedge clippers).One of the really unique things this movie brings is that it was made relatively cheap but it's got some really cool visual tricks. Things like the actually lettering for Columbus' rules popping up and interacting with the environment like the letters moving when limber up appears. It's not completely new but they use it so well. The action is hard and brutal, they also find ways to get some interesting shots (there's lots of slow motion and they work the comedy into the action pretty organically). The zombies look disgusting (in a good way) and they found a way to put a different spin on them. It's not on the level of a movie that had 100s of millions in its budget but it's still well done and it could easily pass for having twice the budget it did.I've watched this movie many times over and it is still super entertaining every time I put it on. It wouldn't be in my top 10 all time but it wouldn't be far outside it. It delivers on all fronts and it's like I said in the opening, if we ultimately don't get the sequel that's okay, I'll enjoy the perfectly wrapped gift this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedy well worth a couple viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's Living Dead trilogy has left quite an impact on today's culture. Although the actual phenomena has never been a fact, the idea that an outbreak of whatever causes this possible danger could happen, is reason enough to be prepared (just in case). Of course, the concept sounds preposterous but anything is possible nowadays. Technology and science are our greatest weapons no matter how much they excel our lives. With that, multiple zombie genre films have been created decade after decade portraying zombies in new and outrageous ways. However, has anyone every jotted down the key things in every film that tends to get zombies their meal of the day? Well unless you watched them all, the best way would probably be seeing this movie here. Remember that Nickelodeon TV Show Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide (2004?2007), which gave all the tips and sparknote clues on how to survive middle to highschool? Well this is basically the same thing in feature length movie form instead with zombies.Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)) as their first theatrical screenplay and headed by Ruben Fleischer in his first directorial debut, this collaborative trio managed to put together a solid horror comedy that is fun in a number of ways. The story follows a group of random individuals living among a planet of unlimited zombies, looking to get to their own specific destination. Audiences are first introduced to Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a scrawny geek who has trouble socializing with people and hasn't had one girlfriend. Along his travels he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a funky human swiss-army knife that has a hankering for Twinkies. Then comes Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), a pair of scam-artists that are convincingly good at their craft. The best thing about Reese and Wernick's writing is that majority of the story focuses around the characters and that's important when it comes to development and there's plenty of it too.The second best point made are the guidelines Columbus refers to the audience about key thoughts one should have in mind if being chased by zombies. If this were real, this would probably be the briefing video on how to pull through. The characters themselves do have personalities of their own but the most memorable character of the bunch was Tallahassee. Harrelson looked like he was having a blast in his role and definitely took advantage of every moment that required some amount spontaneity. The only part of the writing that doesn't work in this film's favor is the comedy. It is funny a number of times but only because of how stupid goofy it gets. By this, it means that the world these characters live in don't take the situation very seriously. For example, "Zombie Kill of the Week",...who's even keeping tabs? It's funny but ridiculously nonsensical. One of the rules mentioned is to "Enjoy the little things", which is fine for some cases but it does seem a little overblown if people are having contests on the best kill on a weekly basis.Other than that however, the special/practical effects do look convincing for the budget as well as the gore. There's plenty of blood, gunshots, wisecracks and zombies. Perhaps the only other thing that some gore hounds may not like is that there are not enough victims in the movie. Yes, there are people who die in the movie but a lot of the story revolves around the main characters mentioned prior. This may leave some viewers who enjoy the gore a little starved of their usual intake. The poster is also a little deceiving because nobody uses a chainsaw in this movie. But there are things that make up for that (kind of). It's not abundant but there are a couple of special cast appearances throughout the movie. There's one of Amber Heard as one of Columbus' neighbors and an extended cameo of Bill Murray playing himself. It's interesting though to hear Murray reference a few of his own works just to break the fourth wall.The last two components to look at are the cinematography and music. Michael Bonvillain was the director of photography for this project. Although there are areas that look like a lot of other zombie films, Bonvillain does get some good shots of landscape to give the setting some scope. Bonvillain has proved his talent before in Tom Berenger's Sniper 3 (2004). Instead of bright colors here, he has a lot of gray colors to emphasize the lack of life, which also helps the colorful characters stand out. As for music, rock enthusiast David Sardy composed the film score. Prior to this, Sardy only had composed music for 21 (2008) but would later do bigger projects like Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2012). All in which Sardy uses a familiar sound of hard rock guitars to indicate his unique score signature. Here is no different; Sardy mixes aggressive guitar chords with organic orchestra compositions to create one interesting score. At times it sounds like it belongs to the horror genre with string stings, other times it's comedy with banjo like cues and other times drama using lengthy chord progressions. It's a weird score for a weird movie. Case in point. Other than not having enough victims on screen and some absurdly dumb humor (at times), this horror comedy is a fun watch and not just for one time. The characters are written with distinguished funny personalities, the violence is abundant, the camera-work is competent and the film score is wildly experimental but surprisingly appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over Rated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched it today on the insistence of many other zombie film fans that stated it was somehow 'one of the best, if not the best zombie film' and definitely feel cheated during and after watching. Which can only lead me to say, that it's highly overrated.It fell very flat to me and I didn't find it amusing at all, nor special in any way. Not to say it's bad, it's perfectly acceptable - but I certainly didn't think it was worthy of this 'cult classic' label that people give it, and the high rating it has here on IMDb.com and all the talk it gets about it.Honestly, I have no idea why people recommend it the way they do. I get that humor and what people find entertaining is subjective - but I just don't understand the appeal here.There are definitely better zombie genre films, with better stories, and better characters, out there to enjoy compared to this one.SPOILER: The whole premise of going to a theme park full of lights and noise (that all conveniently worked on whatever power grid it had, without an operator - seriously how the heck would they get on and off the rides?) was too ridiculous for me to get behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland minus the Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never disliked a zombie movie. They have either always made me laugh or made me thoroughly entertained. Zombieland has done neither of those things. I have to be honest, I didn't really like it. It was sloppy, a little boring, poor characters, and Jessie Eisenberg. I heard this movie was awesome and was a combination of Superbad and Shaun of the Dead. They have both been reviewed and were amazing. To say this movie is like those two combined, that is a bold statement, but one I looked forward to. Without further ado, here we go.It isn't a secret. I don't like Michael Cera but he is good in almost every role. Wait, he isn't in this movie? It's Jessie Eisenberg? Well, he is a wannabe Michael Cera so I don't see a difference. This guy is a photo copy of Michael Cera but not nearly as good. I never thought I would say this but I wanted Michael Cera in this movie. He would have been so much better. The awkwardness and his ugliness would have fit so much better than Eisenberg's mug ruining this movie. Throughout the movie all I could think about was Michael Cera and that's never a good thing. It made me sick I almost had to turn the movie off. This movie is called Zombieland and there are little to no zombies. The opening scene is great as it introduces how Zombieland came to be out of the gate it was so far so good. I really liked how there were rules and they popped up on screen all the time. That was really all I liked about the movie. None of the characters had real names and that is cool but the reasoning was dumb. There are very few people left and they don't want to give away their real identity. Why? What's the point? Why should I care? Hearing the names Columbia and Tallahassee wasn't bad but it was unnecessary and not that funny. Clever, but not funny. Bill F'n Murray is in this movie and hands down the best cameo I have ever seen, but that's the problem, it's only a cameo. I would have loved him in this movie as a star or supporting role. I'll give him credit for his role and his comedy. His time on screen was funny and the highlight of the movie but it wasn't enough. In the middle of the movie the characters bunker down in Murrays house and they were safe. Then they leave to go to an amusement park. That is the entire point of the movie. Emma Stone wants to bring her sister to an amusement park in California. That infuriated me. This movie had no point or direction.The story, well there is no story. The characters are weak, the performances are terrible. Emma Stone can be a great actress but she just looks like Megan Fox in this movie and we all know that is never a good person to be compared to. Don't get me wrong, Emma Stone is one of the sexiest women who walks this Earth and seeing her in this movie is jaw dropping. She is hot, but that's about it. She is 100% cliché and only there to bring in teenage guys and perverts. Her character has some depth and personality but its basic and poor. Her job as an older sister is underwhelming and her as a love interest to Jessie Eisenberg is dumb. This is a zombie movie but there is a big lack of zombies. They are here and there but they really don't kick in until the end. The end to this movie was awesome and exciting now why couldn't that have been the entire movie? The zombies looked great but they weren't used. This movie had a few signs of brilliance but is ruined by everything else that is so awful. Bill Murray was great but only for like five minutes. The zombies were great but only for like ten minutes. The rules popping up on screen was funny and creative but you can't build a movie around that. Overall, Zombieland was a disaster. The story is dumb, the characters are dumb, Jessie Eisenberg should never be in a movie for the rest of his life, and I never want to see this movie again. I hated this movie. I bought it on blu ray without ever seeing it and I don't think I will ever do that again. I expected to fall in love with this movie. I expected to get a mixture of Shaun of the Dead and Superbad. Instead I got a disappointment. I got an hour and a half of hatred. I got a WillyT Seal of DISapproval. It really hates me to say that but it's the truth and that's my job, to spread the truth.</fullReview>

That man can generate a laugh just by showing up.Jesse Eisenberg was good as a traveller trying to get across America and escape the zombies, but Woody Harrelson really carried the movie with his passion for killing zombies with whatever tools he could find.I was not really impressed with the two sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.If you like movies with lots of blood and gore, and is funny at the same time, then you need to check this out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie romp with a film stealing cameo...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this zombie flick, though some of the early scenes grossed me out a little, which is something new as usually it takes quite a lot to make me squirm. It did seem a little excessive to start with but settled down as it progressed. Jesse Eisenberg is very good in this, although I felt at times he has the potential to be stereotyped in the future, the next Michael Cera? Still he provides some laughs with his characteristics and mannerisms. The rest of the cast do a great job as well and Abigail Breslin is far from her Little Miss Sunshine persona.There is a lot to enjoy in this film, it looks great for a start and utilizes some clever ideas, the repatition of the Rules is very well done and never becomes annoying or clichéd. I liked the scenes of the foursome chatting in the car, but above all there is the scenes with Bill Murray. Utterly unexpected, his cameo makes the film and is utterly priceless. The fact that he is dressed like a zombie to fit in just screams Murray, he really is a joy to watch, it's just a shame he has to die! All in all this is a fine comedy horror, it's not perhaps as good as the British film Shaun Of The Dead and whilst they clearly draw comparisons, they are both good films in the their own entities.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland started as good movie. I like zombie related stuff, so I wanted to watch this film. The first scene was interesting, but the main character was stereotyped and not so funny. The set of rules were some kind of original but got tiring eventually, just like the excessive voice-over. In the end, this movie turned out average.The acting was not so good. Woody is not the best actor of his generation precisely, but he isn't the worst either. And he showed us just that. He is somewhat good. I think his character was funny in some scenes though. The rest of the cast was the problem. They just weren't memorable. Perhaps this has to do with the terrible script.I won't remember about this film in a few years because it provided me with just plain entertainment. I don't know yet whether to recommend this title or not. It was a little amusing, just not memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't seen such a perfect zombie movie so far !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is totally outclass..The credit mainly goes to the writers of this whole spectacular concept (Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) and definitely the director (Ruben Fleischer) for such a balanced and straight to heart direction ... The actors were actually not selected for this movie, rather they were born for each and every character of this all time perfect movie, especially Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg.. These two guys were born to perform these characters..Normally a problem with common comedy movies is that they often loose their tracks and start exaggerating the story lines to achieve the funny part.. But this comedy flick had nothing to do with any of such things.. This is a calculated comedy which was delivered perfectly.. If someone has played the game "Left 4 Dead" then the best way to describe Zombieland is a hilariously comic adaption of Left 4 Dead.In fact I loved the "Zombie Survival Rules" concept so much that I have developed a "Job Survival Rule Book" based on this.. I love relating the rules described in zombieland so much that almost everyday I come across at least one incident which actually fits into the Zombie survival rule book; starting with - ALWAYS WEAR A SEAT BELT...I don't have words to express how much impact this movie laid into my life, but all I can say is that if you need some time out from your routine lives, just watch it right away... It's a fun ride all the way from start till the end..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want a zombie movie that's all about fun, this is it. The main characters could be seen as shallow or even personifications of stereotypes, but personally I like them that way once in a while. We're not all leading deep and meaningful lives. Sometimes, even though we know it wouldn't be that great, we do wish we could cut the crap and live on looted goods and firepower, so this film is great for release and a laugh. Most zombie movies have some focus on loss and humanity, which is understandable, but if you've ever thought "If I was in his position I would just make the most of it" then you'll like this movie. Lots of unnecessary violence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love zombie movies - funny &amp; ghoulish ones but this would have to be my favorite one recently (for truly horror based one see "28 Days Later" &amp; then "28 Weeks Later" with Cillian Murphy). I thought it was an interesting concept of using a fairground/amusement park as the closing scenes - it was very ironic that the zombies were trying to eat you in a place where you go to have fun. Woody is hilarious and Bill Murray is an unexpected delight. I loved the use of the "rules" ie: Rule #1 Cardio, Rule #2 Double Tap - great idea. Does anyone know if this was based on a book? You have to go with the flow and just enjoy the movie and the great characterization's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland boasts the funniest opening credits sequence of the year. A stripper zombie chases an overweight business man down the street. Countless shots of gory, comical attacks on petrified humans. Blood splatters and chunks of skin fly. All in super cool, super-slow motion. If Antichrist used this technique to add poignancy and effect in it's opening moments, Zombieland uses it purely for laughs. It works. And it sets the tone perfectly for what is to come.Director Ruben Fleischer doesn't attempt to cover up the silliness of it all. He goes for broke on unashamedly cartoonish violence and slapstick humour. He doesn't give a second thought to what the critics will say. Truth is, his balls-out approach is what makes the movie so easy to indulge in. There's barely a dull moment and when the talkative scenes start to slow things down you know something is about to jump out... and most likely get brutally murdered just as suddenly. Or perhaps a classic comedian will appear for a gut-bustingly funny cameo. Either way, Fleischer never loses sight of the desired result.The male duo on screen are excellent. Their polar opposites share undeniable chemistry as they go back and forth with increasingly amusing banter. Harrelson continues his current career-reinvention with another great character: Tallahassee is up for beefcake of the year with his beyond-macho persona and comic-book style antics. Eisenberg, aka Michael Cera with curls, follows his Adventureland success with pretty much the exact same shtick, assumedly living by the maxim "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Their relationship develops predictably, but when you are enjoying their company so much, who cares? The oestrogen providers, Stone and Breslin, offer up little to rave about, their roles not much more than plot-pushers.Flawed and excessive without doubt, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more entertaining way to spend 90 minutes.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

Its a blast of fun for all, but be warned: It can make you queasy at times.When I went to go see this for the first time, I was completely blown away. I had never laughed so hard and jumped out of my seat at the same time! And even though at times I got a little queasy and thought that I should close my eyes I couldn't, because the film was that good! I would totally recommend this film, to anyone! (but please, common sense people, its rated R, don't let your small children watch it) The other good thing is, the critics loved it! And I think we all know how rare it is for critics to like a movie like this! So go treat yourself to, well, a treat!

I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it felt like Ruben Fleischer shot it for the sake of shooting it. Just one poorly executed film. There just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of tripe, boredom, lameness, falling pianos, attempts at comedy, parental and sibling abuse, and fecal dispersement. I think I just sold the film to many of you, but I meant it when i said this stinks. He has succeeded in other films, but I think you'd be better off watching someone pooping.</fullReview>

Further more, you'll learn that they cant drive and panic when the have zombies on the roof of the car, and prefer running, than driving with zombies on it. Buy the way zombies run real fast in this movie.Guys are not so stupid just softhearted, oh sorry, one is stupid, why would anyone carry two barrel shot gun if you can have any automatic weapon you want, or you could just take ouh...hmm...PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN, YOU IDIOT. And those stupid stupid girls...they need someone to help them they have little tiny hands, and little tiny brains, and little tiny feet. What an idiotic story. When you see Bill Murray you'll know what will happen to him even before it happens. I laughed once HA, and that was all. American Shaun of the dead..Shaun of the dead is Citizen Kane for this stupid movie. And what and ending, what a bullets/zombie killed ratio..wow..

		<fullReview>Now first off I'm going to address a certain subject. To J. Ryan: First off, 28 Days Later is NOT a zombie movie. It's a BIOHAZARD movie. The biohazard was called "The Rage", which caused people to turn into zombies. Come into contact with blood from the infected and you become one. Notice how nobody died when infected in either movie? Because THE VIRUS KILLS THEM. They are still living when turned into zombies, but when they're fully zombies they are dead and The Rage takes over them.Today I went to go see Zombieland, and I must say I really enjoyed it. With a talented cast like Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg, this film uses less and ends up with more- something I wish most comedies did nowadays. We've had brainless, unfunny flicks like those countless Date Epic Disaster Spartan Teen Movies from Failburg and Seltzerwater, I Love You Beth Cooper, and several more. But three movies- Observe and Report (Dark, Depressing, Violent, but Hilarious), THe Hangover (Good old drunken comedy), and now this.A virus has infected the United States of America, leaving but 6 people alive. Columbus Ohio, played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg, is but one of them, and considers the only reason he survived is because he followed his own rules. One day he meets Tallahassee, played by Woody Harrelson. He's a tough guy who has an addiction to twinkies and only one rule when it comes to Zombie fighting- "Nut up or shut up". ALong the way they meet Little Rock and Witchita, two sisters who are con girls. After an incident, they meet up again, only to have them gyp them again. As they make their way across the country, they do one thing and one thing only- fight zombies.This is an amazingly hilarious movie, I kid you not. It has a ton of WTF moments and LOL moments, and even a hilarious cameo from *SPOILER ALERT* Bill Murray *END SPOILER*. Yes the cameo lives up to the hype- it's the surprise cameo of the year! Eisenberg is already a better actor than Cera, no doubt about it. Abigail Breslin sure has grown up, as she is not only hilarious but an amazing actress too- she really shines.My only complaint is that I did not get some of the jokes- like the vacuum joke. I get it, it was a Ghostbusters riff, but I still didn't get it. Other than that this movie is damn hilarious, and definitely a must see this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine Zombieland is the result of some board room meeting that went like this: "People are getting sick of twee, 'quirky' coming-of-age comedies, right? So what if we basically make another one, but add this stupid zombie fad? You know, like that zombie survival guide people buy because it makes them feel like they have a unique sense of humor.""Hey, you might be onto something! Zombies are one of the most popular generic nerd humor categories. So Juno with zombies would be... DOUBLE quirky. Those stupid kids will think this is so indie!" "But hey, let's make sure it has no real comic timing, OK? We don't wanna spoil 'em.""Write this stuff down, man! I'm busy with my hookers and blow and counting money."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nerd, zombie-hating-twinkie loving adult, and con-artist girls join forces to kill the undead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies are a catchy phenomenon. Dating back to Night of the Living Dead (1968), there has been a sense of fear associated with the walking undead. Although there have been films before its time that have had comic relief such as Shaun of the Dead (2004), this film sets a new bar for comedy while killing the flesh eating creatures. Zombieland has a unique cast whose personalities conflict with each other throughout the film. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a nerdy guy, who has a fear of two things- Zombies, and Clowns. Columbus is a loner who lives by a set of zombie survival rules which keeps him alive. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a man who hates zombies but loves killing them by various creative means and has no filter when he speaks and endless one-liners. Tallahassee has one goal, to find the snack of his dreams, Twinkies. The pair comes across two con-artist sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who survive by using their innocence as a weapon and plan to go to an amusement park in Los Angeles with hopes of it being a sanctuary. The theme of the film is surviving the zombie apocalypse using different sets of rules and techniques and realizing that being alone sucks. The group comes together after several incidents of distrust and deception, realizing that they need each other to survive. During their endeavors, the group comes across a comedic icon, Bill Murray, in his residence who ultimately dies because of his twisted sense of humor. Zombieland uses a multitude of techniques to keep the viewer engaged. Two of the most notable are the use of sound effects and dialogue, as well as the use of characterization through contrast. The film starts off and continues throughout the film with narration from Columbus explaining his rules of survival and providing additional information of the other characters and the events that take place. The narration throughout the film was a strong point of the film because of the additional tidbits of information provided show how the character's personalities fill the voids of each other. The sound effects, such as crunching and splattering of zombies, the impact of blunt objects, the sounds of zombies moaning, and the use of gun fire provide a sense of surrealism while providing some comic relief in the process. The contrast of characters could not have been anymore different for this film which makes it appealable. Tallahassee, the dominant personality, is raw and uncensored. He is hardcore and the badass of the group, which is polar opposite of Columbus who is perceived as weak, cautious, and a flat out nerd. Their pairing from the beginning is a major contrast which often provides a great deal laughter throughout the film. Wichita and Little Rock, appear to be innocent girls but have a great deal of experience in outwitting others and getting what they want which is immediately apparent when they come in contact with Columbus and Tallahassee. The contrast in personalities in this film make it successful because you never know what to expect from the characters until they actually do it until they all realize that they need each other in some form or fashion. Zombieland has surpassed any comedy involving the existence of zombies. The contrast of characters who all have their own strengths and weaknesses is uncanny giving several instances of humor. Seeing how these characters come together to form a pact, was intriguing from the beginning and adding Bill Murray with a cameo was just the icing on the cake. Trying to top this fun filled, action packed adventure will be a tough challenge due to the creative narration and such a contrast of characters that make you laugh throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel like I came to this a little late. I was never crazy about zombie movies, and now not so much about Jesse Eisenberg although his performances in THE SOCIAL NETWORK and THE DOUBLE were incredible. Sadly, although peppered with enough humor to keep me interested, the thin story left a lot to be desired. The basic plot is "zombie apocalypse...yada yada...a group of people has to survive." Whatever. What else would you in that situation? What I didn't like was how aimless the narrative was. There were a number of laugh-out-loud moments, most courtesy of Woody Harrelson, but they felt strung together in an episodic fashion. The only time where the narrative felt cohesive and "about something" was the climactic battle in an amusement park. And even then, it just felt like a concentrated version of the crazy stuff we'd been getting in more measured doses up until that point. The film is also surprisingly short on zombie action until that sequence. The only detour that felt "worth it" was a visit to a certain celebrity's house (even now, I won't spoil it for those who may not have seen the film yet). Even though the sequence was just an excuse for an extended cameo, it was funny enough that I didn't care. When it comes down to it, even though ZOMBIELAND is fairly short at 85 minutes, there was still the palpable feeling of being padded and occasionally directionless, despite the gonzo, post-modern approach to the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Fasten your seatbelts, it's gonna be a bumpy ride" - Rule #4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uh-oh. In a highly unprecedented move I've actually watched two zombie flicks in a row. This coming from someone who's only other foray into the genre was "Night of the Living Dead", and that was over a decade ago. Nor was this a planned occurrence, I simply managed to catch "Shaun of the Dead" and this one on different cable channels and it just worked out that way. I don't want to attach any undo meaning to it, it's not likely my next picture will be a zombie film.I think I liked 'Shaun' just a bit better, it started out with some nuance and Simon Pegg's early cluelessness about the approaching zombie horde was done cleverly. The principals here, along with the viewer, find themselves in the midst of a zombie apocalypse right from the get go, and things proceed at a pretty rapid pace. The 'rules for zombies' was an entertaining plot element, and most of them made a lot of sense, although Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) probably got some of his priorities mixed up as the story proceeded. I thought #22 - 'When in doubt, know your way out' was more advantageous than #7 - 'Travel light'. But each to his own I guess.One advantage I find with pictures like this is that I don't have to think too hard about writing something scholarly in the way of a review. When you're dealing with mindless entertainment all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride. That's what it looked like Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) was doing, so if it was good enough for him, it's good enough for me. And now that I've learned my 'two zombie flicks in a row' lesson, I'll be back in another ten years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny But Doesn't Always Make Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. I've seen it a couple times already, and I was in the mood for it again. Maybe it's just because I watched it alone, but this time around it wasn't nearly as good as the other times. Zombieland is a zombie apocalypse comedy that follows four people on their journey to an amusement park which they have heard is zombie- free. For the most part it's done well, and while it was clear that some parts that didn't make sense were done for comedy, other parts just didn't. They weren't huge things typically, but I noticed them and they bugged me. Some of the timing was off, as well as reasons for doing something were a little unclear or completely nonexistent at times. Some of these decisions work out in the long run, but in the moment there isn't enough reason to make said decision. The characters are developed fairly well. They were goofy and likable, and realistic enough. As far as comedies go at least. Overall Zombieland is a solid comedy. Some parts don't make a whole lot of sense, but the plot is done well and the characters are good. My recommendation: watch this with one or more of your friends. A movie like this is meant to be watched with other people. And in the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must See for Zombie Lovers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland was just one awesome addition to the zombie genre. Not only was it funny, it made sense.Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is the main character and he narrates throughout the movie. The most important part of his narration is the rules for surviving Zombieland. They are some very simple rules that are all too logical. You know, the logic you NEVER find in a scary movie.As a "The Walking Dead" fan and fan of the zombie genre overall I loved this movie. Eisenberg was great and Harrelson was even better in his post-apocalyptic quest for Twinkies. I would rate it even higher except I'm not a fan of Emma Stone in anything. Still, this is a must see for the zombie lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love anything with zombies and of course this is something that had to be watched too. I have watched this 2009 movie several times already, and still find it to be enjoyable."Zombieland" has some memorable and likable characters, and the four talents in the main roles were doing good jobs in acting and bringing these characters to life on the screen. However, it was Bill Murray who totally stole the scene with his appearance.I found the movie to be lacking what I had hoped for though, which was more zombies. There were zombies, yes, but I would have liked it to have had a whole lot more of them.Lots of fun, great dialogue and memorable moments, "Zombieland" is a worthy addition to any zombie fan's movie collection. However, just keep in mind that this is not your average run-of-the-mill zombie movie.</fullReview>

The scene of him coming and "going" are awesome.Not even this great cast could save this snoozefest...No humor.... only likable character was Woody Harrelson..Also, how stupid must you be to NOT TRUST two guys again and again after they proved to you by saving you and also not harming you..on top of that you go to the freakin' THEME PARK AND LIGHT ALL THE MACHINES!!! Big surprise... the zombies saw it.... if you want a zombie movie, watch shawn of the dead... even resident evil for brainless yet fun action.

		<fullReview>After Shaun of the Dead, zombie-comedies came out in full force with a lot of good flicks and a lot of bad. Perhaps the #2 zombie-comedy according to many since Shaun is that of Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland. Right off the bat, Zombieland presents a comedic rulebook in order to survive a zombie apocalypse. The film's quirky writing style left a lot of possibilities for fun characters and interested actors to fill roles. The casting managed to snag some big A-listers, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Wood Harrelson, and Abigail Breslin. The story is centrally focused on the four characters named after U.S. cities, and follows them along as they venture out looking for safe havens. The gore and zombie action is top notice, lots of good original dialogue but most of all it's truly a funny flick. Take a look at Zombieland in case this was overlooked, it wouldn't be a regret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest zombie movies I have ever seen you have Jesse Eisenberg aka Columbus, Woody Haralson aka Tallahassee, Emma Stone aka Wichita and Abigail Breslin aka Little rock. They are all trying to get back to their homes all why killing zombies. Wichita and Little Rock robbed Columbus and Tallahassee for their guns and car. Columbus haves rules he is living by so he does not become a zombie, but he became a hero at the end of the movie. Tallahassee son became a zombie so he was trying to kill all the zombies because his son became a zombie. Tallahassee ends up killing all the zombies at the end of the movie. The theme haves to deal with human relationships and, for example, you have where Columbus and Wichita kiss at the end they are building a relationship in which ends the movie off in a good note. The mood of the movie stays alive and don't become a zombie also you have the hero mood in the movie when to keep each other together. Some other themes I could be the plot and how it was up and down how Columbus and Tallahassee ran back into Wichita and Little rock. The points of views come into the theme too, for example, you have when Columbus is standing in front of a clown and he is scared of clowns this would be a subjective point of view. Zombieland is a haves many good points to pull out this movie is a funny one just because it haves part that are just like a video game called Lift 4 Dead. There is a video game theme that's plays a part in the film when all of the cast ends up at Bill Murray's house and from there the amusement park seems like a part on the video game. The theme is a little bit of all of these things. Flashback this happens in the film a couple times when Columbus was talking to Tallahassee about the girl that lived next to him 406 aka Amber Heard. Its shows how he found out that there were zombies outside eating people. Then you have another flashback when Tallahassee was talking to all of them (Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock), he was telling them about his son and how munched he loved him. Then you have the slow motion going on it happens when Bill Murry sees that they are in this house he walks up to them like a zombie. All of these things make the movie a good one to watch Zombieland is something that you would never want to happen in real life the theme is a good thing and the flashback and slow motion is a great part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For what it is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how skilled you are with what's the latest Oscar Buzz or equipped with the knowledge of anticipating which film this week will sustain the longevity of film history such as No Country for Old Men, The Dark Knight, or The Artist, sometimes you have to take films for what they are and judge them on what they try to be. Such is the case with Zombieland. In a film that frolics its way through its well-paced 88 minute running time, Zombieland isn't lacking the quality as the title suggests. The film covers its ground with of developing its characters, fulfilling story arcs, and adding gore on the gore. Zombieland's use of narration is maybe the key to the film that makes it positively stand out from all the horror-comedies today. Though the film tries to market the adult audience through the respected Woody Harrelson and Oscar nominee, Abigail Breslin, the newcomers (at the time of release), Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone carry the picture well for the cards they were dealt. Were they inexperienced? Sure. But every great star must begin their walk on some street, no matter how shady it may appear. The focus on selling the film to teenage nerds through identification could use some lessons in subtly, forcing the "typical sissy-geek who will eventually turn hero" character type down the throats of its audience. Zombieland is certainly gunning for a target audience, but the film would've been fine without all the stereotypes, even if every audience member doesn't come with the experimental histories of the protagonist. Though this is a movie about an apocalyptic zombie world, Zombieland at least sets sails in the right direction, even if what it preaches (loneliness and substituting friends for family) has been told countless other times in film and television before. Zombieland works as a satire, and at the very least, a well-made, enjoyable popcorn flare. Rating: 6/10 Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you combine an over-analyzing college student named Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a deranged father named Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a strong willed woman named Wichita (Emma Stone) and a mouthy pre-teen named Little Rock (Abigail Breslin)? The answer is simple, the four surviving individuals who have crossed paths but unite as one to fight against the domination of zombies. Together they battle against the undead to reach their destination of an abandoned Amusement Park, or what they hope is.Jesse has rules that he abides by in this action packed horror movie directed by Ruben Fleischer. These rules have ensured his survival up to a point; however, they become slightly differed when coming across the other three survivors. The bottom line, follow the rules to live or make your own rules to survive. If the sound of rules in a horror movie seems to ring a bell to you, they were also present in the horror movie Scream, directed by Wes Craven. During the movie Scream, rules are discussed by the main characters on how to survive through a horror film. These rules however did not necessarily ensure their survivor, therefore, Jesse's rules may not ensure his either.Zombieland illustrates use of high-key lighting and uses spatial situations to illustrate the path of destruction that the zombies have taken. The naturalness of the light used allows the viewer to see the ever-changing facial features made by each character. By allowing the viewer to witness the features of each character, you can see the determination, yet fear over the thought of whether their survival will continue or if they too will succumb to becoming a zombie. When the view is opened up to survey the destruction of the zombies, especially on the highway scene, we are subjectively viewing it. This movie provides good examples of subjective point of view in the fact that the viewer actually feels as if they are standing right beside Jesse surveying the damage. The viewer also feels that they are part of the action when the zombie is charging at the characters and they either shoot or hit them with one of their weapons. The way the blood sprays and the contortion of the zombie's bodies allows the viewer to feel as if they are standing there, or as if they are partaking in the action.Will they make it to the Amusement Park unscathed, or will their differing personalities be their demise? Will Jesse's rules rub off on the rest of the group, or will they live for the day, possibly doing in their own fate of survival. Each character has their own rules that they have gone by to survive up to this point. The viewer in the end will see whose rules win out and whose rules will do them in.</fullReview>

The characters are four clichés, none are ever believably challenged. The Twinkie finding plot is weak, and throughout the movie there is no real build up towards a satisfying pay-off, except for interludes between jokes. Basically all characterization occurs through an over-used and highly expository voice over, with no effort put into to bringing out drama actually on screen. Watch it to have a laugh and don't want to really pay attention, but it is a 6, not a 7.8.</fullReview>

Great acting from Harrelson and Eisenberg complimented by supporting actors and actresses (even Bill Murray) who are spot-on. A fresh and enjoyable take on the Zombie genre, which before this was looking a bit tired. Has some similarities to Shaun of the Dead, but is so fun that I didn't care. On a technical level this film is superb, the zombies in particular look amazing and real, the kills are inventive, the camera work is fresh and unique, the humor is very funny and the scares work as well.

		<fullReview>"Zombieland" is a movie that knows not to take itself too seriously. It strikes up a great tone of humor, gore, and camaraderie. And while the gore is definitely gratuitous, the humor mostly works, (major spoiler) despite a strange Bill Murray cameo that sorta works, but feels out of place. (spoiler)Early on, easily the best scene in the movie involves the Hostess truck and Woody Harrleson having a fit. That guffaw alone made the movie worthwhile. As with most zombie movies, there's a lot of aimlessness and solitude for the characters, and indeed toward the end, not much has happened, but the filmmakers know this movie about entertainment and not a great or introspective story. Refreshing to see a movie play well within it's own framework.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ZOMBIELAND is no classic comedy like SHAUN OF THE DEAD (which it emulates in small snatches), but it still gives veteran zombie auteur George A. Romero a lesson in how to insert all that "black humor" and "satire" that he never puts into his movies yet that he is famous for.Directed by video nobody Ruben Fleischer (written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick), ZOMBIELAND also addresses a deeper theme that Romero could never envision: that of its characters running FROM zombies but running ever TOWARDS the past that they lost; the "innocent" time before Zombieland.Surface story follows four people with guns that never run of bullets, traveling across country while trying to remain un-undead. Guns, guts and gore, hero shots, geek-gets-girl, blood-spattered undead end to end. 'Nuff said for most rednecks, and a subtle character study for normal-colored necks.Woody Harrelson brings his NATURAL BORN KILLER, as laconic cowboy loner, Tallahassee, who picks up Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus (doing such a good Michael Cera homage, I feel like beating him up for his lunch money); Emma Stone wearing enough mascara to embarrass a prostitute dressed as Jack Sparrow; and Abigail Breslin growing up on screen in front of our eyes.Once again, the "realistic" reason behind the zombie epidemic is updated. In the '50s and '60s - radiation; the '80s and '90s - genetics; 2000s - now a virus, spawned from mad cow disease.Amber Heard cameo - not naked. Waste of skin. Bill Murray cameo, admits his one regret in life was "GARFIELD, maybe."</fullReview>

He meets fun loving zombie killer, Tallahassee, played by Woody Harrelson whom is still looking pretty good. The two join forces and meet 2 sisters that get the better of them. So, the rest of the movie is a road trip between the four as they travel west. Then the final part at Pacificland was rather silly because it just made the 2 girls look dumb.There is some fun gore of zombies ripping open necks or eating inwards, but it's not meant to be scary. Then there is the cameo by Bill Murray, that part was funny.FINAL VERDICT: Decent film, worth seeing if you like silly films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The horror comedy Zombieland focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies. The Person That Casted This Movie Should Get An Award. Woody Herrelson Does A Great Bad-Ass &amp; Jesse Eisenberg Does A Good Annoying Guy.

		<shortDescription>Classic Zom-Com with a great soundtrack!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sadly missed this one at the cinema last year, not showing at the local and transport issues getting to the nearest Cineplex. So it was with much anticipation I put the DVD into the player. The good news is I like it; I like it a lot! Here's a brief summary then I'll tell you why.As is normal in most zombie films, some mystery virus has turned most of the Worlds population into flesh eating zombies. A young college student, known as Columbus, is making his way back home following a bunch of rules he's made for himself since the world became Zombieland. He meets Tallahassee, a rough tough loner who has a thing for Twinkies. The duo decides to travel together, but is soon met by sisters Wichita and Little Rock, who con them out of their vehicle and weapons. The guys find another vehicle and catch the girls up. To cut a long story short they end up travelling together to Hollywood, and then the fun really starts. I will say no more, I don't want to give too much away.This is a really well made comedy zombie flick. Plenty of blood splatter and very inventive ways found to dispatch the zombie hoards. Great performances from all of the main cast, Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus, Woody Harrelson was particularly good as Tallahassee, Emma Stone as Wichita and Abigail Breslin as Little Rock. There is another major star that has a cameo, but I won't give it away here, just in case you haven't seen it yet.As I said at the beginning, I really like this film; it has a great soundtrack too, if you open with Metallica you're always going to get a vote from me! There are plenty of laughs and also some touching moments too. Over all, recommended, but maybe not for the more squeamish out there.My score: 7.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge breath of fresh air among otherwise stale Hollywood horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a plague ravages the human population (stemming from a contaminated gas station burger), a small band of survivors group together (somewhat unwillingly) and travel the country on their way to a California amusement park. Fun &amp; terror meets them on their path.Ah, zom-coms. . . one of my favourite sub-subgenres of horror. From Dead-Alive to Shaun of the Dead, zombie-comedies tend to be the best of the horror-comedy lot. Unfortunately, after films like Shaun of the Dead, every Joe Director with a few thousand bucks has tried to replicate the success and make their own Shaun clone (same happens after just about every new popular flick (see Evil Dead as a huge example)). Many thought Zombieland would hold the same fate: A replica of Shaun that simply cannot compare. And, while it doesn't hold the same prestige as the Simon Pegg classic, Zombieland is still a truly fantastic entry in the zom-com genre.Starting with the cast, it was a damn fine set up of talented stars. Woody Harrelson perfectly captures the insane, grizzled hero of the bunch. Jesse Eisenberg (Adventureland), as he tends to be in his roles, works as the awkward kid with a crush. Emma Stone (Superbad) is sweet &amp; cute in her own wicked little way. And then there's the sweet Abigail Breslin who really never fails and still maintains her place as one of the few tolerable child stars left out there. On other technical levels, the writing was very good. The dialogue is often hilarious, especially in the times of character spats. The story never gets too complicated and stays very interesting throughout. Director Ruben Fleischer, who makes (pretty much) his directorial debut here, really captures the action of the zombie-killing lifestyle well and manages to wrangle the movie into something both simple and expansive. Very well done on all accounts.There are certain elements that zom-coms really should have and Zombieland has them in spades. The gore is fantastic, brutal, and sometimes over-the-top. It had my girlfriend cringing and covering her eyes numerous times. The opening sequences with the often-hilarious, often-disgusting gore scenes in slow motion was absolutely brilliant (I personally liked the firemen the most). Just about all the zombie violence was simultaneously laugh-out-loud funny and recoil-in-revulsion gross. There are a few scares (most notably the bathroom scene(s)), but most of the film focuses on gore, fun, comedy, and action with a little bit of romance tossed in for good measure.One of the absolute best parts of the film, hands down, involves the outstanding cameo that I won't reveal here. For those who haven't seen it, I truly hope you don't seek out finding out about the cameo as the surprise definitely made it all the better. It was absolutely hilarious and had me rolling in laughter, something not too common with me.Overall, Zombieland was a huge breath of fresh air in the otherwise stale sector of Hollywood horror. With remakes and sequels galore, Zombieland should not be missed.Final Verdict: 8.5/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Garden Variety Zombie Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My son rented this movie. I remember seeing a clip of Woody Harrelson's performance somewhere and decided to take a gander. This is a a wonderful, tongue in cheek (if you'll excuse the expression), outrageous film with cute performances, lots of charm, and a positive slant that seems impossible under the circumstances. The story is about a young man who is stuck alive as the entire world collapses around him. Ninety-nine percent of the population has become the walking (or running) dead. He has a set of rules for staying alive that he uses without fail and this gets him from one day to another. He meets Woody Harrelson, a true character, who is loaded for bear. They also hook up with a couple of sisters who steal their weapons and their car on several occasions. The relationship among these four is priceless and we really care about them. Then, there is Bill Murray. I won't say more. This film was totally off the radar, but was so much better than most of what I have seen lately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fleischer takes us right into 'Zombieland' when the world has already been taken over by the walking dead. He doesn't dwell much on explaining how, why, when, people started turning into zombies which is just as well. There have been plenty of movies started that way so why not go straight to the fun stuff? There isn't that much gore as one would expect from such a film but the humour works very well. The special effects and makeup team have done a fine job. Regarding performances, Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg carry the film while Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are passable. Needless to say, there's a hilarious cameo (I don't know whether I should mention the star's name yet but just to be on the safe side, I'll refrain). 'Zombieland' is a celebration of the genre and it offers plenty to laugh about. Though I don't place it as high as favourites like 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Planet Terror', (mainly due to the uneven pace) it definitely occupies second place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wouldn't call it Top 250 worthy on IMDb, but it's certainly a fun filled ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland isn't overrated by any means, but I do think calling it 250 worthy is pushing it. Zombieland benefits from never taking itself too seriously, and having the perfect balance of Comedy and Action, with a bunch of great characters that we can all root for. It starts off with a tremendous opening of the movie, introducing us to Jesse Eisenberg's character, Columbus. I loved how he gave us the set of rules that he had to survive the Zombies and that, it was funny and quite inventive. I thought the movie's main strength was the fantastic chemistry of Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. Jessie is kind of the wimpish, yet endearing character who sucks it up when he has too, to outwit the Zombies, while Woody enjoys killing them off, and relishes it. It's just a very smart Comedy/Horror film that does what it sets out to do well. I also found it amusing how Wichita|Stone| and Little Rock|Breslin| kept conning Columbus and Tallahassee, the Bill Murray cameo was a nice touch too.Performances. Woody Harrelson is a new bad ass hero of mine, with his portrayal of Tallahassee here. He's funny, he kicks all kinds of but, and his charisma is untouchable!. Jesse Eisenberg is the perfect reluctant hero. His quirky antics, and the way he acted always managed to put a smile on my face. While Tallahassee was my favorite character, Jessie was probably the heart of the film. Emma Stone is a total cutie, and manges to inject charisma and the right amount of depth into her part. Her sassiness was not only a turn on, but it gave me a lot of chuckles as well. Abigail Breslin is a hoot as Little Rock. She is one of the rare likable kid actresses of today, and her chemistry with Emma Stone is top-notch.Bottom line. Zombieland is a hoot of a Zombie film. It's funny, action packed and an all around good time. I wouldn't put it anywhere near the top 250, like a lot of people have, but I definitely like the movie a lot, and look forward to the sequel.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is an enjoyable zombie romp road trip. It's fun, witty and full of gags. It's not a quaint as Shaun of the Dead or as funny but it is well written by Rhett Reese &amp; Paul Wernick and expertly directed by the relatively unknown Ruben Fleischer.It has plenty of gore humour and a comical cameo by Bill Murray as himself. Woody Harrelson is ideal as Tallahassee, the crazy twinkie zombie killer and Jesse Eisenberg plays the goofy teen Columbus effortlessly.There's really not much to dislike about the film, however, if you like your zombie films serious and menacing avoid at all costs, but if you like large budget horror comedies, Zombieland is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Zombie flicks from year 2000 yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really well performed, zombie wise, story wise and acting wise. Directingwise as well. Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Talahasse was the best part of the movie and one other actors funny cameo also did the trick. I was entertained during the entire movie, didn't even have one boring moment in it. The movie also combined humor with horror and drama in a very good way. I really like this movie and it's one of the best Zombie movies I've seen lately. It could also be compared to Shaun of the dead, minus the British humor which this movie lacks. It has typical funny American humor instead, and it's also good. This new guy playing the curly haired hero guy in the movie was really charming. He added a lot to the humor in the movie. And plus watching this movie will make you prepared for a future Zombie invasion, it has a lot of usable rules to follow. Maybe they didn't explore each and every character in depth, but this was foremost a horror flick, secondary; a comedy. The graphics of the movie was nasty good and the special effects was very well performed, even in slow-mo mode. It has got a lot of gory bits in it and sensitive viewers should be warned. It does not lack blood and grossness, but is containing this in an overwhelming amount. Don't eat whilst watching it, you have been warned. To sum it up: This is an very good and enjoyable Zombiemovie which somehow is perfect in it's very tiny 1 hour and 20 minutes. Just a great Zombie movie you all should watch. I would never want to visit Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies with a Sense of Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This hilarious skewering of the walking dead genre is gross as can be, but it's also funny as hell and even -- dare I say? -- rather sweet.Jesse Eisenberg, who I usually find pretty unappealing, is likable as a geek who manages to survive a zombie apocalypse and stays alive by following a laundry list of zombie survival rules (things like always checking the backseat and staying on top of your cardio regimen so you can outrun the undead when necessary). He comes across Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a crazy fellow survivor with a penchant for Twinkies. This unlikely pair eventually teams up with a couple of sisters, and these individual loners who until now have believed that the key to survival is to trust no one form a little island of family in a sea of carnage."Zombieland" is mostly a goof, but it does carry throughout a relevant message about the power of human kindness and connection to help people cope with a world that's full of nothing but bad news. The cast has a lot of chemistry, and the film is quick and clever.There's a cameo from a big-time movie star playing himself that comes about halfway through the movie and gives it some of its biggest laughs.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't get a chance to see this movie until it came out on DVD but the first time i saw it i thought it was a great movie. Woody Harrelson is awesome really enjoy his movies he has a great role in this as well playing Tallahassee the zombie killer. to go along with woody was a actor named Jesse eisenberg these two make quite the odd couple but had some great scenes with funny laughs. The movie was a little bloody actually a bit bloody but with an r rating you have to expect it a little it is a zombie movie after all. I thought this movie was much more funnier than it was scary it had a few parts where things kind of just popped out at you but nothing terrible. plot for the most part wasn't that great you could tell what was going to happen before it even did which made the movie a little less appealing but still found it great. and with bill Murray playing himself might make the movie he plays such a good role for the short time he is the movie but the movie just wouldn't be the same without him in it. Emma Stone and Abigale breslin play the two girls in the movie thought they did OK not too bad but all in all would definitely recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just what the world needs, another Zombie movie. With recent (and successful) genre installments such as Shaun of the Dead and the Dawn of the Dead redo, what could another zombie flick possibly offer an audience? The answer: a raucous, wildly entertaining romp that will make you jump, laugh and send you out of the theater feeling as good as if you just watched The Princess Bride.Technically precise and disgustingly beautiful to behold, Z-Land grabs you by the short hairs from Round 1. But where the film really shines is with these four characters whom we come to love and applaud while sharing their journey through blood and guts. Four pros on their A-Game, the cast gives us performances typically saved for films on the Oscar short list. A particular delight is the relationship between an effortlessly maturing Abigail Breslin and everyone's favorite former barkeep, Woody Harrelson. A montage of scenes in the car at the mid-point will have you giggling and feeling all warm and fuzzy on the inside. And yes, this is a zombie movie. The film also boasts perhaps the greatest and most effective cameo in the history of comedy.Z-Land proves once again what corporate Hollywood simply doesn't understand: any genre, any piece of IP can be successfully adapted to both critical and commercial acclaim if you create colorful, memorable and likable characters.Z-Land. Zombies, but with a lot of heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feelgood Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an amiable, if rather aimless attempt to create a feelgood zombie flick. In order to achieve this it pretty much ignores what we can imagine to be the realities of such a situation in its attempt to raise a few laughs and amuse us with its irreverent attitude towards what used to be a serious horror sub-genre. The fact is, the zombie comedy-horror genre is becoming as over-populated as the straight version from which it was spawned, and Zombieland doesn't really add anything new to the mix.Having said that, it's entertaining enough if you're in an undemanding mood. Woody Harrelson goes all Mallory-lite for his portrayal of Tallahassie, and although he's never convinced me as a tough guy, he's good enough. The lead character's rules for survival in zombieland are possibly the most entertaining part of the film, and it's a shame we're only let in on 10 or so of the 30+ he's devised.For all it's entertainment value, you can't help feeling it could have been a whole lot more ? which suggests its writers have perhaps devoted too much time paying affectionate homage to other movies they admire rather than creating something worthy of their own to which others might wish to pay homage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was told by many people that this was a brilliant horror comedy, so I decided that I should try it, and I really hoped I would agree with them all. Basically Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a big wuss that has survived the virus, related to mad cow disease, which has infected the whole human race, and changed them into blood and flesh hungry zombies. He has survived with his twenty-seven survival rules (which pop up on screen every so often), such as: fasten your seat belts, check back seats, double tap (kill again if not dead), travel light, (don't) be a hero, limber up and many more. On his way back to his home town (to find his already dead parents), he meets gun loving and zombies slaying Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), in search of a Twinkie. They have their car stolen (twice) by independent gun-toting girls Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Little Miss Sunshine's Abigail Breslin), but they eventually all join forces to fight off their foes. They are heading for the one place there is rumoured to be salvation from the zombies, theme park Pacific Playland. They quickly stop off in Hollywood and enter the house of actor Bill Murray, who comes in dressed as a zombie, and as a result gets killed in defence by Columbus. So they reach the theme park, and it does seem quiet, but as soon as the rides are up and running that changes, and they are fighting and killing for their lives against the fast acting monsters. The cast is good, the zombies are nasty, Murray's longish cameo is funny, and the gory effects are fun, it is certainly a very watchable horror comedy. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a post apocalyptic world in the not too distant future, Earth has been taken over by zombies and formerly nerdy kid Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has had to buff up to fight off the maurauding masses. He crosses paths with Tallahasse (Woody Harrelson) a naturally tough, no nonsense redneck with his own demons to fight (on the inside.) But they soon find themselves in a battle of wits with two sisters, the older, beautiful Wichita (Emma Stone) and her feisty younger sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) before they figure it'll work better to work together...The zombie movie franchise is alive and booming at the moment, both played straight with the new batch George A. Romero keeps dropping out and in terms of serving as spoof fodder, since the formula is so familiar. So much so that Zombieland keeps serving up self referential quips, with the rules that Columbus has established for himself constantly flipping up on screen in order of how he thought them up, which do have a bearing with how characters tend to survive in these sorts of films. Although it isn't a brilliant film, it somehow worked for me much more than the over rated Shaun of the Dead.Cast wise, Harrelson could carry the role of the tough, grizzly redneck in his sleep, constantly cracking wise and at one point revealing an unexpected, dramatic trauma from his past that's as out of nowhere (and sort of out of place) as a similar scene in the aforementioned SOTD. Otherwise, Stone is sexy and sassy as Wichita. Eisenberg and Breslin are decent in their roles, but are secondary to the two I could write home about in a film with such a short cast list.Short and sweet at 81 minutes, this is a forgettable but worthwhile send up, better than SOTD or even the more recent British counterpart Doghouse. ***</fullReview>

So did the other actors, the script, the special effects, the humor and the art work. Fantastically uplifting to see that it is still possible to render a "zombie" story to the screen in such a way that it completely revives the genre. I look so much forward to see more of Woody, Columbus, Wichita, Little Rock and whatever the writers and director can come up with next.Story telling and character development at its best. I'll paint spray "3" on my car tomorrow when going to work (though I have not yet figured out the meaning, someone? help?)Nuff said. Watch if you can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without the laughs this may have been another cheesy run-of-the-mill zombie action flick. The laughs were there though and there were plenty to go around. From the very first scenes of the movie there was comedy and it continued through its entirety. Eisenbergs character made up a list of rules to survive Zombieland which carried the first ten minutes or so. Then came Woody and he alone was enough to drive the film. His sick sense of humor was funny in itself and I found myself waiting to see what he was going to do next. The action was enough to satisfy the popcorn flick crowd and the story wasn't too bad either. The acting was sub-par (I'm not a fan of Eisenberg yet) but the dialogue made up for some of that. Little Miss Sunshine was there but she didn't bring much to the film. Bill Murray has a nice cameo though and I swear, I laughed my balls off. His scene was one of the most hilarious scenes I've seen in a while and I still laugh about it when talking with friends. At times the storyline seemed a little repetitive but it ended well with a big bright amusement park scene and plenty of action. I'm not sure if I'll watch it again anytime soon but it is definitely one that can be enjoyed more than once. Everyone should give this one a shot because there is something in it for all types of movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close, so close...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been rather obviously compared to Shaun Of The Dead. For some it eclipses the Wright/Pegg offering. For me it comes very close, but has one major drawback - the love story sub-plot. The rest of this film is fantastic. Woody is superb (is his rehabilitation complete now?), and I found myself watching every move of his character. The two sisters also work well, and the nerd is, well, a nerd. The situations and development of the zombie plague are handled extremely well, and the solutions the characters evolve in their quest for survival are believable as well as very funny. And did I mention that Woody is fantastic? I'll mention it again because it deserves to be emphasised. He's great in this film.Of course, at a couple of moments the younger characters act like dumb-asses, but this is forgivable in the context of the film - they're teenagers and teenagers don't always do the logical, intelligent thing.Did I laugh out-loud? Absolutely, and often. Did I empathise with the characters? At almost every moment.And so to the love-story. It was just not believable. In fact it was a typical nerd's wet-dream. Perhaps somewhere in the world the nerd occasionally gets the babe, but when it's splashed up on celluloid it just doesn't ring true. If she'd fallen for Woody I'd have believed it. As it is I found it really getting in the way of my enjoyment. However, I suppose the money men will insist on the director ticking all the boxes and reaching out to the "nerd profile" of a percentage of the audience. However, for me it was achingly predictable, in a movie that in every other way was fresh.So, whilst I'd give Shaun a 10 I can only see an 8 here. Having written this I suppose I should declare my interest - as an Englishman I can see that perhaps Shaun is better in my eyes because it presses my cultural buttons in a way that Zombieland, excellent film that it is, can't.Finally, whilst I have some criticisms, I would always recommend this as a film. In fact, my criticisms reflect my irritation that they came so, so close to making a perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland: A Pure Comedy, and Quite a Good One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now the most commercially successful zombie film of all time, Zombieland comes with an impressive reputation. Tackling a sub-genre more deeply mined than most, it attempts to do so in an original and interesting way.Zombieland concerns an apocalyptic world in which the main character, Columbus (named, like the rest of the characters, after his hometown), tries to survive regular onslaughts of zombies. Meeting others along the way he carries on, determined not to be eaten, by abiding to certain rules.The film is very very funny. Many laughs, consistent and effective, and well hitting. The rules are a great running motif, popping up in the background where necessary. Additionally, the editing is quite effective in creating laughs of its own, cutaways to other people and flashbacks adding much to the laugh factor. Performance-wise, the acting is great, particularly Eisenberg's, carrying the film well with his appropriate dorkiness. The now infamous cameo, which I won't name in case you're lucky enough not to know and want to retain your ignorance until viewing the film, steals the show with its brilliance: the perfect implementation of the film's style of humour. The plot is fine and nothing particularly original, but ultimately unimportant, the film more concerned with keeping us chuckling. All of the characters work quite well with each other, giving a good balance and range. The central love story, though not all that involving, is perfectly cute and amusing in itself. Harrelson's side storyline is one of the film's better elements, his search for Twinkies the perfect antithesis to his amusing yet surprisingly sad backstory.Good characters, great interaction, funny dialogue, consistent quality. Delivering all you can possibly ask of it and hitting all the right spots, Zombieland is a pure comedy, and quite a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have we been so jaded already by the preponderance of these types of films? I do not even think we even flinch anymore when we watch "Zombieland" or similar types. Zombie films are the perfect excuse to do mindless violence to human bodies without them being objectionable to watch. Zombieland is another one of such blood and gore extravaganza.You have to inject something new into the formula to make it stand out among its sub-genre. "Dead Snow" was unique in its snowy locale and Nazi zombies. "Zombieland" will have to thank Woody Harrelson's reckless performance as Tallahassee as its trump card. Woody is known for crazy roles before, but he is quite the star in this movie because of his natural and effective devil-may-care performance. "Zombieland" also has a hidden gem in its middle section with a surprise star cameo by a celebrity whose gates carry the initials of "BM". That part of the film is also really hilarious and quite memorable.Overall it is a funny zombie movie. It lists some interesting rules about how to survive zombies. It has a romance in there somewhere. Best of all, it is short and direct to the point. Zombie movie fans will surely enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tallahassee (Harelson) and Columbus (Eisenberg) team up with Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) to fight and kill Zombies that have taken over parts of the United States. Tallahassee is also on a quest to find a Twinkie. Yes, a Twinkie. Go figure. To think I had to watch Zombieland to find a movie with real laugh-out-loud (at times) comedy in it. Zombieland has many, many good lines and physical comedy within. To put it bluntly, it's a trip. Normally, I would have stayed away from anything to do with Zombies (hey, I have to sleep at night), but a promo I saw gave me a different perspective, and, of course, the promo was a funny one. So I took a chance. If the movie explained how the Zombies were all over the place, I missed it. Didn't matter, it was what it was. Yes, there is some gore in the beginning, but the scenes didn't last long and later on the gore had subsided. But, cover children's' eyes when you fear a close-up of a Zombie is coming toward you. Later on the Zombies didn't seem to have the same scary effect. They become kind of funny. Really. Harrelson gave a comfortable, comedic, spot-on performance. He is extremely talented. The rest of the cast performed well and no one over-acted or acted stupid, or silly like you usually see in what they call "comedies" these days. A good job by all. Well done. Not sure why Bill Murray was in the movie. In fact, those scenes at his residence could have been anyone's place. He was okay, just not sure why he was in there. He was not a Zombie, but was outfitted like one. His reasoning for the get-up did make a lot of sense. But what was really bad, was what happened to him. Didn't make sense. Judge Judy doesn't like things that don't make sense. But, there it was Judge. Go figure. To sum up our history. We have gone after Indians, the British, the Mexicans, each other in the North and the South, Vampires, and now Zombies. What is next? Is there anything left? Whatever it will be, let's hope that there is a serious sense of humor about it all. This was surprisingly good. And, they left it open for a Zombieland 2. Can't wait. This one was a trip. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Gore: Yes, not really for kids Language: Yes, some, not much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is it with Hollywood's fascination (obsession) with bloody Amusement Parks! Up until the concluding foray in this film's amusement park this was a nice solid "8" of a movie. Then the director decided we should watch another movie and abandoned everything built on in the first 85%. Thus my global rating here of a weak "6".The director's insistence to clone poor Jesse Eisenberg into Michael Cera was largely successful, and only a little sad, but if you can't cast the actor you hoped for, have the good grace to better tailor the role to the actor you do hire, will ya? This isn't a long movie to start with (88 minutes), but as soon as the girls bump through the gates of the park and turn on the lights with delight, turn it off. You've seen everything worth seeing. The rest of the film is why-bother dreck.The film would then even better resemble the TV pilot it was first conceived as and rate an "8".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Zombieland"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the film was a surprise to me. Being in a genre which I thought had already been fully explored with Shaun of the Dead (zombie-comedy), "Zombieland" was actually surprisingly funny. The writers, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, have a sharp wit when it comes to the jokes; they are able to balance absurd situations with clever dialogue from the four central characters remarkably well. Ruben Fleischer's directorial debut is also an impressive effort. He is very stylistic when it comes to the visuals of the movie, creating some inventive sight gags in the film. Something that was brought to my attention is that gore and comedy do not mix. It makes the audience a little uncomfortable when they are supposed to be laughing at body dismemberment. Some situations are fueled by the gore gags, but this film is at it is strongest when the comedy is derived from the personality of the characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indie Hollywood finally has an answer to the British classic Shaun of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There just aren't enough movies about zombies nowadays. Now, vampires are the go-to horror clichés because of the emergence of the overrated, over-hyped, and overdiscussed Twilight. Now, a GOOD zombie movie comes along even rarer than a real-life zombie attack. Shaun of the Dead is the only exception to the norm, becoming one of the greatest horror-comedy hybrids in the history of film. Zombieland is a successful and entertaining American version of the cult classic. By combining action, comedy, horror, a bit of absurdity, and a small dosage of heart, Zombieland is America's first good zombie movie in an extremely long time. Its box office success can be attributed to the previous fact, by proving potential thrills not seen in the genre in over a decade. The most successful zombie movie in history deserves its major success.The plot is extremely simple, as it doesn't dwell deep into why zombies have taken over and also because there aren't that many speaking characters throughout the flick. Columbus (Jesse Adam Eisenberg), one of the remaining survivors, runs into a trigger and violence-happy Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). They both team up together and go on a road trip towards anyplace that doesn't contain zombies---and contains twinkies. Along the way they run into a dangerous sister duo, a well-known actor (awesome cameo too), and of course zombies. Written by Rhett Reese and Paul Warnick, this movie contains plenty of action but also a lot of laughs and helpful tips. While Scary Movie started the entire how-to-survive-horror-movie shtick, Zombieland perfects it.Woody Harrelson runs the show in terms of performance and scene-stealing moments, but the rest of the cast does an admirable job. Jesse Eisenberg's dry subtle style of humor resembles that of Michael Cera, but let's just hope he doesn't carry this personality to every movie (therefore suffering the Will Ferell Effect). Of course in every horror movie you need attractive ladies, but Emma Stone (of Superbad fame) isn't just a pretty face to look at as she adds a mix of toughness, beauty, and quiet vulnerability. Final note, Abigail Breslin is always fantastic, and it's amazing she isn't 16 yet but displays the maturity of a professional actress.However, the best quality from the movie is the fantastic directing. Ruben Fliescher, a rather rookie director, directs this with plenty of flair and indie flavor. The slow-motion shots throughout the movie are some of the best you'll ever see, and they just add to the visual cleverness of Zombieland. The opening sequence is one of the best in recent years, as it immediately propels you into the mood and tone of the movie. Fliescher doesn't pull any punches as you will see plenty of blood, plenty of gore, and most of the carnage can be seen spewing right into the camera. The camera is never fixated, but is also never shaking to a point in which you can't see what is going on. The special effects are minimally used, which makes it much more effective. Sometimes, excellent make-up can provide better thrills and scares than the cop-out CGI.What makes Zombieland work is that it's as much of a comedy than it is horror and that minimizes the tension and allows for the audience to enjoy the ride---granted there are indeed a few scares here and there. This movie never takes itself seriously, which makes it more enjoyable and more gleeful for the indie crowd. For anyone getting tired of the gruesome rated-R horror movies with little character development, little reason to care, and awful special effects, Zombieland will become your breath of fresh air.Bottom Line: Zombieland is a brilliant action/comedy hybrid, and becomes the best film of its genre since Shaun of the Dead several years ago. Neglecting Shaun of the Dead, you have to go back to 1996 to find a superior horror comedy, which was the instant classic (and genre-changing) Scream. This movie has superb directing, great writing, a wonderful cast, plenty of action, and plenty of humor to look forward to. The only problem is that the movie is short and leaves you asking for much more. But this is the sign of a good movie, leaving you actually requesting a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much like scoring a Twinkie in real life.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7.5I'm not a big fan of zombies. I went into Zombieland in want of and expecting a good movie. I heard it was a good movie. I was disappointed. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. In fact, I'd say that it is an "above mediocre" film. There's a good premise, a good cast, and a newcomer director that didn't get to show off much with this script. The script lacks. There are some funny, witty and good lines. But there's a lot of fluff. There's a lot of filler. And filler isn't really all that good. In fact, watching Zombieland is much like eating a Twinkie.It has good characters, and a great cast. However, there isn't much room for them to move around, or you know, be characters. You never really feel like there's a connection between them. And I don't think this is because of the actors' performances, I think it's because of the script. The world as well, feels dead. And I don't mean the zombie type of dead, I mean the "where are we, and where are we going" type of dead. The only place in the film that is interesting is... well... a certain character's mansion. The film is very short, and I think with a bit more development, showing more time on the road, more locations for them to encounter zombies and escape, would make for a better overall film. Instead of the, "here we are, here are the characters, here are a few jokes, and we're done", setup that we get. It felt as if the movie was afraid to do more.If you're going to make a zombie movie, and all it's really about is survival, and you choose to not elaborate on the origin of the plague, you have to have a lot of style. A lot of character. And this movie has that, at first. For example, Tallahassee's Twinkie infatuation. What seems to be like a good thread in the story, one that invites all kinds of possible situations and jokes, one that can promote suspense and emotion in the audience, while being a funny concept at the same time, fails to deliver. There isn't much mention of the Twinkie infatuation. It takes a back seat to... to... well... nothing. Nothing as nearly as interesting happens in the movie, with the exception of the aforementioned mansion scene. In the end the conclusion to the Twinkie thread isn't even all that satisfying. It's much like trying to score a Twinkie in real life, trust me.Zombieland has a good start. It introduces an interesting universe for zombies in America, introduces good characters (casted well, to boot), starts good threads, but then falls asleep. If you like zombies, and/or you're looking for a fun and simple movie to watch, go no further. However, if you're looking for a good film that happens to be about zombies, do not expect much. This movie is nothing special, but it doesn't have to be, and it's not bad either. However, it's a bit disappointing because it seemed like it was going to be a really good film about zombies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the look of this movie but was not too fussed. It rained so I didn't bother going to the cinema to see it.What a mistake! This film is fantastic!! It is witty, exciting, moves at a lovely pace, the main characters "Rules of how to survive a zombie apocalypse" are entertaining and bind everything together.Funnily enough being a comedy it is not restrained by the inevitable downward-spiral of hopelessness that the likes of Romero are chained too, so it keeps you guessing a little. Because of this unpredictability I think the film has some merit as a zombie film, although it is primarily comedy.At one point the film takes a swerve towards stupidity, I inwardly sighed and was about to throw the towel in when 90 seconds later it was back on its path.Definitely one to own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, as far as Woody Harrelson in this one, he was a blast, one bullet and zombie kill at a time. And of course the surprise guy, and I don't want to spoil it for anyone, just made the movie complete. The movie wasn't deep, not philosophical, not a candidate for cinematography, won't be nominated for an Oscar for best actor, male or female, lead or supporting, and it won't be compared to Citizen Kane, but it was just what the doctor ordered. It was non-stop laughs. Thought this was a fun ride from the moment it came on until the end credits. And let's not forget, it's following how many zombie movies in the last several years? The last thing I thought was needed was another zombie movie. And we did, it was Zombie Land. If you didn't catch it on the big screen, it's okay, rent it and just microwave at least two bags of popcorn. It's not a long movie, but you'll be munching away and enjoying a brainless fun-fun kill-kill zombie ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plenty of fun, but a wish-fulfilment zombie movie is something of a paradox.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening riffs tell you all you need to know. The first scene riffs on the Scream-style survival rules of a horror movie. The second riff is from Metallica's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls'.Zombie flicks, like eighties thrash metal, might appear oppressive to the uninitiated, but to the fans they are thrillingly fun. And Zombieland is very much a movie for the fans. Not a Shaun of the Dead-esquire homage to Romero and the like; but an homage to the fans.The characterisation is simple. Our heroes are named by their destinations- Columbus and Tallahassee- and defined by their driving desires. Geeky Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) craves the opportunity to chastely brush a girl's hair behind her ear, while badass redneck Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) lops off undead limbs in search of the world's last Twinkie.These are less characters than they are avatars for the fans. The title invites us into a theme park for ninety minutes of whack-a-zombie. Columbus has the aforementioned list of rules of how to survive a zombie apocalypse, addressing lore that any fan will have fun recognising. The characters take perverse pleasure in discussing the most disgusting zombie kills they've witnessed, sounding like true gorehounds. And they ratify for us that great (yet curiously unaddressed) desire we all share about post-apocalyptic living: they break stuff. For fun.But that's also the problem with Zombieland; it's too much fun. It's too slickly presented, concerned with looking cool and getting laughs, and seemingly forgetting to be scary. It's a balance that Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright managed to get right with Shaun of the Dead. They understood that the laughs come hardest when they puncture genuine tension. Without the peril and the fatalism, Zombieland feels a little lightweight.Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable ride, with funny performances from Eisenberg and Harrelson, as well as a delightful cameo that heightens the fanboy fantasy feel of the movie. But for all the human meat munching it displays, Zombieland is a little too much like confectionery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Travelling along what is now known as ZOMBIELAND (Formely earth) Two men, TALLAHASSEE &amp; COLUMBUS hook up with the two girls that at one point holds them at gun point &amp; steals their truck (&amp; then later take the two men hostage again) where they blow away zombies all the while looking for twinkies, visit BILL MURRAY, kill Bill Murray &amp; then visit an amusement park where they must fend off hundreds more zombies that want them for dinner. Being one of 2009's surprising horror/comedy hits, ZOMBIELAND thankfully (unlike most horror items that reach the #1 spot at the box office) is more than deserving of it's critical praise &amp; financial success. It's an absolutely hilarious horror comedy featuring tons of great zombie make up &amp; effects, acting &amp; directing. The film plays tribute to many horror &amp; comedies &amp; manages to hit all of it's jokes on target. In terms of plot, there hardly is any &amp; the film never really does break any new ground at least where zombie films are concerned. But horror/comedy fans, in particular those who enjoyed films like DANCE OF THE LIVING DEAD/ZOMBIE STRIPPERS/BOY EATS GIRL/RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD I &amp; II/EVIL DEAD 2/ ARMY OF DARKNESS &amp; SHAUN OF THE DEAD etc. should find plenty to like. Highly recommended to fans of the genre. Rumor has it that the film may be turned into a TV series (which this film was originally intended for) &amp; is followed by a sequel ZOMBIELAND 2 (In 3D!) ***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nut Up or Shut Up is The Important Rule. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . and it's a great rule in the aptly-titled, shameless B-grade, horror comedy, "Zombieland", which, unlike the film's blood-and-flesh eating monsters, keeps on going strong within its 88 minutes.Due to some poor schmuck eating a diseased cheeseburger, humanity has devolved into ravenous zombies. Fortunately, there are smart yet unconventional holdouts amidst the chaos: nerdy, coward college student Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg of "The Hunting Party" and "The Squid and the Whale") who wants to reunite with his parents and free-spirited, gun-loving redneck Tallahassee (two-time Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson of "Cheers", "Natural Born Killers" and "The Messenger") who has a "love jones" for Twinkies snack cakes (I heard they can survive a nuclear holocaust). Along the way, they meet (and get conned) by sibs Wichita (Emma Stone of "Superbad") and Little Rock (Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin of "Little Miss Sunshine") while trying to find sanctuary in a L.A.-based amusement park. Can this foursome, whose names are shared with the towns they were born in, get along without becoming zombie chow? Rookie helmsman Ruben Fleischer and co-scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have a ball and a half in the flick that delightfully echoes the works of Carpenter, Raimi, Romero and Smith. As CGI captions, the rules to survive and deal with zombies (like being in shape and avoiding lavatories) are boldly and tongue-in-cheek noted, voice-over style, by Eisenberg, who could probably out nerd philosophize Michael Cera any day of the week. His caution trait is matched by Harrelson's macho goofiness and tenacity, keeping each other alive. A younger version of Stockard Channing and a possible Tarantino stock actor, Stone acts way older than she looks while Breslin slyly reps struggling innocence in a dark world; both ladies pull it off.The appearances by Amber Heard ("Pineapple Express". "The Informers") and Oscar nominee Bill Murray (the Ghostbusters films, "Broken Flowers") are self-mocking and reliable. I wish there was more of the clown zombie. Oh well. . ."Zombieland" is a nice place to visit. If you plan to stay, plan to have lots of guns and ammunition, follow Columbus's rules and have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to nut up or shut up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good zombie flick with some humor thrown in, in fact it's basically a zombie road movie. It was fun from the beginning with the flashy opening to the end, with it's unique comical style and it even has a great cameo. Okay so the whole zombie apocalypse happens in Texas, from some sort of mad cow disease that spreads to everyone else. But the character that is focused on is Columbus played by Jesse Eisenberg, who everyone seems to call Michael Cera 2, and the main reason how he manages to survive for so long is cause he stays by these set of rules he abides by thanks to his phobias and nerdy lifestyle. But the real fun begins when Columbus teams up with Tallahassee(Woody Harrelson) who has no rules but the exterminate every zombie that gets in his way and his also has a obsession with twinkies. A bit of romance is thrown in as well with Wichita(Emma Stone) who has a sister named Little Rock(Abigail Breslin), I found these two girls pretty annoying throughout the movie and didn't agree with the knight in shining armor routine Columbus pulls near the end. But it led to some zombie mayhem so it's completely forgivable. The main complaint for me though, is that I actually wanted a bit more zombie mayhem in this but I guess I will have to wait for the sequel. Still a good zombie road movie, definitely worth checking out.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zombies can keep up the enthusiasm...why can't we?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I really liked this film. Well-paced and, in the end, folds with a healthy stack of chips on the felt. Just in time before the tables turn, I thought. "Nice job!" Still though, the movie illustrates a gripe I've had with the motif of the resulting production of what seems to be evidence of gestating talent at the helm. I'm talking SUSTAIN, people. There is the pure magic at the beginning of the film....the seduction, if you will. Those of us in the movie going world begging to be seduced WANT to be intoxicated and then sinfully transported into the same rapture promised in the throes of the seduction. To be blunt...we want a crescendo and then a earth rupturing climax, dammit! And why not? Millions of dollars were involved in the production, were they not? Where's the goddamn sustainable energy....enthusiasm.....unadulterated LUST that causes us to wiggle in our seats at the beginning...turn to our date and say, "OMG...this is gonna be GOOD!"? A movie rarely lives up to the initial thrust. Why is that? I don't get it. The inspirational juice is flowing at the beginning...why can't it flow right up to the end? It's just not fair.Same thing happens with Zombieland. The cinematic displayed action literally disinters us from reality so thoroughly, like the initial rush of an IV drug, I felt suspended right along with the time elapsed motion of the zombies and their exquisitely rendered panic-enslaved prey. It was perfect. Within a few moments, I felt the swoon and said, "Take me!"....that wonderful feeling while watching a film we're all familiar with. And then...the story unfolded...the character development amidst the motion of the plot. Don't get me wrong. There was novelty...enough to keep me alert and appreciative. But, it wasn't quite what was advertised, I'm afraid.It's so rare that a movie sustains a level of energetic edgy-ness. The kind of alpha-to-omega romp that has you walking to your car dazed with rumpled shirt tails hanging out and your hair messed up....with your cell phone in hand and the insurmountable desire to "kiss and tell".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland 2-4-10http://citizenchris099.blogspot.com/Zombieland is a really fun movie that I enjoyed a great deal...its just too damn short. After viewing it for the second time last night it occurred to me how brief the film feels. There is noting I would say is necessarily wrong with the overall pacing. Things aren't rushed and the narrative seem to flow well. So please don't misinterpret my comments as criticism per say. Nearly every beat of the film seems to land just right. The comedy is appropriate and not over done. Oh and did I mention its actually funny? Yeah that sorta helps doesn't it? The rules gimmick actually works and the way its integrated visually is quite clever. All said we have here the makings a of great..if not entirely too brief Zombie classic.</fullReview>

I found it very entertaining and although very predictable, it's a fun way to kill some time on a rainy day. Anyone who's a fan of zombie-killer console games will really appreciate this movie - I know my kids did.The bottom line is that it's a good movie to watch at least once.

		<fullReview>This movie oozes with epic zombieness!It was a movie that really grew on me. At first, I thought it stupid and unfunny, but later I got into it because of the characters and bloody/gory zombie kills. Woody Harrelson gives a standout performance as Tallahassee, a twinky addicted master zombie killer. Jesse Eisenberg also shines as phobia addled college student Columbus. Bill Murray also appears in a delightful cameo as himself. Zombieland didn't exactly change the entire zombie comedy sub genre like "Shaun of the Dead" did, but it is a cool, fun flick. It didn't have many laugh out loud moments, but it did have some clever bits of dialog and gruesome gags. So, while not straight up hilarious, it's worth a look if you're into zombie comedies or just want to see a movie that doesn't take the apocalypse very seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zom-Com road pic with a "first time this happened" moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First there was The Return of the Living Dead (1984). I thought nobody could make a funnier Zom-Com (Zombie-Comedy) than Dan O'Bannon's opus back then. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright proved me wrong when they made Shaun of the Dead nearly two decades later. Again, I thought nobody could top the Zom-Com hilarity in Shaun. Well, what do ya know? Ruben Fleischer and his writers didn't exactly prove me wrong this time but I must say Zombiland is just as funny and witty as Shaun. What the film impressed me most was "the first time this happened in movies" moment. Even in the most entertaining flicks, that happens so rarely nowadays, but Zombieland provided me with that moment with a vengeance. (To talk about it will undoubtedly spoil a plot element so PLEASE DON'T READ FURTHER if you haven't seen the film yet!) That moment involved the "mystery guest" and never in my life have I laughed so hard at a lovable character's tragic death scene like a maniac. Neither I recall a moment in cinematic history (not that I've watched all the movies ever made) where the "killer" and the "killed" are both so adorable. I consider that alone a huge accomplishment. After all, I wasn't laughing at James Karen's death scene in The Return and neither at Bill Nighy's in Shaun.</fullReview>

Stone and Breslin are delightful as sister team Wichita and Little Rock, and Eisenberg is affable as "Columbus" (I guess he's the casting alternative if Michael Cena isn't available to play the geeky, phobic boy type), who narrates the movie, describing life in Zombieland as well as some of the all-important rules, such as Rule #2 - Double Tap. However, Woody Harrelson's "Tallahassee" made this movie for me. His manic energy makes his part lovable yet scary -- look for all the references to movies his character makes. Great stuff! Bill Murray makes a cameo appearance, although - to his credit - that monstrosity is NOT his mansion (it belongs to some real estate tycoon in the Buckhead district of Atlanta, GA). There are some wonderful montages of scenes where the undead (from all walks of life) chase the living (ditto) and there's the subtle underscore of social commentary you can pick up on if you're looking. But don't work too hard on it - it's a Zomb-edy! Remember - Rule #32: Enjoy the little things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will draw obvious comparisons to 'Shaun of the Dead' because it was more-or-less the first commercially successful zombie/comedy movie. It's like all bands coming out of Ireland being compared to U2, due solely to popularity. Maybe they weren't the first or the best, but they had the most ticket sales and notoriety and that holds sway with casual fans.Now, Shaun of the Dead is actually a great film with more subtle British humor, with some blatant gore thrown in for comedic effect. Zombieland has substantially more gory effects and that's just the opening credits.In Zombieland, the zombies weren't much different than other cannibalistic ghouls you've seen in other incarnations, other than they were of the very fast-moving type. Wherein the characters in Shaun of the Dead's confrontations with the undead were done in self-defense, there was a cold, taunting meanness in Zombieland which to me seemed to hearken back to the the Night of the Living Dead series. This is not a criticism at all, because Woody Harrelson delivering a smashing head blow with a banjo is hilarious, it's just an observation. I don't harbor any sympathy towards zombies since they're just flesh-eating automatons that just happen to inhabit your grandmas, sisters, pastors, etc.'s body.There is a lot more action than Shaun of the Dead, although not as much as in some of George A. Romero's works. It seems to have a pretty good balance between gore, humor and the human condition and the main characters have interesting back stories to boot. It was a very diverse cast, along with one cameo which came to be a big surprise to those of us who hadn't seen the film yet.All in all a very good movie, but the blood spatter might turn some off who were hoping to see a purely humorous movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the kind of movie that you watch and it gives you a strange feeling, a feeling that makes you say "awesome".When it comes to jokes the movie becomes very spontaneous and it succeeds in every way. The kind of nonsense and stupid-people comedy makes this one of the most hilarious films ever.The acting is perfect for the humor and the drama in the film. And so is the directing.Sure it does have horrifying images and situations. But it doesn't matter because its used for fun.The climax has most of the fun.The movie proves that zombies are still fun. A few years from now this one will be known as a classic.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombie land (2009)starring Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee; a tough guy, a zombie hater and a zombie killer since the death of his son, he met Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) on the road. A guy who lives on his own wishing to have a family and to have a girl whom he will touch her hair and kiss her. He is the loser guy here, he's UN-confident and for him living in the zombie land must have rules to survive. On their to escape to the zombie land, they encounter the swindler and deceptive sisters who stole their car and guns which happens 3 times. It's Emma Stone (Wichita/krista) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock). On their way, they've rely on each other to fight the zombies and eventually leads them to enjoy each others company and found a family with each other.This movie just became my favorite Horror Comedy movie of the decade.The story was very interesting and most unique. They present a different angle on a zombie movie as well on the horror and romantic movie. It is a combination of comedy, drama, horror, suspense, romance, and everything else, what can I say.This is such a superb movie, everything fits well.The cast and crew really blends well, Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone made such great chemistry.The plot line is great.Everything...A very funny movie, very excellent.Worth watching for even a thousand times.To the director, producer, writer, cast, and crew: JOB WELL DONE! TWO THUMBS UP! *cheers fellas!* +++</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The introduction welcomes the viewers to "The United States of Zombieland." It never is clear is this affliction is just the USA, or all of the world. However I do know that a "Zombieland 2" is in the works, IMDb tells me so.As we learn during the movie, the 20th century "mad cow disease" becomes the plague of the 21st century. It becomes "mad person disease", which eventually leads to "mad zombies." So we meet up with Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee and Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus. To try to stay impersonal and increase their chances for individual survival they refer to themselves as their cities of origin. The journey begins in Texas, Austin to be exact, and along the way mentions Waco, but all the town and road scenes not in L.A. were actually filmed in Georgia.These two encounter Emma Stone as Wichita and Abigail Breslin as her 12-year-old sister Little Rock. At first they are at odds with each other but end up banding together to survive as a group.They travel west because the girls want to visit an amusement park in L.A. But tired, they first look for a place to sleep and Tallahassee brings them to Bill Murray's mansion, thinking it to be empty. But they find Bill Murray there, playing Himself.Each time the group of 4 get somewhere they encounter anywhere from a few to a large band of zombies, all trying to catch and eat them. There are some very gruesome and graphic scenes of zombies eating uninfected humans, or zombies being killed.There is a running theme of Tallahassee craving and stopping at places to get some Twinkies. And eventually Columbus begins to get sweet on Wichita. But for the most part the movie is "over the top" comic situations, with Tallahassee relishing his expertise as a "zombie killer." (In an earlier role he was a "Natural Born Killer.") I enjoyed it as light, mindless entertainment, but it is nothing more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a film that would make George Romero proud.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a big fan of Romero's work for at least 20 years. While "Zombieland" is a humorous film, it still instills the Romero subtext. In this film, the paranoia, definitely shines, very "Day Of The Dead", like. One very good cameo proves that. All in all, I think this film is a great Zomedy. Right up there with "Shaun Of The Dead", but this is much different. Kudos to the film-makers, this one has Cult-Classic all over it. The semi-star studded cast is brilliant in every way of the word. I thought this film was a great piece of cinema. Woody Harrelson is great, Jesse Eisenburg is surprisingly awesome and Emma Stone is incredibly lovable. This is a great Zombie film, but it still realizes human relationships, amidst Armagedeon. The true greatness of this film is human relationships.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but I expected more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading such positive commentaries about Zombieland, I was very interested in watching it.However, even though the movie ended up being entertaining and funny, I have to say that I expected much more from it.I liked the film Shaun of the Dead very much, and even though Zombieland pretends to occupy a similar niche, it is very far away from reaching that level of excitement, suspense and intelligence.However, it works well as a funny comedy disguised as a horror film, which provokes laughs not only because of the interaction between the characters, but also because of its interpretation of the zombie cinema.The screenplay shows a true affection for the horror genre, and it uses good part of its development to make a satire without any malice of the movies from the genre and its fans.Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin bring good performances, even though the characters they interpret are a bit hollow and generic.Columbus' personal story and his difficulty to interact with the rest of humanity work well as a reflexive analogy of modern world, where social and emotional isolation can be the best tools to survive.The background from the rest of the characters is not very good, and it goes from the predictable (a family tragedy in Tallahasse's past) to the forced (Why do the girls need so many tricks to get what they want?).I think that the film needed to go a bit further on that element.Another fail from Zombieland is its lack of "soul".I admit I had a good time watching it, and I liked the experience overall.However, there is no suspense, or danger sensation or anguish for the characters.The problem is that the dramatic level from the film feels cold and lacking of tension and real consequences.Even one of the most important deaths from the movie is used as a joke, instead of as a drama.Sure, I laughed on that moment, but it was another wasted opportunity to establish additional levels in the narrative which would have made of Zombieland something memorable or unique.In summary, I had a good time while I was watching Zombieland, but once it finished, my brain was already forgetting it.However, I think it deserves a recommendation, mainly because it is entertaining and it offers good moments of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Zombie Flick Till Date...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ruben Fleischer's Masterpiece 'Zombieland' is undoubtedly the Best Zombie Flick Till Date! I don't remember being so, so ,so entertained in a film! Paul Wernick Rhett Reese, the writers of 'Zombieland' are geniuses! The word Zombie petrifies people, but in 'Zombieland' they try their best, but our Hero Tallahassee played by America's first cult star Woody Harrelson beats them to death. 'Zombieland' is funny, brutal, gory, &amp; clap-trap. The climax at a theme park, is full-on.... one of the best climaxes ever! Coming to acting, Woody Harrelson is my favorite actor, right now. De Niro, Pacino, Michael Keaton, Jim Carrey, Dustin Hoffman, Tim Robbins &amp; now Woody Harrelson. His outstanding portrayal proves what he is! Jesse Eisenberg acts &amp; narrates wonderfully. Emma Stone looks a million bucks, and performers, as expected, superbly. Abigail Breslin is just getting better &amp; better with every release. An Icredible Performer! Bill Murray stands out in a brief role.'Zombieland' rocks...... Reccmended for all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining movie to enjoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is a movie that combines horror (although it doesn't scares), comedy, with a lot of black humor, action and adventure. The story focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies. Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies. It doesn't shows us anything new and it is a little predictable but at the same time it is funny and entertaining. It never gets tiresome because of it fast paced rhythm. The music is excellent and the make up design is very convincing. The cast is good. Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee makes a good performance, he is very funny, Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus is quite decent, Emma stone is Wichita and Abigail Breslin is Little Rock, they are also very convincing but the best one of all was Bill Murray in his short appearance as himself, the 15 minutes he is in the movie are hilarious and they really worth it. As a conclusion, Zombieland is a movie which only purpose was to entertain and make people enjoy and spend a really good time and I think it accomplishes it in a very good way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the beginning of the movie three times before going on with the rest. The beginning is beautiful. Loved the opening and then it continues to the slo-mo credits with Metallica rocking in the background.. Couldn't take my eyes off.Then it goes on with pretty standard plot - a nerd, a lone wolf, a cute chick, a bit of romance.. The characters are simple, but likable. There's not much to act for Harrelson, but he looks fine (nothing outstanding though). An episode with Murray is great, maybe the best of the rest (as I mentioned, the beginning is unreachable). Just a few stupid moments when it comes to climax - that much you could bear.It's a good movie, it actually is funny, all the blood (which there's plenty) fits alright, and the idea with the rules popping out is great.

From the first second this movie starts, I'm hooked. Enter The Coolness! With the BEST intro EVER seen in a movie. From that moment on, I knew I was in love with this film.I'll not elaborate on the story, because I feel that this is not the main aspect of the film. What really drives Zombieland is the coolness, the hilarious moments and the adrenaline pumping action.The first thing I wanted to do when the credits began to scroll, was get up from my couch, find myself a cast-iron skillet and run outside to smash some zombie brains!</fullReview>

How the kid goes through his rules of survival and introducing the characters. Very clever. After the first 40 mins or so I thought there was a huge change.I found it to be predictable, not as fun and just plain boring. I'll admit the Amusement Park showdown (the clown zombie) was fun, but just so predictable. I didn't like the cameo from Bill Murray either. I didn't like the way they just threw him in. They just pretty much said "Because it's Bill Murray and because he'll get shot it'll be funny", but it's not. I knew he was going to get killed minutes before he got killed. Second half: Predictable, but fun.All in all it's worth watching. All the acting was good. So, yeah, why not, check it out.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a reasonable amount of fun, I was put off a bit by Jesse Eisenberg acting like a complete ripoff of Michael Cera in this movie for an obvious attempt at some coat tail fame. However, the Michael Cera style of comedic delivery is still fun even when it's a ripoff. This movie has Jesse and Woody teamed up to try and survive. This is generally a dorky comedy with a reasonable level of intellect and creativity. They could have been a bit more edgy but as far as marketability to the unjaded non-sentient masses this movie should be a big homerun.We've seen the plot several times before - Zombie Apocalypse.. this is a lighter/funnier but equally gory handling of the topic.Loses a point for being a Michael Cera comedy style ripoff.</fullReview>

Zombieland is a horror/black comedy that is never truly scary or funny but stays in between. There's a lot of gore, violence,action, strong language and even a little bit of romance. There's the occasional laughs but more so because of the stupidity and absurdity of some of the scenes instead of deliberately funny situations. The main strength of Zombieland is probably the dialog, always sharp and never sappy as it usually is in this genre. There are also a couple of visual gags and spoofs of other films that will make you smile and put you in a good mood.The actors were all well cast with Woody Harrelson shining the most as Tallahassee, the redneck ace vampire killer. Certainly, a huge improvement from his latest comic role in Roland Emmerich's 2012. Bill Murray has a small cameo but it seemed a bit pointless and just something to fill in some time. Overall, Zombieland is a very entertaining and fun fast-paced film and a good debut by director Ruben Fleischer, just not the amazing film people are making it out to be.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the trailers online for "Zombieland" I was expecting a good film, similar in style to the British Zombie comedy "Shaun of the Dead" which i love.I am also a big Woody Harrelson fan so I knew i would see this film at the movies upon it's release.Some of my friends got their hands on "pirated" versions via internet download which i refused to watch as I knew this would be a great cinema experience and prefer watching films i like on a big screen as apposed to a laptop one!I had heard good things about "Z-land" from those who had seen it so my expectations were fairly high but to my surprise, the film was even better than I was expecting!Thank god they didn't show all the best scenes in the trailer for this film and there were many surprises and hilarious scenes I didn't see coming!Like I said earlier, I'm a huge fan of "Shaun of the Dead" and didn't think "Zombieland" would be as good....but it really is in many ways equal in entertainment value to "Shaun" and is still different enough to feel fresh and original on it's take on Zombies and how the few remaining un-infected people deal with them.The cast is brilliant in this film and they all feel like genuine realistic characters. I love how the main "hero" of the story "Columbus" is a real wuss and totally not your typical heroic character. THAT role goes to Woody Harrelson who plays the part of a tough no "BS" character who's purpose on this planet is to rid it of Zombies and who's only weakness is for the delicious soft, creamy snack that is "Twinky"!!!No one else could have played that role but Woody, it's as if the role was written for him!All up, a great film with something for everyone in it not just Zombie or horror enthusiasts. There is lot's of intelligent comedy and a little romance thrown in for the women viewers too which is fortunate as I went with a female friend of mine who really enjoyed the film as well : )Great dialogue, great action sequences, great comedic scenes and a very memorable cameo by a certain Hollywood star which I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet....but it's a great few scenes with an hilarious finale!!!So if you liked "Shaun of the Dead" or just comedies or Zombies in particular, "Zombieland" is a must see film which should not be missed!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations for this film given it's extraordinarily high ranking on IMDb for its genre. Slick horror/zombie usually rates significantly lower mainly because it's not a crowd pleaser and secondly doesn't have the budget to pump the ratings.That's said, the production values of this film are high. Opening titles are splendid. The character introduction is amusing but then about 30 minutes in - the film loses its way and gets bogged down in a feeble teenage-never-been-kissed-virgin-guy vs bad-girl-with-a-shotgun sub-plot. Zombies are nowhere to be seen and it feels like a bunch of sitcom writers were hired to script a lot of forced humour. The scenes including Bill Murray's mansion and smashing up the Indian souvenir shop are just fillers. The crescendo in the amusement park is lame and predictable.If you are a zombie film fanatic - this film is definitely worth a watch. It tries to be original but I just can't but feel that a lot of this film was left on the cutting room floor.</fullReview>

He meets up with three others, and together they fight their way through a constant stream of zombies.This is a well written story, full of humour mixed with absolute gore and carnage.From the outset, there is completed action, without the story slowing down, even for a minute. When you least expect it - there are more zombies.Bill Murray, places himself, and is excellent. A really funny guy. One of his best parts in a long time.The zombies are the fast running kind, who can climb fences and ladders. They are some of the best zombies I have seen.The photography and special effects are first rate, as humans and zombies meet their messy ends.The script has many great lines, and links to many movies.This movie is not for the faint hearted, but if you can bear the gore, you will love the humour.Cannot wait for Zombieland 2!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I attended a preview of 'Zombieland' this evening and was very impressed. I tried not to spoil myself much beforehand, so pretty much all I knew was that there were zombies and it was a horror-comedy. Of course, this immediately brings 'Shaun of the Dead' to mind, so I was hoping I wouldn't compare them TOO much and end up being disappointed. I need not have worried. This is a genuinely funny film with plenty of blood and guts to satisfy the horror fan as well.Woody Harrelson is absolutely fantastic in this. Seriously, about 95% of my favourite moments involved him. The rest of the cast is good as well, though, with Emma Stone getting a special mention for also looking great! Look out for a certain extended cameo, as well, which pretty much steals the show. All in all, it's a really fun film.

It is a wonderful black comedy, so much so, that you will be hard pressed to predict moment after moment.Seldom is violence so entertaining. Other than Nazis, zombies are the perfect enemy. They live, only to kill, completely devoid of any positive trait. So, watching shot after shot of zombies getting their comeuppance is satisfying on a colossal scale. The main characters (played by Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin) are constantly finding new ways to kill, dismember, squash, and destroy zombies. And watching it done has never been so enjoyable. Sure, at times the violence is for comedic effect, but elsewhere in the film it is used as a release from a genuinely tense chase scene.Furthermore, this means the movie is genuinely scary. This is not just a hack remake of the same thing we have seen a thousand times before. This is fully new and inventive. From moments full of heart pounding tension to moments that make you jump, the movie does not disappoint. There were several audible gasps, screams, and guffaws from the audience throughout the film.Also, seldom do you find a touching love story in a zombie movie. Since, zombies, by their very nature are thoughtless, irrational creatures that are void of any emotion other than rage; you would not expect any hint of a romantic storyline. Furthermore, most zombie movies are hell bent on inspiring fear. So, to find an emotion connected to a zombie film that is even remotely connected to an inspiring heartfelt one is almost absurd to imagine. Yet, they are able to create one here. I give total kudos to writers, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who so poignantly point out the true difference between the walking dead and us as humans. In a world where zombies live to destroy and kill, we as humans still live to connect and build.Finally, it's nice to see Woody Harrelson back on the big screen in a role that allows him to play cocky, brutish, and stupid: three characteristics worthy of "Zombie Killer of the Week". Eisenberg also steps up his game, proving that he is equal to his more popular twin Michael Cera.While some may say that the zombie genre is overdone, I say as long as there are new and inventive ways to kill zombies, I'll keep watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great special effects and more braveness than ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe this movie is different from the ones i've seen before. It has that click which gives to the horror lover the satisfaction that will make him or her dreaming totally about this movie. Even though some scenes are too exaggerated by the mean that when zombies are eating human the flesh from the bite seems like rubber rope. Another fact is that Tallahassee, in the person of Woody Harrelson, has a passion, more an obsession for the Twinkie cake. I've seen recently an episode of Family Guy from season 2, located in year 1999 or 2000, which has the same obsession for the main character, Peter, as Woody, here in the movie. I believe that this is a little uninspired directing, because copying something it's just bitter. Anyways, i liked the movie in a whole and the female existent actresses are very sweet, especially Abigail Breslin, who at 13 looks very cute and i hope in future she'll become a very good actress.</fullReview>

I also wish Bill Murray ate someone.An amusement park and zombies? WOW who thought of that? That was pure freaking genius!It is right up there with Sean of the Dead. So much fun and so much gore and yes, I was scared a few times, which says a lot since I love horror movies. These are my favorite type of horror movies too. I don't like Saw movies and I don't like those awful twlight crappy movies, but this type of movie is what makes me a horror fan. Me like a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, clever but somehow unfulfilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i went into this movie i had read the IMDb reviews and checked out the rating, so i guess in a sense i was walking into this movie with some average to somewhat good expectations, however as good as this movie is in terms of humor and wit it still didn't fulfill me in the way that i had expected in the beginning. This movie is similar to the movie burn after reading in the sense that after one watches it kind of slides to the back of your head and you'll either forget it or it wont really have a great impact on your life, which i guess is the aspect i was expect and missed out on. It is however humorous and one is placed in a world where zombies are normal and survival is part of every day life, and i guess they make life and death a joke in the way they play it out and the script itself. It was extremely short, and i also didn't enjoy that aspect, i guess then again there is nothing more to add to the film that wasn't shown already i mean you can only show so much in a world filled with zombies, when there is no true back-story to how it happens and unfolds, but nonetheless i believe there weren't enough violent scenes as well scenes that really put me on the edge of my seat. I will suggest seeing this as it is something new and intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy entertainment without a message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some fun watching this movie as it works as a horror comedy, but at the same time lately I feel guilty giving this kind of movie a high rating. There's just nothing new to be added, instead, the same plot elements get further condensed and reduced every time, like a new snapshot of a well-know monument.The thing is that people apply the same rating for different kinds of movies. I gave this one a 7 for good but mindless entertainment, but it can't be helped that it will rank there on the same level as other movies which get a 7 for being cinematic-ally or plot-wise interesting. That's just the way it goes. Comedies that the broad public enjoys as funny are usually not clever at the same time, or would you rate American Pie as a cinematic masterpiece? At least Zombieland also worked on the character level so you could identify with the main characters (yes, that's you, nerd).While I have the impression that the bar is constantly being lowered plot-wise these days and plot is being replaced by violence, grossness or any other kind of exaggeration, I also notice that due to the shorter attention span of the twitter generation the run time of movies gradually gets shorter. This one was over just after 80 mins, the rest was credits (and an outtake). And speaking of exaggeration, I also felt that the Bill Murray cameo was exaggerated, the same has been done before, also with Bill Murray as the supposed center of a film cult.As the philosopher said, every nation gets the president it deserves and the audience gets the movies they deserve... and pay for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but where are the zombies?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time and for the most part it is good. The comedy is quite clever, what little gore there is is good, the acting is OK (Woody Harrelson is excellent). The story could be better but i found the two girls tedious and annoying. You can always trust a chick to get in the way of a decent horror flick. But OK this is a zombie film so let's not look too deep into this. It is fun but my one big gripe is that with the exception of the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes there are very few zombies at all. It's mostly them just driving along with no view of the living dead in sight and we get to Bill Murray's mansion with no view of the living dead in sight, OK the zombies are in it now again but the zombies might as well have been the cameo instead of Bill Murray. If i watch a movie called Zombieland i expect to see a load of zombies throughout.Otherwise this is a fun, cheesy and stupid horror flick that relies on pretty much Woody Harrelson to carry it which he does well. I give it an 8 because i'm a total zombie fan but if this was as good as the rating it has on IMDb i would have easily have given it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sound but far from amazing comedy horror affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels curmudgeonly to damn a film like this with faint praise, so loved does it seem to be by many, but much as I found it a perfectly watchable slice of easygoing entertainment, it certainly didn't leave me that shaken or stirred. Set after the apocalypse, with zombies roaming the land and few human survivors, it sees a young and hardy geeky type team up with a zombie busting badass on a trip cross country, as the former wishes to find his family and the latter just wants to find some Twinkies, his favorite childhood snack. Along the way they encounter a fair number of zombies, a couple if smart and duplicitous sisters and one inspired celebrity cameo. Things roll along easily, there are a few laughs, some likable entertainment and a meh finale. As our young greenhorn hero Jesse Eisenberg walks a knife edge between sympathetic and irritating, sometimes the former, sometimes the latter he does OK but isn't much of a central figure to pin the film on. Woody Harrelson does far better as the enthusiastic lone wolf he hooks up with, with plenty of good lines, a tough attitude and an endearing flair for zombie slaying. Then we have Abaigail Breslin (of Little Miss Sunshine fame) and sweet looker Emma Stone as the two sisters that get involved and they do OK, although I never really found either character especially well drawn. My main problems with the film were its charm offensive style and its lack of anything much in the horror department. It did best with its production design from Maher Ahmad, for the landscape did look suitably wrecked and deserted, but otherwise the film faltered. Director Ruben Fleischer has a knack for easy humour and fast flowing fun, but the film has no suspense, no sense of desolation or trepidation, not even an appropriate poignancy for the setting. One would imagine there might be more emotional heft to a film with only a tiny handful of living left after the zombie apocalypse, but no dice here. Apart from a little smattering of bloody doozies there isn't very much gore and the zombies are a slightly weak foe, lacking the fear factor of traditional zombies or the relentless savage vigour of latter day ones. As for being on a charm offensive, well the film feels like its really trying hard throughout, its fine tuned and feels like its constantly scrabbling for likability, but after a pretty fine opening this tactic felt too blatant to me, so I couldn't really buy it. Its humour was never quite cutting or imaginative enough and its characters never quite gelled sufficiently to paper over the cracks. Also, unlike most of the great zombie films, this one deals in a lightweight conservative attitude that hits particularly in the end and somewhat infuriated me. Despite all its problems I still had a decent enough time with this one. Its pace is effortless, Woody Harrelson is terrific and Emma Stone makes for some endearingly tough eye candy. Its few grisly moments are nicely placed and satisfying and there are some neat moments of ingenuity, as well as writing that carries just enough laugh out loud lines to keep the film going OK. The earlier mentioned cameo is terrific, making for the most entertaining section of the film and when the film is simply aiming for comedy it hits pretty nicely at times. Altogether though, I can't quite get on the love train for this one. Maybe I'm too old and quite possibly it would have been better had I watched it with friends and liquid refreshment, but much as it was solid stuff with some sparkles of joy, I just didn't think it was that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been more, and a bit of a letdown afterwards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Zombieland is that the movie has nothing really to offer. The beginning promises a lot of gore, humor, and action that the movie never lives up to. What we have here is a coming-of-age movie that has nothing to offer except some occasional gore, a few good half-crafted ideas, and a lot of filler that's interrupted by an amusing cameo by Bill Murray. The cameo's appeal is how it comes completely out of nowhere and works, but you have to slog through a lot of exposition about the characters that is occasionally interrupted by zombies.And that's the problem: this movie attempts to do Shaun of the Dead but replaces the characterization within that with one-dimensional Hollywood cutouts. This is the fatal flaw: we are then stuck with these characters driving through massive areas of empty space interacting with each other and the audience yawning, kicking back, and trying to stay awake towards some sort of action-packed finale. The pacing is awful in this film and the movie could be cut by half an hour and not miss anything. Also, the lead character is essentially worthless and annoying. The last thing a zombie movie needs is a nebbishy loser type who claims some experience as a zombie fighter yet wields the worst sort of weapon to fight legions of zombies with. The ironic attempt to speak to the audience is possibly one of the most annoying things I've ever seen in film and should have been cut out of the script immediately.If you want a good zombie action movie, you won't find it here but you'll find some good gore effects and Woody Harrelson actually works on a good level here. It might make for a good intermission in a zombie marathon, but the movie won't stick with you. Outside of the Murray cameo and the gore effects, the movie is essentially forgettable and that's really a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twinkies aren't the only that survive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is first off, and I am so happy to say this, not a Shaun of the Dead rip off. While the two are arguably two of the best zombie movies to date and comedy oriented, they are two separate humors in their own glory. This also has set a new standard in reviewing, I found it quite difficult for how unique it truly was.What you can expect from the trailers and the descriptions, Zombieland is largely based on the comedy at the expense of zombies. Woody in this movie plays a no talent renegade--though everyone is in this world--who finally did find a one talent--killing zombies. He makes it a point and what seems like a goal for the most creative ways of killing zombies. One notable scene is when he lures zombies out, in the hopes of snagging Twinkies, with a banjo. I won't go into further detail, but you can use your vivid imagination until you see the movie.No zombie movie, regardless of horror or comedy, is complete without a set of survivors. Each is represented by their territory, all with a cause and purpose to band together to survive. As noted before, I don't want to reveal too much since this is a movie that is meant to be seen, not relayed through words. While you will not see too much of gore or anything stomach churning, there is plenty to keep the more than casual blood fan satisfied. Another thing you will notice, again comparing Shaun to this, is there is a lot of humor to be found here despite the setting. Anything from Twinkie searching to creative zombie killing, and even a special cameo who some will be quite amazed by. Overall, without wanting to reveal too much and let you just simply know that as an avid zombie fan, I couldn't be more happy with this movie. Those who want a traditional zombie experience, with humor and logic, with some very unique settings, this movie is a must see. Definitely one of the best of the year, if not, all time movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering I am not really a hardcore fan of zombie movies I thought to give this movie a try.I also have to admit there were a few actors in the movie that I have previously seen in other movies that I have enjoyed so that is why I leaned on the whole "yes,I will see this".First off if you don't like a little gore and blood this movie isn't for you. If you like cheesy gory fun with some twisted humor thrown in well this movie just might be for you.The movie itself is( I am not going to spoil it for you) about some people trying to stay alive and stay away from zombies and of course kill them. I found that the actors such as Woody,Jesse and the others were did a good job. I must say that Bill Murrays cameo did it for me.That was a hilarious scene/part all together. If you are a fan of Bill you have to check it out also...and then there were the twinkies.A good zombie flick for zombie lovers.I would recommend to others to view. It was really an interesting and fun adventure.</fullReview>

It's got humor and the acting is OK. After the movie ended though, I thought, "Is that it?" There is no goal or plot in this film. Just randomness. The whole time I'm watching it I want to see the movie take off in some direction but nothing really meaningful happens. There's a classic damsel in distress ending where the hero(s) come in and save the day but everything leading up to that point seemed unguided and not well thought out. It could have been organized a little better that's for sure. It's a funny movie but I think it's safe to say I'm never watching this again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As some of the other scores and critics have clearly indicated, this is a movie that you will either love or hate. There doesn't seem to be much in-between. Personally, I thought the movie was lacking in several aspects. First, it wasn't that funny. As a matter of fact, I thought the entire scenario with Bill Murray was incredibly simplistic and a waste of time. It was simply awful. Likewise, there was absolutely no chemistry between the characters. Woody Harrelson (as "Tallahassee") showed no personality while Emma Stone (as "Wichita") was dull and uninspired. They're better actors than that and their talents were wasted. Further, the character of "Little Rock" (Abigal Breslin) was totally unnecessary and she seemed to drag the picture down with her. About the only good thing was the acting of Jessie Eisenberg (as "Columbus") who was likable but couldn't carry the movie all by himself. Again, the plot was jumbled and nothing really came together. At any rate, those viewers who wish to watch this movie can decide for themselves. They should know whether they like it or not by the end of the first 30 minutes or so. It doesn't get any better or worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong and poignant characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of my favourite movies yet. Admittedly, I am not a big fan of the whole zombie thing - zombies are genuinely scary creatures, even in movies which use them for slapstick, like this one. But this one definitely ranks high. Not because of the plot, but rather because of the characters. It easy to see how the survivors survived - Columbus was smart, physically fit and very easily scared, Tallahassee was resourceful and fearless, Wichita and Little Rock were crafty and didn't trust anyone. So they make quite a team. But it's the inner personalities of the characters that matter. Columbus' life used to be so empty and meaningless that he was almost like a zombie himself before the invasion took place. Underneath Tallahassee's rough, fearless exterior is the kind and tender father he once was. Despite Wichita's cunning and cleverness, she is still a goodhearted person who empathises with Columbus for his loss. And despite Little Rock's own cunning and tough exterior, she still occasionally lets her inner child escape her - from not knowing who Gandhi and Bill Murray are, to getting genuinely scared when Tallahassee so easily overpowers her. Sometimes, even if the plot makes little sense, one can still argue that it's the development of these characters that is part of the plot. And on that note, the plot flowed very smoothly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies are not scary anymore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when humanity roamed naked on the surface of the Earth. There was a time when every syllable that poured out of a semi-clothed lunatic's mouth became a word of the almighty. And there was a time when zombies were actually scary. But why delve in the past? Now is not that time. Walking nude of the streets has been banned by law, lunatics are stashed in asylums and zombies have become the third funniest things in the world, after glittering vampires and Justin Bieber's puberty talks. Zombieland is based on the latter, not his puberty talks of course, but funny zombies. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a lone man walking through a zombie apocalypse, accompanied by his ever faithful double-barreled shotgun. He has a set of survival rules ('#3 Beware of bathrooms', '#17 Don't be a hero,' '#21 Avoid strip clubs'; to name a few) that he scrupulously follows. They don't do much except keep him alive. He meets another survivor Tallahassee - a brutal, powerful, hulk of a man - who gets sadistic pleasure in kicking zombie arse. Though he is not particularly fond of Columbus, they strike a friendship of sorts, united by a common goal of not ending up as zombie-food. He decides to drive Columbus to Columbus, where the latter wants to find his family. One their way they meet Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), the former a beautiful twenty-year old and the latter a mean little bitch; both con-sisters. Columbus falls in love, things become screwy, zombies get mashed up and everyone goes home happy and satisfied.The movie does not rely too heavily on its plot (when have zombie movies ever?), but scores high on execution. Despite being set in a grim, dystopian atmosphere, comic-timing is one of the highlights of the film. Zombieland doesn't weigh itself down with the bulk of making a zombie- flick; it does quite the contrary. Humans have always maintained a soft spot towards seeing creatures they abhor be ridiculed and maimed. The movie exploits this well, much to its benefit. With witty dialogues and adroitly done action sequences - where zombies are shot in the head, face, gut, groin and otherwise blasted to the moon - it is difficult to suppress laughter every few minutes. Though the humour is inclined towards the slapstick side, it is funny in every sense of the word.The acting is brilliant with Eisenberg proving his mettle as an upcoming actor (he later delivered a superb performance in The Social Network). He befits the lead role with perfection; as a coulrophobic, cynical and klutzy nerd with an awkward gait. His list of life-savers accounts for much of the laughter and as he stumbles through the mayhem, often saving his neck by mere inches, you can't help but marvel at his performance. Woody (the second-best Woody I know) Harrelson as Tallahassee is a hard man with a soft centre. He despises - nay, that would be an understatement - unabashedly and wholeheartedly hates zombies; an idiosyncrasy that is later attributed to the loss of a loved one at their hands. He is to the zombies what Blade was to the vampires. However, making plant manure out of zombies is not his only purpose in life. The thing he wants in the whole wide world is Twinkies, and whoever comes between him and a Twinkie is dead meat.The action and special effects are realistic, to say the least. The zombies look and do a convincing job of being blood-thirsty freaks and certain moments, when they materialize out of nowhere manage to make the viewers jump in their seats. The zombie-slaying, gore and erupting bodies all make it visually appealing. And the fact that the undead are not their usual snail-paced selves, but rather surprisingly agile for their reputation makes the chases and fight sequences even more exciting.The middle, however, suffers from a drag. The director (Ruben Fleischer) tries making the movie into a rom-com-zom; with emphasis on the rom. It seems uncalled for, because the relentless blood-baths suited my taste better. And just when I was about the chop another star from the movie, much like a zombie's head, in came Bill Murray; a man whose mere presence on the screen evokes ebullience. His splendid cameo saved the star and also proved that some actors never become too old to make one laugh.You have to feel for the unfortunate, undead bastards. From being one of the most feared and disgusting fictitious creatures, they have been made into a juvenile joke. They are still as ugly as ever, with skin peeling off, rotting brains and organs ready to fall, yet they no longer inspire fear. They are also stupid as a donkey's testicles, but you can't blame them. Their brains are cross-wired and it's hardly their fault that they cannot differentiate between a dildo and a shotgun. Tallahassee repeatedly bludgeons through their hordes. They get shot, crushed, squashed, run over, whacked, decapitated and otherwise beaten up so much that you actually feel sympathetic towards them. You can empathize, because in a way they are just hungry creatures and humans are their food.If you agree with the above lines, I think you should consider getting a check-up done. Zombies are bad. They deserve to die. Zombieland does just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of waste potential.. it's no Ghostbusters, unfortunately...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that Sony wanted to play safe with a very small budget and that explains why it was a box office flop. This movie had a lot of potential actually, the CGI and actions scenes are quite good BUT it's like No Ordinary Family TV series.. it's a mixture of different genres without being either one or the other and the mix fails to work as expected.This movie needed a big enemy. It needed better jokes. Why waste Bill Murray like that if there was no actual threat to characters? The ending battle was just so easy.. the whole movie looked too easy...It would have been enough to have some unfriendly guys trying to kill them, rape the girls and so on... even with jokes and it would have had a clear meaning.... the product would have been sound that way.It's really sad to see a movie that had so much potential being wasted like that. This movie really could have become the new Ghostbusters if they tried better or it could have been a very good horror with jokes ... but unfortunately it isn't.It just seems an unfinished script, it's unfinished business.. it seems to be based on a draft for a better movie.. this movie just looks incomplete. Good cast, good CGI and action scenes.. all wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard many compare this film as the American Shawn of the Dead. And while the idea seems to be comparable, the differences is what makes Zombieland a more pleasurable movie. The film chugs along at a nice pace for most of the time, and when it does stutter, it's not long before we are watching the creative ways in which Harrelson decides to kill the flesh eaters. There's a wonderful cameo in here and the film is picked up with the set rules that Eisenberg has created. For the most part the entire cast and sequences made me laugh, but I couldn't help every once in awhile feel restless. Perhaps because there was no real story here. That the union between all the characters seemed unfleshed, to pardon a pun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland (2009)What a funny romp. Zombie movies are so mainstream now, this was inevitable, an end of the world zombie comedy. And it's pulled off with enough sassy, unexpected twists (and one spectacular guest star) you have to love it. I'm not sure why they had to include as much filler as they did, not just developing the romance (of course) but creating some dead time (very punny, I know). The movie could have been a flawless, fast, compact classic. If you can just bear with the doldrums, you'll see what a perfect pitch the rest of it has. Kudos to Woody Harrelson, as usual, and to his buddy, Jesse Eisenberg. Aimed at an adolescent crowd, and at those of us who haven't outgrown our adolescence, and so comically bloody, Zombieland will repulse some of you. Think of it as low farce, all makeup and clowning around. It is what it is, and as such is what it is very convincingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This started well, focusing on the characters who survived without showing 20 minutes of the descent into chaos. Woody Harrelson is quite good and clearly enjoying himself, there are a few laughs along the way and it (thankfully) doesn't try to completely ape Shaun of the Dead. However after a promising start it meanders along into a nonsensical ending. America's answer to Shaun of the dead - if this is your answer then you've misunderstood the question folks. Come on, you can do better than this.However ***SPOILERS*** He is a self-confessed geek who virtually lives in his room, so how would he cope with the big bad scary outside world when it's now populated with flesh-eating zombies, zombies who can run fast ? Rule 1: Fitness - for someone who spends his weekends playing games surrounded by the leaning tower of pizza boxes he's well able to run. This guy is too dumb to remember whether or not he left the car locked, he'd be eaten as an entrée before the fatties or he'd shoot his own foot off. They go into a shop, kill a few zombies and find two girls out back - how did they survive with no weapons ?Noise attracts zombies so you drive part-way across America to find a fun fair and then - power it all up - bright lights, noise, what do you thinks gonna happen ???Humvees get about 3 gallons to the mile, yet you choose THIS to drive ? You're in the US, there are cars everywhere, why choose this POS.Someone steals your car and abandons you to your fate, you somehow magically find them again (having just found another car with another arsenal of weapons) and they try rob you again. If you were worried about Zombies sneaking into you car surely you could, oh I don't know, lock the doors ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Die Laughing: The Deadly Art of Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Zombieland (2009) for the first time on DVD recently reminded me how tenuous the sub genre of horror comedy can be. While it seems ever more difficult to craft a horror movie that is actually scary and a comedy that is actually funny, some filmmakers willingly set themselves the task of combining the two opposing genres. In the case of Zombieland, though successful in box office terms, it fails as a sub genre candidate. It's really just a comedy with some outrageously gory FX, which are played as sight gags rather than shock moments. In my opinion, a successful horror comedy should be just that, the horror before the comedy. Some of the best horror films have often incorporated humour to ballast the terror. In many ways the throwing of the girl into the river by Frankenstein's monster had a degree of humour to it (it's sequel Bride Of Frankenstein (1935) may well be the first ever horror comedy) and films like Steven Spielberg's Poltergeist (1982) and Joe Dante's The Howling (1981) are punctuated with humour threw out, the later more darkly so. The same could be said for any number of stalwarts of the horror genre. An American Werewolf In London (1981), Re-Animator (1985), Piranha (1978), Fright Night (1985), Gremlins (1984) and Critters (1986) are just some that use the push-pull of horror and comedy, some weighted to one side more than the other. However none of this films forgot to be scary, even the more innocuous (dare I say cute) examples like Gremlins and its inferior doppelganger Critters, both had death, blood and an overwhelmingly multiplying menace. Perhaps Ghostbusters (1984) could be branded as the sub genre's greatest success. I don't think anyone would find Ghostbusters sitting in the horror section of their local video store (if you still go to one), it's definitely a comedy, but in a couple of scenes, we are reminded of the 'evil' our heroes are up against. The scene in which Sigourney Weaver's character is abducted, demon claws ripping from her couch, hell hound drooling at the ready, is definitely not played for laughs. There is a certain air of doom in Ghostbusters. While the characters deliver comic dialogue, we understand that the ghosts they are busting are nasty and that the events are spiralling towards some kind of apocalypse. The point being, the film is serious and scary when it needs to be, something Zombieland and many others didn't quite grasp. *SPOILER* Ironically Bill Murray makes a cameo in Zombieland, and the characters actually watch Ghostbusters, as if saying, "Hey, we love that movie and this is our version of it". Frankly, they have nothing in common and Bill Murray looks pained for the short scene he appears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate all zombie movies except Shaun of the Dead. Now I hate zombie movies except Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland. No other zombie movie has managed to make me feel so good and happy for having watched it. Production value, acting, humor, action, romance, bromance, cinematography, music, presentation, style, reference to pop culture, name the criteria, I love both movies on all levels. I am otherwise speechless and drooling at how good this movie was. And will be every time I'll be rewatching it with friends and by myself. Thank you for making me believe in Woody Harrelson again.Missing the number of lines necessary to make a review, unlike the very concise movie, I shall delve deeper into what has made it such a welcome blast in the face for me. The casting is superb. Aside the obvious thumbs up for the main cast and the triple hoorray for the surreally incredible cameo, every zombie and its victim is simply an amazing selection of vivid faces, making the opening sequence one of my favorites, along with those of Seven, Dead or Alive-Hanzaisha, and Watchmen. The zombie make-up is fantastic. Every new zombie flick seems to try a distinct look for its zombies, but fortunately this one backs up its efforts to make rotten flesh look fresh with a good plot and characters to love. Even the deleted scenes and promotional theatrical trailers in the special features expanded on the characters in completely hilarious directions. I especially love the deleted scene where the pasts of two of the protagonists are hinted/guessed at. It's a scene that is nice left out of the movie, yet must be seen to add another layer to every character involved. Just watch it. The promotional theatrical trailers give you a list of clips from the movie followed by the two main characters giving you zombie survival tips, and serve as great fillers. Very worthwhile.I can't wait to buy my own copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Zombieland"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to begin adversarial and maybe we can meet in the middle. I didn't love "Shaun of the Dead." There, I said it. Those still reading can only imagine my reaction then to the "Zombieland" trailer, which on every significant selling point seemed identical, without the novelty of having done it first. My primary objection to this burgeoning 'zomedy' genre is that its sense of humor hasn't been transgressive enough to match the post-apocalyptic setting. "Shaun" set every precedent for "Zombieland" to be a cutesy, inconsequential comedy chock full of gimmicky jabs at the expense of horror convention.So I hunkered down in an irritable cynicism when the film began building a catalogue of positive reviews. Rotten Tomatoes, Facebook feeds, and second-hand conversations all seemed to suggest my prejudice toward the film was unfounded. I saw it last weekend as part of a triple feature and was, admittedly, pleasantly surprised. It turns out "Zombieland" does employ a cutesy, inconsequential narrative, but its emotional and comedic core is every bit as distinct and charming as that of "Shaun of the Dead," but which, as I admitted, I didn't love to begin with.The screenplay for "Zombieland" is rife with seasoned surface-level details like zombie safety regulations and an intriguing character name template, but has a great big undercooked pink center. The structure doesn't have the snap of "Shaun," and the plot often feels tertiary to the disposable gags and the 'wouldn't-it-be-cool' set pieces. Certainly aimlessness is an appropriate feeling to elicit for a scenario in which any 'save-the-world' opportunity has long since expired, but it comes at the expense of the film feeling underwritten. As near as I can tell, three things happen over the paltry eighty minute running time: boy meets girl, boy and girl travel to surprise celebrity cameo's house, boy rescues girl from amusement park. And those aren't acts, they're scenes.Fortunately, the screenplay accounts for all but one of "Zombieland's" most-rotten blemishes. Besides green-lighting the irksome giant text espousing every survival tip that floats or crumbles or unfolds distractingly amidst several scenes, first-time feature director Ruben Fleisher performs his duties admirably in bringing the film to life, though was blessed by the natural chemistry of his leads. Woody Harrelson stars as Tallahassee, the Twinkie- obsessed badass, while Jesse 'For-The-Last-Time-I'm-Not-Michael-Cera' Eisenberg portrays the swooning, rule-keeping wimp, Columbus. "Zombieland" works as often as it does because of the classic dynamic pairing of these two.But I think the primary reason Fleisher's film has been so commercially successful, having already made back its 23 million dollar budget twofold, while other recent horror-comedy hybrids like "Drag Me to Hell," and "Grindhouse" have underperformed, is that his directorial sensibilities skew so comedic. A zombie may trigger a "Boo!" orchestral spike every so often out of obligation, but the undead don't pose any serious threat until the amusement park finale, and even then, "Zombieland" settles for a crowd-pleasing comedic outcome rather than what's logical, mature, or interesting.Nevertheless, I was won over, if just barely. "Zombieland" contains plenty to chuckle about, but its tonal levity unfortunately extends to the storytelling itself, and the credits roll leaving a sensation of benign indifference in their wake. To bring it back to fan-favorite, "Shaun of the Dead," which is a better-made film, unquestionably, it's my heretical opinion that "Zombieland" is just as funny. The films actually oddly compliment one another in their very English and very American takes on life after the living dead.And for "Zombieland," what's more American than the sequel? Bloggers are already atwitter over early talks of a follow-up, and as much as the idea disinterests me, I guess I have to give this one the benefit of the doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Written Specifically for Junior High Boys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, if you are not a Jr. High boy or have the shallow mentality of Jr. High boy, you won't think it rates the 7.8 that it has on the day of this writing. It seems to be the undeveloped plot version of an arcade shooting game about killing zombies. The plot doesn't make any sense from beginning to end and the characters have no depth or attachment to reality. The guest appearance of Bill Murry added nothing to the movie, but it did caused me to want to re-watch some of his hits. The zombies in the movie seemed to be anywhere and everywhere with no rhyme or reason and the very few remaining living people magically appeared to be living safely in the immediate vicinity and availability of the zombies. There was no sign of dead people, like they had magically been beamed up by space aliens, yet technology remained intact and working, even weeks after zombies were everywhere.I strongly recommend you miss this movie, unless you are doing a party for Jr. High boys or have a sick one at home, like I do.</fullReview>

Too much mad cow turned into mad human disease and the US of A has turned into Zombieland.Woody Harrelson is great and completely believable as the Zombie killer with a grin. As someone else mentioned, the weakest part of the movie is the girls and the difficulty a mostly male audience would have in sympathizing with them, especially after our two male heroes get duped twice by them.I thought the cameo was great and was very fitting. Definitely did not run too long and ended very appropriately.I gave it 10/10 because I honestly could not think of a way to really improve this movie.</fullReview>

Copious violence, including: boots to heads, bats to heads, double taps to heads, car doors to heads, Hummers driving over heads, and respectfully, God getting credit for creating rednecks and their back woods arsenals. It doesn't get much better than Woody Harrelson riding the roller coaster, wielding a pair of sub-machine guns, dropping zombies like he was a Blackwater Intern. Totally kick ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as hilarious or brilliant as many say but consistently amusing and entertaining (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The basic setup for this film sees us in familiar territory with a handful of survivors left in the middle of a world full of zombies since patient zero took their first bite out of a human, spreading the disease rapidly and totally. Young loner and geek Columbus has survived thanks to his strict rules of engagement and survival. On the road he meets and joins up with another survivor, Tallahassee, who is alive thanks to his inherent ability to kick ass and kill zombies. He also has a specific quirk as he is not so much looking for a way to rebuild humanity as he is looking for any surviving stocks of Twinky bars. The two meet two sisters during one such search but find that the zombies are only one of their problems.So far, so standard but Zombieland stands out in a very crowded genre by being consistently amusing and occasionally very funny indeed. The tone of the film has been compared to Shaun of the Dead by everyone and their dog so I suppose I should join them by agreeing to a point because at points it does have some very imaginative and rapid-fire gags (sight and dialogue based). However I don't think it is quite as good as it doesn't quite manage to spread the laughs consistently ? yes it manages to amuse consistently and for me that was enough but the bigger laughs tended to remind me that they were not as frequent as I would have liked. The plot is written to fit with the film as a comedy but at times it does slightly irritate because of how illogical the whole thing is ? having some of the silly aspects is fine but even within the internal logic of the film the fairground just doesn't make any sense at all.Of course it is just a silly film and this is what it is best to enjoy it as and the daft plotting doesn't spoil it all that much, just limits it as a film. I know there is already a sequel being planned and, as much as the plot could do with a bit more polish, it is the comedy where the film needs to step it up ? with the big laughs repeated and the amusing tone elevated to produce more good laughs. The cast is mostly reasonably good. Harrelson plays up to his character really well and his deadpan reactions to lines of others makes many scenes funnier thanks to his timing and delivery. Eisenberg is good once you try and get used to the feeling that the film couldn't afford Michael Cera. His narration and the use of his rules provide a good structure to the film. Stone and Breslin are both a little irritating as characters but they just about manage to be good enough in other ways to help cover up their characters. The cameo by Bill Murray was spoilt for me but it was still funny (even if it suffers from slightly illogical, clunky writing).Overall Zombieland is not a brilliant film by any means but it has a hatful of good laughs on a bed of consistently amusing material and tone. The gore is cartoony and not scary but the film is more of a comedy than horror so this is not a problem. Good enough to be worth a look and it made for an enjoyable 90 minutes mostly spent chuckling for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland A Funny Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is a funny horror comedy which turned out to be much better than I expected. Director Ruben Fleischer is admirable in making this movie about four people trying to survive an apocalyptic world that has been taken over by zombies. The film has a nice balance between character development, the humor, and the action which mostly involves the zombies getting killed in gruesome but hilarious ways. The cast are very impressive in their roles including Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin who seem to be having a blast in this movie. Harrelson and Eisenberg have great comic chemistry with each other. They played off one another very well which made their growing friendship believable. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are just as good as two smart sisters who reluctantly join Harrelson and Eisenberg on a road trip across the country. The four actors also played off each other well during their scenes together. With that said, Zombieland ended up being much better than I thought it was going to be and the film left me feeling entertained. I can see why a lot people and critics for the most part enjoyed it. There's a surprise cameo by a well known actor halfway through who makes the best of his small part. I can't really think of anything I didn't like about this movie. Zombieland has it all character development, plenty of humor, drama, and a little suspense with just enough zombie action. I'd recommend you see this without knowing too much about it because it might ruin the experience for you. Zombieland is a very funny horror comedy with impressive performances by the cast especially Harrelson and Eisenberg who make it an entertaining film to watch. You won't be disappointed with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland: Enjoy the Little Things</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone loves zombies, and writer's Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick realized this early. If you look at this years upcoming releases, you're going to notice that zombie flicks almost double vampire slasher flicks because of how the new generation has learned to write for them=. People like Simon Pegg and his "Shaun of the Dead", giving a bloody and satirical look on a 40-year-old industry opened windows and doors. "Zombieland" takes a page or two from Pegg's script and put it to good use, bringing a deliciously quick, gory, and comical look at the end of the world. Narrated by the lamest of heroes this side of "Archie", Columbus (jesse Eisenberg) dictates what has happened to the world, now considered "Zombieland." He explains how he has survived this desolate world, while trying to make it to his home in Ohio. Upon the way, he meets up with Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), blood thirst maniac that "is in the business of ass-kicking." After meeting up with two con artists, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigale Brinson), the four take a turn to a part in the East where it's said to be zombie free; an amusement park entitled Pacific Playland.On the one hand, the film follows every single premise that zombies flick has had since Romero put them down. Truthfully, there's little in the way of sidestepping gory deaths of characters or the undead, counting down who will die first, having the world completely overrun? you get the point. But where most try and make up for the same formula with cheap scares and pointless drama, "Zombieland" goes with its comedic acting and situations. The plot itself is loose enough to be right on the cusp of being pointless, with Columbus wanting his home, Tallahassee wanting his Twinkie, and the sisters getting to their painfully bad idea of Pacific Playland.Speaking of cast, Harrelson and Eisenberg create an interesting blend of neurotic and irritating that make you just giggle. With Eisenberg's character, everything is planned out: nothing is left to chance. Living by his own set of meticulous rules (Rule #3: Double-tap), he is one of the few people that you can look at and see that OCD really can work out somehow. Then Harrelson, in all of his gun-toting, bloodletting, and simplistic one-liners make the perfect bridge. They prey off each other's weaknesses so well for their jokes that it's like they were meant to be together, especially when it truly looks like Harrelson is getting annoyed while Eisenberg is looking for the upcoming punch. Yet a horror movie wouldn't be complete without a love interest. Wichita creates an interesting romance in the story, being the culmination of everything that Columbus could never have: sexy, preppy, overall "high-tier." Yet what makes this work is the gradual growth of Columbus. His adapting to the environment, and his quirky attitude makes it almost like a lost puppy finding a master that will give it scratch behind it's ears. What really takes the cake for this movie is not its simplistic shooting style (in zombie, you can only do so much), or its complete disregard for suspense, but it's work on creation In most zombie movies, you see the absence of creation, the overall end of life and groups of society. Yet what the main character was really after was something that he could consider a family. Once you compare most of the older movies with the main characters trying to find a place to be safe even after their group has died out continually, this just focuses on being together. It's a rather nice change of pace than what's always been handed. Overall, unless your man or woman enjoys visceral damage and violence, it doesn't work as a date movie. However, it does fit perfectly with a nice side humor movie that will get you through long enough and content enough till that episode of "Big Bang Theory" finishes downloading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie got hooked me in in the first 5 minutes or so. The beginning was brilliant. I am not really into zombie-movies, the only decent i saw was 28 days later maybe, but even that doesn't impressed me, it was just OK. I never really liked this genre. I always laughed so hard when i came by a movie like Resident Evil, or Dawn of the Dead, where they wanted to be serious and scary. Well, they never achieved it, at least not for me, it was still funny. I thought if there is a place zombies belong to, it would be in a comedy. And this one is a very good comedy.Not that kind of comedy in which you will laugh every 20 seconds, but the kind which will make you constantly smile with a couple of real laughter if you get the atmosphere and the tone. And Bill Murray's scenes were hysterically funny.Yes it had faults, plot holes, stupid things (why do the 2 girls need to STEAL a car when there is plenty around, since the zombies don't drive, how on earth were the zombies able to kill all the army and police and everything when they aren't able to penetrate a small kiosk made of most likely plastic or thin metal), but HELLO everyone, this was a ZOMBIE-COMEDY you know. It wasn't created for and by atom-physicists, this was created for the purpose to entertain, to shut down your brain for 1 hour and 20 minutes. If you seek that kind of entertainment tune in, otherwise why do you even bother with an (i repeat slowly...) Z.O.M.B.I.E-C.O.M.E.D.Y???....And beside that it had a little heart and a little brains in it too. The rules (don't get fat, exercise, know your way out, ENJOY THE LITTLE THINGS, etc.) and the final message (don't be a loner go out sometimes and have friends) were very-very important and positive, because many-many young kids will see this movie, and i think this is a way better message then for example: eat fast food and play WoW don't you think??? And the romance wasn't so annoying either, it wasn't really good, but it was bearable. And the characters were great too, one-sided: YES, but still very likable.This movie will not "make life simple or innocent again", but if you want some easy fun, I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting great things out of this film but the action, story and acting was very average, For a film called "Zombieland" you would expect to see a lot of zombies, but you really only saw them for the first and last 10 or 15 minutes of the film. Eisenberg proved once again the only role he is suitable for is an awkward nerd. Harrelson was one-dimensional as usual. The only decent acting came from Stone, which was not great but at least she was a somewhat likable character. The story had no plot or real climax. It was basically, zombies took over America and there were almost no people left. Four people are looking for a place where there are no zombies. That's it. That's the whole story. The ending was not particularly exciting and anti-climactic. Thankfully it seems like they didn't leave any room for a sequel.</fullReview>

I can say that I had pretty high expectations about this film. And the beginning did not disappoint me. Lovely, funny and lot's of disgusting, disturbing but still funny pictures rolled out before my eyes.But then, after about 20 minutes I found my self sitting there, quiet. Felt a bit tired, started to think about next day... what I should eat for dinner. The movie had some were along the way lost both it's legs and was now slowly dragging along. Here and there I got some laughs. But that was it, suddenly the movie ended. Some running and shooting for 10 minutes and a stupid ending, just like that.Sure, the movie was fun, but not that fun. Woody Harrelson was the best part of the movie, perfect for the role as Tallahassee. But he alone could not make this movie work in the long run.Seen how other people compare this film to "Shaun Of The Dead", I can not understand that. Shaun Of The Dead is a masterpiece in it's genre, this can not be said about "Zombieland", a movie that cant handle the long long weary long 88 minutes! "Thin" is a good word for the film.You can watch it, sure,it's entertaining. But nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2009 should've been the year of comedies. Cause there were some great ones. I think the funniest was the underrated Bruno. There was also the instant classic The Hangover. Along with lots of others. But I think the comedy I had the most fun with was Zombieland.I loved 2004's Shaun of the dead. These two films are similar plot wise. But Zombieland, to some surprise, is actually better. The film is hilarious, incredibly entertaining, and there are good performances. The main one i'm talking about is Woody Harrelson. Harrelson is great in anything he's in. He made the movie for me.Here we see Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abagail Breslin all kicking zombie ass. And it's a lot of fun. Harrelson is ridiculous, and there is another ridiculous cameo by Bill Murray. How could anyone resist Zombieland?Zombieland is a post apocalyptic film about zombies. Obviously. Nerdy Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, A college kid trying to go back to Columbus Ohio to see his family. People are nicknamed after the place they were born. So you don't actually know anyone's name.Soon Columbus meets Tallahasse, an ass kicking Twinkie lover. The two team up. They soon stumble across two other people(played by Emma Stone and Abagail Breslin)who at first betray them but eventually they team up too. They are heading for a theme park.How could anyone dislike this film? I mean there is a great cast and lots of laughs. I can't wait for a Zombieland 2. This is an apocalypse that I wouldn't mind seeing more of. This was one of the funniest films of last year.Zombieland: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals, great soundtrack, decent acting, terrible writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really really wanted to love this movie. I'm a long-time fan of Woody Harrelson and I really thought he did a pretty good job in this movie. However, there were some things wrong with this movie fundamentally that I just cannot get over.First, let me say the filming, visual effects and editing are all top-notch. I loved the incorporation of the rules for survival in 3D titles throughout the movie. I even loved the fact that Harrelson just wanted a Twinkie, and I didn't find it to be too commercial, or just a "product placement". "I HATE SNOBALLS!!!" where he's jumping up and down on the pile of pink powder puffs outside the truck - that was hilarious.**HERE COME THE SPOILERS**Now onto the bad. Firstly - I didn't too much enjoy the main character, Jesse Eissenberg. He was underdeveloped as a character (I blame the writing). He wasn't terrible and at first I really thought he was going to be good in this movie. Then the girls came along....Ugh. This is where the movie just bottoms out. First of all - I HATED those girls. Throughout the entire movie, myself and ALL my other friends were rooting for them to be either ripped apart by zombies or have their heads blown off by Harrelson. They never did anything in the movie that made the audience like them. They were snobby, controlling, conniving, backstabbing, thieving... WHY would you need to act like that when everyone else is dead? You can take anything you want, steal whatever, drive whatever, shoot whatever. And yet you decide to screw over the only two other living human beings who just wanted to help you? It makes zero sense.The second time the girls showed up, when they stole their yellow hummer and kidnapped them, I found it ABSURD that within 5 minutes, Harrelson and Eissenberg liked these girls. I would have ripped their heads off.Then it continues to get worse... a GREAT cameo by Bill Murray, except he's being retarded and scaring people with loaded guns. Of course, he gets shot, and that's the end of that. Not funny, just a bummer. Yet another reason to feel dirty for watching this crappy movie.I won't go into the rest, as everyone here mostly covered it. Things like, why did it take the girls 4+ hours to get to the amusement park, and the guys got there in about 20 minutes? Why did the girls turn the power on at the park? How was there even power at all? Why did they think that place was zombie free? The first thing I'd do when I looked for a "zombie free" location would be find other survivors, stay low and quiet, and set up a camp. Not get on rides that whirl you around, play loud music and shine blinding lights all over the valley. These girls are so STUPID.Then, how did they start and stop the rides in the first place? And furthermore, why did the guys come after the girls anyway? They were ripped off and abandoned THREE TIMES by those stupid girls (wanted to use another word, but apparently I couldn't for the review...). GAHH it just makes me mad. This movie could have been so good. But crappy, rushed writing and completely unlikeable female characters ruin it. There's so many plot holes it's just a swiss cheese movie. So weak.To sum up: the movie was pretty funny, Harrelson made it. WIthout him I would've walked out after 10 minutes. The writing is awful. The females in the movie are contemptible, you never want to like them or root for them - I'm still really mad that they didn't die. The music, editing, filming and other audio/visual aspects of the movie were terrific. Once again, great actors and a talented direction team create a steaming pile of zombie crap thanks to Hollywood writers. Such a shame, I really wanted to love this movie.Shaun of the Dead was an order of magnitude better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid Boy likes Girl angle lowered my rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's just me but boy likes girl plots cheapen movies especially when they are not romantic comedies but rather movies like Zombieland or thrillers or action films or whatever. It's such a cliché, eye roll worthy angle to play and I was disappointed when Zombieland decided to go that route having Jesse Eisenberg's character crush on Emma Stone's character.I still rated the movie 6 out of 10 b/c overall it was enjoyable but the boy likes girl unoriginal garbage and a few WTF moments as well as a stupid video game like action sequence at the end prevented this movie from really taking off into amazing territory.Basically, Zombies have taken over the world and the 4 main characters (Harrelson/Stone/Eisenberg/Breslin) are the last remaining humans ... or are they? ;) The movie is about their adventures to survive and find a place that is zombie free.I will say that I found the 2 female characters extremely unlikable and it bothered me the way no matter what kind of crap they pulled, the 2 male characters would help them. If it was the other way around, the 2 women would probably have walked over their bodies and kept going. Was their snark and bitchery supposed to be endearing because it wasn't.. at all.SPOILERSThere were a few WTF moments, obviously not including the ridiculous humans vs. Zombies shootout at the theme park at the end, but 2 that bugged me were: 1) Why did the 2 women need to wait for people to show up so they could run a con and steal their car? 1st of all, the chance of anyone showing up that wasn't a zombie was slim to none and 2nd of all, there were perfectly good, abandoned cars all over the place. Why not just take a car and go West like they wanted? Why hide out in a store randomly? That was dumb.2) The men want to go East. The Women steal their car and start heading West. The men, hours later after getting a yellow Hummer come across the women... umm.. they wanted to go East. They would have gotten the Hummer and traveled East, not West so how the heck did they just so happen to run back into them? Insanely DUMB.Ugh......and for the record, I am a female. Just thought I had to point that out given how much I couldn't stand the self entitled females in the movie.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requested by my fiancé, turned out to be quite funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Must I state that this was a Fabio request or is it obvious? ;)A movie with the word zombie in its title is not something I would normally watch, but in a relationship one must make compromises and after Bright Star, I owed him one. I must admit that Zombieland was quite funny at times and although not in my usual genre, I did laugh more than once.A brief plot summary: The world has been devastated and is inhabited only by blood-loving zombies. There are few "normal" people left. Woody Harrelson plays a tough, streetwise cowboy who drives a huge 4x4 and enjoys killing zombies and eating Twinkies. He picks up Columbus, played by Jesse Eisenberg (who I confused with the actor from Juno thus losing a costly bet for a sushi dinner) and the two form an awkward friendship or rather coexistence. In order not to get too friendly Woody says that he doesn't want to exchange names, only where they're from- therefore Columbus and Tallahassee.They decide to journey together, Columbus trying to survive- in fact he has a rather funny list of survival tips that are interspersed throughout the film with immediate examples of what happens if you don't follow the rules- and Tallahassee searching for Twinkies. Along the way they encounter and are repeatedly conned by two sisters, one of whom is played by Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine and more recently, My Sister's Keeper. They go by the names Wichita and Little Rock.The ultimate funniest scene is towards the middle and takes place in a Beverly Hills mansion with a surprise appearance from an actor who apparently isn't supposed to be named. I will not spoil the fun but just say that these 15 minutes or so are very funny and were by far my favorite part of the movie. That and a scene where Columbus' hot neighbor comes over and he thinks she likes him only to discover she is a zombie too and is there to savagely murder him. I realize it sounds quite juvenile but the scene was very amusing. The rest of the killing zombie and action parts were a bit too obvious and disgusting for my taste but as Fabio said, this horror comedy cannot be taken literally. If done so, Zombieland can be an enjoyable, albeit peculiar, adventure.My rating: 4.5 Fabio's: 8.5 Total score: 13 For more movie reviews please visit http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.comTo my followers and readers: I am leaving to Paris for a long weekend so there will be no more movie watching or reviews for the next couple of days.

		<shortDescription>Move over Scary movie, there's a new horror comedy in town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is probably the best horror comedy I have seen since the first Scary Movie. Shaun of the Dead was good but for some reason or another I never thought of it as being a classic unlike some others, but I feel it might become a cult favourite in a few years. And yet, I feel the same way about Zombieland. I have seen this movie on it's opening weekend, but I just haven't had the time to review it. The laughs just kept coming and coming and I'll admit I jumped maybe twice throughout the movie, but as far as I'm concerned this movie is more focused on laughs than scares. The acting is good, especially for Woody Harrelson as Tallahasse. That zombie-killing redneck is my favourite character of the whole bunch thanks to Harrelson's portrayal of him. Of course Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus should not be forgotten as well: The opening sequence with him and his rules marked me and my friends for a long time and his character was very truthful. Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) were also very convincing as a group of sisters who hijack, trick people into giving them money and more bad stuff. Honestly I can't believe that the Golden Globes rejected this movie because honestly both movies were good but I think I laughed more in Zombieland than in Hangover. You should see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Next Stop Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zombieland" is an action-comedy that capitalizes on the current vogue for zombies. The story is basically one part "Zombie Survival Guide" and one part "28 Days Later". Not incredibly original but there's still some fun to be had here.The acting is decent enough with Woody Harrelson making an entertaining team with Michael Cera (oops, I mean Jesse Eisenberg). Emma Stone &amp; Abigail Breslin are merely decent in rounding out the main players while there's a celebrity cameo that will undoubtedly thrill some (hipsters, mostly).Hipster-approved cleverness is also present in other areas of the script, particularly when it comes to the survival tips. These got old for me very quickly. Also, the main story is fairly aimless and inconsequential, so those looking for something substantial would be advised to look elsewhere.The first-time direction by Ruben Fleischer is attractive, though, particularly in the credits sequence (niftily supported by Metallica's "For Whom the Bell Tolls"). The zombie effects are good enough though I'm certainly no authority on the subject.Ultimately, I think that while "Zombieland" is a somewhat enjoyable time waster it's got nothing on "Shaun of the Dead". Nevertheless, the film's warm critical &amp; popular reception shows that there is an audience out there for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Zombie Comedy of the Year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I know that's not saying much, given it was the only movie of its type to come out last year, but that still takes nothing away from this film. While this movie may be about four people struggling to survive in a world overrun with zombies, really it's about four people learning to tolerate and put up with each other long enough to come together in order to survive in a world overrun by zombies.And I think that's the appeal of this film, at least for me. In most other zombie movies, all that matters is whether another individual is living or the living dead, but here it takes a little longer. Another factor which appealed to me was the protagonist, a neurotic loner well-played by Jesse Eisenberg ("Adventureland"). His character is not the sort of person you'd expect to possibly be the last non-undead in the world, but because he is pretty much an Average Joe, it made it easier for me to root for him; besides, the alpha-male zombie butt-kicker part is left up to Woody Harrelson, who is constantly teetering on the verge of a violent psychotic outbreak (and his not being able to find some Twinkies isn't helping matters).All in all, this is film well worth seeing, considering it clocks in at less than 90 minutes. Throw in a cameo by a well-known actor playing himself and a rocking opening song (Metallica's "For Whom The Bell Tolls"), and you got yourself a good candidate for a purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb fun/horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not actually a fan of horror films. One reviewer called Zombieland less scary than "Shaun" but I could not disagree more. I think the difference was much more violence and much more energetic directing of the action bits here than in "Shaun". In general there is some disturbingly brutal and visceral violence in Zombieland, whereas it was toned down in Shaun. That one was more a comedy in the midst of zombies, this one is much more a horror film with a lot of comedy. In short I find this one much scarier. Also funnier, which is because it is better written; i suspect if all the juicy "f" words were taken out of "Shaun" not much would be left. But nuff about Shaun. I think the opening credits - about 5 mins, are about the best I have seen and they already make it worth seeing Zombieland. Then the scene with the blond hottie turned zombie is also kick ass well directed and acted. The soundtrack is to crave for and I will definitely buy it. Emma Stone is amazing - a good actress and very hot in an interesting way. And the best of all - BM cameo, an absolute gem! I had a very good time thank you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would say mediocre is the word: "The horror comedy Zombieland focuses on two men who have found a way to survive a world overrun by zombies..." More like based on a virgin teenager trying to pull the only other female left alive:) Grindhouse + American Pie = Zombieland but less funny and less entertaining with adverts for Twinkies and Bill Murray:) Could also be Resident Evil + Road Trip = Zombilenad... but you get the idea.Anyhow, at the end I honestly though WTF? I just wasted a few hours instead of watching something else:) At the start of the film I though it was great... then slowly slowly I saw it go down the hill. Maybe it is me, no idea but I did like the Planet Terroor film a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Excellent Zombie Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delightful stylish zombie comedy delivers the chills, thrills and laughter. It sets a perfect sample what a good zombie comedy or any movie should be-- great characters meet a good story. Two desperados out to survive the zombie new world setting up rules and eating Twinkies, meet up with two of the toughest bitches still kicking, and set out to prove that their still fun in a world where humanity membership has expired. This movie packs a punch starting with a well crafted story, full of tension and funny scenes, I'm a sucker for the cardio scene where it show is good to keep fit, and when in doubt kill it twist. Nothing like a good Twinkie binch to bring the hero in anyones soul. I urge to go out and rent or buy this one, a most for zombie movie collectors. Watch it with a couple of friends and your favorite munchies.</fullReview>

While watching this movie I couldn't believe how one dimensional the characters are. The movie was also contains no surprises... the zombies are never unexpected and there is no suspense. The intro sequence featuring a Metallica song is a good hint that this movie is going to be lame while trying to be cool. RIAA eat your hearts out...There is no reason this movie should be ranked above "Shaun of the Dead" the true Zombie comedy classic of the 2000's. Also "House of 100 Corpses" is twice as good and it only has a 5.6 rating. Watch this movie, enjoy it and forget about it. NOT for repeat viewing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Your Place...In Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare to find a film that functions efficiently as both a comedy and a horror film but "Zombieland", packed to the gills with laughs galore as well as gory zombie carnage, is just that. Narrated by the slightly neurotic Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), the film follows him and professional zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) as they travel across post-apocalyptic America trying to find?well, I don't exactly know. Though there is a time when Columbus is hoping to find his family, the film is primarily concerned with them simply surviving in a world they affectionately call Zombieland. After encountering the beautiful Wichita (Emma Stone) and her younger sister, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), they form an unlikely and quirky family (of sorts) that, while heading to an amusement park in California, kills zombies and has fun. For those who are wondering, the answer is "Yes"?yes, that really is all there is to the film's scant storyline.Read The Full Review On My Blog: www.cinema-under-review.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's alright...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland's main strength is that it toys with something that at least I haven't seen in a zombie movie before - the morbid fantasy of running around amidst an apocalyptic world, killing zombies. Surely many others were satisfied by this in and of itself, I know I certainly was. Despite this, it's still ultimately forgettable.The worst part was the obvious and painfully bad Michael Cera impersonation that Jesse Eisenberg does; I can't help but wonder why they didn't just get Michael Cera himself, it doesn't seem like he's got a whole lot going on right now. His rules too, got to be very irritating. Yeah, you have a list of rules, cool... we already saw them. Bringing them up again and again (presumably for comedic effect) just got annoying after a while.The girls were... eh. Nothing good, nothing bad. Emma Stone was hot, and that's about it.Woody Harrelson is unsurprisingly the movie's saving grace. He's got great one liners, and his charisma alone carried the movie for me. Bill Murray's cameo was cool too, though slightly over-hyped.I liked the music a lot, and the pacing was flawless; I didn't like most of the characters, and there were a lot of dumb jokes, but I was never bored. A lot of people complained about the running zombies, which have become kind of popular as of late, but that's really not THAT big of a deal. Overall it's a passable blend of action and comedy, though it doesn't hold a candle to Shaun of the Dead in my mind. I can honestly say that I did like it, but it's too flawed to be truly memorable.</fullReview>

I'm probably the biggest wimp when it comes to horror and gore, but i really liked this. The movie starts in Garland TX, and is about a young man who had been going to UT in Austin. This is very special because i have lived in Austin my whole life and my dad grew up in garland. The movie ends in LA, where my stepmother grew up. these 4 humans make there way half way across the country battling the undead.

ZOMBIELAND is bloody, gory, morbid with insensitive and graphic scenes of dismemberment and actually more than enough laughs to go around. Tallahassee(Woody Harrelson), a seasoned zombie hunter by happenstance teams up with a worldly-challenged young man Columbus(Jesse Eisenberg). Tallahassee is searching for the last Twinkie on Earth and doesn't mind blowing away any zombies that get in the way. This mismatched pair meets up with two young girls, Wichita(Emma Stone)and Little Rock(Abigail Breslin), who are on a quest to see a popular amusement park in California. The four will end up fighting hordes of the undead and wondering if the two girls are of any help at all. While in Hollywood, the foursome stop for rest at the mansion of Bill Murray...where they find a zombie-like Murray just pretending because he likes to go out at night. Not saying that Bill will survive having guests. Hilarious. This should be in a genre of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland attempts to answer that question. the time is now the Zombie takeover began when a customer ate a tainted hamburger at a truck stop the burger had a new stain of Mad cow disease instead of killing him it made him into a cannibalistic Zombie with anger issues. Everyone he bites transforms into killer zombies those who don't survive become Food. Simple plot into this chaos comes Columbus and Tallahassee two survivors who team up with the understanding that once they reach their destination they will go their own way. However they like each others company and they know that being together increases their chances of survival. then they meet two sisters Little Rock and Wichita who are con artists and take the boys for a ride every chance they get. They too realize that the strength in numbers will work for them survival wise. Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee is a Zombie hating Twinkle addicted Gunfighter who turns Zombie killing into an art form. He makes the movie it is his movie hands down. The rest of the cast compliment him wonderfully they add to his strengths and add to the fun of the film. It's a fun shut off your brain don't question it or take it too seriously movie. I hear Zombieland 2 is being considered and I hope so because this is the beginning of a beautiful franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top 5 Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland Reviewer: Josh, www.overcranked.netColumbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has made a habit of running from what scares him. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) doesn't have fears. If he did, he'd kick their ever-living ass. In a world overrun by zombies, these two are perfectly evolved survivors. But now, they're about to stare down the most terrifying prospect of all: each other. --© SonyNot since Shaun of the Dead has a zombie movie been more than just a zombie movie. Zombieland is a combination of Zombie/Road Trip/Romantic Comedy movie. There are sight gags, one liners, and plenty of witty dialogue that keeps you laughing through the horror. Sure you get everything you want out of a zombie movie as well, but the comedy in the movie is smart and makes the movie an instant classic. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson make a great comedic duo in the movie playing Eisenberg as the straight man and Harrelson being unwittingly funny. Also the narration by Eisenberg gives the movie another source of comedy that just feels right within the world of Zombieland. Eisenberg throughout the movie lists his rules for survival in Zombieland, and the way in which they are implemented into the movie is brilliant and made me laugh every time.The chemistry between Emma Stone and Jesse Eisenberg is very real, and you are cheering him on the whole way. This is because Eisenberg is playing a neurotic, and at times socially awkward, twenty something that has had no luck in his life. Also Harrelson has a scene that tugs at the heartstrings and gives more to his character than that he is just a zombie killing machine. Another big selling point of the movie is a cameo by a certain comedic actor that if I shed any real light on it you won't enjoy it nearly as much.When comparing this movie to other zombie comedies the only one that really stacks up is Shaun of the Dead, but Zombieland is the superior movie. Part of that is because if you don't enjoy dark humor or British humor then Shaun of the Dead doesn't reach you like Zombieland will. Zombieland mixes dark humor in with other more "normal" brands of comedy giving the movie a wider reach as far as getting the laughs. Also Zombieland is faster paced than Shaun of the Dead, and has far more gore in it than Shaun of the Dead. I never thought I would say it, but Shaun of the Dead has been replaced as my favorite Zombie movie.If you had any doubts about if the zombie movie genre had any steam left in it then Zombieland is going to knock that idea clean out of your head. This movie is an instant classic for me, and is one that I would pay to go see multiple times. In an attempt to not ruin any of the parts of the movie I can just assure you that this is not one of those movies where all of the good parts are in the trailer. So, hurry to the theater and watch Zombieland!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romeroland romp...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just spent a weekend at a zombiecon (where I saw not one but two more unacknowledged but clearly Romero-inspired no-budget zombie movies), I didn't really expect a whole lot from ZOMBIELAND. Good thing, too. Most of the funniest lines were in the trailers (all but one, by my count) and the cgi were downright underwhelming. Woody Harrelson shoulders the bulk of the acting burden (which ain't exactly a stretch, in this case), mugging alongside what has to be one of the blandest young leading men to ever come down the pike. Bill Murray, who hasn't been in a movie worth watching in decades, becomes the butt of the film's best joke- which you can see coming a mile away. In fact, everything that follows is instantly forgettable. (And the brief scene tagged onto the end of the closing credits isn't even worth waiting for.) The most egregious error is the omission of the number one rule for surviving a zombiepocalypse: you don't have to be faster than a zombie to survive- you just have to be faster than the guy next to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catches most of the love behind the Zombie fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland - The world is once again (or maybe it's the same virus as the one in Shaun of the Dead) ravaged by a virus that turns the world's population into hordes of mobile (is the running/walking debacle really so worthy of ire? Either would destroy the world) cannibals. The main character is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a squeamish nerd who has survived so long because of strict adherence to a rulebook that neatly skips over most of the mistakes horror film characters fall prey to. He soon meets Tallahassee (played with vinegar and vigor by Woody Harrelson), a man with a savage penchant for killing zombies. They meet two untrustworthy young women (Emma Stone and Abigail Bresnin) and the four slug it out joyfully in an apocalypse of enormous proportions.The film marvelously captures most of the love most teenage men have for the zombie scenario. In a word or two: legitimized anarchy. If the story lacks direction for any reason it's this. One of the best sequences (of which there are several) shows the foursome breaking everything in a shop just because they can. The jokes come often and are amusing, with pop culture references aplenty. One cameo made me fall in love with the film. There really is nothing like the comedy greats of the 80s and 90s, is there? The opening credits sequence would be the best if the Dawn of the Dead remake hadn't done theirs so perfectly.The film only sparingly adheres to reality so as not to detract from the fantasy. Running out of ammunition never seems to happen. It's hard to imagine three out of four of the crew, capable as they are at times, faring any better than millions of other people, much less the US Army. But speculation about that hardly seems the point of the film. The final quarter is nothing if not constant visceral fun.If I have some minor issues, apart from the ammo tiffs, it's this: The casting of the film seems extremely calculated. We have a kid that looks and acts like Michael Cera, the hot girl from Superbad, the cute kid from Little Miss Sunshine, and Woody Harrelson. If there weren't zombie nudity, blood, and cussing here I'd say it's practically a family friendly film. I've become a little less of a fan of comedy relying on pop culture over the years because it relies on an audience's knowledge of other films, not the film standing on it's own merits. But I don't want to flog an undead horse too harshly, especially such an entertaining one. I'd gladly watch Zombieland again, and it remains at least the second best zombie comedy ever.The masses have spoken: we love us some zombie films, and it is a fantasy that will likely spawn countless more movies, both comedic and horrific, being made. And for once, I'm okay with that. A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a guy who's portrayed a mass-murdering psychopath (in "Natural Born Killers") and went head-to-head with mass murderer Anton Chigurh (in "No Country for Old Men"), it's anyone's guess as to why Woody Harrelson--he of the perpetual cowboy hat and hickly typecasting--was never enlisted to play the role of undead-whompin' good-'ol boy before. Rest easy, friends: in "Zombieland," that dream is fulfilled, and all is now right with the world. Woody plays Tallahasse, a grizzled zombie hunter plowing across the highways of America to make it to his namesake (and also find a Twinkie along the way, if possible); in his travels, he meets neurotic dweeb Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, who is really cornering the market on this character type), whose obsessive tendencies and notepad of "rules" has kept him alive; also on board are Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin--"Little Miss Sunshine"), two sisters with their own tough-love survival instincts, who even add a little romantic tension to the mix. True to its title, "Zombieland" knows the character types and conventions of the genre, and expects the audience to, as well: this is a film that plunges us into a world gone to walking-dead hell, and--in the vein of the "Scream" films--knows the clichés that accompany such a scenario, to the point where the surviving inhabitants are pretty jaded toward it all. Director Ruben Fleischer creates a convincingly apocalyptic landscape, and even mines some passages of suspense and rip-roaring action to accompany the laughs, courtesy of Rhett Reese's and Paul Wernick's script. While "Shaun of the Dead" might have beaten "Zombieland" to the punch as far as undead satires/homages are concerned, it's hard to top the thrill of seeing Woody Harrelson pluck strings on a banjo (pretty badly, I might add) to the theme of "Deliverance" to draw overweight zombies out of a supermarket aisle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crowd-pleasing splatter-fest...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre owes the little vitality and originality it has left to comedy; hits like the Evil Dead series have paved the way for more recent efforts such as Shaun of the Dead, and it also means that through mitigating the sadism inherent to the genre with humour, filmmakers are able to pass gorier films through at the 15 certificate, as long as the violence is exaggerated to an absurd effect, as is true of the above films, and certainly of Ruben Fleischer's breakout feature Zombieland.A ragtag band of survivors traversing a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested wasteland is hardly a new idea, so how does Zombieland freshen things up? A superb slow-motion opening credits sequence set to "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by Metallica ought to do it, if not the unique tone introduced by narrator Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), an anxiety-ridden college student who has survived this long because he has no real personal attachments, and also due to his strict set of rules, such as always checking the back seats of cars he enters, and always "double-tapping" zombies to make sure they're dead. In attempting to get to Ohio and see if his parents are still alive, he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), an aggressive and charismatic man who lives only to hunt zombies and sink his teeth into any remaining Twinkies on Earth, but his search for the latter has so far been fruitless. The two form an uneasy partnership, deciding not to use real names and instead refer to each other by where they are heading. Things become even more complicated and uneasy as they meet sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), who will do anything to survive, and seemingly cannot be trusted. They all share one common ground, though; they want to get to Pacific Playland, a theme park where there are reportedly no zombies. Narration is so often a lazy expository device used to move the plot forward, but in Zombieland, it is used sparingly, most often for the sake of laughs, as the plot itself trundles along and doesn't require much explanation. Columbus frequently takes us out of the action to tell us a new survival rule, or to let us in on a bit of personal insight, or even inform us of the "Kill of the Week", and although Eisenberg's delivery isn't charismatic, that's exactly why it works, because he's the counter-balance to Harrelson's off-the-wall performance, the voice of reason in a group of selfish and untrustworthy survivors. If there's something I have against Zombieland, though, it's that for a film running in at barely 80 minutes, it really ambles along carelessly without much focus for a good portion of its middle-section. It spends a little too long focusing on the journey through the wasteland and not enough on the thrill of the chase or the relentless undead; it should never let up, but it in fact goes almost entirely the other way and is at times quite inert. The gag rate is high enough, but those expecting laugh-out-loud japes may be a tad disappointed; it's more about subtle, witty parlance and pop culture references than gore-based sight gags and dark humour (notably as Columbus refers to himself as a "Sancho Panza character").The film is strong for the most part, though, and hits its stride when the gang passes through Hollywood and meets a certain celebrity actor (who less considerate critics have already sadly spoiled), who enjoys an extended, hilariously self-deprecatory cameo that is the unequivocal highlight of the film. From here, things remain intense and funny right into and throughout the third reel, as the final showdown takes place at Pacific Playland, with our heroes using all manner of fairground rides to fend off the hungry horde. The pacing is too leisurely and it's not the laughs-per-minute gag-fest that Shaun of the Dead was, but it's an original, visually inventive slice of film-making that's bolstered by a hilarious performance from Woody Harrelson, which is complemented by Jesse Eisenberg's more straight-laced turn. Eisenberg is slowly becoming a star in his own right after several strong performances now (in Roger Dodger, The Squid and the Whale and Adventureland), but let's hope that he doesn't get "Michael Cera syndrome" and become typecast as the awkward, socially inept kid, even if he does play it well. For a fun and brisk film that satisfies both as a crowd-pleasing splatter-fest and as a clever comedy, you'll find no better this Halloween season.</fullReview>

There is a lot of violence and some pretty stupid gags (stupid as in just stupid and silly not stupid as in not worthwhile) that had everybody laughing a lot. Woody Harrelson is real funny in his part in this movie. All the creative ways they ended up killing all the different zombies were really funny too. Not much more to say about this but this is a really funny take on zombie movies but it does get a bit repetitive and boring in the humor it uses. Worth seeing for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best zombie film since Shaun of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this film will get a lot of comparisons to Shaun Of the Dead and I truly believe this film is just as good as that fantastic film was and is the new version of it. This film is based in a zombie apocalypse with Columbus a nerdy but efficient survivor as he goes on a road trip with 3 companions to survive. Now Jesse Eisenberg was great in his role and was perfect casting for the nerdy role, his monologues are great and his delivery of lines is superb. The supporting cast is also fantastic, Woody Harreldson plays his red neck ally and he is great with their chemistry being excellent and his presence being a great thing to see in this film. Also Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin were great as the sister companions and really provided a great dynamic in the film that truly helped. The chemistry between all these guys is superb and it really carries this film and is probably the main reason I love this film so much. The story is not the strong point of the film with it essentially being a road trip film that you will have seen before, however, they do such a good job of it you end up not really caring too much about how basic the story was. The script was superb with the dialogue being utterly superb and it was hilarious from the opening scene to the end scene. The style was great as well with the zombies looking cool and the last 20 mins of the film's style being so awesome and really being a great finale. Overall this is a fantastic film that really shows how good zombie films can be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of zombie comedy, and the fact that just a few years ago we had "Shaun of the Dead" (2004). "Zombieland" proves that there are still plenty of jokes to be made when tackling the undead, especially when it's this self-aware."Zombieland" has great gore effects, interesting set locations, fun action sequences, "that" cameo appearance and some overall brilliant "laws" to follow in order to survive. Every character is uniquely different from one another. Most notably Woody Harrelson steals the show, but each of their own personal histories unravel towards the films conclusion which result in sadness, comedy and social awkwardness. In a world with only zombies left, how does that remains possible? Final Verdict: A great first outing for Ruben Fleischer. "Zombieland" benefits because recently we are so use to seeing people flee in terror, it's rarely been done in Horror Cinema where those left alive just decide to let loose and have fun. 7.5/10.</fullReview>

What makes this movie so frickin' special! It wasn't even THAT funny! The main character annoyed the living sh*t outta me, and eventually, I got tired of hearing his voice and him constantly re-stating the rules of Zombieland.(Okay, Enough, We get it!) Woody Harrelson had some funny moments, but his performance was disappointing. Same goes for Bill Murray, he just didn't add anything to the movie. The only thing I really liked about the movie, was the use of Metallica's "For whom the bell tolls" but the rest of the movie was a letdown. It wasn't horrible, but I expected a whole lot more. If you're looking for a hilarious zombie movie, watch "Shaun of the Dead" or "Return of the living Dead" Don't watch Zombieland!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland, Unfunny, and Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you felt that a certain film has been over-hyped and overrated before? Well, that is exactly how I feel about this movie: Over-Hyped and extremely overrated. Why? Read on.I was in school when this film was released, and EVERYONE asked me if I'd seen it. I'd always respond with "No" and then they tell me that the movie was very good and hilarious. Now, 3 years later, I finally get the chance to watch it, and? I honestly hated it. First of all, the jokes are very bland and unfunny. There were a few jokes here and there that made me chuckle a little bit, but that was it. Secondly, the characters were poorly developed. Abigail Breslin doesn't get very much screen time, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin don't have much of a backstory, nor does Tallahassee, and that REALLY bothered me. Thirdly, *SPOILER ALERT* near the end, it turns out that Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin went through all this fuss and all this chaos JUST TO GO TO AN AMUSEMENT PARK. Really?! Are you kidding me? And also, when they reach the amusement park, the zombies break in and try to kill them! DUHHH?The thing that bothers me the most about this movie is that everyone told me how great it was, I watched it, and I hated it! VERY disappointing! Overall, don't spend your cash on this dumb and mediocre film. If you're in the mood for a Horror/Comedy film that's actually FUNNY, skip this one. I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do people from my generation love this garbage?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am tired of self-referential, "clever", witty, quirky films; films where characters are straight off of the Judd Apatow assembly line. You know, the obnoxiously talkative, obsessive-compulsive, love-lorn nerdy Jew, the sassy yet droll, wise-beyond-her-years teenage girl, the big- mouthed outrageous hillbilly. This is a slickly-produced but very hackneyed retread of every teen comedy released in the last several years. There is not a single part of this movie that shows even the least bit of original thought. Simply put, this movie is an embarrassing exercise in fan service; jam-packed with tons of Hollywood references, gratuitous (but pointless) zombie carnage, and the timely popping-up of cutesy text...all of it there to remind us just how *cool* and *smart* the filmmakers are.How can people in their 20s/30s not see through this ruse? When movies make an effort to try to tell you how clever they are they cease to be clever. I suspect that many of those who are (idiotic) enough to give this movie more than a 4 rating are probably Kevin Smith/Joss Whedon fans who have difficulty discerning between a film and a tapestry of scenes of "witty" dialog sewn together.Compare this to Robert Rodriguez' superior "Planet Terror". It's full of colorful characters we haven't seen before played STRAIGHT. The tone of the movie is serious and that's what makes the film so much more entertaining (and funny). And most importantly, we're spared the constant reminder of just how precocious the filmmaker is.I give this movie 3 stars instead of zero due to an inspired title sequence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about two men who struggles to stay alive in a world infested with zombies."Zombieland" starts out fun and stylish. The slow motion scenes is reminiscent of "The Matrix"; while the way credits and rules appear and get destroyed on the screen look cool. However, "Zombieland" has a very thin plot, the first half is so boring. The thing is, they try to avoid zombies, so there is no gore, no escaping for life, no tension and no thrill. To fill time up, they senselessly wreck everything they see which is not exactly comedic. The second half is better, but by then I get bored already. I am disappointed with "Zombieland", and I think it is very overrated. "Shaun of the Dead" is way better.</fullReview>

Is this the American SHAUN OF THE DEAD? Well, it is indeed a zombie film to have lots of fun with and is not quite like the Canadian FIDO, that is also a fun zombie film but that is more about a world than just about trying to survive the zombies. So yes, ZOMBIELAND is in the vein of that Edgar Wright film (that, btw, I really have to re-watch. I watched it for the first and so far only time back in December 2005, so is time to visit it again) with our characters just trying to survive. Of course this is not a quite similar: ZOMBIELAND is basically a road movie, with characters that are indeed surviving the zombie holocaust yet that are not around zombies all the time. I mean, this is more about what's next for the survivors in the United States of Zombieland, about the relationship between the survivors? but well, of course there's plenty of extremely cool zombie slashing! So don't worry. The film is fun almost all the time. One of the main characters said it just about right: "". Of course a zombie holocaust is not a very funny issue, well before I go on I want to write a bit about the main characters. Plays the hero, a thin boy who is basically like the character Michael Cera always plays. And yes, there's a familiar face here if you are into Apatow productions. The love interest of Jonah Hill in SUPERBAD is here, plays , the love interest of . and her little sister () will be a real headache for the . everyone of them has something sad to tell thanks to the zombie holocaust</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Comedy Mixed with Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland was the last movie that I watched in 2009. I had quite a good time as the movie is mixture of comedy and horror. One of the reasons I like this movie is because I don't like Zombie movies as pure horror. In the past I watched Shaun of the Dead and enjoyed it thoroughly.Zombieland is not trying to tell us how things went wrong and people became Zombies. It is going straight to the point and showing us the ways of survival. The film starts with a good speed with those key ways of avoiding Zombies. (of course Columbus *Jesse Eisenberg* is the main character who is walking us through).Then he meets a born-to-be a zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and they start their journey together. In fact they join their powers and methods and even in your seats you feel much safer. But this doesn't mean they are unbeatable. They meet two sisters on the way and all the way along they are cheated by these two girls. Their aim is to go to a theme park which is supposed to have no zombies around. Our two guys join the girls and they all head up to Florida and they encounter funny situations. Especially Bill Murray part is the best of this movie.All in all it is great fun to watch but also gives you the feeling why on earth this movie was made. For fun and no high expectations go and watch.</fullReview>

The only time I had some laugh while watching the movie was right after the beginning when the nerdy hero explained how to survive among the zombies. Unfortunately this was the end of all fun and some 1,5 h of boredom followed.

		<shortDescription>Great movie, without much of a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most other people here on IMDb and elsewhere, I think Zombieland is a great movie. An enjoyable movie. But where was the story?The reasons for the zombie plague are not well explored, they are well hinted at though. The time-line is not explained. The reason for the survivors to have survived is not explained. Nothing is explained... everything must be taken at face value in this movie. All of the plot elements are borrowed wholesale from the Zombie genre, so there is no real reason to explore them further.What we are left with is an undeniably funny, and enjoyable piece of Zombie fluff. A film that takes place within the well established Zombie-apocalypse universe without challenging our expectations in any way. Except for THAT sequence in the middle, whereby the unexpected appearance of a comedy great lifts the movie from unremarkable to near classic status.The characters play with the well established stereotypes, both conforming to them and then occasionally usurping them for comic effect. In the end, it's a light morality tail about the value of the nuclear family even under the most extreme of circumstances, and it manages to be vaguely heartwarming.I can understand this movie getting good scores. I recommend anyone with a tolerance for Zombie comedy to watch it (though it's a dark comedy - no Sean of the Dead here) but the 8+ score surprises me somewhat. That places it up there with the movie greats, and it really doesn't belong there. I gave it a seven, it deserves to settle at 7.3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the way I felt about the movie. I didn't really think of this as an American answer to Shaun of the Dead. Shaun is pretty unique (to this day at least) and really funny. Zombieland is a Zombie action comedy like Shaun, but that's pretty much all these two movies have in common! Were Shaun had a different kind of world and the characters had some goals they wanted to go/achieve, the two main characters in Zombieland don't have that. It pretty much plays like a sketch show, with different settings holding the movie together rather than a story that runs through it. A cameo, that might seem a bit weird, especially the way it does end, is just another testament to that.But again, this movie is here, for you to enjoy and not to compare to other things.

		<shortDescription>A Zombie movie with a heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is full of zombies but left me feeling good about humanity. The plot is thin but the characters are very likable and the fact that I wanted them to be okay kept me interested in the film until the end. Describing the plot won't take long. After a zombie plague very few humans have survived. Four of them decide to travel together to LA where there may be a Zombie free area and/or Twinkies. The four are: uber geek Jesse Eisenberg, redneck Woody Harrelson and grifter sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.Eisenberg has a long list of rules for survival in a zombie filled world and we see in flashback why he came up with some of them.Most of the film consists of our four heroes having gory/funny encounters with zombies. The dialogue is funny and the acting is good. Abigail Breslin is growing up at an alarming rate but is perhaps wasted in the smallest role as the younger sister. Eisenberg and Stone have good chemistry in their roles and look set to gave decent Hollywood careers. Harrelson is perfect as the wisecracking NASCAR fan who loves nothing better than killing zombies.A comparison with "Shaun of the Dead" is inevitable. The English film had a stronger plot line so perhaps I would give it the edge. Although Zombieland has Bill Murray as himself pretending to be a zombie so he can play golf in peace! That must count for something.This is a funny film with its heart in the right place. The films message, or at least the one I gleaned from it, is that people need to help each other to make the best out of life. I enjoyed it in the cinema but it would also be a perfect DVD for a night in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see any jokes (y'know, funny stuff), beyond the odd obvious bit of visual satire. I didn't see any suspense, or originality. No atmosphere either. This film put me in mind of an extended cut scene from a rushed and unimaginative video game.The only surprising thing about it for me was reading the reviews on this site. One of the reviews I read seemed to suggest this nonentity of a film has usurped Shaun Of The Dead!Shaun Of The Dead had a plot, it had sympathetic characters, it had a clever, well thought out script, it had well conceived and executed scenes, and above all, considering it's supposed to be a comedy, it was funny. This film, on the other hand, had paper thin characters, virtually no script at all (beyond Woody's one liners), no real plot (beyond something akin to a single level of a bad video game, as I've already alluded to), and wasn't at all funny. Funny is subjective only to a certain level of tolerance. I can see what *some* people find funny about rubbish like Mall Cop, I can see what *some* people find funny about Will and Bloody Grace, and I can definitely see what people find funny about Shaun Of The Dead. This film has absolutely nothing funny in it at all - not even smile worthy. No hold on, the 5 minute cameo appearance made me smile...if a little sad too, as he should be a little more selective about which projects he gets involved in by now.Wooo-bloody-hoo. A lesson in how to hype a straight-to-DVD film out of obscurity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a fun movie. I like the way that they outlined the plot through the "rules". The way that the characters interacted with the text on the screen was neat too.Tallahassee is the star of the show with his off the wall personality, yet likable traits. This is not a serious movie, nor does it pretend to be with the comical gore, among other things. The vibrant colors are a welcome change from how dark and gloomy most zombie pictures are shown. I might have been apt to rare it a bit higher than I did, but there was just a few too many times where I was rolling my eyes, despite the fact that this is not a serious film. For me, the cameo was totally unexpected and good for a laugh.Going into this film, I was really not expecting to enjoy it quite as much as I did. For a good hearted action/comedy film, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Summarized in one sentence, Zombieland is a Dawn of the Dead theme park in Disneyland, if there can be one. Everything in a zombie movie before appear in this movie as a farce, and don't even expect it to be horrifying other than some bloody scenes.The fact that Zombieland is good lies within its correct and precise marketing, that it's for those who love a fun, funny movie which doesn't disappoint. It's solid in technical perspectives, performances(Abigail Breslin is brilliant) and every scene flows with senses of humor. From beginning to the end, it never stops homaging to famous movies and scenes, yet it's not as serious and morally-concerned like Shaun of the Dead. By the way I strongly suggest you don't compare these two movies because they have totally different emphasis.I won't talk about any single scene in the movie to spoil the fun, just expect to laugh a lot in the theater.8/10. Satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Must say this movie is totally disappointing and crap. Lets start with the main actor guy, this cowboy Tallahassee, who looks not one inch brighter than a zombie, but calls himself a passionate zombie killer. What an idiot. Did he say one funny or clever sentence in that movie? He did not. The other guy (Columbus) and the girls are just OK. Not more, not less. But even they didn&#x2019;t manage to provide funny or interesting dialogues. Instead they come along with stupid behaviour. And if a movie is supposed to be a fun movie, why is there not any tit, besides of one zombie, in this movie? Prudish Americans. So where else is the so called fun here? Shooting Bill Murray in his villa and dropping him form the balcony? Kicking zombies with different kind of tools and car doors? Worst moment in this movie was the freaking out scene out in the Native American souvenir shop. Dam it, not only that the white American settlers have stolen all the land of the natives, without any sign of consciousness of doing wrong, now they even celebrate destroying their cultural objects and call it &#x201c;enjoy the small things&#x201d;. It is just like we would make a funny Nazi movie and smashing some Jewish shops there and celebrate our best funny movie of the year. To say it short, this movie is wrong. I regret the time spending on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts out great; with the rules, the slow motion zombie replays, etc. and then it just goes dull.The middle and ending is empty, lacking substance.I feel ripped off totally for something that could and should have been great.Ninety minutes went by and i feel like nothing happened, reminds me of "lost".They didn't even kill that many zombies, a few here and there while traveling and the big group at the end. Whats even more disappointing and what the reason is behind a 5 out of 10 is the fact that this movie obviously had a good budget, at least in that regard it had more potential than some other zombie movie that has a low rating.A cult classic...not a chance if compared to evil dead , brain dead and some other real classics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can one hate a movie for being too American? I mean, really, guns, SUVs and Twinkies? Where does all that electricity come from anyway? I guess people can enjoy seeing a curly insecure virgin boy looking out of place no matter what the script. Because there is not much in the way of script here.From the high rating on IMDb and from all the hype I though it would be worth watching this. I was wrong: it was a total waste of time, not funny as a comedy, not thrilling as a zombie movie, not touching as a personal drama.Bottom line: it's practically a romcom with zombies. Same lack of plot, ludicrous premise and acrid aftertaste. Oh, and zombies. Meh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slack pacing kills this. It's feels like it's the directors first movie (uh, bingo!). It also needs a slightly better script; because between episodes of hilarity one notices that it's not very inspired. A Ghostbusters gag with nowhere to go, lingers on screen long enough to make a viewer wince. One gives up early, on the films potential to live up to the classic suggested by the tightly edited preview; which once again gave away all of the best scenes (except one involving a celebrity guest star). Why have rules characters know they have to obey if they have to be abandoned to supply the film with a de rigeur climactic setpiece, which relies on everyone acting 'horror-movie-stupid' again? As the movie ends prematurely, you sit there thinking "Oh... that was the big climax? ...going to the amusement park was the movie's big goal? ...that was really unsatisfying." It feels like something major got cut out (or more likely, was never written), leaving the movie lopsided. Eisenberg is not as good or charming as the role demands and one is constantly mindful that the part MUST have been written with Michael Cera in mind. Cera could do a better job in a walk. One assumes Eisenberg's casting is explained by nepotism involving some Hollywood bigwig. Oh, and "Scream" called, they want their 'horror movie rules' gag back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Check out my comment about Zombieland. http://jgz408.livejournal.com/864.html My pick for best flick of 2009 is Zombieland. I saw the movie at the movie theaters on opening night. What I liked about it was the way that they took the elements of a popular genre, such as gore, darkness, and survival and seamlessly, worked it into a comedy. The hardcore zombie fans will appreciate the irony throughout this movie. I expected to watch a C grade movie but its a definite A!I didn't know that Woody could be such a funny character.The movie was fun to watch and I'm glad that they didn't try to make it some PG-13 movie and loose all the greatness off seeing piles and piles of zombies be killed. It must be the first zombie movie where the main characters are using the word zombie to describe them. Very creativly put together and worth the $10 i spent on the movie. Non stop laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best thing for zombies since Shaun of the Dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly cannot compare the two.I am cynical in nature, and whenever I see an abrupt death in a movie, I tend to chuckle..like in Blades of Glory, when they showed the girl's head getting cut off, I was the only one in the whole theater that found that funny, and it showed because I couldn't hear anyone else laughing.I've always found horror movies in general to be funny, because they're usually terrible.I mean consider House of the Dead, probably one of the worst films ever made,I I couldn't help but laugh through the entire thing, just at how terrible it was. When I saw House of the Dead in theaters, I looked around at the people around me and saw the disgust on their faces, and I noticed them waiting for it to get better, but it never did. It just didn't, and I was the only one laughing out loud throughout. Yes, I realized I wasted $20 in going to see it, but you couldn't try to make a crappier film, and there were zombies...so you might as well enjoy it.I even find some humor in good zombie movies such as George A Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and subsequent sequels, or 28 days later, But these movies only had some moments that were meant to be funny. They're still very serious in intent.I wish I could have seen it in theaters, but I missed any opportunity I had. I didn't even know about it until it was on HBO, but when I saw Shaun of the Dead a few years back, I was convinced there would never be a more clever, or hilarious horror comedy featuring Zombies. I would find myself watching it every time I saw it come up in the listings. It was a good zombie movie with the intent of being funny, and not some Hollywood writers' or directors' attempt at trying to be too creative,or too serious, which typically gives you something like House of the Dead.I scoffed at Zombieland when I first saw the trailer, because I was certain that it could not top my favorite zombie movie of all time, and I was hesitant to go see it. I had a suspicion that it was just an attempt at trying to take something away from Shaun of the Dead and reap the profits from an unoriginal idea.However, all it took was 20 minutes in to realize that I just might be wrong.I have never been so surprised in a theater in my life. Usually when I've made up my mind about a movie, even before I see it, my suspicions ring true, and my opinion doesn't change much if at all, but this time it did.Zombieland is simply hysterical.As I mentioned before, you cannot compare the two. Shaun of the Dead is like biting into a Golden Delicious apple, and Zombieland is like biting into a Red delicious apple, you might prefer one over the other, but they're both juicy, and offer you the same nutrients.If you like Shaun of the Dead, you will like this too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It might be the final nail in the coffin for the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies aren't scary anymore. The Zombie film is little more than an excuse to show off special effects and cheap kills. A picture like 'Zombieland' was bound to happen and it is a funny send off to a genre which has run out of gas. If you're name isn't George A. Romero don't attempt a Zombie film again.'Zombieland' like 'Scream' before it features self-aware characters who know they are in a zombie film. Our hero Columbus has made a list of rules in order to survive to populate Zombieland 2. These rules provide the greatest laughs of the film because chances are any going into Zombieland knows the formula by heart. These rules are really what people watching a poorly made zombie film would screen talk with in the background. Zombieland is made by people who have had fun with zombie movies and this is why I think it is so funny.The other reason this movie is funny and why I really enjoyed the film is Woody Harrelson. The plot and satire are funny but probably not enough to sustain a film. Harrelson gives Zombieland that extra push to make it noteworthy and memorable. It's a performance that reminded me a lot of the bowling classic 'Kingpin' which Harrelson was fantastic in. Harrelson's chemistry with his 'Kingpin' costar Bill Murray makes for one of the best cameos of all time. Harrelson doesn't take the material seriously and for the benefit of the film this is why his performance is so funny. They could have easily casted an SNL alum in the role and have him parody this arch type. Harrelson plays it relatively straight to the punchline where the audience and Harrelson share a laugh. It's inspired casting and when he gets his long awaited twinkie at the films end there was applause.The problem which brings Zombieland down from being a great film is that it is still a Zombie film. Despite being self aware about the zombie scenario our heroes still make the same mistakes made in lesser Zombie films. These Zombies are agile as well. I wanted slow pacing and moaning Zombies of Romero films. I can't imagine why this approach wasn't taken because it would provide riper material. We have fast moving 28 Days Later zombies. I suppose these are scarier but fear isn't what this film is going for. The film is also surprisingly gory. Not surprisingly for a zombie picture but I was disappointed to see it because I think the film was strong enough without it. The line between satire and what is being parodied is mulled when some of the explicit gore is on the screen. I can stomach gore fine but the film looses some of it's comic effect this way. It doesn't hurt the film but it lessens it.At any rate Zombieland is a great example of pulp entertainment done right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer makes the film seem better than it is, ruining some of the best gags, but the film is entertaining and fun nevertheless. Zombieland has a very good start from the point of view of a young survivor who has created a bunch of rules for survival in this zombie-infested land. Those give us some of the best early moments as his no-nonsense sensible approach contrasts with the usual macho heroics or clueless stupidity of typical horror movie characters. Then he meets the proverbial reckless macho redneck zombie-killing machine, Woody Harelson in a very enjoyable and enthusiastic performance, and thus odd couple hijinks ensue. It seemed to me that the energy level and inspiration dipped down, with occasional upwards bumps, but never down to the ground of mediocrity, as time passed. A bit like a roller-coaster ride after the big first drop. That "drop" seems to happen a little after the meeting with the girls, roughly a third of the way through when zombies get scarcer.The infamous cameo (hope nobody ruined it for you) is fun but not as great as some people might leave you to believe. However, it's eventually responsible for one of the biggest laughs so what do I know. I liked the characters, found them likeably imperfect and flawed sometimes even sweet, but I did find little Miss Sunshine (Abigail Breslin) shooting guns somewhat disturbing ;-) This film having zombies, you can expect some gore, mostly of the open mouth spewing blood variety, but the most extreme scenes are more farcical than horrific. As an horror comedy, Zombieland is quite good and should preferably be seen in a crowded theater or with a bunch of expressive friends. It's not as inspired, original or consistently funny as the recent Shaun of the Dead, Drag me to Hell or the more obscure Dance of the Dead but it's a worthy entry in this sub-genre of comedy. I've seen all of those in crowded theaters and there was more crowd reaction for these than for Zombieland who at the moment (at #147 of all-time best films on IMDb) is overrated.Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Sean of the Dead", which sets the zombie comedy benchmark, is a far funnier movie.Zombieland, which relies mostly on slapstick zombie violence to get it's laughs, is really just an average teen/coming-of-age comedy with zombies added. The script is nothing special and it's just not that funny. In fact it's frequently self-defeating as in what should have been the funniest scene of the movie (with Bill Murray). Here most the impact of the joke is lost as you wonder "Why the hell did he do that?". With just a few minor tweaks by the scriptwriter or director, that scene could have been a classic. In the end, the movie kind of feels like a sequel to Adventureland (Jesse Eisenberg's other 2009 movie) but not nearly as well written or executed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you ready for some Zombie's?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, your thinking this is going to be a really dumb movie with Zombies and people running from them the whole time. right? Well its not your typical Zombie movie starring Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Bresin, and Bill Murray. Narrating some of the movie before he first see's signs of the Zombies and then after that he has made a set of rules to follow not to be killed by the Zombies and to live by. Meeting up with Harrelson and later meeting up with Stone which you probably remember her from Ghosts of Girlfriends Past lately. Also you can't forget Bresin who is taking on bigger roles and soon will be up to speed with Dakota Fanning even though we know they aren't the same age of course. You might remember Jessie Eisenberg from the movie Adventureland not too long ago and your thinking Zombieland, Adventureland. Is this kid going to be in all the movies ending in land. Not to sure on that but he is the main character in this movie as he was in Adventureland. I know you may think this might be kinda cheesy here, but once you get into it you will get that it is not really a waste of time. Eisenberg is a lot like Michael Cera in such that he has little lines throughout the movie, but with Eisenberg he kinda has a twitch to himself which you can see throughout the movie. Im guessing Eisenberg will take on roles Cera won't and hopefully grow in his acting career. Stone does a great job in this movie and I'm interested to see what she will star in next. I've enjoyed these young actors in this movie and they will only get better and have bigger roles to take on in the future. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I expected this movie to be pure junk, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is actually a good movie. This movie presents an offbeat story that is part science-fiction, part action and all comedy. Woody Harrelson gives a strong and amusing performance as a quirky character who is both a hero and buffoon and clearly dominates the story. The movie has lots of action, good continuity, and, unlike most Hollywood products today, is not overly long. The director wastes no footage as he put together what has to be one of the best edited movies maybe in decades. Gone are all the extraneous and superfluous filler that ruins most movies. Here the story is taut, simple, watchable and entertaining. The zombies are reduced to mere animated objects who can be abused and eliminated without a second thought and here lies the rub. For the ghouls that lay in wait for unsuspecting humans were once human themselves and what happened to them was not their fault but the result of something much larger and more profound. Yet the movie skirts the tragic dimensions of the catastrophe that has befallen the world and instead reduces the disaster to the level of a goofy comedy ... and it works. As long as the movie is accepted for what is is, parody, then it is entertaining. But if you are expecting a hand wringing moralistic tale of epic proportions then you may be disappointed, even while you laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know it is really great to go to a movie and truly have fun and feel you got your money's worth. ZOMBIELAND was awesome !!! Killing zombies is cool, really cool when it is done by a perfect collection of social misfits. Do not show up late for this movie or you will miss out on one of the coolest intro I have seen in a long time. Lots of cool clips of zombies in slow motion while letters from credits fall out of the way, simple yet brilliant.I don't know what it is about apocalyptic movies where only a few humans are left standing?I mean sure it would be difficult and dangerous but for some reason the idea of having the world as your playground seems almost like a dream. But I love the concept that 4 of the survivors are on extremes of the social pool.You of course have you gun-toting crazy redneck, probably the only part of society that learns how to use a gun by the time they can walk, played perfectly by Woody Harrelson. The NERD, yep that's right there is always going to be a nerd population that uses its wits and logic to survive, and this one is a sarcastic yet polite person who has developed rules and methods to survive. Jesse Eisenberg pretty much continued the same Adventure land character into the same park just full of zombies. Then you have your con-artist hot girl Emma Stone who has one of the most gorgeous set of eyes I have ever seen, ohh and the rest of her is hot too. And of course there is always the young kid that just finds a way to survive; Abigail Breslin does a great job of delivering in a minimal role.The writers (Rhett Reese + Paul Wernick) and director Ruben Fleischer are young by movie industry standards, did not follow a formula and HIT this movie out of the park. They did not need to rely on stupid formula scare tricks; like "quick zoom camera" or "loud noise before the attack" or the one I hate the most the "turn around look behind you". And the movie has Bill Murray in it?what's not to love there! The only complaint I have about this movie is it should have been longer, to show more zombie whacking or running in to a few more survivors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creative zombie kills and a talented cast make for great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's most admirable about this most recent zombie-crushing comedy is that it knows exactly what zombies are meant for: killing. Funny, creative and most of all low-budget killing. Rookie director Ruben Fleischer and Columbia Pictures capture that essence in the quick but fun "Zombieland," a post-Zombie infection apocalypse action comedy with a small cast and a whole lot of make-up-covered stunt people.To be frank, there's nothing that will blow you away completely in "Zombieland," it's just all executed very well and the story satisfies despite cutting short its character arch and development. Action-wise, Fleischer I'd dare say one-ups Zak Snyder on the slow-motion technique. He holds little back when delivering some of the more gruesome zombie kills. He'll definitely get some potentially lucrative directorial offers with the success of this film, no doubt.The characters are strong but if anything is lost in the film's barely even an hour and a half run time, it's them. Jesse Eisenberg's neurotic virgin unlikely hero only really learns to grow a pair and Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee has both the conscious and subconscious desire to find a Twinkie. Although writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick allude to some good ideas about how a character would feel being one of few survivors in a barren and zombie- polluted United States, namely a person who was anti-social to begin with, no relationships in the film come out of the oven beyond medium-rare.Truthfully, however, the cast is great. Eisenberg is better than Michael Cera at the dorky hero who manages to get the hot chick and Emma Stone is one of the actually talented young "hot chicks" working today. Add Harrelson and Breslin and kudos goes to whoever made the casting decisions. With barely any other characters, a lot falls on them to be real and interesting and as actors, they're all the types who avoid being shallow.What makes "Zombieland" likable in the end, however, is creativity. An ending sequence of Harrelson taking out zombies in an amusement park is just good imaginative thinking by Reese and Wernick. Say what you want about zombie-killing scenes, but you don't feel like you're watching something you've already seen. They understand location is everything in these kinds of films (shopping mall in "Dawn of the Dead" anyone?). A trip to Hollywood to stay in a famous actor's mansion is another example of outside the box."Zombieland" treads the respectable middle ground of delivering quality examples of what it promises and not going too much for glitz and mindless action or the other extreme: shooting way high for excellent character development and drama. The cast and the writers appear capable of that next level, but instead we get more entertainment factor, which is fine considering the entertainment is creative.Zombie genre fans, comedy fans and quirky/creative film fans will all find something to really enjoy out of "Zombieland," one of the better entertainment-driven thrills of the year. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

To me that actor is Jesse eisenberg. His acting is to me is just horrible! That other guy is OK, but never has been one of my favorites. I think it was retarded for them to do whatever just to get a stupid Twinkie. If it was a steak and a beer I would understand, but only for that wasn't worth it. It was some good humor with bill Murray though. I think if he took that no good actors place it probably would of been better. Also I noticed how could he drive as much as he did and never got any gas. It seems like every vehicle in each movie always has a full tank and the best vehicle. Maybe if they would made it like resident evil or something it would have been better. You can also tell that they didn't spend to much to make this one since it was all based in the same city.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mad Cow Disease has mutated into a cannibalistic zombie-producing virus to which only a few people are immune. If adding four emotionally damaged characters including a Twinkie-obsessed nihilistic urban cowboy (Woody Harrelson), a paranoid hypochondriac teenage shut-in (Jesse Eisenberg) and a two-sister teenage con-artist team (Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone) doesn't sound like enough to turn this cyberpunk nightmare into a laugh-out-loud comedy, why not throw in Bill Murray playing himself? I don't see many modern comedies. The theme of 21st century comedy is more often than not stupidity, which does not amuse me. What enticed me to see this film was the combination of the concept and Woody Harrelson. With the exception of 2012, Harrelson has not made a lot of bad career choices, and - let's face it - zombies have great comedic potential. I was mostly unfamiliar with the rest of the primary cast (Murray's role is a cameo), but, midway through the film I recognized Abigail Breslin from the excellent Little Miss Sunshine. Despite its unusual premise, Zombieland, like most contemporary comedies, is presented from the perspective of a twenty-something male - its target demographic. Eisenberg's character tells the story as something between a diary and a primer on survival in Zombieland. Predictably, his romantic interest - played by Stone - is the least well-developed character in the film. Harrelson and Eisenberg's characters, however, are more than enough to carry Zombieland.As with many contemporary comedies, it is not very strongly plotted, but unlike many of of its competitors, its characters are made memorable by a script which makes the most out of both the acting talent and the plot's significant elements. My only disappointment with this film was what seemed like an unnecessarily wandering and lengthy transition between the film's first (survival) and second plots (learning how to care), bridged by the Bill Murray cameo. While this transition offered some crucial back-story concerning the primary characters, its lack of action seemed incongruous with the rest of the film. Nicely paced and filmed, smarter than average, and funny, Zombieland is worth seeing - once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of laughs, snappy dialog, Harrelson at his best, what more can you want?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As our local cinema was celebrating its 250th Surprise Sneak Preview showing, people were expecting a special movie, fitting the occasion. I was a little disappointed when "Zombieland" came up, because I am not a great fan of zombie flicks. Even the praised "Shaun of the Dead" didn't manage to impress me very much.But "Zombieland" turned out to be a genuine surprise. Jessie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson make a great team on screen, playing two starkly contrasting characters. Eisenberg's over-anxious, geeky college kid "Columbus", who relies on a set of fixed rules in order to survive, is put against Harrelson's "Tallahassee", a rough but likable cowboy type with a maniac edge, who likes to kill zombies for fun.Their chemistry works well and B-movies such as "Tremors" come to mind, where the banter and quarrel between main characters is at least as entertaining as their fight against evil low-budget monsters. Soon, con girls "Wichita" and "Little Rock" join the road trip, and an uncomplicated, straight-forward love story develops. The whole plot is extremely simple, so don't expect twists and turns. I guess that's what makes this flick so likable - its simplicity: just plain, old-fashioned fun. Lots of laughs, snappy dialog, Harrelson at his best, what more can you want? One word about the gore - yes there is quite a lot of blood and violence. Personally, even though I dislike excessive gore, I couldn't take it serious here. For me it was more part of the setting than anything else. Zombies, monsters or giant worms - who cares. Then again, a friend's girlfriend left the theater shortly after the opening credits, so be warned in case you don't appreciate the habitual use of double-barrel shotguns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant mix of comedy and a true zombie-bloodbath!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the title of Zombieland I was intrigued and excited, because I really like zombie movies. They all seem to be somewhat funny, because Zombies are all just very dumb, walking around, waiting to eat, and look completely and utterly wasted. Very passive, until a car swings around the corner, just to stop, have a guy in cowboy boots step out, and slowly kill them all with a smile on his lip - real bad-ass. Zombieland grabs the exact base of zombie-fans, and puts in a pretty good plot, set in the post-apocalyptic America. During the movie, there were so many hilarious moments, as well as a whole lot of kick-ass zombie-killer moves. I definitely would rate this movie as the best action-comedy of the year, trailed closely by Norwegian "Dod Sne" which also has a big humor element mixed into the zombie-infected plot. A must see, if you can handle some ass-whooping and blood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Aiming for amusement with the undead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombie comedies really seem to be coming along in increasing numbers over the last few years and, yet, it's hard to get them just right. There is, for me, a holy trinity of zom-coms including The Return Of The Living Dead, Braindead and Shaun Of The Dead. To break into that trinity would be quite a feat in itself but to get close enough to hover around in a holding pattern in fourth place is also a great achievement. Zombieland, unreservedly, takes that fourth place for now.The world has become overrun by zombies, go figure, and two loners team up for a while to help each other reach their destinations alive. Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, a young lad who was already nervous enough of anything in life before a zombie problem appeared and who now survives thanks to his lengthy list of rules he tries to adhere to at all times. Woody Harrelson plays Tallahassee, an angry man who has finally found his calling in life as he maims, ridicules and kills anything undead that crosses his path. As the two men come across two females (played by Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) you just know that it's only a matter of time before things start getting strained and those essential rules start being broken.It's hard to really put a finger on the way this movie gets so much right. For a start, it definitely seems to make more of it's budget than most horror comedies manage. There's an impressive mix of great FX work and polished violence (some comedic, some surprisingly brutal). The script is smart and consistently amusing, helped by performances that are uniformly pitch-perfect. Harrelson stands out as one of the best modern genre heroes but Eisenberg is totally endearing and the girls develop as the movie progresses. And let's not forget a cameo to rival even that comedic performance given by a mystery star in Tropic Thunder. Overall, I just have to say hats off to director Ruben Fleischer for blending the ingredients together so perfectly and providing fans with a complete blast that, while up there with the other greats of this subgenre, does it's job in a different enough way to feel unique and fresh. Superb.See this if you like: Shaun Of The Dead, Braindead, The Return Of The Living Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hollywood's sad attempt at a B-pic with some heart.. but hey zombie flicks are a moneymaker right? People just love seeing re-animated corpses get sliced, diced, burned, blended.. well I couldn't name them all. For some odd reason these zombie films are fascinatingly entertaining to us, and there are some fantastic ones out there with great stories. Zombieland doesn't even step close to being in that category. Everything about it seemed very generic to me and reminiscent of an ongoing list of zombie films like it with nothing really interesting happening.The one thing this pointless shoot em up at least spared us from is that age old endless zombie film saying said many ways "shoot them in the head, and they'll die.". It's like they just have to remind you. "In case you forgot sledgehammering them in the head like a watermelon is a great way too kids!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Case Of The Munchies Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that when I went to see Zombieland I wasn't quite prepared for what I was getting. When it started out I honestly thought it was a variation on the Charlton Heston science fiction classic, The Omega Man which also dealt with some human survivors of a plague that's left the rest of humanity the victim of some horrid disease.Instead I got a good natured farce of a film about this same kind of apocalyptic event. The action is narrated by one of four survivors who find themselves thrown together in this case college student Jesse Eisenberg. The other three are Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. These characters are not referred to by name, merely places either destinations or places of origin.Harrelson has the best most broadly expansive role in the film. It's a scenery chewing part and Harrelson dines on it the way those zombies devour surviving humans.I never did get just exactly how this disease spread and why these four should have been so lucky to be spared. Usually those details are important in science fiction, but I got swept up in the general enjoyment that the cast was having with this film that I didn't care after a while.I agree with other reviewers that this film is destined to become a cult classic. Another future Rocky Horror Picture Show has been born.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Very Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw zombieland last weekend with a group of friends, and i have to say it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in quite some time. While it does fall under the genre of zombie/horror films it doesn't exactly live up to that description, i would say it was way more into the comedy drama.As one could expect the plot and storyline were not very in depth, and the movie left very little to be had that wasn't in the previews. However, there were a few brief shining moments of an in-depth plot, especially when it came to the past lives of the main characters, before they came to live in zombieland.The acting amongst the characters and their relationships i thought was decent, at least enough so that it got the story going and kept it going, and left no dead spaces in the film. From beginning to end i was involved and entertained by this film. Woody Harrelson was the one who most surprised me, and i was very impressed by. Seeing as the last movie i had seen him in was kingpin, i went into the movie with the feeling he was going to be the weak point, however i felt he brought the film together quiet well. His out of control antics and over the top hatred for zombies mirrored his father-figure roll in the group and his devastating past(thats a spoiler i'll leave out for those who haven't seen the film).Overall i definitely enjoyed this film, and can't wait for the DVD release to see it again. Filled with a lot of moments that made me yell in excitement, Zombieland left no horror film death untouched, and no joke untold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, a Stunning Movie Satisfying Today's Pop Culture + Epic Awesomeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland, a tittle which is so simple and descriptive. What is "brilliant" about this movie is that like every other zombie movie, it puts YOU in the front seat of one of the worlds most unique Apocalyptic scenarios, but it does it with a tasteful and comedic twist. The twist mostly playing on the 21st century's internet and video game persona. Unlike other zombie movies with the exception of "Shaun of The Dead", this movie plays out the idea that we're not idiots and we know what zombies are. So there is no time wasted explaining how the events which formed Zombieland. The massive video-game influences of this film is what seriously makes it so enjoyable especially if you're an avid video-gamer. The fact that characters in the film never had any remorse for the carnage that they were inflicting with spewing blood and gore is something that any gamer understands because beating on stupid zombies is just FUN. In this movie zombies aren't crazed terrifying cannibals but stress relieving masses of meat where characters like Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) make an art out of zombie killing. So if you're looking for a movie which is hilarious and violent while being familiar and yet original plus being a fan of violent zombie killing video games, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Zombie Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland, what most had expected to be just a rip off of the cult classic Shaun of the Dead ended up being one of the funniest films I have seen this year. I had a feeling from the trailer that this was going to be good, but Zombieland was a lot better than I had anticipated. This film delivers in everything: scares, gore, action, romance, and perfect comedic timing. Woody Harrelson is on top of his game this year with several movie hits under his belt the past couple of years, he comes back to his true form of comedy with Zombieland. Both he and Abigail Breslin stole the show and could honestly have carried the movie on their own. Zombieland also took it's typical concept with the clichés of zombies and took today's twist on it. After all, we've all see a zombie movie or 2 in our life time. We're always screaming something at the screen on what we think the character should do and that's what our main character is all about: The Rules of Zombieland.In a post-apocalyptic context, beginning with narration from Columbus, a college student, who is on his way to Columbus, Ohio to see if his parents are alright. He begins by explaining his "rules" for surviving the zombie apocalypse. After surviving a few zombie attacks, he encounters Tallahassee, whose life goal is to find the remaining Twinkies on Earth. As Columbus and Tallahassee search a grocery store for Twinkies, they meet two girls, Wichita and Little Rock. Through a con, the girls get their weapons and car, but the men find a Humvee loaded with weapons and head out to find the girls. Later, the girls use their own weapons to get the Hummer after their stolen car breaks down. After a small fight, Columbus convinces them that it's better to stick together. They decide to drive towards Pacific Playland, an amusement park that is supposedly zombie-free.Zombieland is going to be a hit and I'm sure another classic down the line. It was just a blast to watch. I think that Bill Murray scene is going to be remembered for years to come, but I can't give any spoilers away, you're just going to have to trust me and the others on the IMDb comment boards are talking about. All the actors in this movie worked so well together and were a total pleasure to watch on screen battle it out with these flesh eaters. Also you gotta love that Woody Harrelson's main goal of the movie is to get a twinkie, but I tell you when you have a craving, you have a craving. I told my boyfriend who knows how I get when I have a craving that I totally knew what Woody was talking about, lol. I would recommend Zombieland to others, this was a fun fast paced film with that delivered what the audience wanted and more.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did not like it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a zombie movie, it had less gore than the opening scenes in Tropic Thunder. It did feel like it tried too hard, without getting it right at all. And how did the girls survive at all when they are so mind numbingly unaware of how to handle zombies? They may have been great con artists, although I would NOT go out of my way to help a woman who clearly stated she was engaged. But they had apparently no clue on zombie rules. Also, I found it odd that there were perhaps 100-200 zombies in the entire area of the country that the gang experienced. I faced more zombies on my original Xbox in Hunter the Reckoning. There were huge lulls where no threat of any kind appeared. Shaun of the Dead was funny because they took the extraordinary and experienced it as ordinary average people. While there was not the inexplicable Japanese style bikini clad chick fighting zombies, the gang did not seem to put any thought to armor or at least thick leather clothes and precautions against infection. Startling number of locales with what I can only assume was self sustaining generators. I love zombie movies and games and this was a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The One-Line Zingers Just Kept Coming And Never Let Up!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a pretty big RomZomCom fan. Loved SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Thought FIDO was brilliant (kind of mix of Zombies meet PLEASANTVILLE or Lassie). So I was pretty hyped to get a look at ZOMBIELAND.The premise is really nothing new: Zombies show up. Take over the world. A group of survivors has to make their way through the maze-like brain-eaters on their way to ...somewhere. But this time we get some seriously dysfunctional people who are forced to ban together and become a gun-blazing family. The patriarch of this unusual gathering is none other than Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) who supposedly lost a puppy that's caused him to go a bit loco into Zombie slaughtering. He'll pound 'em to death with a banjo (while strumming a little ditty from DELIVERANCE ...and you might even catch him saying a few lines from that unique film), cut their heads off with pruning sheers, or just fill them full of lead. The son of this disturbed family is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, THE SQUID AND THE WHALE), an introvert shut-in who has difficulty forming human connections because of his excessive nerdiness (think Mountain Dew drinking, World of Warcraft playing loner and you'll be right on the mark ...literally). Columbus has survived by alienating himself from everyone and everything ...and by creating a laundry list of rules that have helped him stay Zombie-free (Rule #1 ? Cardio. Rule #3 ? Beware of bathrooms ...which have contributed to Columbus' irritable bowel problems. The list goes all the way up into the 30s and you can occasionally see the rules placed at varying intervals throughout the movie whenever their usefulness is used within its framework). Columbus and Tallahassee team up as they head across the USA ? from East to West ? and eventually encounter two scam artist sisters: the lovely Wichita (Emma Stone, SUPERBAD) and her younger sibling Little Rock (Abigail Breslin, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE). The two girls steal the mens guns and transportation only to later meet up and join with them on this cross country trek.The great thing about Zombieland is that it really isn't dramatic at all. It is purely comedic, even when you feel they might be heading toward the dramatic. For instance, once Columbus discovers why Tallahassee if really messed up (not because of a dog), the audience is lead to believe there will be this sweet, touching moment. But don't be foolish! Tallahassee comes up with another one-line zinger that keeps the film's comedic timing right on track.The romantic portions of the film are confined to Columbus' desires to brush Wichita's hair back over her ear ...and one little kiss. So, again, the comedy just kept coming.It was also great that the film never went overboard in terms of time. At only 87 minutes in total, the movie moves along at a pace and doesn't wander in the slightest.Comparisons between this flick and SHAUN OF THE DEAD are already being made (no surprise). They both have their strengths. Shaun of the Dead ruled because it wasn't one-liners that kept it going, but a continuous montage of comedic events that spilled one on-top of another, and just kept snowballing. But Zombieland has the zingers. The one-liners are excellently placed within the story. My favorite one was "Thank God for rednecks!" And you can't not mention Bill Murray, the surprise pseudo-Zombie guest star. His short but extremely funny part was vital to the story (and remember to stay in the theater until after the credits finish rolling for a special treat).So some might want to weigh which was the better RomZomCom: Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. But there's no need. They're both in firmly in the genre, and are excellent portrayals in their own comedic right. Enjoy them both. I know I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really put off by the trying too hardedness of this movie. the images were really ugly throughout almost the whole thing cause too much damn crap was in each shot. I mean half the shots in the movie have about 165 pumpkins in the frame. &amp; there are too many extras in the film running around trick or treating. it's supposed to be a small town it looks more like manhattan or tokyo for the crowding. it's like the writer kept going back saying "I have another idea!" and extras casting was going, "oh look here's another person we can put in the movie!" and the set designer "I found another pumpkin!"also, there are about 10 villains oncscreen at any given time! it's all bit much! what bothered even more was stuff that characters did on screen to fake out the audience that made no sense within the scene. the sequences that offended most mightily were the backyard burial and subsequent pumpkin carving set up, the first of which was also a protracted instance of something played for laughs which prove unfortunately not to be forthcoming. (I also really didn't care for the sort of "fat ass" humor of the scene with the red haired kid that preceded these). Also the story with rhonda and the bitch and gang and quarry certainly contains the best material in the movie. it's too bad that you end up asking yourself what they would have done for a victim if rhonda hadn't ended up accidentally in their group. the one story that actually had no holes and made sense from start to finish was the one with the clearly somewhat "off" women. as for the ending... focusing on that guy and his vaugely iterated backstory didn't exactly make for a glorious finish.I do appreciate the attempt to make an integrated "omnibus" type film, but. . . this wasn't quite the way to do it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland: More of Woody kicking butt would have saved it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never go to a Zombie movie unless it looks like it contains some quality. What hooked me on Zombieland was the opportunity to see Woody Harrelson doing some butt kicking in a light hearted way. I liked him best when he tried to be funny. I felt sorry for him in earlier disastrous movies. I avoided him until I saw the trailer for Zombieland. Seeing him dressed up to kill Zombies really got my hopes up. So I went to see Zombieland.Woody was the best part of the movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't know how to use his character. Just from the trailers alone, I felt this was going to be great fun watching dead walking people get even deader. Woody shooting the walking dead...Woody hacking the walking dead...Woody smashing the walking dead - what more could one want? Seeing him do this sort of thing in more serious roles with non-dead people just didn't do it for me. I saw the trailer and felt, the guy's humor is back and he is going to have fun. I am glad he had the role of Tallahassee but apparently the geniuses behind this movie thought Eisenbergs character would win us over. WRONG!!! Eisenberg has a definite cute factor but he is always wimpy. He should never be a main character. How anyone saw it best to let his character override Harrelson's is beyond me. I will admit that the beginning of the movie had me feeling optimistic. Starting out as though some early teenage kid had just written this Zombie movie in his bedroom in a few hours, the narration had me smiling from ear to ear and laughing out loud. It had a great feeling in the beginning. But then the long (I mean l-o-o-o-n-g) musical introduction kicked in and began to drag everything down. That is until Woody made his first appearance. I was once again hopeful. Sadly, as his character was moved from front and center to off center stage, the movie became less and less funny.Bill Murray's short appearance helped break monotony. But, to heck with that, let's get back to the wimp and see if he can get some sympathy from Emma Stone. YAWN. Eisenberg translates to "boring; must avoid future possible funny films with him".I will be fair, though. A younger generation may appreciate this movie for its abused zombies if they couldn't care less that this felt very much like an extended, bad Saturday Night Live skit. You have to go in knowing this is a comedy involving stupidity and flesh eating zombies. For that alone, it gets a 7 but denying Woody a better developed and more completely used character earns the movie a 5.</fullReview>

Oh but just found out that I haven't written enough so I will say one thing else...If you thought the Bill Murray bit was hilarious then you really are brain dead and obviously also think that Ben Stiller is a comic genius. This movie has received countless good reviews and my 20 year old son recommended it along with many others, but unlike District 9 which was a good 'odd' movie this film is was just a boring ride across the States with people shooting zombies, well that's never been done before, anyhow it's hard to tell the difference nowadays between real life Americans and the zombies featured in the movie, another stupid film from an unimaginative film industry aimed at an idiot American public. bite me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young man must cope with life in the midst of a zombie apocalypse as he joins a tough redneck and two sisters in a fight for survival, romance, and twinkees.The zombie genre has always seemed to make for the best horror-comedies. There's Return of the Living Dead (1985), Dead Alive (1992), and Shaun of the Dead (2004), just to name a few; now we have a little gem called Zombieland and it certainly lives up to all the previous "zom com's". Zombieland is a terrifically fun film. It has lightning-fast pacing, hard-hitting action, and a fantastically colorful sense of humor. This is one excellently well-written comedy that packs genuinely effective laughs into nearly every scene - which is a feat in itself. The dialog is often hilarious and the comic gags are clever. The characters are endearing and very likable. The direction is quite good and there's plenty of gruesome zombie chaos for genre fans to enjoy.The cast is great. Jesse Eisenberg is a joy as the wimp-turned-lovesick-hero. Woody Harrelson has never played a more colorful character and he's a complete hoot. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are solid as the two sisters. Bill Murray is a welcomed sight as he makes an uproariously funny cameo - playing himself no less.Zombieland is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in ages. It's a comedy that more than delivers on what it promises and becomes a superior horror-comedy that's not just for zombie fans. It is destined to be a cult classic. See it!**** out of ****</fullReview>

I felt dumb and outwitted half way through when the cast visits Bill Murray's supposed Beverley Hills mansion. Embarrassing, it seemed like a prolonged out-take. Murray play-acted as in a TV sketch. His portrayal of himself wasn't honest. It became apparent that the makers had a good-o-time developing the story as they went along.However, the fun-park segment at the end saved the film . . . barely.The television ads for "Zombieland" had Johnny Cash's music. Cash's vocals would have adequately provoked the dark humor this flesh-eating, Southern-Gothic nightmare attempted to impart. Obviously, they used Cash's music as a draw. But his voice was never heard.False advertising and a substandard script will make this film easy for me to forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well we all like a bit of a schlock horror comedy to relieve the boredom and stress and not take life too seriously but this??? What happened to the script? The writer must've walked out near the beginning and left the actors and crew to sort of make it up as they go along. What we get is a bunch of bored actors just ad libbing as they drive around the U.S. feigning some bon homie between themselves. There's no tension or excitement but lots of clichés. Road movies are usually great for a music score but where's the soundtrack? There isn't one memorable tune. There are no jokes. Well, there was at the beginning when our nerdy hero says he was always a loner because everyone seemed like a zombie to him before they..............became real zombies. That kinda perked my interest. But even that got jerked off when the final moral of the story becomes: you're a zombie if you don't have friends. Duh! Make your mind up. Jeeeez!! Maybe all the conspiracy theorists are right and this is all part of an elaborate plan by the Pentagon to dumb down America before the final takeover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Zombieland, and yet I was left feeling unsatisfied. It seems to have been well reviewed because there is nothing necessarily bad about the movie, but beyond a few laughs, there really isn't much good about Zombieland either. I wanted to like it, and I enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie, but then I got this sinking feeling that it just isn't going anywhere. There's some stabs at character development, but it is incredibly simplified - the main character is a neurotic baby Woody Allen type, Tallahassee is tough because he lost someone or something, and the girls don't trust anyone, because... they just don't. Some people have been comparing this to "Shaun of the dead", but I think that was a vastly superior film, mainly because the zombies were an actual threat in "Shaun". In Zombieland, the zombies exist more for their slapstick appeal. The plot is loose and unconnected, and makes no real sense. This is a movie that cried for a dark side, just a glint of pain, disaster, personal loss. I was not a fan of the ending either, it felt like a TV ending, leaving everything open so there can be a sequel, and almost nothing is resolved. The acting is solid, I have to lay the blame on the script, the story's arc was weak, even if many of the scenes were strong. Finally, don't get me wrong, it's worth seeing, just not worth gushing over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Next Shaun of the Dead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland (2009): Dir: Ruben Fleischer / Cast: Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigale Breslin, Bill Murray: Horror comedy about a decayed society where zombies roam about for blood and any remaining people struggle to survive. Although the ending never really resolves anything, the screenplay is detailed and unique climaxing at an amusement park where Zombies are splattered with creativity. Directed by Ruben Fleischer with graphic yet effective production. While the zombie comedy theme was also effective in Shaun of the Dead, Fleischer also has fun with many humorous scenes involving zombies in not so desirable light. Jesse Eisenberg narrates his fears and lack of family. He first gives an effective narration regarding the rules of zombie survival, then he encounters Woody Harrelson, a zombie killer. Harrelson steals the film as a twinkie craving zombie killer who takes them to the home of a famous Hollywood persona. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin play two females who aren't who they seem. They steal their weapons while relying on each other for survival but eventually Eisenberg calls for a truce. Bill Murray is involved in the film's best joke when he appears to be playing himself undercover in this zombie society. While the world view presented here is hopeless and depressing, its society satire makes it one of the more clever zombie movies. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw Zombieland I was a little underwhelmed but this is a film that pays off with repeat viewings. Following a zombie holocaust a disparate small band of survivors trek across America.A superb cast bring the witty script to life. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as the geeky hero but the acting honours go to Woody Harrelson as the slightly deranged Tallahasse, a man obsessed by Twinkies. Add in support from two of the best young actresses in Hollywood, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin and you really can't go wrong. There is even a nice cameo from Bill Murray. This is a fast and entertaining film which mixes laughs and gore to great effect. It's like an American Shaun of the Dead and if you liked that then you should find this worth watching. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Emma Stone and Zombie movie. First I thought this movie would be containing many horror part, But it turn out to be hilarious and funny. No one would ever imagine this movie to be a educational and comedy one. I love the way Columbus and Tallahassee work together. I never know I would be laughing really loud, trying to catch my breathe on a zombie movie. Comedy, Horror, Romance and Adventure is everything I like about a movie. When Wichita and Columbus kiss, It just make everyone at my house goes "aweee".The part when Columbus saving Wichita and her sister at the amusement park really make me wanna following his step "Be a hero". These two combining is really the best for me. I would like to recommend this movie to teenager and comedy fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surviving a zombie apocalypse, a group of rag-tag heroes try to survive in the world where the dead are constantly growing in numbers and try not to kill each other before the zombies do as they try to reach safety.Overall this was quite an enjoyable and fun zombie comedy. That this one stays in the realm of keeping the zombies here as something to be respected and feared in the situation which is always a plus and makes for one of the bright spots in here. The early examination of the rules for survival is a prime feature here for that, making this one treat the main creatures something to be taken seriously even though there's a lot of fun to be had here elsewhere. There's a joy to be had here from the gleeful and over-the-top ways this one goes about doling out the details here which are just quite fun and cheesy not only based on having a spectacular gimmick but also featuring an even greater way of keeping the zombies as threats here and carrying that thread along here as well. That allows this one to get in plenty of exciting action scenes here that are a lot of fun, from the opening attack in the bedroom apartment and the early road scenes of the two which provide this one with plenty of fun, action-packed scenes that offer up some comedy as well. It all gets dropped off later on during the finale at the amusement park which offers this one a large amount of gags utilizing the location to great effect, from the roller coasters and thrill rides to the souvenir shops and concession stands all coming into play here in a hail of gunfire that allows for some nice stunt-work and action along with the few comedic lines thrown in to help this one. As well, the fine make-up and gore here allows for some great-looking zombies to finally round out the positives against the rather few negatives present. The biggest issue to this one is the entire middle section to this one being play off without any attacks at all and is more of an endless stream of teasing between the girls engaging in an endless stream of mind-games that build to absolutely nothing with all of the scenes foreshadowing a finale quite easily. It's not as special as it seems to think this is and really just drags out the pacing unevenly throughout this section. As well, the film's other problem here, and one that might crop up for some where is the comedy which might be a little too goofy or cheesy to some which is somewhat of a problem for this one. These here are the film's main problems.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

(see my American savage index) category 3. all movie reinforces cultural doctrine of their target audience. this is for "those" people from "those" place that define "those" view points. category 4. it was fun? was it worth it? i give it a 4. if i didn't see it. i would have not worry about it.category 5. i want to punch all the characters in the face. the fact that all of the main character falls on the spectrum of psychopathy as a antihero is consider "cool" among teen audience( aka the " jackass" crowd) non have moral center i find it annoying. and not in a fun way like dumb and dumber. my American savage index is about the propaganda and cultural rejection or acceptance of the "others". those" savages" those "outsiders" those "antiheros" in our need to define our own moral and cultural identity . these movies reinforce our need to watch vicious act as entertainment and justify them as act of justice. in these movies, viciousness may or may not be gory. it's in story itself, in that context. the index goes as follows. 10 on the extreme deep,1 on the shallow end. example. my brother keeper would be a 1. wall street would be a 4 just like rocky and the god father. Sophie's choice would be a 5 or 6. reservoir dog, platoon, the deer hunter would be 8 or 9. i try very hard to avoid watching 9 and 10. so from the hero, the"savagery" of the boxer, in rocky to the anti hero, the savagery of wall street broker Gordon gekko. all are American mythological creatures in the movie, a mirror or a projection of ourself. by the way the reality index is another subject matter.</fullReview>

However, the end they show none of the same moxie that defined them. Ditching the truck seemed to set up the rescue, but little else, for who would give up their vehicle while a horde of zombies were chasing you? Many here compare this movie to Shaun of the dead-the sensibility of an UK humorist, and an American humorist seems light years apart to me. Over all the flick surely has merit and Bill Murray cameo was pitch perfect, and his dissing Garfield gave me a laugh-This movie was filmed in the town I was living in at the time, Newnan, GA-for that reason alone I give it a watchable rate of 7?all the actors shine ..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I've pretty much seen and enjoyed most zombie films ? everything from George A Romero's offerings to the general silly B-movies featuring shuffling corpses eating people's brains. So I was always going to put 'Zombieland' on my 'to watch' list. As soon as I heard it pretty much had A-list actors in it and a theatrical release, I was definitely looking forward to it. Plus it's worth noting that most people who saw it loved it.I didn't love it.Granted, I didn't hate it. It kind of left little impression on me ? neither good nor bad. Yeah, there were some humorous moments where I giggled, but, generally, I found it a bit forgettable. As the title would suggest, the world has been overrun by the living dead and there are few humans left, desperately trying to survive. Jessie Eisenberg is our 'hero' who talks us through the 'rules' of how to live in a world where most of the population is trying to eat you. His voice-over is pretty funny, but after the first act it kind of drops off when he meets his 'love interest' and they head to a theme park.I think the biggest flaw in it comes near the end. I'm not sure I can mention it as it probably constitutes a 'spoiler,' but it's generally to do with a weird (and rather stupid) decision made by the two girls which totally goes against anything a sane person would do in a world infested by zombies.For some reason I just couldn't really get over that and no matter how good the rest of the film was, that one moment of madness (involving doing something that literally drew the attention of every flesh-eater in Los Angeles to them).After a second viewing I do like it a little more. It's not a bad film. It has gore. It has laughs and it has a good celebrity cameo from Bill Murray. I just wish they'd changed that one (theme park-related) aspect towards the end. It really bugs me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is not dissimilar to Shaun of the Dead in its level of probing satire and bleak humour. The half indie-horror and half angsty comedy - on a level parring with Juno - Zombieland uses the undead as a metaphor for growing up, the inevitable fight between wild youth and the grey conformity of adulthood, and where else are we safe but a theme park completely devoid of all zombies. The longer I think of Zombieland the smarter it gets, but unfortunately I didn't really enjoy watching it that much enough to want to watch it again. The ever-pleasing Emma Stone was wonderful once again, however not much else is there to stifle the interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The product of an image.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It happens to everyone. An obsession over an image. Anyone who does anything creative will know it can take as little as a single image to trigger an idea or a piece of writing or a poem. Or, in this case, an entire feature-length movie. No actual names are used, instead places of origin. Colombus (Eisenberg) is a college student trying to find his parents in Ohio, Tallahassee (Herrelsen) is in a hunt for Twinkies (Natick anyone?) and on their journey they run into Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) who are trying to reach an amusement park supposedly free of zombies. And herein lies the obsession. The writers clearly had an image of zombies in a theme park and thought cool cool. Let's make zombies in a theme park. Cool. That's a cool idea. So, without any particular explanation, the loose story is set up to this climax. The writers can practically be heard screaming out how great their image is. It is unclear whether Jesse Eisenberg was so good in The Social Network, that Mark Zuckerberg was such a defining role for him or that he is just not a particularly versatile actor. Because at best, the role feels like a warm-up for his uncannily good performance as Facebook's creator. Surely enough, as one point he mentions Facebook in the movies and then it is impossible to see anything but Zuckerberg. Woody Harrelsen does his tough guy, mouth too small for face, tongue too big for mouth performance but is absolutely not the best he has been as some have been saying. Try Kingpin or True Detective for some brilliant Woody Harrelsen. Bill Murray is the film's high point in his cameo, but does seem like comedy filler. Like a large proportion of the movie, it is unnecessary. What is the most disappointing thing of all about Zombieland, however, is that it doesn't live up to its potential. The opening is pacey and exciting, immediately it screams new stance on the zombie franchise. Alas, it never builds on that promise and where it should have exploded, it peters out. A real shame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is why we go to the movies. It's fun and never takes its self seriously. A more than welcome addition to the ever growing genre: the Zom-com. Zombieland is a near perfect film. It has likable actors, good dialogue, lots of over the top action and is very funny at times. I won't spoil it for you, but it features one of the greatest cameos in the history of film. I wish more actors would take themselves less seriously. Film would surely be the beneficiary. Maybe zombie flicks aren't your thing, but I would give this one a shot. Is it gory at times? Yes, of course it is, but it's so over the top it's hard not to laugh. My only complaint is that I would have liked it to be a little longer. In the end, Zombieland might be the most fun you have at the movies all year. In a climate where Hollywood continues to release unwatchable films every weekend, Zombieland is a breath of fresh air.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent, gross and so much fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this somewhat different post-apocalyptic comedy, we learn among other things how much fun it can be to kill the undead in pretty much any way you could possibly imagine, and some you don't even want to imagine. It's the first full big screen feature for director Ruben Fleischer, who was far from being a rookie before after having learned the business from the scratch by having worked on short films and television before including a couple Jimmy Kimmel episodes for example. Same can be said pretty much for the two writers, who just recently returned to Zombieland and wrote a TV pilot. It included some references to the movie, like the characters of course or the "Zombie Killer of the Month" or whatever it was called. It wasn't too bad, just the material not that fresh anymore and nobody from the original cast returned to pick up his role again. So consequently, it was not picked up for a series.Anyway, back to the film. Besides the zombie killing, it also includes a nice little story on human bonding. Central character is played by Jesse Eisenberg, who keeps telling us from early on how rules helped him survive the zombie apocalypse and plays his usual sarcastic loner character, maybe the weakest performance from the quartet here, but mostly because the other 4 are just so damn fine. The best performances comes from Woody Harrelson, who once again finds the perfect balance between comedy and drama. Of course it helps that his character is such a badass zombie mass murderer and that he's got the best quotes of the pack as well. Some highlights: "You wanna f... Wichita? Sure why not. She's been f...ing us the last 24 hours." Or the scene where Eisenberg is depressed from watching a zombie eat out some corpse and all Harrelson's character feels is his ravenous appetite for Twinkies rising. Or that scene where he's in that little house at the theme park and with hundreds of zombies closing in you wonder if he's really sacrificing himself for the others. But nope, he kills them all. Good thing he enters the picture before the ten-minute mark and stays there until the end. Wasily the best thing about the film and definitely nomination-worthy. But he got in for his other 2009 film "The Messenger" and probably ended up runner-up to Waltz, so I won't complain.The two girls play interesting characters too and initially put up a nice fight to the guys with their car-stealing stick in order to make the little one's roller-coaster dream come true. The way they were introduced may have been the best thing about them. Oh and then there's Bill Murray of course in a cameo. No need to elaborate on that. The words "Bill Murray in a cameo" should be enough for everybody to run and rent the film right now. The scene with Murray and Harrelson in fanboy mode was so much fun. Stone just stood next and was amazed, just like she'd probably have been if she wasn't acting. The giant clown zombie near the end reminded me of the cult classic "Killer Klowns from Outer Space", quite a fun movie too. Besides that, Zombieland has lots of interesting movie references, decent music (Puppy Love, Metallica and even some Mozart). It's not a must-watch by any means, but a very funny 90 minutes with an uplifting ending and that's why I recommend it, especially to folks who want to get into the zombie genre. This one may be a good start because of its mass appeal. Also, thanks to Columbus' rulebook, you'll be prepared for the day when zombies inevitably really take over. So you really read all that??? Now get your ass up for some cardio, folks!</fullReview>

Kristl interjected."And there are some funny running gags that are well, spaced out and given twists to keep them interesting such as the double tap: making sure a zombie is really dead by shooting it twice if necessary. Or the rules of surviving the zombie holocaust. Or the zombie killing of the week. All in all a fun movie. What do you think?""You are right. It is a fun movie."

		<fullReview>This movie is not that amazing. It's kinda cute and quirky, but suffers from being same-old. Nothing really happens of any significance. It's like the first draft made it to final draft without much work in between. The "rules" are OK but... I'm getting sleepy thinking about this movie.There's a few laughs, and a few nice zombie killing scenes, but at no time do you feel you're watching anything new or original.In any apocalyptic movie, comedy or otherwise, the audience will ask questions and notice inconsistencies. Things like why the power is still on, why they aren't using radios or checking TV to listen for other survivors, why the 2 girls would bother with an amusement park. Things need justifying even in a zombie comedy, otherwise its just lazy film making. And that's my awesome review of Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie start up brilliantly. It got the push to get you involved and wanting more, a refreshing look and very good humor. It doesn't have as much blood as you could expect from a zombie film, although a couple of scenes are pretty gory. Anyway, as I say, the jokes, the comedy, is great. That said, things go a bit down when the film advances. There are moments when this movie tries to be serious and, at that, it fails badly. Those serious moments are supposed to be emotional. They simply slow down the movie and make it feel, well, not so good. And predictable.This is a fun film to watch and, even with the clichéd emotional moments, the funny parts and the amazing acting (except for the 2 female roles) is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland has a lot going for it, but it tries too hard and too much. It never quite makes up its mind on whether it wants to be a parody, an action movie, a road movie or a coming-of-age drama; which isn't a bad thing by itself (some of the best films ever made are the ones that defy definition under any specific genre) but Zombieland plays each genre by the book, feeling like a montage of clichés; the best example of this is the Bill Murray segment, which, while it's the funniest in the movie, feels completely out of place and seems to have been glued in just to add a few laughs to an otherwise mostly jokeless comedy. While the movie is a lot of fun - the pacing is mostly flawless, Woody Harrelson is wonderfully cool (Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone are not at their best, but Abigal "Little Miss Sunshine" Breslin makes up for it with a compact but wonderful performance) and the premise - basically, a zombie movie with no gore or deaths (well, hardly any) is appealing but the movie fell flat for me. Shaun of the Dead wasn't perfect either but it had more groove.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world has become overrun by zombies, go figure, and two loners team up for a while to help each other reach their destinations alive. Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, a young lad who was already nervous enough of anything in life before a zombie problem appeared and who now survives thanks to his lengthy list of rules he tries to adhere to at all times. Woody Harrelson plays Tallahassee, an angry man who has finally found his calling in life as he maims, ridicules and kills anything undead that crosses his path. As the two men come across two females (played by Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) you just know that it's only a matter of time before things start getting strained and those essential rules start being broken.It's hard to really put a finger on the way this movie gets so much right. For a start, it definitely seems to make more of it's budget than most horror comedies manage. There's an impressive mix of great FX work and polished violence (some comedic, some surprisingly brutal). The script is smart and consistently amusing, helped by performances that are uniformly pitch-perfect. Harrelson stands out as one of the best modern genre heroes but Eisenberg is totally endearing and the girls develop as the movie progresses. And let's not forget a cameo to rival even that comedic performance given by a mystery star in Tropic Thunder. Overall, I just have to say hats off to director Ruben Fleischer for blending the ingredients together so perfectly and providing fans with a complete blast that, while up there with the other greats of this subgenre, does it's job in a different enough way to feel unique and fresh. Superb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers', Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film, which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear, but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style &amp; sensibility. Jesse Eisenberg (who has a certain Michael Cera shyness/eccentricity to his delivery, but doesn't seem nearly as pathetic as Cera's characters often come off) carries the film well. And of course, everyone is talking about the film's 'secret' cameo, and rightly so. It is absolutely the best and most fun part of an already awesomely fun film -- and it kept me laughing almost non-stop throughout that 10-15 minute section of the movie.This is a zombie-comedy that deserves to take it's place amongst the best of the genre, 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Army of Darkness'. In fact, what I wouldn't give to see a triple feature of these films at a drive-in theater on Halloween... the perfect place and time for a zombie feeding.</fullReview>

This movie has everything other PG-13 Horror directors wish they had in their films: and actual name-brand cast, R rating, easily remembered funny lines, great makeup effects, and fast moving pace. It follows the scuzzy reality behind life if there was an actual zombie apocalypse on the horizon, but with a funny flare. I honestly can't wait until the sequel (which is supposedly in the works), to see where the cast may go next on their adventures. Awesome movie, don't want to spoil it, but watch it if like funny, gross-out horror, with a side of adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland has a simple story. The guys are loners. Columbus with the simple mission to stay alive and Tallahassee with a never ending search for any and all of the remaining golden Twinkies left on the planet. The girls are sisters who are trying to get to an amusement park in CA where they believe, or at least want to believe it is zombie free. A small part of the film feels like the movie Vacation with zombies. The comical trip with a destination which you can just feel isn't going to be what the characters hope for. Like Vacation it shows that the journey is far more important than the destination.The biggest moment of the film has to be the mystery cameo. I'm glad I didn't know who it was and I won't spoil it for anyone else. I will say that it was brilliantly written into the script. PERFECT! It really goes to show how much they focused on getting Zombieland to be a top notch flick that should go down as a horror-comedy classic to remember. It will certainly fit alongside Shaun of the Dead in my movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually stylish and the most laughs I've had at the movies in a long time. A really solid script and nice underlying story really helps make this so much more than just a bunch of awesome zombie kills. That being said, this film feels as if you're playing a really badass zombie killing video game.Thanks to 'Natural Born Killers', Woody Harrelson has just the right cult status and persona for this type of film, which is intended to pay homage to the great zombie 'B' movies of yesteryear, but really is a great zombie 'A' movie with today's style &amp; sensibility. Jesse Eisenberg (who has a certain Michael Cera shyness/eccentricity to his delivery, but doesn't seem nearly as pathetic as Cera's characters often come off) carries the film well. And of course, everyone is talking about the film's 'secret' cameo, and rightly so. It is absolutely the best and most fun part of an already awesomely fun film -- and it kept me laughing almost non-stop throughout that 10-15 minute section of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most surprising aspect of Zombieland, to me, is how much heart there is. All of the characters feel warm and alive, and what drama there is to be found feels extremely sincere. Ultimately, you feel invested in the story and the characters, which ? I think ? is the most important thing any film of any genre can do.Zombieland has instantly become a horror favorite of mine (comedic or otherwise). The ? for the lack of a better word ? quotable dialogue, consistently hysterical tone, and endearing characters, all come together to create a film that will undoubtedly become a cult classic.Unlike many comedies in recent memory, in which the majority of laughs are already provided by the trailer, Zombieland is filled to the brim with laugh-out-loud moments, thanks largely to the brilliant cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To really enjoy the movie, you have to put yourself in his shoes. First off, if the girl next-door who you've been secretly in-love with for over 3 years turns into a Zombie. Could you put her down? I don't know if I could do it. Restrain her, tie her up, break her arms and legs maybe, but put her down like he does? I'm just not sure I could do it.So right off the bat the movie exposes (and here's a key to the people who don't enjoy the movie) a thinking person, yes I said it exposes a 'thinking person' to a nightmare scenario.What instead of that girl you like it was your child? What if your 5 year old had suddenly become a tiny zombie who wanted nothing more than to eat your flesh? You can try to restrain him, but one bite and you'll end up a zombie and then the rest of your family will have to face the same choice you have and that's the big danger of the Z scenario.There are a lot of people who hate on this movie, but the negativity should stop because what should be taken away from this are the 10 or more rules, such as Double-Tap, Exercise Running, and the rest.When World War Z occurs, the people who hated on this movie will be happy they watched it.Still, with the shambling zombies, I don't believe world-war Z could occur. With the fast-moving human-eaters in those Return of the Night of the Living dead movies...we'd all be screwed with or without the rules...</fullReview>

Zombieland is the kind of movie made for people who does not know anything about zombie movies have never been real fans, so they found this cool, and modern, and clever, cause you know, geek thing are popular this days...

		<fullReview>It is fun, it has lots of qualities, sometimes is scary, other times is hysterically funny, but in the end you only get from "Zombieland" an entertaining film that overused a few things that worked better in "Shaun of the Dead". Zombieland is America after almost all of its habitants were transformed into zombies after a virus, being the last human survivors of this place four people (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone) who have many issues of trust, fighting and surviving with their own rules, trying to escape from being transformed into disgusting creatures. Down on the road they'll met thousands of zombies, will go to Bill Murray's house and meet the real Bill (the funniest part of the film!), and try to have some fun in a amusement park. There isn't much of a goal here for these characters, although the film explicits one at its ending in a almost cheesy way about having a family, having company is what matters in life.The movie works its style of horror and comedy very well, good jokes here and there (Woody's tactics to kill the creatures; or Jesse's rules flashing on the screen all the time e.g. #1 Cardio, things like that), some hilarious moments but its premise gets very weary after a while, closer to the ending which is something very dangerous for the film's good impact on us. It gets stranded in this lack of purpose that one can only wonder: "So, here's a bunch of characters, they try to survive in a place dominated by zombies and...?" It is entertaining and all but sometimes even entertainments can be and should be more than just that! "Shaun of the Dead" got better results by being scary, funny, intelligent and surprising. Now, "Zombieland" fires a lot but only hit a few points. The acting of all the ones involved is very pleasant and funny (Harrelson and Eisenberg being the funniest on scene), some spectacular scenes (the supermarket attack) and it is a nice film to spend a great time. Enjoy the little moments...nice and slow! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow...an excellent Zombie flick with some serious gore, but even more laughs. And how about the happy ending? When was the last time you watched a blood-thirsty movie and left the theatre, or living room, feeling better than before you started the viewing? Zombieland's cast is about as good as you are going to assemble these days. The age range between the actors is so profound, yet each carries the film in their own unique way. The interaction between each is superb as they start out as enemies and finish as family. Sure, there were some gushy and predictable portions, but I didn't mind. The overall storyline was just too intriguing. I even enjoyed the ridiculous Bill Murray cameo.Zombieland is much less a horror movie and much more a comedy. Sure, there are plenty of splatter moments to keep the gore geeks happy, but there are extended portions of the film that have nothing to do with killing zombies and much more to do with how humans may interact if indeed there was such a grim apocalypse.I highly recommend this picture to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and isn't afraid of a little over-the-top gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What appears to be a decent z-day movie turns out to be a major disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Zombieland, I thought it was a pleasantly robust zombie flick with a few odds and ends. The first time I actually WATCHED Zombieland, I slowly began to realize a few things:1. Generic use of the "Patient X" backstory runs rampant in the Z-Movie industry.2. Watching Woody Harrelson try to act all dramatic tough cowboy is about as painful and cringe-inducing as watching 3 straight seasons of The Office on repeat.3. Jesse Eisenberg should really quit reaching for the title of awkward teen of the year. Michael Cera already beat you to it, guy.--Plot-- Zombieland starts out with a lone wanderer from Ohio, stopping to get gas in Texas. Jesse Eisenberg, or better known in the film as "Columbus", narrates over a visually slick opening credit sequence before it's handed off to a super-slow mo sequence with a classic rock background. If that doesn't let you know how flippin' wicked this movie is, I think that the half-naked stripper zombie will cover that without a hitch.From there, we accompany our awkward hero as he tries to find a potty, only to have his efforts to drop some care packages to the sewer troops doused by a swarm of jogging zombies. From there, we learn that "Cardio" is essential to surviving in the zombie apocalypse, y'know, just in case it ever happens. After this lengthy intro and a quick peek at Mr. Eisenberg pinching a loaf in his khakis, we get the ball rolling as Columbus stumbles upon Tallahassee, a mean mothertruckin' cowboy with a drinking problem and a fast car. Really, it's just Woody Harrelson. So, they drive off onto greener pastures after a tense but screwy standoff between Tallahassee and Columbus. We even learn of Florida's addiction to Twinkies and how this craving leads them to a small market.They enter the market in search of Twinkies, but find a couple chubby zombies to obliterate. Once the locals are taken care of, the pair stumbles upon a young beauty, and we're introduced to the character who makes this movie at least watchable, Witchita, played by Emma Stone. The woman beckons them to assist her with her sister, Little Rock, who's been bitten by one of the zombies. Just as Witchita is about to blow her sister's brains out, she decides to follow through with the real plan and jacks the pair's gear.Everything else from there is a bunch of hijinks and irony and "be wild and different" stuff that would talk too long to highlight. Zombieland seems like one of those unique zombie flicks, but it's really just a generic recreation based on plot alone. Some Joe Somebody gets infected with a virus, it spreads around to everyone, rage-like symptoms and what-have-you. It's like 28 Days Later: Family Edition.-Overall- Zombieland is just a polished, home-video z-day movie featuring a generic script and a hook on style and finesse with the editing. Some of the acting is solid, but Jesse Eisenberg is like a...like a limp, awkward, college kid noodle trying to act like the socially inept young adult.While being generic, the script also focused too deeply on character development. I felt once a character was introduced, their intentions were made clear. There was really no way for the viewer to get to know the character themselves. The writers need to allow the viewer to figure out the characters themselves before they offer up a description of what he or she is all about right from the get go.Aside from those cons, the film was somewhat enjoyable to watch, but from the standpoint of a Z-Movie fan, this one was just too softcore for being advertised as a gory, bloodfest of zombies and mayhem. Hey, at least we got Emma Stone.-M</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen "Zombieland" on it's first day of release, I decided to watch it on DVD this night and I was pleasantly entertained yet strangely surprised at how touching and warm it could be.Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus, an average Joe who has always wanted a family and to score with a girl. Eisenberg as well as Woody Harrelson(especially Harrelson) give great performances throughout the whole course of the perilous trek with a dash of dark comedy and zombie bashing. There's very little visual effects, but that it's used sparingly is really effective as it lets the audience focus on the great aspects of this film: characters and a well-written and darkly witty script. The story's a bit thin but in the context of the whole film, it works unlike some other films that try to be fun and smart, but end up failing in all levels.I really missed out on this film on it's theatrical fun but fortunately I watched recently and I got to say that Zombieland simply rocks. Black comedy mixed with well-written dialog, zombie bashing, and some touching moments, Zombiland is a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bill Murray, you're a zombie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"That's the worst goodbye I've ever heard. And you stole it from a movie." - Columbus (Zombieland) "Zombieland" is yet another film in a recent wave of 80s nostalgia flicks ("Adventureland", "Superbad", the various cinematic secretions of Judd Apatow etc), all written and directed by guys who came of age in the 1980s.And so the film is set in a post apocalyptic future in which a band of survivors learn to put aside their differences, battle zombies and "become a family". Here, family, or human connection, is implicitly about restoring the perceived utopia of the 1980s, a pre 21st century world in which the cosy naivety of youth has yet to be destroyed by the "modern experience". And so our heroes all long for symbols of childhood: family, friends, old school amusement parks, babies, dogs, snack foods, 80s media, Betamax, community etc, anything that existed before the technological leaps of the early 90s escalated technocapitalism and ramped up the postmodern experience.Like "Shaun of the Dead", this is therefore a zombie movie which trades in nostalgia, which weeps for some perceived loss of humanity. Needless to say it pales in comparison to the zombie movies of George Romero, who tackled this material with "Night of the Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead" and has moved well past such themes with his subsequent zombie flicks, all of which have been ignored by audiences.First time director Ruben Fleischer injects lots of fun and energy into the film, but the plot itself is a fairly routine merger of the road movie, the zombie apocalypse movie, the teen romantic fantasy, Leone westerns, the "Mad Max" trilogy and loner survivalist tales like "Escape from New York" etc. That it all works is largely thanks to Fleischer's rapid-fire direction and actor Woody Harrelson pushing postmodern action hero irony as far as he can. He isn't as meta as Robert Downey Junior and Johnny Depp ("Pirates of the Caribbean", "Iron Man" etc ? all performances which make the wink-at-the-audience irony of Cary Grant, Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis, for better or for worse, obsolete), but he gets the job done.The film itself opens with Metallica's "For Whom The Bell Tolls" on the soundtrack, an interesting choice, as both Metallica's song, and the Hemmingway novel upon which its title is based, dealt with a fear of modernity, impending death, sacrifice, mortality, a longing for family etc. Such themes are never substantially delved into or treated with much weight by Fleischer, but they do help add some gravity to an otherwise formulaic plot.Perhaps the most interesting thing about the film is the way it rebels against what Jan van Dijk called the "network society" - in which society is constructed merely as purposeful, repetitive, programmable sequences of exchange and interaction between physically disjointed positions held by social actors (ie postmodernism's brain scrambled zombie future) - but then relies on this society's "codes" to hook audiences. For example, for all its nostalgic lamentations, "Zombieland" heavily relies on video game pop ups, scribbled screen text, is structured like levels in a video game, assembled from chunks of other films, and revels in the zombie genre's seductive blood-lust. In a very real sense, the film is what it critiques.The final interesting thing is the sudden surge of zombie movies (and the popularity of zombies in mass market video game shooters, books and television programmes, like "Call of Duty: Zombies", "Breathers: A Zombie's Lamet" and "The Walking Dead"). Writer Annalee Newitz has chartered how war and social/political upheaval caused spikes in zombie movie production over the past century, but of course that's not surprising. The iconography of the "zombie genre" has always effortlessly tapped into all kinds of primal feelings: mass fear, chaos, suffering, the whole Bolshevik class structure, mindless hordes distressing upper classes, issues of individualism, paranoia, overpopulation, disease, class anxiety, xenophobia etc. Mostly, though, zombie movies are therapeutic, our socially awkward heroes being granted the chance and excuse to kill their neighbours without guilt, unleashing their Id, ditch work, make their own rules, bash heads, ransack stores, lord over the world and of course indulge in a little attractive survivalism. Nothing else lets us confront our worst fears about our drive for self preservation than a good zombie movie.Most of all, though, what this new wave of zombie flicks is responding to is what Fukuyama and Nietzsche called "The End of History" and "The Last Man". It's no coincidence that if one were to even briefly glance at the wikipedia "list of zombie films", they'd see that over a hundred have been released in the first 10 years of the 21st century, whilst the other big rise in zombie movies occurred in the late 60s and 70s. Faced with the dead endedness of both postmodernism and techno-capitalism, these films reflect humanity's deepest unconscious desires; the desire for a great purge. The desire for change and progress. But more so, these films reflect humanity's inability to even imagine or conceive of a future. Faced with deadlock and incapable of tomorrow's conception, the zombie movie then exhibits nothing less than humanity's rage-filled "beat the crap out of your neighbour and set the world on fire" frustrations.7.9/10 ? Slick and very entertaining, but it's not as good as even Romero's worst Zombie flicks, lacking his thematic and allegorical weight. Makes a good companion piece to the low budget "Stake Land" and "Carriers".</fullReview>

Woody Harrelson was awesome and I loved his crazy obsession with Twinkies. Oh, and it's got Bill F*n Murray in it. The style and creativity was great in filming this movie like when a rule was followed by one of the characters they would slide in the title of it like the "Double Tap" and adding in a "Zombie Kill of the Week" gave a feeling that killing zombies was more of a game. And their choice of music was excellent. I can't think of anything they could have done better. The entire movie just seemed to flow so nicely from scene to scene and combined with their excellent choice in music it never lost your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The States' version of "Shaun of the Dead" is actually a joyous ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quick to dismiss modern zombie films mostly because it's become such an overused genre of film to make. I enjoyed the remakes of "Dawn of the Dead" and "Land of the Dead," and I had a feeling that this was going to be these actor's chances at making their own "Shaun of the Dead." That's fine, but I dug my heels in. I realize I was wrong to, though. The movie is very light-hearted with the zombie apocalypse acting as a mere atmosphere of day-to-day grind work to get through. It's a coming-of-age/horror/comedy film that has in-jokes for movie buffs and fun moments of destroying stuff for anarchy's sake in a world ruled my zombies. Is it believable? Is any zombie movie really believable? I guess that's up to you. They have an unrealistic amount of bullets and a number of convenient resolutions, though. This is a movie primarily based on characters and their development in a land that they loved which is now zombiefood. There's an amazing cameo (by who? I won't spoil it) around the midpoint of the film, and once the characters get to that point, the movie starts getting exceedingly hilarious. This movie subscribes to the plague element that brings people to roam the earth, searching for new flesh, and I liked how the movie didn't really tell how it got that way (like "Resident Evil" is quick to point the finger at a huge corporation). I gave the movie 8 stars. I'll definitely watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland goes to prove that one of the key elements needed to produce a good movie is producing likable characters. It's premise is very simple, 99% of the the worlds population has been wiped out by this virus and the survivors are on a trip to LA with the bad ass Tallahassee (Harrison) leading the charge of this very well assembled cast. In addition to this there is an hilarious cameo role played by Murray that probably worth watching the movie for on it's own. The zombies obviously play an important part and contribute to scares and humorous moments but the beauty of this movie is that the four central roles produce the vast majority of good that comes from it. There's nothing wrong with zombieland, it's well acted, well directed and very funny and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Shaun Of The Dead when it comes down to zombie horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horror movie spoofs are becoming pretty common?some of them are great ("Scream"), while others are just forgettable. The really good ones manage to both spoof the genre and simultaneously exploit its effectiveness. "Zombieland" does just that. The main character has developed a list of rules for surviving a zombie apocalypse, which we can easily assume he has developed from watching lots and lots of zombie movies. These rules flash on the screen at strategic moments, and we come to appreciate their wisdom. The plot, although clever and amusing, is subordinate to the characters here?Jesse Eisenberg as our hero (who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a definite handicap when one is fighting zombies), Woody Harrelson as the bad-ass who's hiding deep sorrow, Abigail Breslin (yes, the girl from "Little Miss Sunshine") as a rough tween who fears nothing, and Bill Murray in a hysterical but all-too-brief cameo.

		<shortDescription>A Fair Comedy, a Terrible Zombie Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening shots of Zombieland possibly depict some of the most gleeful carnage ever filmed. I had been nothing but excited to see Zombieland, and this sequence only made me more so. I am a fan of zombie films, and on of the cornerstones of any zombie film is the gore, and this movie looked like it was going to deliver. I am also a fan of funny zombie films, and I have certain expectation there as well, mainly that I will get to see some zombies killed in hilarious ways, and some obnoxious characters offed creatively. I was prepared to die laughing for the next two hours in sheer, carnage filled, comedy bliss.Then, the credits ended. And so, we meet the main character, the cookie-cutter virgin nerd who will lead us through this tale. He kills a couple zombies. Doing good so far. He meets cookie-cutter redneck, they kill some zombies. Still doing fairly well. They meet cookie cutter female characters, boy likes girl. OK, maybe not doing as well anymore. They go on a road trip.No, really they do.By this point in the film, I was noticing a trend. Rather than being a zombie comedy, this was more like two films. A zombie film and a road trip movie, squashed together. None of the zombie deaths were particularly inventive or entertaining, indeed at one I found myself rolling my eyes (That would be the banjo. Now while I've never seen a zombie killed with a banjo, there was a game several years ago called 'Dead Rising' which featured many inventive ways to kill zombies, including my personal favorite, with electric guitars. It was very similar.)In addition to the fact the zombies are not dispatched entertainingly, they also are almost nonexistent in the film, after the credits. Yes, this zombie film contains almost no zombies.Which leaves us with the characters who are all a bit flat and uninteresting, which is fine in most zombie films where they are really just zombie fodder. But here it is nearly the death of the film. I mean, we have virgin nerd, redneck obsessed with Twinkies, twelve year old, and in slight departure for routine, the bad-girl rather than the bad-boy.And they proceed to be only as interesting as these stereotypes allow. It turns into a road trip movie, with these four making their way across county, because. Really that is the other great flaw, there is no logic to their cross country drive. The girls heard that there are no zombies at a random amusement park in California. It is never explained why they believe this, or indeed how it make sense that the zombies would not go in the amusement park. After I spent the entire film questioning this logic, when they finally get to said amusement park, I was unsurprised to find zombies there. Which means I can only conclude these characters are idiots. True, some of the jokes are amusing, Bill Murry is Bill Murry, rednecks obsessed with Twinkies are good for a few laughs, and the rules are surprisingly sound (though I'd still prefer to have a copy of The Zombie Survival Guide in the inevitable zombie apocalypse). But it's just NOT a zombie comedy, not when the only zombies appear at the beginning and end, aren't remotely menacing, and none of the deaths are creative.And no one dies. This may be a zombie film first, no body dies, at least not from the zombies. So I don't count Bill Murry.Quiet simply, I didn't get what I paid for, had I known what I was getting, then I wouldn't have bothered to pay in the first place. So, if you go in expecting a road movie with some 2-d characters, a random cameo and jokes about Hanna Montana, with a couple of zombies peppered throughout, you will be very please. However, if you are expecting something like Shuan of the Dead, BrainDead, Evil Dead II or any other great zombie comedy flick, keep walking. You have not found the next great entry in the genre. In short: for the mainstream audience only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland took me by surprise.Zombieland deserves to be named as one of the best (Land of the Dead included) zombie films of recent years, as well as a decent comedy to boot. It is a much better ode to its history than Shaun of the Dead. Its comedy comes from a brilliantly cast and likable nice guy loser, a sweet character who uses his own issues to survive a world plagued by zombies.As the cast grows the quality of well drawn characters and believable turns doesn't drop.It is difficult to write a review of this film and avoid comparison to Shaun of the Dead, most will tell you Shaun of the Dead is superior but I would disagree. The characters surprise you, the humour is unexpected and unique and most importantly the zombies are not simply the butt of every joke.An honourable mention to a good soundtrack (Highlight The Droge &amp; Summers Blend - Two Of The Lucky Ones) and the director who makes excellent use of a 20 million pound budget.</fullReview>

If taken as a comedy this movie is pure genius... you get some of the funniest over-acting, staged shots of the coolest nerd-losers in movie history, some of the gayest smart-ass zombies, some of the most annoying screechy ghost grannies, the Redneck version of Harry Potter as a sidekick funnier than even the cliché fat dumb funny guy.... and don't even start with the "cool" main characters. Jesse Eisenberg is the handsome nice guy who tends to sit down for misplaced scenes of unfitting sadness and staring at the horizon, his brother is some kind of a nerd who watched too many Rambo movies and decided killing zombies is fun and makes you look cool and then there is a cool rocker dude (love the staged scenes with the baseball bat) who seems to have been snatched from a bad 70ies rock gang movie. He tends to appear more retarded than the obviously retarded Tallahassee character.Anyway... that gang of idiots for unexplainable stupid reasons heads of to retardation land where they fight a bunch of zombies, exploding winged vampire zombies, cheap CGI zombie-meets-Giger-style-Alien monsters and zombie degenerates like the kick ass brain dead "Reaggae" zombie who is by far the funniest. The whole movie doesn't make an inch of sense and the random editing adds to the ridiculous funny bone of Zombieland, mixing shaky cam fight sequences that are barely watchable without throwing up with endless shots of Columbus sitting on a wall and being sad for 20 minutes or having some romantic puppy-flashbacks before turning into a bloodthirsty fighting machine that splits flying leaves in slow motion.The fight sequences are always accompanied by misplaced epic heavy rock music and tend to recycle the basic ideas of smashing heads, chopping off arms or driving swords through hollow vampire-zombie heads in a repetitive fashion. They really just had these 3 ideas, so even a massive monster dragon has to have his head smashed first and then stabbed just to make sure its really dead. Of course this movie is 2 hours long to elaborate on the exquisite plot and thrilling fight sequences. In Zombieland heroes die slowly so they can scream the names of their loved ones for minutes even after having a samurai sword driven through their nerd-brains.The director is either a total comedy genius or a lobotomy patient... anyway, put on your diapers when watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland is amazing, and although I won't go so far as to say it beats Shaun of the Dead as supreme zom-com, it does stand proudly beside it. See it right now!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I first saw the trailer to Zombieland, I knew that this horror/comedy hybrid road picture would be right up my alley. But as we all know, trailers can be deceiving ? they can make a bad movie look interesting and vice versa. I'm pleased to say that not only is Zombieland an awesome flick, but it's one of my favourites this year. Booya! The film starts with Columbus (Eisenberg), seemingly a rare surviving human in post-apocalyptic Earth ? now dubbed 'Zombieland'. Although being on the Woody Allen side of neurotic, Columbus explains that these neuroses are what have kept him alive all this time, written as a list of rules for survival (Rule #1 ? Cardio: 'When the zombie outbreak first hit, the first to go were the fatties'). On his journeys he meets up with Tallahassee (Harrelson), a gun toting redneck whose one mission is to find a Twinkie in Zombieland before they all expire. They then stumble across charlatan sisters Wichita and Little Rock (Stone, Breslin), whom after they con the two men out of their truck and guns join together in their journey west to theme park Pacific Playland. Running at a brisk 81 minutes, Zombieland is non-stop entertainment juggernaut and although it is more on the comedy side than horror, there is plenty is violence and gore at hand but it is more slapstick than gross-out. Director Fleischer does a wonderful job in pacing the film so that we get equal amounts of character development in between the hilarity. After watching this I could say that his style is a cross between Zack Snyder and Greg Mottola (through obvious and not-so-obvious comparisons). The first 10 minutes of this film is absolutely golden, with Columbus' first on-screen encounters with zombies and the genius way of going through the list of rules as they happen, and the incredible opening title sequence (done in a style similar to this year's Watchmen and Wolverine) perfectly set to Metallica's For Whom the Bell Tolls ? a track that has been on constant play on my iTunes ever since. Not to say that the rest of the movie is a disappointment, but they certainly put their best foot forward in creating a tone for the rest of the movie. Performances are astounding all around amongst the main cast (which, bar zombies, is kind of the only cast) but get outshined by an amazingly cool performance by Woody Harrelson. It's kind of like it's the role he was born to play and I give him props for going completely over-the-top without tipping over into cheesy self-parody territory. I might also mention a movie stealing cameo that I will not give away here, but I will tell you that he co-starred with Harrelson in 1996.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new comedy touchstone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While *Zombieland* will not go down as a great cultural philosophical film (although if you think about it, there's a little bit of that), it gets a 10 from me as the most hysterical comedy-black comedy I've seen in years. The premise we start with involving "Columbus" (Jesse Eisenberg, an amazing young talent) is used to great comic effect consistently throughout, the double entendr? and profanity are pitch perfect, adding to the comedy, rather than being there superfluously for shock value or to be "cool." The pop culture references are hilarious, and hit all the right notes for the actors in the film as well as their characters (you'll see what I mean), the core ensemble works together like a dream (including the perfectly executed meet-ups which are both funny and surprising), the references to the human condition are spot on, but brief, and do not stop the momentum. No maudlin or preachy here. Bill Murray makes the perfect call back to the ensemble comedies he was so successful at participating in in the 80s that carry the same kind of comic momentum is a different kind of comic world. But this is not his film, and his grace at being the (hysterical) cameo is notable (but not surprising). Everything about his presence in the film is ironic, but the film itself is a mixture of all the elements of black comedy, irony, satire, parody, etc, with an appropriate amount of clearly fake gore, screwball moments, and a new twist on scatological humor. And I see several reviewers have mentioned a particularly funny scene as well, and I'm guessing it's the same one that had me ROTFLMAO, involving a couple of simultaneous situation reversals that are ingenious to say the least (I say no more for fear of spoiling). It's been a long time since a movie has done that for me, and any minor imperfections (a slight lag in the momentum briefly in the middle, for example) are made up for by the overall hilarity, and a solid ensemble, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson being perfect, Abigail Breslin showing that she's growing up nicely as an actress, and Emma Stone a strong young actress (and comic straight-woman) to watch. If the aforementioned 80s comedies were the comedy touchstone of my generation, *Zombieland* will I expect become the touchstone of today's generation, and rightfully so. And, P.S., the music is fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny tongue-in-cheek comedy about a world overrun by zombies. The "rules" alone are enough to make you smile and realize you're in for an interesting ride. The cast (as small as they were) are good and the fact that it's a movie with few characters, it allows the story to move at a brisk pace all while allowing for just enough character development to make you care for them. Woody was particular funny with his zany, eccentric, and pretty much crazy character. Over-the-top gore will derail some, but those who stick with it (and it's pretty much over before you know it) will enjoy the time they spent with 4 very interesting characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best zombie movie I've seen - BIG SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was really cute. Perhaps that's a strange thing to say about a zombie flick, but it was. The script was good, the direction was good, Eisenberg's character's Rules were a hoot, and I don't think I've enjoyed a Woody Harrelson role more since Cheers. He was so bleepity-bleeping funny as he stalked through most of the movie trying to be the baddest bleepity bleeper left on earth, and his unwavering search for something very specific was a delightful little quirk that endeared.Bill Murray's surprise appearance - playing himself - just about knocked me off my chair. Though I knew someone big was going to make an appearance as soon as I knew they were headed for Hollywood, I don't think it gets much better than Bill Murray (though I was cheering out loud for either Brad Pitt or Gwyneth Paltrow before Murray showed up...THAT would have been classic). Murray's screen time was perfect for being brief, and his departure was a side-splitting scream.Though I didn't think Emma Stone or the normally charming Abagail Breslin contributed anything substantive to their roles, there were a few great moments between them and the boys, and there had to be girls for advancement of the plot. Amber Heard's very brief role in the film is worthy of an honorable mention for being completely over the top, utterly predictable, and funny, funny stuff.Each role was contrived to take itself way too seriously, which was one of the things that makes this movie so fun. There were many, MANY horror movie clichés in the film, but that didn't detract from the plot one bit. There were a few ridiculous asides in the film, some pointless scenes, and some pretty campy dialogue, but it all added to my overall enjoyment. Though not necessarily for the squeamish, this wasn't supposed to scare. This was a clever film, all the more clever for making fun of itself at every turn, and I enthusiastically recommend it.Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland is quite possibly the right combination of cinematic excellence that produced a masterpiece for the ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK It's not Citizen Kane or Henry the 8th. But this is one fantastic movie. I'm not a zombie movie lover. "dawn of the dead" hated it. "night of the living dead" snooze. This is not so much a zombie movie but more a Apocalypse movie. The movie starts with and is narrated by Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus...each character call each other by their destination). Jesse is the reason this movie works. It all revolves around him. He plays the virgin geek who learns how to survive by his set of rules. He meets up with three others. Woody Harrelson is the gun toting blood thirsty zombie killer. Emma stone and Abigail Breslen play con artist sisters. Together the chemistry is great. What makes this movie great is the chemistry between these four actors. The plot doesn't go where you expect it to go and blow it. Above all this is a great comedy. It's well timed, unexpected and funny as hell, but still has a heart. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good twist on an old tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it the zombie genre has been done to death (excuse the pun). These days it's just a matter of applying a back story about how the 'disease' spread, selecting zombie speed from slow or fast, picking out a motley bunch of survivors, dangling an undead-free zone within their grasp and deciding how many of the cast survive along the way ? usually dependant on the actor's wage. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead, 28 days later and obviously Shaun of the Dead but there is too much recent mediocrity in the genre to get me excited which is why I was pleasantly surprised when Zombieland came along.The film doesn't bother with an elaborate or annoying back story, a simple voice over brings us straight into the over-the-top world of Zombieland where we are introduced to Columbus who tells us that 99% of the population are walking dead (of which there are some very gory examples). Played by Jessie Eisenberg (picture Michael Cera with a curly dufro) Columbus is a nervous paranoid shut in who has survived by following an elaborate but effective set of rules. Travelling across America he meets Tallahassee the crazed zombie killing machine with a hankering for Twinkies (portrayed brilliantly by Woody Harrelson), and scheming sisters Little Rock and Wichita.Umm and that's it really, there are some very funny scenes including what is possibly the best cameo in a film ever (I won't ruin it for you but it is great), and as the film doesn't have a giant cast who slowly get picked off you actually care about their fate. There is just the right amount of character development without too big a focus on past nissues (non issues); the protagonists don't mope around and deliberate over every decision, they just get on with things and do whatever they want and it seems that's the best way to deal with the insanity of it all.So all in all Zombieland is a genuinely funny movie and a witty take on the Zombie genre, the cast are great and it all flows along nicely amalgamating in a frustrating yet perfect ending. That said, the story will never win any awards and there is the odd slow moment but in the words of Tallahassee during a heartfelt goodbye scene? "That'll do pig, that'll do?"8/10Check out our other reviews at http://androydfilms.wordpress.com/ or follow us on Twitter http://twitter.com/Androyd_Films</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is pretty much a documentary on how to make a great comedy. The characters are very likable, the jokes are funny, the action is cool, the gore is great, and everything works. While being very funny it is also deep. The characters form a bond and become a family. The apocalypse is looked at positively and negatively. They enjoy killing zombies and breaking things, but they also miss what they lost. When people are walking through destroyed areas filled with empty cars it looks great. Dialogue between people in this movie is fantastic. Seeing people talk about killing zombies is so entertaining. I love this movie. I can't wait for the sequel.4 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies taking on a Facebook Nation - Loves It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, this is just about as good as it gets. Not only are zombie films my favorite genre, but I'm always up for a great laugh, tough chicks and wonderfully filmed movies. Zombieland was a bold approach in my opinion and could have gone horribly wrong. However, a stellar, fresh cast pushed this movie to be a wonderful success.Zombieland's game-like approach and the Kills of the Week were smart-moves. While it's a zombie movie, the real focus of this movie is about the journey and the people ? often the zombie-killing almost feels secondary - although usually artfully executed?literally. The typical zombie movie formula is that you're usually introduced to a group, one-by-one they're picked-off and you're left with the obvious few remaining survivors in the end. Instead, this movie starts with one survivor, who gradually meets three others and they get stronger as a group throughout the movie with impeccable comedic timing.Now, for the real treats of this movie. Jesse Eisenburg is a Facebook-generation God ? his timing and very being are spot-on. Woody Harrelson, of course, is always a treat from head to toe. And the fact that Little Miss Sunshine is Little Miss Bad-Chick in this movie was unexpected and fabulous all at the same time. Bill Murray's cameo was "WTF-exciting" and Jesse Eisenburg had a well-deserved nomination for MTV's "Best Scared as S*!t Performance" when 406 wakes up. Additionally, Woody Harrelson turns a carny-booth mass zombie kill into a colorful and bloody ballet.But my favorite treat of all time would be the opening credits of this movie ? simply delicious! They take us through "normal" everyday scenes when the outbreak was first introduced throughout the country ? creating vignettes as visually appealing as Macy's of NYC Department Store windows at Christmas. Using 3D titles, these scenes are some of my favorite scenes of a movie of all time. Just genius.While I stay loyal to George A. Romero and the zombie revolution he created, I love how the Facebook-generation has taken-on the zombie film. Shaun of the Dead and Fido were great starts?Zombieland, however, drove it home. And what's even better? A sequel is in the works!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that the Sprinting Dead can be hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is another entry into the long tradition of the great zombie comedy. Well?okay, there's Shaun of the Dead, Fido and now there's this one. So, I guess it's not that long of a tradition. But this movie does reaffirm that when a zombie comedy is done right, it's clever and gory fun.This film focuses on four people who survived the zombie apocalypse and only know each other by the names of their hometowns. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a dweeby, phobic 20something whose social dysfunction is the main thing that's kept him alive. Tallahassee (Woody Harelson) is an ass-kicking redneck with a powerful yen for a Twinkie and an even more powerful need to brutally massacre every zombie in sight. Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) are con-artist sisters who only trust each other and aren't looking for any more company. After a rocky start, the four decide to head to an amusement park in California because?well, what else are you going to do when the Earth is overrun by the walking dead. Along the way, they learn that there's nothing like everyone else being gone to teach you how much you need other people.This is a damned funny movie. From the neuroses of Columbus, who keeps a list of survival rules that emphasize things like aerobic workouts, basic motorist safety and never, ever being a hero; t o the balls-to-the-wall attitude of Tallahassee, who discovers that he was born to kill zombies and relishes it; to the sisters, who are both smarter than either Columbus or Tallahassee but show mercy to these dumb shmucks; every character contributes something to the comedy stew.This is also a damned bloody movie. These zombies belch blood and tear flesh with abandon. They aren't the walking dead of George Romero. These are the sprinting dead of 28 Days later and the Dawn of the Dead remake and this film shows them killing and getting killed in about as graphic a fashion as you'll ever see.All four of the main actors do a really good job, with Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harelson striking comedy gold as the Mr. Peabody and Sherman of zombie-killing, if Sherman took too many steroids and Mr. Peabody had irritable bowel syndrome. Abigail Breslin is adorable and Emma Stone is able to overcome a very unfortunate set of bangs to be every nerd's fantasy girl.Look, I realize a comedy where only a handful of people have survived an outbreak of flesh eating ghouls isn't everyone's cup of tea. Appreciating zombie humor does require a particular sort of taste. But if you liked Shaun of the Dead or Fido, you should definitely give Zombieland a try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film a lot, much more than I thought I would. One has to keep in mind what it is, and not try to make it something it is not. It is a parody of "Night of the Living Dead" and to a lesser extent "28 Days Later". I have not seen this "Shaun of the Dead", but it sounds like a parody as well. OK, with that out of the way, this is a film of wry amusement, rather than laughing out loud. I believe that was the intent. I think that the Wichita part may have been a little mis-cast. That was the only false note. Woody Harrelson's redneck obliviousness, and Abigail Breslin's older-than-her-years mien both scored direct hits. And the "surprise" cast member sequence was great. If you can handle a zombie movie parody, then you have to check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been quite a while since I've seen a good zombie movie. The last one I saw was Land of the Dead, which was so horrid that it completely put me off the genre for a while. Thankfully, Zombieland came along to remind me of why I like these kinds of movies so much.Zombieland doesn't try to make any grand social statements, or critique the ills of modern day society. It's just a funny, enjoyable ride. The small cast is uniformly great, the story zips along at a lively pace, and (maybe most importantly) lots and lots of zombies meet their end in violent and creative ways. This isn't a revolutionary movie, by any means. It doesn't do anything that hasn't been seen before in the genre, but does everything it borrows, fairly well. Bring on the sequel!&nbsp;</fullReview>

I can remember thinking at the end , it was like poetry, but not quite. I saw it again and I realized that Woody Harrelsons character was talking about a puppy named Buck at one point and then a boy named Buck later on in the film. I can overlook that what was supposed to be Bill Murrays place in Beverly Hills probably really belonged to Bette Midler, but I think the mixing up who or what Buck was supposed to be was just downright dumb. Maybe the people who make these movies just think people are dumb. Maybe it is some kind of calculated insult. I mean, isn't that like saying to the audience, come on, who follows the plot in a zombie film-well, gee guys I guess anyone whose watching one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland. The result of a bunch of American's who just had a whole hearted weekend watching Shaun Of The Dead. But Zombieland lacks of all the artificial colourings that made Simon Pegg's zom-com such a revolution. This movie is the result of lots of showing characters, strung together with a paper thin plot, and zombies. This is a movie that being raved by critics and audiences all over the world, and a fact that this reviewer cant quite grasp. It's never awful, but it's just stupid and quite unfunny for the most part. Jessie Eisenburg is weak in a lead part, he does bring a likable quality to this nerdy character, but the way he is written forbids him for carrying this movie. Then enters Woody Harrelson, who provides a ridiculous Twinky sub-plot but makes the movie, just a little more watchable. Zero scares, but the zombie deaths here are awesomely imaginative and great fun to watch. There are some very cleverly developed ideas in this sea of bleak un- originality. Death counts etc.The movie although not very funny or scary, it's quite entertaining. Couple of beers with some mind-numbing friends, it's a hoot. But it's paper thin plot and 1 dimensional character just grind this zombie affair to a halt. The writers have the audacity to make us feel emotion for these character in a very awkward manner, attempting to thicken out the plot, but only finding themselves in a bigger mess. Overall: Provides us with some deliciously vicious zombie gore, but provides very little more. Forced on-screen chemistry and weak script just makes this stupid zom-com even stupider. Mind numbing fun for some thou.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a stressful time in my life the last few years, and very few movies seem to entertain as they once did. And, in honesty, there really have been few horror movies of any kind that have left any indelible mark. Zombieland was just what the doctor ordered. While it was inevitable that Zombieland would be compared to Shaun of the Dead(unfairly, I believe), I think this film stands on it's own merits as a really entertaining zombie comedy with pitch-perfect casting.We spend most of our running time with four people as they evade zombies while traveling cross country looking for wherever home may be. Jesse Eisenberg has been really smart in choosing movies and he's just right as a protagonist to center the movie around, a narrative voice to the plague that has depleted his homeland, and how his life was forever changed when he met a rowdy cowboy with a Twinkie obsession, mourning the passing of his "puppy", "Tallahassee"(Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee just pulls up in a Caddy, as the two point shot guns at each other in a standoff, not knowing that they would join together on a trek which would unify them. Destroyed cities with decimated vehicles and devastated streets are stops along the way as Columbus(Eisenberg)and Tallahassee become inadvertently involved with two sisters, Wichita and Little Rock(Emma Stone &amp; Abigail Breslin), quite the con artists, who are able to trick them into handing over guns and the Caddy. This chance meeting, in a grocery store as Tallahassee's quest to find the golden Twinkie knew no end, would, unbeknown to all parties, only be the beginning of their times spent warding off zombies and searching for room and board.Zombieland is as much about the bonding of four people whose relationships evolve as they attempt to stay alive, as it is about zombies. The root cause of the zombie outbreak is mad cow disease and the viral freaks are a grotesque bunch with black blood spewing from their mouths as they loot and scavenge for fresh meat. The zombies are often an afterthought, taking a back seat, at times, to the four characters journeys across the nation and their burgeoning friendship.Not overlong, and rather even-paced, with a fantastic cameo when our gang stop off at the Hollywood mansion of Tallahassee's favorite actor. The names of the characters stem from Tallahassee's desire not to become too involved emotionally with those he meets. Harrelson is a riot as the roustabout who may seem to want to remain a loner, when we can tell he has been needing the company of a pal for sometime. Eisenberg is wonderfully cast as a nervous virgin with a host of phobias, who takes a shine to the cute Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin finally gets a chance to star in an adult movie..his list of ways to protect yourself against zombies is an amusing device throughout the film. Plenty of zombie heads are shot or caved in by large weapons. The theme park finale is a showstopper(..how rides are used to defend themselves against zombies have to be seen to be believed, quite imaginative and clever).The young hottie, Amber Heard, has a small role as a neighbor of Eisenberg's who wishes to crash at his joint after a zombie attacks her, startling him in the morning, withholding a secret that nearly costs him his life. It's no surprise to me this movie was a hit, it has all the ingredients to be successful. Harrelson as a gun-toting bad ass is about all I could really hope, wish, or ask for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was definitely as good as I hoped it would be. Personally, I never doubted the acting. Each actor was in the role they were born to play. For being low budget, the effects and production value were fantastic. Anyone grossed out by any of the "gore" or "graphic violence" as described in the R rating description, is a bit of a softy. In my opinion, this movie blew spoof cliché's out of the water. It seemed to me that it spoofed spoofs somewhat (i.e. Shaun of the Dead). Cliché's sicken me and this one kept itself from delivering that. The only thing i found as a fault was the actor who played Columbus (who's name slips my mind) was a little/lot like Michael Cera (the guy from Juno, Year One, and Superbad) which I tended to notice a little much. All in all, one of my favorites and one I'm sure to recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>American 'Shaun' doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zombieland" can't help but stand in bloody parallel to another horror-comedy road movie about two unlikely survivors of the undead apocalypse. Both "Zombieland" and "Shaun of the Dead," the former's ostensible overseas cinematic twin, are unapologetically crass, viscera-strewn studies of two lovable losers who must make their way in a terrifyingly changed world.This rough plot sketch is where the similarities between the two films end. "Zombieland" replaces "Shaun's" charmingly English wit and creativity with an attempted skewering of American hubris and excess. The resulting effort is oddly flat in tone and surprisingly unfunny in execution.There's just something missing in the relationship between "Columbus" and "Tallahassee," the heroes of the piece. The two wanderers, who go by their cities of origin instead of real names, meet on a vehicle-snarled highway in an unspecified time well into the zombie apocalypse. They are a predictably unalike duo?Columbus is a virginal nebbish whose obsessive-compulsive personality has kept him alive, while Tallahassee is more of a seat-of-his-pants free spirit with a penchant for fast cars, fast food and heavy weaponry.Eisenberg and Harrelson are game enough in their respective roles, but their on screen chemistry is just not in evidence. Eisenberg's twitchy awkwardness is amusing, although he will draw inevitable and not unfair comparisons to the silver screen's current Mayor of Awkwardtown , Michael Cera. Eisenberg's snakeskin suit-wearing counterpart, meanwhile, oozes Southern charisma and is not afraid to chew the scenery. However, the two actors are not funny together, and are largely relegated to Eisenberg reacting nervously to Harrelson's deftly delivered put-downs.The pair is also saddled with some contrived, "only-in-a-movie" character traits. Harrelson's Twinkie obsession struck me as pointless and should not have been a driving force behind the narrative. Eisenberg's phobias feel similarly phony, especially has terror of clowns. What are the odds our boy overcomes his fear and kills a zombie clown during a pivotal point in the movie? What do you think? These plot devices feel forced, as does a particular catchphrase director Ruben Fleischer drops three separate times with the apparent hope of some kind of future cult recognition. Go to any frat party in the next few years and you may hear drunken rabble-rousers advising their buddies to "nut up or shut up" before doing a keg stand. F*** You very much for that Mr. Fleischer.Emma Stone as con artist cutiepie "Wichita" injects some life into the proceedings, but not enough. The film really starts to flail during a weird, extended cameo by a certain comic actor. Hey, I like the actor in question, and the director obviously loves him, because he gives the guy ten minutes of screen time and heavily references several of his most popular works. It's just a strange meta moment that took me entirely out of the experience, for whatever it was worth up to that point.Sadly, not much really works in "Zombieland." There are a few fun scenes here and there, and I enjoyed the clever deployment of "Columbus's" strict rules for survival in zombie hell. Sadly, those bits are scattered like shotgunned zombie brains against a gas station wall. I think I'll just go watch "Shaun of the Dead" again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Zombieland" survival guide rule #1: Love this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ruben Fleischer's "Zombieland" is one of the best horror-comedies ever made. The horror genre has some real shockers that will no doubt have you cringing with fright in one moment, and then laughing out loud the next - George A. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" (1978) (my favorite zombie movie of all time, and my favorite horror movie of all time), "An American Werewolf in London" (1981), "The Return of the Living Dead" (1985), "Evil Dead II" (1987), "Tremors" (1990), "Shaun of the Dead" (2004), and last year's "Drag Me to Hell." It comes close to rivaling "Shaun of the Dead," Britain's comedic take on the worldwide zombie pandemic. Now on our home soil, we now have "Zombieland."Of course after a worldwide zombie pandemic, one of the last few human survivors is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a nerdy college student whose only real reason for survival is that he's scared of everything, and has an almost endless list of rules for survival; they've done him good so far, but he needs to loosen up a bit and "enjoy the little things in life." He soon meets the gun-toting, Twinkie-loving Tallahassee (a scene-stealing Woody Harrelson), who makes killing zombies look easy, cool,and fun. In their travels across the country, they also meet the traveling pair of sisterly survivalists/con artists Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and hope to head for a rumored zombie-free getaway somewhere on the West Coast. (Note that none of the characters in this film have real names, just the names of the places that they supposedly hail from/or are going to.)"Zombieland" is literally fun from the very start. What gets the movie working from its first moments (aside from the hilarious slow-motion opening credits sequence) are the knowing wink-winks aimed directly at the audience that promise you that you're about to watch something very special. And special this movie is, indeed. The movie is pure fan service to the literally dozens of zombie movies and the nihilistic zombie comic books/novels (think author Max Brooks's titanic "World War Z," which is required reading for any zombie movie fan) past and present that all seem to reference each other. In that regard, it's really nothing special but damn it, it's pure fun from beginning to end. "Zombieland," like "Shaun of the Dead," references them all with a knowing wink-wink and a big, goofy smile.(Another aspect of the film that I thought was ingenious is that the zombies themselves are quite formidable. In keeping up with the recent trends in zombie-themed horror flicks - which I believe originated in "The Return of the Living Dead" - these zombies can run and climb over obstacles in order to munch on human flesh. And true to most zombie movies past and present, there are some impressive special effects zombie kills and the zombies themselves often become objects of some of the film's best laughs. It should also be noted that the zombies themselves also have very little screen time whe compared to the four main leads, and don't really become a major element of the picture until the last 20 minutes. Lastly, how do these characters get away with dropping so many "Z"-bombs? Don't they know that you never say the word "zombie" in a zombie movie?)Like "Shaun of the Dead," I had a lot of fun watching "Zombieland." As a fan of zombie movies, I'm not quite sure how I missed this movie in the theaters. But I can say that the wait for the DVD was well worth it, especially Best Buy's exclusive "Nut Up or Shut Up Edition." It is clear that the cast and filmmakers had a ball making this movie, the most obvious of which is Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee. As a zombie-killing redneck with a sweet spot for Twinkies, he really takes his role to heart with one-liner after one-liner and a knowing wink-wink that he's got this part in the bag.If there are any downsides to the experience, it's that the movie is way too short at just a mere 88 minutes, which actually kind of surprised me when I learned that no extended version of the movie - presumably with more character development and gore - is available. But I guess that's only a minor grievance for a movie that does everything that it promises to do, does them right, and then some."Zombieland" is an impressive new feature about the soon-to-be worldwide zombie pandemic. I can only hope that the (proposed) sequel set for release some time in 2011 is as good as this one.10/10P.S.: In a movie that never ceases to surprise you with the laughs, watch out for a hilarious cameo by comedic actor Bill Murray about halfway through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The essential plot is that the Zombie Apocalypse has happened and we have some humorous adventures of the four last survivors.We have the always painful to watch Woody Harrelson, and some other actors. And Bill Murry does a guest appearance, where he has managed to survive the Zombie apocalypse by dressing up as a Zombie, only to be accidentally shot by one of the characters.Hey, Bill, the only thing that's really "undead" is your career, bud! Yeah, I know this is supposed to be a "comedy", but honestly, the subject matter is too depressing. Someone else compared it to Shaun of the Dead, but that movie at least had some cheery parts to it.I think the real problem is, we've had too many Zombie movies ever since Richard Matheson wrote "I am Legend" back in the 1954. What once was drama has now become farce.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaun of the Dead, Americanized but better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was credited as Superbad meets Shaun of the Dead. This statement is about exactly right. Others described this movie as the American version of Shaun of the Dead. This is also right too. While Shaun of the Dead was made in England and really did not look like America, Zombieland is a movie that looks made in America. Unlike how Shaun of the Dead's characters all have British accents (which in my opinion does not give you any familiarity or relation with the character because they are not American) in this movie they are all good old Americans with American ways. One thing that could have made Zombieland even better than the British Zombie movie, is if Zombieland would have had more scenes and action in residental neighborhoods. This can be related to and I think can make the story even better because we can all think about this happening in our neighborhood and what it would be like.Each character in this movie has their own form of "problem" or "issue" that they deal with. Like in Superbad, Emma Starr again was being pursued by a main character guy who had interest in her throughout the movie. Jesse Eisenburg's character is almost Identical to Michal Cera's character "Evan" in Superbad.Overall this was an entertaining movie with a a lot of good parts. It had some type of parts in the movie when a character has the chance to do something and in many movies it is not done, it is done with the killing of a certain famous movie star. good movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has everything. It's funny, horrifying, romantic and filled with smart-ass witty dialogues/situations.I walked into the cinema expecting another teen-horror movie. What I got was a masterpiece. Here's in a nutshell...The Good: The dialogues. It's witty, it's realistic.The storyline. It actually goes deeper than just smacking zombie heads. You will actually get to know the character and love them. Every one of them has a back-story, reasons why they're fighting zombies and why they're trying to survive this wasteland.The whole concept of the movie. I really love the whole 'Rules' thing. What you need to do to survive this apocalypse. And I love it even more the fact that the 'Rule' pops up on screen each time it is being applied. That makes the movie fun and helps it become funnier.The horror....!!! It was shocking, terrifying and just plain scary. The zombies caught you when you least expects it. Great fun!The bad: Well...hmm...Overall: This movie is a must-see for all fans of comedy, horror, romance and adventure movie or just plain ole movie-loving movie-goers out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like this movie. Zombieland is filled with lots of fun and adventure with 4 people, having a place to go. This is a must-see. I really love how the movie was based on a set of rules on what you have to do in order to survive Zombieland. Some parts can make you jumpy, but it's really worth it. It's not a traumatizing movie if you think so. It's just filled with lots of bloody, gory, intestine-eating cannibals taking over the world. I think the only flaw about this movie was that it moved kind of slow in the middle when it was "bonding" time. And those two girls really knows how to play a good game. Overall, great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is very well tuned! The direction blew me away in the style of Oliver Stone, with a faster pace and more light-hearted laughs.Characters develop at good pace, and you don't feel empty, but wanting more afterwards. The film parodies much of modern culture which I found fun, while it doesn't detach from the main storyline. The main characters' anonymity (yes, more than one) might be a reference to Tarantino, and if so it's well deserved.The acting is solid and convincing, and the narration throughout is a nice touch inside this genre. The special effects are well used to progress the plot, and blood makes it so much more fun! I recommend this film, if you're a thinker, and you like some messy fun on the side :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Quite "Shaun of the Dead", But the Next Best Thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the zombie apocalypse (allegedly brought on by a mutation in mad cow disease), few humans are left to wander the earth, a place now called "Zombieland". Four of them are skilled zombie hunters who go by the names Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock. These are their first adventures as a unit, with all the tragedy and romance that comes with it. And the most important objective: find the last remaining Hostess Twinkie.Rookie director Ruben Fleischer has done a fine job with "Zombieland", blending comedy and more than our fair share of gore. If you don't like blood, you're watching the wrong movie. Plenty of blood spewing and dripping from every orifice, even by the time the opening credits roll. Gorehounds with a funny bone are going to lick this one up like a dripping ice cream cone.The cast is pretty much perfectly chosen: Abigail Breslin, Emma Stone, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg bring together the sort of team of gritty yet lovable leftovers that could survive in a world full of zombies. There's really nothing to complain about them, aside from Eisenberg's delivery of Columbus' annoying voiceovers. Those got old fast.I have to give credit to Amber Heard, who played the smaller role of "406". I really found her to be a burden in "The Stepfather", and in desperate need of clothes and lunch. But, mysteriously, in "Zombieland" her acting seemed better and she was fairly attractive -- while being fully clothed. I would like to see more of this Amber Heard, especially in the horror genre.I heard that the humor peters out in the second half, and I absolutely agree with this analysis. Not to say the second half was bad, but the jokes got a bit repetitive and I lost interest in the list of rules that Columbus keeps. I found the ongoing search for Twinkies funny and I'm glad that remained steady throughout the film. I'm unsure how I feel about the film's romantic factors: too much or too little? I have to give them credit for not getting smutty, though I wouldn't mind more skin from Emma Stone.After draft writing my own review for this film, I read the other Killer Review from my Canadian colleague Greg Roberts. I had expected a vastly different outlook, but it appears we're on the same page here. Greg says, "The story is weak and routine... Harrelson's character gets the best one liners but the Eisenberg voice over narrative is too annoying and reminded me of Adventureland (hmmmmm)... I enjoyed the fun the characters seemed to be having during the shooting and there is a cameo that could have been done better, but is still a hoot all the same... It will make you laugh and keep you entertained. It just won't make any top 10 lists when it is done." Greg is dead on with the cameo. I thought it was a clever idea, but didn't really impress me the way I hoped it would.The creators expressed some concerns about piracy and the sequel. Allegedly the film was downloaded at a record pace, which made the sequel less likely. Believe it or not, Internet piracy does affect the entertainment industry. Luckily, even with all the illegal copies, enough people went to the theater and a sequel seems inevitable. But it's a lesson worth learning: you do need to support films you like. If you are going to pirate (and I'm not saying you should), get chick flicks.This film is: Recommended. I can see it gaining a growing status in years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland is a reasonable success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set during a zombie raging apocalypse that has taken over America, a dopey teenage boy (Jesse Eisenberg) who wields a shotgun, describes the various rules to us that he has set out to survive the infestation. With such concrete guidelines for survival his meeting with a gun slinging psychopath (Woody Harrelson) with an appetite for Twinkies, is initially a hostile one. Refusing to exchange names they call each other by their destination. The kid is Columbus and the gunslinger is Tallahassee. They band together on the road and also find a pair of girls who are sisters. The oldest is Wichita (Emma Stone), who Columbus develops a crush on, and the other is named Little Rock (Abigail Breslin from Little Miss Sunshine).Zombieland, directed by Ruben Fleischer, is not unlike Shaun of the Dead in that it parodies the clichés of the zombie genre to the point where it could be called and all out comedy rather than a horror movie. With a running time of barely ninety minutes the plot is not dissimilar to a series of sketches. The film immediately dumps the audience into the zombie apocalypse without any explanation for its occurrence and never seeks to develop any exposition for the outbreak. Similarly, much of the back-story for Eisenberg's character is told fairly lazily through his voice-over and a flashback detailing to us about how he used to be a video game addict and how he has always held a desire to have a girlfriend. This is not a film you would expect to have a great deal of character development beyond the most basic archetypal patterns and it correctly uploads these assumptions. All four of the main characters exist merely for the purpose of the gore and the laughs. To this extent, Zombieland is a reasonable success.Somewhat surprisingly though, the film works better as a comedy than it does as an exercise in gore and zombie slaughter. There are a number of disgusting, grotesque and gruesome deaths but thankfully the film resides in its humour more than the action. The action sequences are not particularly exciting or intense and there are almost no scares to speak of. Their infrequency and brevity is thankful. How those who just want to see pure ultra violence and zombie dismemberment will respond to this is questionable. Though a lot of the humour is extremely silly, bordering on idiotic, there is no doubt that it is funny, even if it is for its own sense of oddity. A lot of the humour is provided through the contrast between the extremely geeky Columbus ? a very different part to what he played in The Squid and the Whale - and the ultra serious Tallahassee who parodies his own tough persona and in one scene his appreciation for smoking pot. These actors seem to be having a lot of fun in their parts.These self-references are not just limited to the actors themselves though but the entirety of American culture itself. One of the first rules Columbus tells us is about cardio and how the fatties were the first to perish in the zombie attacks and we see one of them run down and devoured by a flesh eating zombie in the opening stages. Likewise, when Tallahassee finds a car loaded with guns he screams, "Thank God for rednecks" and starts firing shots up in the air. Certainly the film's funniest scene though, which really ignites the second half of the picture with a number of other film references, is a cameo from a famous Hollywood actor as himself dressed as a zombie. It is a moment you want to see for yourself without it being spoilt. Despite these pop culture references and the certainty of the laughs, you may feel as though your IQ has dropped significantly after watching this film. It is funny but the humour couldn't really be regarded as deep satire. Certainly it does not have the same satirical strength as the first half of Shaun of the Dead, which was particularly fresh and original in the way that it juxtaposed the lethargy and laziness of British life with a zombie apocalypse.Although this very silly, sometimes violent mixture of horror and comedy is largely forgettable, there is still fun to be had through the frequent laughs and the actors who seem to be greatly enjoying themselves. It may not add anything particularly new to a well-worn genre, but at least it is aware of its own silliness and does not take itself the least bit seriously, which is more than can be said for the last few George Romero zombie films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the drill. A virus sweeps through the human population, wiping most of it out, but leaving a few select survivors. Zombieland is no exception to this zombie-flick rule. However, this is one of the best in this genre I have seen. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) provides a great voice-over, with rules for surviving in Zombieland. On his travels he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). This is a great pairing. They have a good comedy partnership and there are a lot of laughs. They meet Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), and the four of them make their way to LA, killing countless zombies on the way. There is a great cameo appearance, totally unexpected, which adds so much comedy to the overall movie. This is a visually attractive movie, funny, and very well directed. If you like Shaun Of The Dead, you'll love this. Miss it, and miss out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My best friend and I were looking for something to do on a Saturday and settled on Zombieland. We weren't disappointed and neither will you.The movie starts auspiciously with the US Capitol overrun by zombies. Some slight background is given; a Patient Zero developed a disease that swelled the brain and turned him savage, the disease spread and zombies erupted everywhere.One of the last survivors is the neurotic Columbus, Ohio...a geek to whom many of us can empathize. Soon joining him is the acerbic redneck Tallahassee a man in search of a Twinkie and with a penchant for firearms. A straight shooter in all senses of the phrase. While you'd expect a movie like this to border on camp, it has its definite serious moments, especially when Wichita and Little Rock enter the picture. The scenes of zombie carnage are worth it in and of themselves, especially the grocery store outing and the stress relief at the souvenir store, where the survivors rediscovery some innocence and youth.There's a great cameo toward the end of the movie as well, which I won't spoil here. Overall, this is a fantastic bit of popcorn-munching fun. No great insights here, I'm afraid, outside of the ability of diverse people to cooperate in times of need. But it's one nice stretch of zombie exploding good times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's another zombie comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is the newest in the genre which I will now classify as the 'zombie comedy'. The genre began perhaps with the greatest zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead'. That movie was extremely funny and one of my favourite films of 2004. Unfortunately Zombieland is very short on laughs as well as lovable, memorable characters like Shaun of the Dead. The plot meanders and then ends with a silly climax that isn't all that rewarding for the viewer. There's lots of shooting zombies and explanations of the rules of a zombie world but all-in-all it's more like a video game than an actual movie. There have been a lot of zombie comedies in the past but this isn't all that special. It's even worse than the extremely mediocre "Fido" which at least added the element of social satire.That's probably one element which should have been included. The social satire element was what made 'Shaun of the Dead' a great movie instead of just a good one. Using zombies as a social satire first evolved as an idea with George A. Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" in 1978.This movie also uses 'zoombies' instead of zombies. I'm not sure why. Slow zombies are funnier, but maybe the movie wanted to separated itself from Shaun of the Dead. Save the zoombies for movies like 28 Days Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.There's zombie video games, board games, books, CDs, all numbers of things. Hipsters love their zombies so the movie was a guaranteed hit. Maybe that's the reason the movie was ultimately low on plot and high on concept.</fullReview>

I think it's worth bringing up one of our favorite scenes so you can decide if (a) you think we need counseling or (b) you might enjoy this movie too: we thought the scene where the female zombie was sucking the marrow out of the dead guys' leg incredibly funny -- and calling him her Manwich was inspired. this is one of those love it or hate it films. we found it thoroughly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honestly, as soon as I heard Zombieland was a zombie horror with comedy, i actually dismissed as a typical B-rated movie with little to no effect on the audience and hardly any entertainment but when i downloaded it...boy i was wrong!!! Zombieland was one of the best zombie movies I may have ever watched and in my view, awesome enough to rival even Shaun of the Dead. The plot was fairly good, the characters had their own past lives revealed and show how their personalities conflict together when they first meet. Apparently the zombie outbreak is already in place when the movie starts and it actually does show some logic on what the first steps of the outbreak will be like (in a comedic fashion of course). Haha, for some reason, Columbus's character reminds of me.I admit, running zombies was the largest disappointment for me (running head-shot-only zombies?!?!?! no fair!!) and the movie could have lasted longer as I felt just a little bit more could have made it a worthier watch.All in all, a great movie to watch and fully recommended!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An immensely entertaining ride from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since there isn't that much of a connection between the two... apart from both being parodies of zombie flicks... I will not draw many comparisons to Shaun of the Dead. It's sharper, has superior dramatic moments as well as more direct references to classics in the genre, and the British humor is tough to beat. Neither spoof in the manner of only poking fun at scenes you remember from other films and adding gross-out jokes. The laughs are the main point here, but the horror aspect(it does bear mentioning that this does not convey a constant threat) does work as well(and the scenes that are ripped straight out of a film of the genre are excellent), and this tends to balance it all pretty well. Material is a little hit and miss, and it gets overplayed and tries too hard once or twice, but it is almost exclusively hits, and for the majority of its short running time, this is utterly hilarious. The action is beyond awesome, and somehow does not get old at all. This is well-directed, and not just "for a debut", either. You can somewhat tell that this was originally developed to be a TV series pilot. The cinematography and editing are impeccable. While there is one or two times where this goes where you *know* it will, it usually surprises, and it never stays with the same situation for so long that you get accustomed or bored. This also works well as a road-movie and buddy comedy. All of the characters are interesting and not annoying. The parts are all well-cast. Music is well-selected and fitting. This has plenty of gory, bloody violence(and creative means of death), a moderate amount of strong language and some sexual dialog. I recommend this to any fan of the genres that this falls into. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny horror comedy is one of the best mixing of genres in years. Its only real flaw is it kind of runs out of steam at the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>College nerd living alone manages to survive the zombie plague by having no friends or close family. Heading out on the road to get to his parents in Columbus Ohio , Columbus hooks up with Tallahassee and begins looking for survivors, and Twinkies. They then hook up with two young women and travel West? Funny horror comedy is funnier the better you know the zombie films its sending up. This isn't to say that the film isn't funny otherwise, it is, but as Columbus rattles off his rules, some of which are illustrated and some of which aren't, knowing the films adds a certain amount of weight. The cast is mostly dead on with Woody Harrelson giving a hysterical turn as Tallahassee , a man who has finally found that the one thing he is best at is killing zombies.I don't think the film is perfect. I found the much heralded cameo by a certain actor not quite as funny as advertised. I also found that the final set piece doesn't work as well as the rest of the film, coming off more as weak excuse at ending the film in a spectacular manner rather than as something that makes sense.Still I really liked the film and think if you like bloody horror comedies you should give the film a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, stylish, rip-roaring ride through Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is hands-down the funniest horror-comedy I've ever seen.The plot is similar to that of a typical zombie film ? anything from Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later ? a small group of the living searching for refuge amongst a population of the ravenous undead. However, it's the brilliant and likable group of characters and satirical tone that add spice to an expected storyline. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg serve as a well matched, funny, zombie-kicking duo, while Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin form a likable supporting cast.If I were to compare Zombieland to any other film, it wouldn't be Shaun of the Dead, it would be Scream. Zombieland exudes the same satirical edge of Scream without treading into spoof territory. It remains as a witty comment on the zombie horror film genre without resorting to excessive pop culture references or toilet humour. In Zombieland, if you follow the rules, you'll stay alive.From the "Zombie Kill of the Week" to the laugh-out-loud hilarious celebrity cameo and the rocking soundtrack, to the stylish and original ways in which the undead are dispatched, this film reeks of originality and genuine fun. Not in a long time have I had this much fun in the cinema.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The zombie/comedy sub-genre of a horror movie is an extremely daunting task for any film maker. Edgar Wright's 2004 blockbuster hit Shaun of the Dead set the standard for any director bold enough to attempt to tap into this intriguing sub-genre. Amazingly, Rueben Fleischer not only created a movie that surpassed these standards, he re-wrote the book on this sub-genre with his new movie Zombieland. Puke-inducing gore, laugh out loud comedy, gratuitous violence, hilarious celebrity cameos, and a little bit of romance make Zombieland a must see for every male or adventurous female this fall.Zombieland is a world in which a brain rotting disease has infected all but five of the world's population, causing "zombies" to run rampant in search of food; preferably human flesh. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), the protagonist, is an awkward shut-in that has managed to survive by following his own set of basic rules about avoiding zombie attacks. On his way to Columbus, Ohio to see if his parents have survived the attack, he meets a redneck (Woody Harrelson) who is given the name Tallahassee due to the fact that he is on his way there. The two unlikely characters join forces and start heading east in hopes of reaching an area untouched by the infection. Along the way, Tallahassee is compelled to stop at every convenience store in hopes of reaching his goal of finding a Twinkie in Zombieland. It is in one of these stores that they stumble upon Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin); two cunning sisters on their way to California that prove to be a lot of trouble for the duo.Surprisingly, the humor in this film is much less slapstick than expected, and the character development is quite refreshing. Each character has a very unique sense of realism that is exceedingly difficult to express through a film such as this, and every ounce of humor comes from the nature of the character's themselves; this is especially true for the surprise celebrity cameo.Columbus, the awkward protagonist, grew up living a life of solitude; usually spending his weekends playing World of War Craft and drinking Mt. Dew. When the zombie plague struck, he created a list of rules that he must follow in order to survive, and the film illustrates each of these rules in an amusing fashion at the introduction of the movie. He longs for the feeling of home, so he decides to head to Columbus, Ohio, hence the name that Tallahassee gives him, to see if his parents have survived the invasion.Tallahassee, the over-bearing, ass-kicking redneck, was headed east to Tallahassee when he meets the protagonist. Contrary to Columbus's ideals, he stays alive by delivering a heavy dose of ass-whipping, while Columbus tries to live with minimal conflict with the zombies. Tallahassee is initially introduced as a very shallow character, but his depth is learned when he shares the loss of his "puppy" with the group. He has learned to keep his sanity by enjoying all the little things, such as the cars and guns they found. His mission throughout the film is to find a Twinkie, something that could remind him of home and a time that was much simpler.Wichita, the trust no one, deceiving older sister, and Little Rock, the mature for her age twelve year old younger sister, were traveling to Pacific Play land, an amusement park in California, when they meet the two. Tallahassee had to stop at a grocery store to search for Twinkies and after they killed all the zombies, the two girls came out and convinced them that the younger sister had been bitten by a zombie. Wichita wanted to shoot her sister herself, and when they gave her the gun she turned on them and took their car and guns. They met up later when the girls managed to hijack their hummer that they found, and the four then travel together.Overall, this film vastly exceeded my expectations. The humor was great for a movie in this genre, the character development was awesome for a movie of only 87 minutes, and the acting was superb. I had thought Shaun of the Dead had mastered this sub-genre, but the bar is now firmly set at Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombieland should provide a horrifically funny good time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In honor of this month being the one where Halloween is celebrated, I've dedicated most of these 31 days to watching horror, sci-fi, or comedies with elements of either or both. So it was in that spirit that I decided to watch this new hybrid with my movie theatre working friend who got us in for free. This is a funny, touching, intense, and sometimes scary good time with good performances all from Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, several zombie extras, and a Famous Celebrity who gets quite a funny death scene. While the plot is nothing to take seriously, the characterizations are believable enough and sympathetic enough that one cares what happens to them. Nothing much else to say except if you don't mind the gore and other intensities, I highly recommend Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie that quickly became a favourite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before going to see this movie I was told numerous times that it was great, hilarious etc. so I was hoping that it would live up to these expectations. And it did...and more.There is an amazing cast that fits this film exceptionally well, there are great laughs and ,of course, zombie galore. The opening sequence to this movie is probably one of the best that I've ever seen. Woody Harrelson was legendary in Zombieland and supported everything really well. And of course there was that cameo by one of my favourite actors and everything in those scenes were just mind-blowing. Zombieland is full of style and is like no other zombie movie that I've seen before yet is probably one of the best I have seen. Before watching this I hadn't seen a great example of comedy blended in with zombies (sure Shaun of the Dead was good but it wasn't hilarious) though Zombieland got some good laughs out of me. This is a movie that you've gotta see. It delivers on many levels and it does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland was casted wonderfully. Woody Harrelson is back to his best. He was funny and bad ass and it was just really enjoyable to see him want those Twinkies so damn bad.Jesse Eisenberg is apparently compared to Michael Cera a lot, but this being the first movie I've seen him in. I didn't see it. Michael Cera is his own person and that's just the way he acts. Jesse isn't better and he isn't worse because they are different actors acting differently. The way he stares at the other women in the movie is kind of creepy. The way he did it with Emma in this movie and Kristen in Adventureland. It's just weird. Abigail Breslin wasn't her best in this film, but it's okay because she had to act up to Woody and Bill.Yet again, I enjoyed this movie. The graphics were pretty realistic and the dialog was enjoyable.At some points of the movie I caught myself tensing my grip because I wasn't sure what was going to happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 survivors, battling 100's of zombies, in search of 1 Twinkie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With it's gory violence, interesting characters, and flesh eating zombies, 'Zombieland' knows exactly how the zombie genre works and how you can add a little humor to it.The whole movie revolves around Columbus.He is a survivor of an infection that has ravaged most of the world and has turned millions of people into flesh eating corpses.He soon finds out that he is not alone. He meets another survivor named Tallahassee.When they gang up, Tallahassee tells Columbus that he's searching for something.You're probably asking yourself what this thing is.It's a Twinkie.Just an ordinary Hostees Twinkie.Afterall, he explains that it may be the last Twinkie in the universe that anyone could ever enjoy.They soon reach a grocery store where they encounter two other survivors, Wichita and Little Rock.They hijack Columbus and Tallahassee of their vehicles and weapons and they soon encounter each other once more.They eventually learn that they must stay together if they want to survive the zombie apocalypse.What really surprised me about 'ZombieLand' is that it's in the top 250 list on IMDb.Sure, I enjoyed it, but it's not exactly the best zombie movie ever made.There's still a lot to enjoy in 'ZombieLand'.It's 82 minutes ( without the end credits) of pure fun that's either as good or slightly surpasses 'Shaun of the Dead'.Did I also mention that there's a cameo by Bill Murray? Well, there is and it's one of the surprising things about this movie.I give it a solid 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfecting the right mix of 1 part comedy and really any other genre has proved to be difficult over the years. Horror and comedy, as a combination, has been attempted many times, usually the results just underline how difficult it is to achieve.I know i don't need to but we'll rattle off a couple, Shaun Of The Dead, American Werewolf In London and certainly Romero loves him some social satire. Zombieland can well take its place on that list now, the tension and atmosphere of the Zombie sub-genre are intact and the comedy always comes out of the situation and the "cameo" is beyond funny.As far a "genre" films go this is easily the best film i've seen this year, with the notable exception of District 9, gory, funny, original and fresh, just watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was funny and very entertaining. Sure there were some parts that were hokey, but come on it's Zombieland!! I just had to see the movie - a comedy about Zombies. How can that be? But when I saw it I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was clever. Woody Harrelson was great - the part fit him perfectly! Abigal Breslin was great, too. A matter of fact I thought the movie worked mainly because of the the four main characters. There's a little gore which would normally seem odd for a comedy, but in this movie, it fits. The cameo with Bill Murray was perfect. Of course, I thought adding Ghostbusters was dead on. I don't know who wrote this, but what an imagination. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Was disappointed in this though considered it fairly entertaining. Particularly good was the Bill Murray sequence. My biases are that I'm a huge fan of the "Dead" movies (over 200 now, maybe?) but prefer the "better" ones (Romero) over the low-budget ones. The basic fun is being immune to killing of humans, since the "dead" are no longer human. Am also a huge Woody Harrelson fan and he delivers in this. Usually in this genre, the lead characters eventually become overwhelmed by the dead and are consumed but that's a surprise in this one. Maybe my sensibilities are "deadened" but this just seemed to drag on with more of the usual same-O. Surprises in store for Twinkie lovers. Am still waiting for many dead movies to be made: The Melancholy Dead, The Anorexic Dead, Bored Dead, Rehabilitated Dead, Hypnotized Dead, Brain Dead, Finally Dead Dead, Time Traveling Dead, Prehistoric Dead, Emotionally Dead Dead to name a few. Stay Tuned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory fun!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10Zombieland is a horror comedy which combines all the elements you expect to create a movie with true humour and gore. With a good cast also bringing along the extra fire power, this film tries and succeeds in never quite being too serious but still being very interesting in the story and the actual heart which has been put in to producing this piece. Overall I found this safely a good film and here below is why so.The story is fun but also dark but never dark enough to horrify but never light enough to not feel grossed out. It has it's best moments mostly in the middle with some great things going on and some great characters just thinking up crazy things to do in a crazy world. I felt the comedy is slightly lacking in way of crying out loud but it still manages to throw in a few chuckles and some good jokes here and there.Jesse Eisenberg is good as Columbus but it does feel with his characters a bit, done it all before and a personality that can kind of annoy. Woody Harrelson for me was the star of this movie, such a crazy and wild performance from which the majority of jokes derive from. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin contribute well all the way through and although never being so funny, they do well in the more sweet moments in the movie.It is directed well and the writing is on the same level, both seem to mix together well and there is a lot of smart kind of things that go on within in the screenplay. For me the best behind the camera thing is well, behind the camera. The cinematography is wonderful and done very well all the way through the movie, just very nice to look at especially in the more thrilling scenes.The main problems are the slow story and the lack of big jokes as I've already mentioned. The plot never quite gets going too much and you never feel a great amount of adrenaline or nerves for the characters that so often can link you with a films story. The jokes don't stream like rain but when they do come there OK, but not good and so when you compare the jokes to the overall fun of the entire plot, they don't so much match up very well.If you like your horror you should absolutely love this but if you want funny kind of deaths then you may not necessarily like this. If your looking for a great comedy then this isn't actually GREAT but it is good, it has a lot of funny times and actually some quite memorable moments but still isn't pure gold to be fair. If you like your blood and guts then this is for you, very graphic indeed and in some scenes you just think "would that really happen in real life", (although they are in a zombie world).Overall I give this a 7/10 and found it to be Safely a Sound movie which although never becoming Very Good, is definitely more than just OK. I feel with this that it tries very hard to be a classic movie and too much so and although not being far off, still isn't one I'd lock away to watch in a thousand years. Watch and enjoy it and you should to be fair very much have a good time, even if you hate violence and gore you should still have a great adventure in a zombie infested land.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A creative and fairly original horror-comedy. It's biggest selling point for me personally is its likable, 3-dimesnsional characters. It avoids the pitfalls of horror-comedies such as having dull characters and cheap laughs. Most teen horror-comedies comprise of an: "Aaah I'm being chased. Oops I fell over" kind of comedy, brought to life by pretty little young people who you really couldn't give a toss about. This is different.Jesse Eisenberg is fantastic as the shy and awkward guy who is forced to man up, wake up and smell the decaying flesh. Woody is sublime as the tough man with a sad past and a Twinkie obsession (which they somehow didn't make annoying). The 2 other girls are well-acted and there is definitely good chemistry between Jesse and Emma Stone. I don't quite know how the girls ended up in the supermarket (without killing the zombies) or why they didn't abandon Jesse and Woody (the 2nd time) but apart from that the plot is solid.There are a lot of laughs, and proper laughs; sarcastic comments and comical scenarios. There is enough action to satisfy the bloodthirsty, but not too much which suits those of a weaker stomach. A genuinely enjoyable horror-comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irreverent zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies are everywhere. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner and that may be why he is surviving the zombie apocalypse. Also he has come up with a list of rules to live by. On the way to Columbus to find his parents, he gets a ride from zombie killing Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) who has a Twinkie obsession. He refuses to know anybody's names. The guys gets robbed by sister grifters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). They head to an L.A. amusement park that is rumored to be zombie free.It's an irreverent zombie movie in line with 'Shaun of the Dead' except not as much jokiness. Ruben Fleischer, mostly a TV director before this, is able to bring a quirky style to comedy writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick. There is a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray. Even the kills are wacky. The four leads are eminently likable. The last act does turn into more of a straight up zombie fight. If the world does turn into Zombieland, I wouldn't mind riding with these four.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a trip! A fun ride across Zombieland.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Adventureland, Jesse Eisenberg's previous movie, this movie is a lot better and truly is a fun adventure. Plus, this one is funny as hell. Jesse is another Michael Cera. Call me old fashioned, but the whole mumbling-mono toned-socially awkward-skinny-nerd thing just does absolutely nothing for me, but at less Jesse does make this movie do. Two months have passed since mad cow disease mutated into mad man disease. Unaffected college student "Columbus" (Jesse Eisenberg) is making his way on the road to Columbus, Ohio to check out if his parents made it. On the way, he meets "Tallahassee" (Woody Harrelson), another survivor whom looking for purpose, and see it's in his never-ending quest for Twinkies. Twinkie production in the United States ceased in November 2012 in a weird off way. So it's seem realist that Twinkie would be hard to find after the 'zombie' invasion. Before 2012, it might not. It's a funny major part of his character, and it's pretty obvious the tasty cakes supply him with some form of comfort in a land torn to shreds by zombies, as it's also 'hide' something deep, as he seeking something more than that in his mind. Woody Harrison really took this role serious. Shortly after finishing the filming of Zombieland, Harrelson had an altercation with a TMZ photographer. His defense was that he was still in character and thought the cameraman was a zombie. I don't buy it, but who knows. He's smoking something. The pair meet "Wichita" (Emma Stone) and her younger sister "Little Rock" (Abigail Breslin) in a grocery store. The sisters, who are masterful con artists, trick Tallahassee and Columbus into handing over their weapons, then steal their car, not once, but twice when the boys try to find them again. I don't know why Tallahassee and Columbus doesn't end up killing them, since the con girls pretty much left them for dead, the first time. That's something you just can't forget, and we suppose to believe Columbus will fall in love with Emma Stone. The con girls were obnoxious and poorly written. I know they have trust issues, but that's pretty crude. The boys were written to be dumb, and stupid. Somehow, all four of them reached a state of Détente. All of them, decide to go to try their chances at Los Angeles. It's odd in a way, that Columbus never really did go to Columbus to check out his parents even with the town being decimated, there still a chance. He gives up way too easily for his love ones. The movie takes the four all throughout Zombie America. The movie is all fun, sadly the scares are non existent, and the good kills are just plain no where to be found. The movie has way too many scene-killing Voice Overs and scenes that makes zero sense. Now for the good of the movie, I love the running gag, and a central theme throughout the film, is the list of rules Columbus comes up with for surviving in the zombie-infested world. It's reminds me of the Max Brook's novel 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. Wish the movie had time to use all the 49 rules, but a few were mentioned in the film. It's makes me wonder what he meant with avoid strip clubs and bowling ball. The Character names are interesting as well, as the movie doesn't use the real names, but identify them using the names that relate to them. The movie also has a great cameo, but it's sadly it's short and underused. Another thing underused is the 'Zombie Kill of the Week' as the movie only mention one, with a character that isn't relate to the plot. I think Director Ruben Fleischer try way too much to fit as much fun into it, and some of them had to left out. The humor is smart mouth, living up to the catchphrase of 'nut up or shut up' style. It's a movie that doesn't take itself so serious, but does when needed. Check out Zombieland and visit the sites.</fullReview>

The Movie is about a young Nerdy boy surviving alone in Zombie infested America and he meets a Tough Guy Tallahassee who just wants to kill zombies and eat a Twinkie, Wichita who is the Girl of Columbus' Dreams and shed just trying to con them so her and her sister can survive. They all team up and head to 'Pacific Play-land' a renowned Theme Park reportedly Untouched by The infection in this hilarious, action packed Film about Firearms, Fun and Friends with a special Cameo by Bill Murray. The Writing in this is sharp, witty, Hilarious but lacking a strong Plot. The effects are a bit Reject shop Fake Blood but the Slowmotion Opening Credits was much better than expected. I didn't expected a bit from this film and they certainly exceeded my expectations! I absolutely Loved this and easily one of my Top 5 Zombie Films! Jesse Eisenberg who I Rate as a big Up-and-coming actor shows how good he is with his action scenes and quick comedy. Woody Harrelson Is great with his gut-busting one liners and tough guy attitude and Emma Stone who is my Personal favorite Actress and just proves why in this film playing a complete different character to what she has done in other movies. All in all Great Movie, Not for the kids but early teens would die for it and some little laughs for the adults! Cant wait for the Rumored 3D Sequel and a defiant must own on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie gets it just right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying this is my all time favourite film, as its on par with other great titles such as "Shaun of the dead", both of them falling under black comedy as a genre (you can see why I like them both.) So why is this film so good?Read on to find out!As a massive fan of the zombie genre I often find myself in the mood to watch a zombie film. Unfortunately, as more people like me become drawn to this genre the film industry pumps out more and more tacky films to make "quick money". These films generally are 90 minutes of action and nothing more. However not zombieland. The plot is simple, a lone survivor, nerd Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg)is making his way across America. Encountering other survivors they band together to fight the zombies, whilst trying to find those ever elusive Twinkies. Despite the previously mentioned simple plot this movie gets it just right.A great script is present,the characters bounce of each other with humorous quips that are sure to stay lodged in your brain. However the diamond in the rough lies within the characters. Something that is lacking in films now days when compared to TV shows is characters we care about. I understand why it's easier in TV shows, you have about 15 hours with the audience instead of 1 and a half. But in this film you do care about the characters, every last one of them in fact, and that's what counts. When they are in danger, you panic, not like in films when generic soldier #1 is in danger. This connection is down to the actors (superb by the way), they really portray there respective characters well, making it easy to see why they were cast.To conclude, this film has a spot on cast as well as script making for a very enjoyable few hours, and it doesn't get stale over time. So why aren't you buying it now? After all, you "have to enjoy the little things!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you think there are no more cool zombie movies left, you just always happen to watch an awesome new one. Zombieland was another example for this fact.The whole story is built up in such a funny way that the fact that the world is taken over by zombies doesn't appear scary at all. Our main character, Columbus is a typical geek from your everydays who could only survive the zombie apocalypse due to his fear of countless things. All the characters are lovely on their own way, and it's really adorable how they become kind of a family as the movie rolls on.The great sense of humor that appears in the movie permanently makes it really enjoyable and fun to watch, and with the great soundtrack it really gives you the feeling that probably a zombie apocalypse wouldn't be that deadly after all.Not much more to say, a fun and entertaining horror comedy that will definitely give you some good laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zombieland" is one of the best horror comedies out there. The cast is what makes it an awesome movie. Jesse Eisenburg plays the Michael Cera-niche everyone's accustom to, but the writing makes the character a lot more sympathetic. Michael Cera, to no offense as I enjoy most of his films, usually just comes off as pathetic and inhumanly good-natured. Woody Harrelson is the film definition of a bad-ass. His love for Twinkies is shared by me and the story makes him a lovable gun-toting hero. Emma Stone is pretty solid and Abigail Breslin is a talented child actor. There's nothing more annoying in a movie then a kid who either comes off as bratty or just bad at acting. She thankfully is neither.The story is a brisk one that moves quickly and while sticking to a technically predictable storyline, there are enough surprises in the writing to make it an enjoyable movie. The final battle music by David Sardy is epic and there's enough gore to satisfy me. I'm not quite sure if it's a horror classic but it is definitely a movie I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I told my dad it would go down as an American classic but he highly disagrees but you can still tell he loved the movie. I think all of the actors were picked accurately to play their roles (why did you casting directors think of Megan Fox for Wichita?).Bill Murray will probably get the award for Best Cameo in history (there is no such award but if there was, he should win it.)Jesse Eisenberg was so perfect for Columbus! He has that scardey-cat essence in him.Abigail Breslin, I bet enjoyed making this film (as any 13-year-old kid would), and she was superb in it.Emma Stone was great and I wouldn't have been able to imagine any one else for Wichita and she did really good! Maybe one of the best performances of the movie (besides Woody Harrelson).Woody Harrelson was truly the best of this movie. He was the funniest (e.g. "You weren't exactly stormin' the trenches before I came in") person in it and the awesomest! GO ZOMBIELAND!p.s. see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexpected zombie surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies are the second thing behind slashers in the Horror genre. Zombies are portrayed as funny, stupid, and brain-eating beasts, but more often scary than funny. This is like Shaun of the Dead in many ways, a funny Zombie Comedy. Director Ruben Fleischer really did a well done job on this. His future work should be impressive Jesse Eisenberg plays one of the few survivors, a dweeby, girl wishing Columbus when a mass virus turns ordinary people into crazed brain lovers. The virus is never explained. Who else but Woody Harrelson plays as Tallahassee. Thats all we need, a kick ass cowboy and a dweeb to save the world. They become friends and team up to rid the world of Zombies in the most ridiculous ways possible (not that there are any not ridiculous ways to kill zombies). They then run into Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Bresling). Sexy and Sly sisters trying to get to Claifornia to go to Pacific Playland where there are said no Zombies.Classical and Rock music are blended to create the perfect mix. The humor is non stop like Harrelson's hunt for a Twinkie. Not to mention a cameo from one of the best 80s movies. Playing a "zombiebuster" perhaps? Zombieland is perhaps one of the funniest Comedies of the year. Still The Hangover takes the cake for the best.Starring: Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. Directed by Ruben Fleischer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too shabby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a big fan of Zombie movies, I have to admit I had a blast watching Zombieland. It's the kind of movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't get plain goofy on the way either. Somewhat like an American version of Shawn of the Dead (the only other zombie movie I like), it has a good amount of both action and comedy. There is even an intensely sad scene as well, but it is brief enough that it doesn't take much away from the flow of the story while giving a touch of humanity to one of the main characters at the same time. There are a couple of plugs for soda and junk food shoved in there, but overall watching Zombieland is not a bad way to spend an evening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a feeling that people are actually going to enjoy this movie. If the movies Dawn of the Dead and Shaun of the Dead had a baby and chose a Michael Cera wanna-be to be the main character, they would name their undead child "Zombieland". Destined to be a cult classic, "Zombieland" has everything a fan of zombie movies would ever want, comedy and gore. Director Ruben Fleischer took a risk at making another zombie movie when the genre is already so saturated with mediocre films, but for some weird reason "Zombieland" was able to stand out amongst the crowd. Maybe it was the casting of Woody Harrelson?Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All films can be improved with an 11-year-old girl with a shotgun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for Zombieland I feared that it was simply to be a poor American copy of the classic British film Shaun of the Dead. Luckily I was wrong and Zombieland is a funny, action comedy in its own right and nearly as good as Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg's work.Two months after a virus turns most of the world's population into flesh eating zombies, Zombieland follows the survivor "Columbus" (Jesse Eisenberg), a social outcast who follows his list of 31 rules to survive. On the way back to home to Columbus, Ohio "Columbus" meets "Tallahassee" (Woody Harrelson), a handy man at killing zombies and on a mission to find the world's last Twinkie in world. After getting rob by two sisters, "Wichita" (Emma Stone) and "Little Rock" (Abigail Breslin) the four end up joining forces and head west to California, believing that there is an uninfected area.What makes Zombieland work is a very strong and witty script by Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, excellent direction from Ruben Fleischer and top comic performances from a great cast. The writers and Fleischer were able to mix both great witty dialogue, funny lines and reactions with excellent physical humour, sight gags and violence slapstick.Fleischer is a very stylist director, with particular the opening credits set during the collapse of society and the way the rules come up on screen. He was able to make a quick paced film, with a lot of violence action. The zombies are more like the creatures in 28 Days Later and the remake of Dawn of the Dead, fast and disgusting looking: they would have fitted well in a serious horror film. Fleischer knew how to handle his set-piece and much of the action was of top quality. The style of mixing bloody violence with a light hearted tone and some serious moments, and the way it was shot reminded me of Kick-Ass (which was actually released six months after Zombieland). The writers were able to inject some character development, allowing the characters to grow from lonely and develop trust and they do allow for serious moments and make the film more then just a mindless comedy gore feast. The scene in the store reminded me a little bit of the scene in 28 Days Later.There is great chemistry between the cast. Eisenberg and Harrelson are both normal comic talents and were an fine chalk and cheese combo. Emma Stone is an actress with potential and she dominate the feisty chick role: she looked the part (and was great looking) and she worked particularly well with a big name actor in cameo role. I look forward to seeing her in the next Spider-man film, but I think she would have been perfect as Mary-Jane Watson rather then Gwen Stacy. I am sure that a bit of dialogue was ad-lipped, which is always smart thing to do in a comedy. Breslin has shown she has had a good child actress ever since her debut in Signs and that had comic talent in Little Miss Sunshine. She also worked well with Harrelson, with them arguing and have a dislike to each other and talking about Willy Nelson and Hannah Montana. Plus she had a shotgun and any film can improve if it has an 11-year-old girl with shotgun.Dave Sardy also gave the film a fitting, intense rock score, adding to fun nature of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent first half-hour loses steam in the middle section.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is a movie with a great start that ultimately runs out of gas thanks to a plodding middle section, disappointing as it had the potential to be so much more than just another zombie movie lost amid a sea of recent other werewolf, vampire and zombie movies.Disclosure: Zombie fans be warned, Zombieland includes running zombies! If this lack of true to label zombie purity scares or frightens you perhaps you should avoid this one. Although the fact is that as zombies are fictional creations they can do whatever the f*ck a writer or director tells them to do, and perhaps you should do something they can't and get a life.Once again it seems the continental US is overrun by zombies, created by a mutation of mad cow disease - no doubt spread through slutty young Hollywood starlets banging rock stars and athletes who then passed it onto every groupie in the nation. That'd be the quickest way to do it I reckon, so any new virus that comes out from now on should be given a girl's name, like cyclones.I hereby dub the Zombieland plague - the Hilton Virus.Examples of the Hilton Virus are shown through the opening credits, three or four of the most memorable minutes in a credit sequence that I can remember. There is just something about slo-mo zombies in full flight tracking down a helpless victim, it's also why we watch with morbid fascination as the Lion catches the Gazelle, we don't want to see the kill itself, but we feel compelled to watch nonetheless.Circle of Life.The survivors of the initial onslaught are few and far between, and during the course of the movie they are referred to by their destination, therefore early on we meet Columbus, who acts as both star and narrator through the film.Columbus continues on as a survivor by adhering to a series of hard and fast rules that he does not allow himself to stray from. An example is the "Double Tap" rule. Once a zombie has been shot there is always the chance that they are merely slowed down, and might still rise up again to pose a threat, a second bullet in the head does the trick and makes sure that this uncertainty doesn't come back to bite you, (literally).A pretty nifty idea is that the rules appear on screen as described, and later on as they are repeatedly utilized, acting as an ongoing reminder that they generally work.Columbus is cautious, methodical and chatty in a nervous and fidgety way, something that the next guy he runs into, Tallahassee, is not. Tallahassee is many things, including hard to spell. He is a redneck with a cowboy hat, big boots and a fondness for big cars, he shoots first and doesn't ask questions later. He is reckless, vicious and hair triggered, and suspicious and untrusting of strangers.He also likes a sugary-bun sort of snack called Twinkies, so once Tallahassee decides to allow Columbus to tag along for a while, they go on an impromptu Twinkie hunt.I feel I need to point out right now that this runs a ratio of around 70/30 comedy to gore/violence, meaning that it's far more a comedy than a straight action or traditional "Zombie" film like Dawn of the Dead etc. The gore is often used for comic effect or simply to illustrate a point. Back to the Twinkie Hunt, Columbus and Tallahassee end up at a supermarket where they encounter two young girls, say 18 and 13 named Wichita and Little Rock. One appears infected, and after a humorous exchange it comes to light that our heroes have just been conned out of their arms and vehicle.After a short time on foot they run into the girls once more, this time they decide to team up for a while as the girls describe the destination, a Disney style park called Pacific Playground in California rumoured to be the only zombie-free pocket on the West Coast.The remainder of the movie follows them on their journey.It is worth noting that in a movie in which there are really only four main characters (and one cameo that Woody obviously teed up), they fortunately managed to cast them with likable, credible actors, none of which have the presence to carry a film by themselves, but as a group they do a creditable job.- Jesse Eisenberg / The guy from Adventureland (He likes "Land" films I guess) low key and self deprecating, a good counterpoint to: - Woody Harrelson / Despite being a pot smoking hippie who was never blessed with matinée looks Woody is still a funny guy and he adds value here.- Emma Stone / Best known as the chick Jonah Hill was after in Superbad, Stone is spunky, witty and confident in a non-annoying way.- Abigail Breslin / Is also in the movie.As mentioned earlier once the two pairs come across each other again and team up the movie loses its way for about 25 minutes, probably not coincidentally is that this happens to be the period between zombie encounters. In an 80 minute movie 25 minutes of lifeless (if you'll excuse the pun) inactivity between the "life-less activity" is inexcusable. (I swear that made sense as I wrote it.) This is not one of the best films I have seen recently, (though overall it is still solid), but it was one of the more enjoyable.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. I know a "7" hardly screams "Watch THIS!" but I was let down after the great start to the film was allowed to go to waste, if you liked Shaun of the Dead you won't hate this.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Z's in Zombieland!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The witty "Zombieland" definitely did wake me up from my zombie state and was a real eye-opener. The film is set in the future where a deadly plague that converts people into zombies has set its mark in the USA. "Take A Bite out of Slime" has superseded "Take A Bite Out of Crime", sorry McGruff. Jesse Eisenberg stars as pseudo-name Columbus, a gabby, jittery unzombie who has set his own "zombieland security" rules in order to defend himself against zombie attacks. Woody Harrelson co-stars as pseudo-name Tallahassee, a bad-ass "zombie exterminator" who plays by his own "zombieland security" rules which are more of the destroyer mode than Columbus' ones. The two coincidentally meet up in trying to search for locations that are "zombie free". In their journey, they meet up with a con-artist sister duet in Wichita and Little Rock, also pseudo-names, who are conniving in stealing property and dollars of the what's little left "male zombie-free" population. Eventually, the fearsome foursome do converge in most of the narrative of "Zombieland". Director Ruben Fleischer revitalized the zombie genre with some juicy, sharp bites in his orchestration of the movie. Rhette Reese also did a credible job in instilling his reese's pieces in the amusing scribe of the flick. I don't want to be a "plotbuster" but there is a cameo appearance of a comedic legend in "Zombieland" that does earn the film its "stripes". Cheers to Woody Harrelson for his enigmatic performance as Tallahassee, and to Jesse Eisenberg for connecting quite well as Columbus in the "Zombie Network". Emma Stone continues to impress as a startling young actress, and her performance as Wichita was one I was wishing I could see more of. Abigail Breslin as Little Rock was no "little miss sunshine" here, but she also delivered a fine performance. Hey, can't forget the Zombies! Kudos to those thousands of zombie extras that zom way had to make them believable. Hey, you just read a corny pun review of the film "Zombieland"! What are you going to do now? I am going to "Zombieland"!!! Or at least I am hoping you will. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rule Number 1 - Enjoy This Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Ruben Fleischer's first theater effort is quite successful as a piece of entertainment. Jesse Eisenberg is one of the male leads &amp; the narrator for a world pretty much taken over by Zombies. While you'd expect early on that maybe the world is too far gone, the film becomes interesting &amp; funny. Columbus (Eisenberg) is featured in the credits going over his rules on how to survive as a human in a world full of Zombies.He meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) after the credits, &amp; they start on a trek to Columbus where Columbus wants to see if his parents &amp; family have survived. On the way, they meet Wichita (Emma Stone)&amp; Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who immediately steal all their survival gear &amp; leave them to start over for themselves. Once they do, they meet the two young women again.Here the aim of the trek they are on changes as once the women decide they need to join up with the guys, Columbus finds out that there is nothing left where his family was. Meanwhile, the women's goal is an amusement park outside LA. This becomes the groups goal.The special effects in the movie are pretty realistic &amp; the abandoned cities, highways full of wrecks, &amp; other sets look very realistic. The cast works well together &amp; are just deep enough to keep the viewer engaged. This is done for laughs &amp; the cast is a good ensemble. Abigail Breslin is 13 when this movie was done, &amp; you can still recognize Little Miss Sunshine though she has a more extensive role in this movie than the former. While Eisnberg &amp; Harrelson dominate the film more, the two women have fairly full co-star roles.Watching it I swear there are a couple of times I see people in windows behind the actors that are not part of the film. While there is a major cameo in this film, these other folks in the background look like they just happen to be watching the shooting as they do not look like zombies. While this film is not long on plot, it is well acted, directed &amp; solidly put together. A pleasant diversion for a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Any Regrets...Garfield, Maybe"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast-paced from beginning to end, Zombieland defies what has been done with zombies beforehand and goes for the laughs in the same way if not the same manner as films like Shaun of the Dead. Jesse Eisenberg plays the narrator and lead as a young man ripped from his humdrum life to follow a code of rules he has developed in order to survive the zombie holocaust. Throughout the film we are reminded of his rules, his fears, his phobias, and his thoughts in a most humorous way. He ends up teaming with wild and crazy guy Woody Harrelson(who is always good with these kinds of roles)and later with hot Emma Stone and her sister(in film) Abagail Breslin. Thefour shoot, hack, bludgeon, etc... zombies along the way to California as the young girl wants to see the Pacific Play Park(something like that) from her youth. The characters are known from the cities they are from and I found the film's script to be rather witty and disgustingly funny throughout even though there really, on the surface, is not a lot to work with in terms of plot structure. About halfway in the film a cameo of a major star comes up and it IS the highlight of the film. It is incredibly humorous and the guest star does his level best to be self-deprecating as well as amusing. Director Ruben Fleisher shows he has a future with his directorial flair and ability to care for characters even in a funny film like this. There are so many good, solid laughs that come from all kinds of sources and types of humor that this one does not just rely on the "beat" a dead zombie up to a pulp mentality. I thoroughly enjoyed Zombieland - especially the climatic end. Despite the comedic intent the film obviously has, there are some truly scary moments as well, and I found myself jumping out of the seat a time or two. Even regular horror films today don't often do that for me. I guess part of it deals withe the ability to create suspense, the care we have invested in the characters, and, perhaps most importantly, there is more here than just death and killing and none of them over the death bloody(the beginning credits being the exception).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out For Those Contaminated Burgers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For women who want to learn how to (supposedly) catch a man, there is Fein &amp; Schneider's infamous 1995 book "The Rules." However, those who want to know about a different set of rules--specifically, those pertaining to surviving a zombie apocalypse--are advised to check out Ruben Fleischer's 2009 horror comedy "Zombieland." In the opening, perhaps funniest section of this consistently LOL-funny movie, a diffident, IBS-afflicted college kid, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, who currently stars as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in "The Social Network"; ironic, as one of his funniest lines as Columbus is a Facebook put-down), gives us a half dozen illustrated rules for escaping "the plague of the 21st century": the remarkably swift-moving flesh eaters. (As in the recent "28 Days Later," the zombies here are not lumbering, reanimated corpses, but rather crazed, homicidal victims of a viral pandemic, in this case brought about by contaminated burgers.) Columbus soon encounters three other noninfected humans while traveling from Austin to his namesake hometown in Ohio: Tallahassee, who excels at the art of battling zombies and is very amusingly portrayed by Woody Harrelson, and two young sisters, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). (How the two sisters--if they really are sisters--come to hail from different burgs is never explained.) Ultimately, the four decide to cruise over to L.A.'s supposedly zombie-free Pacific Playland (an amusement park in wintry Valdosta, Georgia was actually used). In his first go as director, Fleischer keeps his film zipping along smoothly and efficiently. His picture is perhaps more successful as a comedy than as a horror film, however; the requisite zombie carnage is hardly anything new or original, and no zombie kills on the order of the imaginative flame-up by flare gun, as seen in George A. Romero's 2010 outing "Survival of the Dead," are to be had here. The film veers sharply into the land of the absurd when the quartet crashes the L.A. mansion abode of Bill Murray, and starts goofing around with the big man himself. (The line about Eddie van Halen is a riot.) Actually, the entire film is something of a hoot, with a cracklingly funny script and some very able performances by the four leads. And yet, the gorehounds out there shouldn't be disappointed; the action scene between Columbus and his crazed neighbor in 406, and the final zombie slaughter in the amusement park, are pretty darn gripping. In all, the film is tremendous fun. And oh...all you "Caddyshack" fans out there (I have never been one) will certainly want to stick around for that final coda after the end credits....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it in the movies. Loved it. Bought the DVD. Just watched it =&gt; felt obliged to spend my 2 cents on it. I think this along with the original "Dawn if the dead" are two of the best zombie movies ever, period: DotD delivers the message with blood n guts, ZL delivers the laughs with blood and guts... and some. On the surface, this is like "Hatchet" with Zombies with some of that post-Scream self-aware. But I'm also willing to claim that under the surface, there's more: I would go so far as to say that this is like both a parody and a right-on-the-spot take on the post generation-X comedies... a Kevin Smith movie, "Dazed and confused"... or perhaps, most fittingly, "Say anything" with zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is perfectly cast as "Columbus", a geek who gets a rude awakening into a world suddenly overrun by flesh-eating corpses. Woody Harrelson is perfectly cast as a trigger-happy mentor who picks Columbus as his sidekick. And Emma Stone... perfectly cast, playing the damsel in distress/ femme fetale along with... (sorry. I just got lost in her reindeer-in-the-spotlight eyes. Did I mention she's perfectly cast?) with an okay Abigail Breslin on her tow. That's about all you need to know. Won't spoil you the fun, but all I can tell you that there's plenty of it: I'm an 34 year-old Finn with a master's degree, and I laughed my ass off along with all the 18-year-olds in the crowd. "Zombieland" instantly got into one of my top-five experiences in a movie theatre. Can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by "Zombieland". Was it a great movie? Well, no, but it was pretty good. I'd been ignoring my friends' requests to see it ever since it came out in theaters. I just thought it looked stupid and didn't want to waste my time or money on such a stupid movie.Then, it was released on DVD and Blu-Ray and I still didn't see it. I don't know why, there was just something about how it was portrayed in the theatrical trailer and TV spots that made it seem so unappealing. Thankfully, it was released as an "instant stream" movie on Netflix and I finally caved and watched it...and you know what? It's not half bad! There are two things that make this movie watchable...Woody Harrelson and a hilarious cameo by an actor bearing the initials "B.M.". If you haven't seen the movie yet, I won't spoil it for you. If those two elements weren't involved, I'd hold no reservations in saying I wouldn't have liked this movie at all. The younger actors, while decent enough in their roles, just wouldn't have been enough to keep me entertained.Overall, I'd say this movie was pretty good. I think going into it with low expectations helped me to enjoy it more, and I'd recommend others do the same. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Secondly nothing much actually happens until the last half hour, which tries my patience. In my opinion if a movie gets stretched for that long then there is much of a story to tell in the first place.It looks like a typical marwari marriage party video with the all the ingredients: Big family, happy family, no horror element. The story is thin line and moves form one non horror scene to another, with some funny tricks added, like the old trial and test methods. This is no food for the head movie.It is solely for family entertainment, a picnic and a money spinning machine.Not recommended for serious viewing.</fullReview>

And Woody Harrellson... what is there to say? not a role we've ever really seen him in, and he absolutely NAILS it. with hilarious twists and turns, and scenes that in any other circumstance would be considered cheesy, but just enhance the comedic effect and plot line. The opening credits are really cool and are enough to get you salivating over this awesome zombie flick. This movie is a must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland 80When this came out in theaters, I truly had no desire to see it. When I did eventually view it after it came out on DVD, I was completely in love with it. It was not alone just a comedy, but had good action and almost an entire different look at the zombie apocalypse scenario. Jesse Eisenberg was great, and made an unlikely great pair with Woody Harrelson. It was a great story that was unique and always interesting. I was completely intrigued the entire duration of the film. Everyone should watch this film if you are in to the Walking Dead or just action/comedy movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Notches Below "Shaun of The Dead"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Turning from the seamless and neat "Shaun of The Dead", this film has been downgraded from "all right" to "inferior" in a sudden. Perhaps British humor works better with me, for the jokes here seem crude and unpolished. Yes, it is a very fun movie, but not as funny as "Shaun" would have you feel. I am not sure if "Zombieland" is meant to be a parody. If so, a big misfire. "Shaun", on the contrary, captures the society we live today quite well. This may be another proof that the Americans have always been more conservative and US-prone than they think. Democrat Party's platform policies may ring true to their desire to become, but Republican platforms are truly the way they do things. This is why American films stop being critical of the American society. Self- criticism is important to the ones in power. Zombies in "Shaun" are a part of the plot, while the ones in "Zombieland" run around only as props. Having said all this, if your only purpose is to have fun and nothing else, here you go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are loads of Zombie films these days and very few of them (in my opinion) are funny or good. I have to say this movie was both hilarious and disgusting! My theater was packed and everyone of them was cracking up all the way through it! What was really clever about the movie was that all of these 4 characters are all in their way either dumb or just plain cruel or stupid, and yet, they are the only survivors left in the whole world! That's what I really love about it.It did have some slow points where it got too dramatic and went without laughs for at least a good 20 minutes or so, but excluding that..it's perfect.Very disgusting, sick and twisted and hilarious movie! If you hate this movie you must be a zombie! Rule Number #1. See this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's been a sea-change in the inchoate zombie population. They started out as Haitian voodoo dudes suffering mind control, which I'm sure they weren't that happy with, but that had to have been better for them than the cursed, magical, lurching, rotting wrecks that guys like George A. Romero changed them into. They remained thus until just recently, when movies like 28 Days Later and the remake of Dawn of the Dead stole their eldritch supernatural mojo, gave them some kind or another mutant blood virus, and let them sprint rather than shamble (much to the chagrin of dudes like the one seeing Romero speak recently at TIFF, cheering and wearing a "Fast Zombies Suck" t-shirt). What the zombies think about their new status as speedy, ill unfortunates is unknown. They seem angry though.As the zombies themselves have matured, so has the film genre itself. Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland is an example of a recent spate of genre flicks that are twisting up their common tropes to tell stories that aren't in any particular traditional way about, say, the zombies that their characters spend most of the film killing (the Spierig Bros. upcoming Daybreakers is another example, a corporate thriller set in the Vampire Apocalypse milieu). Zombieland is at its heart a shy-boy-meets-girl love story, its just that the boy and girl are two of maybe the only four non-zombie humans on Earth.It's a funny film, led by Jessie Eisenberg as Columbus. He has the same thing going on in this film as he did in this year's very very good Adventureland: a self-assured Woody Allenish nebbishy aggressiveness that is equal parts entertaining and off-putting (as my movie partner pointed out halfway through the film, he has an impossible-to-ignore-once-you-notice-it staring problem).The film positions itself at a point farther along in a theoretical zombie apocalypse than the normal zombie fodder does, at a point in which the survivors are not particularly scared of the zombies, having developed and honed their survival skills and lethality to the point that they represent little more than a nuisance. The film trades in the traditional zombie movie scares for laughs and gloriously disgusting zombie gore, as the heroes and the filmmakers find more and more brutal ways to kill them. There's a scene in the middle of the film that is completely, utterly unexpected and absolutely hilarious, so much so that the film feels like a lead-up to and denouement away from the 8 or 10 minutes smack in the middle of it. It's unfair almost, as its so good that it makes the rest of the film, which isn't in any way bad and is in fact filled with beautiful riotous moments (including a spectacularly pretty title sequence), seem dull in comparison. It can never quite hang together. Taking the fear out of the zombie genre takes the suspense out, and that's a big hole in the heart of this film that is almost filled with humour and character, but unfortunately, not quite. 6.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to say that I love zombie movies in general so that may have added a little bit of bias towards my review. Overall I thought that the movie was a good mix of comedy and action. The plot was pretty predictable, even the minor twists but overall Im assuming that the viewers go to watch zombies getting their ass kicked. It had some funny parts, some really funny parts, and some dull parts. Without going into too much detail, the best parts are when all four main characters are together. There was a lot of blood and organs being spewed around which made it kind of hard for me to eat my food. The acting was really good I enjoyed it, the characters blended really well and they all delivered great performances with a guest appearance from Bill Murray. The movie was good overall but not great, its not going to be a block buster hit but if you enjoy watching reckless violence mixed in with some comedy I would recommend this to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this on Friday night, and i must say i was absolutely stunned by Zombieland. From start to finish it has to be one of the funniest movies i've seen. Woody Harrelson does an excellent job and so do the rest of the main characters. All of them are interesting. The beginning had a unique bloody intro with good music that i think will appeal well to all audiences. The thing that really made this movie soooo good for me was the celebrity cameo. it was absolutely hilarious. Probably one of the best i've seen, by far beats Mike Tyson's in the Hangover (although he did provide some laughs). So overall a unique, interesting, and ultimately hilarious horror-comedy that is well worth seeing. So go out and see it! it's one of the funniest movie's this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny entertaining horror send up.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went in expecting a horror comedy film, but it is more comedy than horror. The horror part happens around the comedy. This film never takes itself too seriously. It was what Shaun of The Dead almost was in opinion. It never gets boring or stupid for a second. All the lead actors work well together. They seem to be having a fun time.Jesse Eisenberg goes from Adventureland to Zombieland, what are the odds. The funny pairing of Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson is done with comedic perfection. I had my doubts about Eisenberg doing comedy. Because he oftener plays serious one and the comedy happens around him, like in Adventureland. But he was pretty funny here, and he and Harrelson are like a perfect team. Now Emma Stone(last seen in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past) in not all funny, but she holds her own. Abigail Breslin I feel was not giving much to act on.But none the less an entertaining film. If you are in the mood for a fun time go see Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fun zombie movie spoof starring Jesse Eisenberg as a nebbish whose host of rules keep him safe during the zombie apocalypse. He meets up with Woody Harrelson, a tough guy who loves killing zombies, as well as two sisters, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, who aren't nearly as helpless as they first seem. The group travels to Los Angeles, where the two girls believe there is a zombie-free zone at a famous amusement park (Harrelson and Eisenberg aren't so sure). The film starts off fresh with a great montage of slow-motion zombies chasing after their meals, and its quite fun for well over half its run. You may have heard that the film has one of the all-time great cameo appearances ever. That's absolutely true, and if it hasn't already been spoiled for you, stay away from its IMDb page and any other spoiler sources. The movie starts to run out of steam as it nears the end. The final sequence in the amusement park is fun, but characters begin to act stupidly. Plus, you can't help wonder why the heck the power is still running everywhere, and just how in the heck the two gals are running the rides and riding them at the same time (not to mention how they get off said rides without anyone at the controls to stop them). It's definitely a film worth seeing, but I might recommend waiting for video.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Zombie Flick by Zombie Fans for Zombie Fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a regular Michael Bay apologetic, I feel I have a solid appreciation for entertainment for the sake of entertainment. A movie doesn't have to have groundbreaking social context or an overreaching message, nor does it have to have an original or complicated storyline. It just needs to be fun. Ladies and gentlemen, meet Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland.Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is one of few survivors of the big ol' virus outbreak that, believe it or not, has turned the world into a post-apocalyptic hellhole. He survives by following a set list of rules he keeps with him at all time, and which pop up on-screen as a reminder whenever a rule is used. Columbus is on his way to, well, Columbus and on the way meets up with grizzly bad@ss and Twinkie enthusiast Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who follows no rules and treats the apocalypse like a zombie-infested playground. These two heroes eventually meet up with sisters/con artists Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), with whom they discover the secrets to being happy in Zombieland. While wreaking bloody havoc.What we have here is a fun flick made by zombie fans for zombie fans. The plot is mostly predictable and full of holes, but it doesn't matter because it's having fun while helping us have fun. For every silly moment there's at least twenty hearty laughs to be had, whether it be from the crazy editing, the gratuitous gore effects, the witty banter, pop culture references, or just a fun celebrity cameo, it's all good. I don't think I went five minutes without laughing, while everyone around me got a good few more in. The witty banter part is important above all else, as it's what carries the movie in between zombie gutting, thanks to the energetic and perfectly timed performances by its leads.Jesse Eisenberg is a guy to watch. I didn't get to see Adventureland, but he peaked my interest in the trailers. Now upon seeing him here, I pray to the almighty David Bowie in the sky that he doesn't end up like Michael Ceral who started out with a similar routine and, well, still uses the same routine. This dude has perfect comedic timing, bringing fresh helpings of nervousness and sarcasm to the table. His narration brought a lot to the proceedings, adding laughs on top of the laughs, and his overall charm and nerdy understanding of zombies helped me really feel for him. He's like some sort of bizarre mutant laugh salad. With really crunchy croutons.Speaking of fresh acting, welcome back Woody Harrelson to the Legion of Bad@ssery! The man sweats victory here, while allowing us some dramatic characterization to help add some emotion to the predominantly fun, happy-go-lucky film. He's not a complex character, but he has more than enough depth for a movie about blowing off rotting corpse heads. In the end he, as well as the rest of the cast, are just like each other in the most basic yet important aspects, and are ironically brought together by the zombie apocalypse. It's really all very touching, and I dare you not to feel just a little saddened when the film gets into Tallahassee's backstory. I triple dog dare you.Now mind you, the film does have actual faults. As said, the plot holes are rampant and the plot is very, very predictable. Most of the bigger jokes (aside from the cameo, which was sadly already spoiled for me) can be seen coming from miles away, as can major dramatic moments. We know who's going to get with who, we know what friendships will be made, we know what challenges will inevitably show up for certain characters. However, and this is a big however, did I care? Heck no. Thanks to both the humor and fun editing, I was too entertained to give a rat's ass about any of that.In fact, Zombieland is a fine example of a very, very funny movie made even better by brilliant editing. The rules that literally pop whenever they're practiced are given a life of their own, and are inserted with a comic timing that rivals Eisenburg's. The "Cardio" and "Double Tap" jokes definitely got the most laughs from the theater and myself, but there wasn't a single ill-timed rule, including the "Don't be a hero" rule that is given just to be broken for dramatic purpose later on in the story. They're a fine touch, along with the overcranking (read: slo-mo) that is shown in the trailer and prevalent throughout the film itself. Bouncing zombie stripper titties, three legged race father-and-son zombies, and general gore are made even more humorous and gruesome at nearly one hundred frames a second.As long as I'm on the subject of editing, the main titles were some of the best I've seen in years. The whole montage is made up of slow motion zombie attacks that usually interact with the credits, pushing them aside or shattering them, punctuated by Metallica's "For Whom the Bell Tolls", which is surprisingly even better than it sounds. The whole thing was a laugh riot, and was disappointing to see end. Luckily, the rest of the soundtrack consists of Van Halen, Sea Wolf, Lou Reed and a bunch of other legends, so the atmosphere given by the opening titles never really leaves.It's not a perfect film by any means, but zombie fans will love it and the general public (who, from my experience, tend to be made up of zombie fans) should too. It's lighthearted entertainment with one or two little mini-messages to warm our hearts while brains are being splattered across the screen.Full Review at SufferForYourArt.com</fullReview>

It's more interesting than Zombieland. By far.The film is glossy and has a videogameesqueness that should appeal to those who like, well, glossy video games. Even has pop up rules like you might see in the tutorial level of a, well, glossy video game. It looks just fine.End of positive comments.I won't even go into the plot other than to wonder who got paid to pull a script out of The Big Hollywood Vomit Jar of Horror/Comedy Clichés. Not a surprise to be found in this one folks.The cast. Woody H. plays (badly) a Twinkie obsessed, absurdly proficient gun slinger. Some kid I've seen somewhere before but don't know his name and don't care to look it up plays (fairly) Columbus Ohio, a social outsider who, predictably, finally finds a family. A couple of girls play (forgettably) a couple of girls. B.M. plays B.M. At least he has the good sense to get killed.Oh, and yeah, there's zombies. Bloody, fast moving, never scary zombies. In a never scary, never funny, never entertaining film.Please skip it. Put your money back in your pocket and add Twinkies to you grocery list. Now, those are good.</fullReview>

As Tallahassee sets out on a mission to find the last Twinkie on Earth, the duo meets up with Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), two young girls who have resorted to some rather unorthodox methods to survive amidst the chaos. Reluctant partners in the battle against the undead, all four soon begin to wonder if it might be better to simply take their chances alone.Starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, Amber Heard , Bill Murray , Derek Graf and a bunch of zombies. ;pwell i completely ignored this movie when it was released. i just didn't cared about this movie at all. i thought this is going to be another bad zombie movie. but when i saw good reviews and the jaw dropping Rotten Tomatoes score i was so excited to watch this movie. and i did a few weeks ago and i loved it.a completely pleasant surprise it was. Directed by Ruben Fleischer who directed the upcoming flick 30 Minutes or Less did a good job. nice screenplay and make up alongwith cinematography and art direction and other technical stuff.this was a movie funny as hell. like extremely funny as hell, a great laugh out loud comedy that is very hilarious. truly the most hilarious zombie comedy though i forgot Shaun of the Dead i think i need to watch it again. best action comedy of the year.Jesse Eisenberg is a revelation, Woody was great and so were Emma and Abigail. a great cameo too. movie is wickedly funny with plenty of smart humor and plenty of gore. a road trip zombie comedy that is fun to watch and quite enjoyable. a well made movie. i loved it. one of my most favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For A Zombie Film: It Follows "Shaun" Roots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As what some critics have stated, it's like "Shaun of the Dead" meets "Superbad" and I have to say that I agree with them on that point! I thought the 2004 British film with Simon Pegg (the inspiration for this film) was hilarious and scary at the same time, but "Zombieland" wouldn't have been worth watching unless you added stars like Woody Harrelson and the underrated Jesse Eisenberg into the mix! As the story goes, the world has been ravaged by flesh-hungry zombies and a small group of survivors must join forces in staying alive and fending off the horrific creatures (albeit in many humorous methods you yourself might think of).I'll admit that some scenes did seem contrived and could have improved on learning more about each character's past exploits, but director Ruben Fleischer managed to come up with a clever idea of blending the typical zombie film with elements of teenage angst. One scene I remember, for example, was when Columbus (Eisenberg) claimed how he scored with this one girl he made up, but the audience would know well he's hopeless on romantic confrontations. This hences the "Superbad" reference. As a whole, the movie was pretty much more of a laugh fest than something to fear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People, you are honestly killing the film industry, this movie was trash it wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, no acting no story, bad effects, and rubbish cameos, in the tradition of other bad films like the hangover, and Ironman this film just throws a bunch of random scenes together through the convenience of a road trip. Movies like this are killing the industry and are the reason why i hate 80% of the films i see in theatres. Harrelson is a second rate action lead and the only thing i like about him is his sawed off winchester which is ripped off "once upon a time in the west".Eisenberg is a 4th rate Micheal Cera, the movie was probably written for Cera but why would he touch this hunk of garbage with a ten foot pole, Eisenbreg steps in and makes the character almost unbearable. The film is blown away by horrible cameos, like Bill Murray and mike Tyson in The hangover. What the hell is wrong with you people. I can't believe this actually exists on paper somewhere. The script was a piece of trash, the comedy was so stupid. I could write a better zombie movie in a weekend and one day i will. the only thing i enjoyed were the slow motion credits, they made me believe that there might be something to this film but then 30 minutes later and 0 laughs later i realized that the film was as good as the trailer, which was also a piece of trash. I'm tired of CG gun shot squibs, and acting which is supposed to be based on real life. Film is supposed to be escapism but todays audience is so stupid, story doesn't matter, just throw a bunch of stupid ideas together with no connection and we have a hit. Why are the girls going to a theme park? Maybe the worst idea ever. When Abigail Breslin is introduced we are meant to believe that she is infected and that her sister is going to kill her with a shotgun, that's a brilliant idea, kill off the 12 year old girl in the first 2 minutes by blowing her face off, that's a great idea, but no it's all a big trick. The flashbacks are terrible and I would gladly watch any Romero zombie film over this hunk of embarrassment, even diary of the dead and that movie was terrible. Friends of mine think this was a classic, to tell you the truth if you have a positive opinion of this film your wrong period, everyone deserves their own opinion but that doesn't mean that your isn't wrong. This movie was trash, absolute trash and as the fact that this movie did good means there will probably be 20 clones of it that suck too. Hitchcock and John ford would be spinning in their graves if they saw the current state of the film industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer for this movie looked great, a zombie comedy with woody kicking ass. I even read reviews in the local paper that were giving it 4 out of 5 stars, and then saw the lofty rating on IMDb. So I had pretty high expectations going in. The result is probably one of the biggest let downs I have ever had at the movies. I kept waiting for the funny to come, and aside from the scenes with Bill Murray, all the remotely funny moments were covered in the preview. I kept waiting to laugh out loud but it never came. The premise had so much potential. Its like they just held back in scenes that I feel really could have been taken to another level or a bit farther and I would have enjoyed them. In the end I didn't care about the characters at all. It seems like the director found a super slow motion camera and decided to film a bunch of scenes that were pointless. I was so disappointed in this movie that I felt compelled to comment, this is my first comment ever on a movie. I would say this ranks as one of the worst I have ever seen, along with pootietang. And at least in seeing that movie I didn't have any lofty expectations coming in. As I was leaving the theater some other people were commenting that it was by far the worst movie they had ever seen. I've read of comparisons to shaun of the dead, I enjoyed shaun of the dead a great deal. Shaun is leaps and bounds funnier and more intelligent then zombieland. I did not enjoy this movie. Don't believe the hype.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring Deception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After an outbreak with a deadly virus, the United States of America becomes the United States of Zombieland with the whole population transformed into flesh eater zombies. The outcast teenager Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) follows the rules he has created to survive in a country infested of zombies. While going to Columbus, where his parents lived, he hitches a ride with the tough Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) that loves Twinkle and slaying zombies, and they travel together. Along their journey, they meet the tricksters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) that are heading to an amusement park nearby Los Angeles. The sisters only trust on each other and they deceive the guys in different opportunities. But in the end, they learn that they should stay together to survive in Zombieland.The overrated "Zombieland" is a boring deception, with a weak humor and non-scary zombie scenes. The greatest surprise is the IMDb Rating of 8.0/10 with 40,436 votes and reviews telling that this flick is great or will become a "cult classic". Actually, the story is silly; the narrative of Columbus is tedious; and the cameo of Bill Murray is totally dull. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

You quickly see kills and funny death scenes and it just picks up more steam from there. I found this movie to have the best amount of horror and comedy to balance it out and even a bit of a love story which fit right in perfectly. The young cast aside from Woody was right for this movie but the star has to be Woody Harrelson he mad this movie great. He was back to form and never let up. The movie had very funny moments especially the entire Bill Murray scene. OH MY GOD was the funny not to mention the obsession with twinkies. Zombieland will be the movie to knock off Meatballs and be number 1, zombieland is worth every penny its a must see movie which everyone of all ages will enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombie Kill Of The Week!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What SHAUN OF THE DEAD did for the UK, ZOMBIELAND did for the US. The story: A mysterious virus (reminiscent of mad cow disease) has swept America, turning people into bloodthirsty "mad zombies". Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has a list of rules that he follows to a tee in order to survive. However, his loner existence is soon shaken up when he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson in his best, laidback, nonchalant role). Teaming up, the duo exchange witty banter while looking for the one thing post-apocalyptic society can't live without: Twinkies. But their plans are further complicated by sisters, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and Wichita (Emma Stone). Late in the film, there's a memorable cameo by a "famous comedy actor", but I won't reveal who it is... Just in case you're one of the few people who hasn't heard the secret already! Overall, this popular zomedy (or zom-com) has a healthy dose of chuckles, quotable zingers, funny and fresh characters, as well as the requisite of gory zombie violence. So sit back, relax, and have a bloody good time!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(All my reviews will be/are marked "may contain spoilers", because I'm paranoid. I don't *think* I've spoiled anything but...)I am so sorry I forced us to stop watching this movie in History class...Having now built up more of a tolerance for gore and horror, and general zombieness, I have now watched this movie, and, having got through the opening sequence, I found myself enjoying it very much. Not one of my favourite movies, and perhaps not on my top ten list, but certainly enjoyable, humorous and a good movie. And this is coming from someone who is generally quite squeamish. There are a few very gory scenes, but if you're able to get past that, it's very good. Or at least, I enjoyed it. An apocalypse movie that doesn't make me wish it were true.("Double Tap.")

		<shortDescription>A fun ride for a zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of all the zombie movies I've watched, Zombieland presents an easy going and fun ride for a story compared to its counterparts. This movie can nicely tell a zombie-post-apocalyptic world and retains many traits of a standard zombie movie without having to be overly stupid or gruesome or horrifying. I like how the movie keeps the focus about the survivors on a journey and banding together. The sharply contradictory characters are also deeply developed with each of the characters having a specific flashback sequences to base their behaviors on. The acting overall is a good one. With Woody Harrelson as the senior of the four main cast, I see his role not only extends as in the movie itself, but also as a mentor to the then newcomers of Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geeky Randy's summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critically acclaimed zombie comedy about a group of apocalypse survivors trying to find a sanctuary. Starts off very promising, with awkward college student Eisenberg and violently Twinkie craving Harrelson learning new skills from each other while also revealing their tragically humorous histories. Unfortunately, Stone and Breslin come along and?while initially helping add elements and humor to the plot?ultimately ruin all the fun, with Stone becoming a love-interest to Eisenberg, and Breslin offering nothing except lame jokes on adolescent ignorance and obliviousness. Started as a spec script for a TV pilot, and even with its short runtime, the film gets less and less interesting as it progresses. Still, despite the easy jabs at the movie's imperfections, it is without a doubt hilarious and entertaining, and even at some points? classic.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS** Zombieland is the funniest horror movie that I have ever saw. Shut- in Columbus, played by Jessie Eisenberg sets out from his college campus in Texas to return to his home town of Columbus Ohio to see what is left after the zombie apocalypse. Along the way, he pairs up with an ultra-tough Tallahassee, played by Woody Harrelson, who is in-route to his home state of Florida who has no real plans other than killing zombies. The duo meet up and join forces with a pair of street-smart sisters, steamy Wichita played by Emma Stone and her little sister Little Rock, Played by Abigail Breslin. The two who are heading to the west coast for a theme park that is supposed to be zombie free. Tallahassee lost his beloved Buck to the zombie outbreak is roaming southern United States in search of a twinkie when he happens across Columbus. Despite his tough guy persona, he becomes a big brother or body guard type to Columbus and then to the rest of the group. Columbus, who desperately seeks human connections is smitten with Wichita from first glance but has never had success with the ladies. Wichita, who with the help of her sister has been scamming men with her charm and good looks prior to the zombie outbreak, doesn't trust or let any enter her life except for her sister. Circumstantially, the foursome decide to stick together and head for Pacific Playland so that Little Rock can experience and enjoy some part of her youth. Unlike other dark horror zombie movies that focus on people working together to survive like Dawn of the Dead. Zombieland uses comedy and human connections to tell a feel good love story set post- apocalypse. Most scenes feature a mixture of funny scenarios and bright sunny days that outweigh the horror of flesh eating zombies roaming the earth. The film is narrated by Columbus whose quirky rules pop up on the screen and diffuse tense situations ensuring that the film focuses on comedy. Although this is a movie filled with zombies and gore the comedic story and cast leave the viewer smiling and laughing from start to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland (2009):Can this movie really be the answer to the question of what the best zombie movie is? Well, lets just put it this way. The humorous moments and some exaggerated, yet still funny scenes, made it an achievement which you don't quite expect from a movie about zombies.The enjoyment it gave us in watching action scenes really stood out, and the overall story telling for a zombie movie was actually pretty well done.The overall story was well delivered in a relatively short amount of time.It felt like we were at a fair that included everything but suspension . However the lack of it did not made the roller-coaster ride unpleasant. It just sometimes made it a little bit boring.Still, I find the movie well written and in my opinion received low expectations, but delivered high results.Review by: Brendan Resnick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland successfully does something that hasn't happened since Shaun of the Dead, make zombies enjoyable. While the movie arguably isn't a "real" zombie movie like Dawn of the Dead, it still is an exceptional addition to the genre. To put it lightly, the zombie genre has grown stale, boring, and lame if you will. Gems such as Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland are what keep it alive, and that isn't a bad thing. While many terrible movies will be released because of these movies, we suffer through them for movies like Zombieland. Speaking solely of this movie though, the acting is great, the jokes are hilarious and very clever (plus an amazing cameo), and the zombies look great. He best part is that there are actual scary parts of this comedy movie. I think the most amazing thing about Zombieland is it pulled a Shaun of the Dead, make zombies funny but also still be a zombie movie, which many believed to be a one time feat. This movie is a spiritual successor to the earlier zombie flick, and it lives up to it gloriously. Seriously though, if you haven't seen this movie or Shaun of the Dead, watch them now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have now watched Zombieland fourth time and its still great fun to watch. It may not have been as surprisingly fun as first view but Zombieland has good enough rewatch value. More than the comedy I like the feel good theme of film and the way it balances all its drama,horror,comedy,romance and everything else. We all know the plot of any Zombie movie. Here it says some mad cow diseases spread to humans making them mad humans then into mad zombies. Well its absurd but that's not focus of the film. Much of it is about surviving the onslaught of zombies and to find the feeling of being a human in the world filled with these horrid creatures. The story is of 4 such people who are referred to only by the names of the place where they come from. Jesse Eisenberg's nerdy yet disciplined for survival character 'Columbus' meets Woody Harrelson's character 'Tallahassee' who is more of zombie kick-ass with a bit too much love for something called Twinkie. This odd duo meet another duo of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who again know all the tricks to survive Zombieland. Romance is thrown in which looked a bit forced but we are busy admiring the uniqueness of each character that it did not matter much.The character of Columbus is hands down my favorite. His set of rules to survive Zombieland which pop up every now and then were absolutely hilarious. The script is highly enjoyable with some really witty and hilarious dialogues. There is quite a lot of gore which wasn't quite necessary but it adds to the horror element. There is also a surprising cameo by a great comedy star and his entire sequence was the funniest bit of the film. At the run-time of only 88 minutes it never gets boring. The cast is only of 4 people (plus the cameo) and everyone else is Zombie. Each one of them was amazing to watch. It is a nice blend of horror comedy with the right amount of drama and thrills. Nothing feels a bit too much thus making it entertaining all the way.I try to avoid Zombie movies because at the end all of them follow the same path. But Zombieland is not only one of the best zombie film among the few I have seen but also a very good comedy film. Even if you don't like Zombie movies watch it. It is really fun, but make sure you can handle some blood and gore. I would give Zombieland a 7/10 but the cameo part was a show stealer.It is one of the most hilarious sequences I have seen so gave it an extra star. RATING: [4/5]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Zombie Comedy?.What's not to love!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Zombie Comedy?.What's not to love!!! (One Line Summary) ****Spoiler Alert***** As a precaution I thought I would throw out the spoiler alert. It would be hard not to with this film, although the previews took care of most of the spoiling for us. How could you not give a great review of this film? First, it is a comedy and the main characters, Woody Harrelson (Tallahassee) and Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) make for a big film almost "Odd Couple" comedic duo. The other quasi main characters are Emma Stone as Wichita and Abigail Breslin as Little Rock. Wichita and Little Rock, albeit important to the films plot, don't hold a candle to the mojo that Tallahassee and Columbus throw down. The theme, although kind of multi-layered is?? well pretty much killing zombies. From the very start of the film to the very end, there is complete zombie carnage and killing. Columbus, with invisible voice over tells the story if you will of how he got to the point of where the movie is based, which is basically in a zombie filled world all alone. All alone that is until he stumbles onto Tallahassee on an abandoned car filled highway (left over's from the apocalypse). While he is dragging a roller equipped suitcase walking down the highway, Tallahassee comes driving along in a Zombie killing machine (Cadillac Escalade). After a few minute "stand-off" Columbus hops into Tallahassee's caddy and they become good friends shortly thereafter and remain so till the movies end. While stopping at a grocery store on the search for the Holy Grail (Tallahassee's Twinkies), they are duped by the other main characters Wichita and Little Rock who took there ride and weapons. The four hook up later and kind of became a make shift family as the film plays out. After some rough bumps in the road, no pun intended, okay there is a pun intended, (the rough bumps being a few zombies being run over) the four characters try to make their way to a theme park, as if it is a zombie killing knock-off of the movie Vacation. This is a funny movie with the total opposite styles of Columbus and Tallahassee, mixed in with some badass zombie killing comedic action. Nothing serious about this film, aside from the short snippet of Columbus' voice over telling the story of Tallahassee losing his son previously, but this only helps explain his anger towards the zombies and being really good at killing them. I have to say this film reminds me of an American version of Shaun of the Dead, with less characters, and less of a plot, and of course less the British accents. The American add being some gas guzzling SUV's and an hummer, some cowboy boots, and a zombie that catches a home-run style baseball swing with a banjo to the head. The film has a happy ending and there are a lot of dead zombies, with some pretty amazingly funny gruesome effects. What's not to love? The one technique I liked was Columbus's voice over as he kind of told the history of everything and broke down his rules (the ones to keep him from getting killed by the zombies) as the action played out on the screen. This story telling if you will saved time and made room for more action packed zombie killing. It also helped you (the viewer) connect with Columbus on a personal level, which helps you root for this nerdy kid to kick some zombie ass and get the girl in the end. How is this not on the cult classic list yet?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Zombie Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to this by the presence of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg in the lead roles. They're both good actors and I figured they'd make this worth watching. I wasn't disappointed. This was a fun movie to watch and Harrelson and Eisenberg both did great jobs with their characters.Set in a time when the earth has been over-run with zombies after a plague, Tallahassee and Columbus (Harrelson and Eisenberg - the names of the characters refer to the destination each wants to get to) team up in their efforts to survive. Tallahassee is a tough as nails survivor who's afraid of nothing and who spends much of his time trying to find whatever twinkies might be left after all this time. Columbus is a socially awkward, nerdy loner who nevertheless manages to survive in this zombie-infested world and actually finds love in it as well! They were a pretty good team. They were matched with Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Wichita and Little Rock (sisters). I'm less familiar with Breslin and Stone, but thought they were also quite good as thieves and manipulators who constantly try to run off with Tallahassee and Columbus's vehicles, but then are constantly brought back together with them. There's a really good cameo in this from Bill Murray as himself, who survives in this "zombieland" by disguising himself as a zombie in order to fit in - with ultimately tragic results!This isn't your typical zombie movie. To be honest, I wasn't even clear that these were "real" zombies. Were they really the dead who came back to life, or were they just really, really sick people? It seemed to be the latter. It's also not really frightening (although there are a few of "jump" moments scattered throughout.) But it's a good, lighthearted take on the whole zombie concept, and it's fun to watch.

Its very different as its an apocalypse movie but still you never feel like it. The other interesting part is in the whole movie just four characters are there and everybody uses a fake name. We see the story from Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) 's point of view and it makes it very interesting.All the four characters are very funny and beautifully constructed.So my advice is that this is one of the best movie i have watched .It is very funny and heartwarming at the same time.So don't miss it buy it and add to your collections.I honestly think that a sequel would be perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilariously funny zombie-comedy-drama.Plot is fairly random, but it doesn't really matter. In fact, the rambling nature of the story just adds to the charm. No, the best thing about the movie is the one-liners, and their delivery. The comedic plot devices, eg Columbus' rules for dealing with zombies, are also great. Woody Harrelson is the known name in the cast, and delivers in spades as the hard-bitten tough guy. However, it is Jesse Eisenberg who steals the show as the dead-panning nerd. (I saw The Social Network before Zombieland, otherwise I would never of heard of him before). Good support from Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, and a great cameo from Bill Murray.Certainly not your average zombie movie, and not merely a zombie-parody either. Much more than both of those.

Blessed with a strong, versatile cast, appropriately overdone special effects and a wicked, black sense of humor that rolled right up my alley, this is much more than just another throwaway monster movie. Loads of fun to watch, for the first time or the fiftieth time, it can also brag one of the greatest surprise cameos in modern memory.

		<fullReview>Zombieland is set in a USA where zombies are on the rampage. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a geek who has a lot of rules of survival from zombies like checking the back seat of a car, not using public toilets, wearing a seat belt, running very fast and double tapping which is always back up once you hit a zombie by car.These rules keeps him from being eaten by zombies. Each time he states one of his rules, you see an example of it in action. He decides to go home to see if his parents are still alive and encounters a redneck zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) with a penchant for Twinkies and a sad history. The become a duo and later meet up and have an uneasy alliance with two women. Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abagail Breslin). They have to rely on each other to survive as they may be the only humans alive.Zombieland is a cracking horror comedy. Eisenberg is a charming but vulnerable lead using his speed and zombie survival rules to his best advantage. Harrelson on the surface is a redneck who just blasts zombies, misses his dog and loves Twinkies but later shows pathos and real vulnerability at his loss.Bill Murray makes one hell of a cameo appearance in a scene set in a Hollywood mansion and his demise is very funny with his biggest regret being The Garfield movie!The weak point is the film drags when they encounter the ladies with there games of out hustling the only nice humans they seem to have encountered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombie movies are a cultural phenomena to the modern world. Classics like night of the living dead and zombie paved a walk for the successors and more like dawn of the dead, resident evil and 28 days later have followed. Eventually the interest in zombies deteriorated since the flesh-eaters doesn't had much to contribute. So, movie-makers found a way to revive the genre, which was to add a few sprinkles of humor. The first one was 'Shaun of the dead', and then came zombieland. As the movie promises, zombieland is a fun ride, with lots of laugh and not so scary dead-walkers. Plot doesn't bothers to explain the outbreak of the virus or about the cure, but who cares. All we wanted was a few tough bad-asses shooting and smashing zombies and some situation jokes which will save our money. Zombieland guarantees both. On the acting department, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson shines as Columbus and Tallahassee. Apart from social network, this is the movie that I really liked Jesse Eisenberg(normally, I considered him an overrated actor), and as for Harrelson, I never expected him to be this much bad-ass. It's sad thing that Emma stone and Abigail Breslin couldn't catch up with the duo. The movie also featured the most famous cameo ever done - Bill Murray.The only barrier I experienced was the childish treatments of climax sequences. Other than that, zombieland is worth your money...</fullReview>

As they stick together facing flesh-hungry zombies, they get to know each other in the process. I like this film, Harrelson is great in it and is like the next Ash from the Evil Dead films. The rest of the cast is good and I like the zombie make-up effects. Funnyman, Bill Murray (Ghostbusters) also makes a cameo as himself and I recommend this good zombie flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is a horror comedy at its best. You usually don't see a zombie movie as a comedy, but you will like this one. Actually this isn't really a comedy; it is more a funny horror movie, because there is bloodshed in a comic situation. There is plenty of blood splattering, plenty of killing and gore, and even some nudity of a stripper zombie. The film delivers you four heroes that you can root for when the zombies come after them. You will begin to love the scenes with the rules of survival that Jesse Eisenberg explains to the audience in a background voice such as wearing your seat-belt, or the double-tap rule after you shoot a zombie make sure he is dead by shooting him in the head again. Trust me; this is not a wasted shot. Woody Harrelson's performance is terrific, as a redneck zombie killer who misses his puppy Buck, and must find a Twinkie at any cost. There is one unforgettable cameo appearance that will take place at someone's Beverly Hills mansion. I won't say his name, but it is hilarious. There is one thing that I must say about this zombie movie that is not normally in zombie movies, and that is the fact that once these zombies are infected they can run very fast. As a matter of fact that is rule number 1, be sure that you can outrun the zombies, because the overweight and slow people were caught first by the zombies. There are some pretty funny scenes, and you will laugh from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a perfect movie by any means, but it certainly was a lot of fun to watch. I bet it was ten times more fun to make!I got lucky and went to see this movie early with a couple of friends right around Halloween. I thought that it would be a mediocre movie but the acting and direction really hit on all the various clichés with zombie movies.I was thinking, "how could they make another zombie movie? I'm so zombied-out already", but then I saw the trailer and I was like "oh yeah, this isn't a zombie movie! It's an anti-zombie movie!"The acting was awesome. 100% sarcasm all the way. Funny little jokes through out the movie making fun of other zombie movies too. The "rules" laid out as you go through the movie really makes you remember that this is a comedy.The direction of the movie is constant and the director never lets you fall asleep. Yeah, there are a couple of slow areas in the movie but they are extremely brief. The action picks right back up again and you don't get a chance to shut your eyes or yawn.The special effects are awesome too and kudos on going over the top on some of the close up shots of zombies eating brains or spitting blood. I won't give it away but the cameo of that famous actor is the the cherry on top of an already delicious arrangement.Acting 1 Directing 1 Comedy 1 FX 1 Making fun of other zombie movies 1014 of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a movie fanatic. I watch many movies each week, and Zombieland has always been one of my favorites. Without giving away the plot line or anything regarding the movie, I feel that it is best to say that you can take something you expect from a regular/default zombie movie, and change it all up. It brings a hilarious take to the Zombie Genre, and is similar in terms of this hilarity to Shaun Of The Dead. If you want to read a bigger review of my feelings towards this movie (with spoilers), come visit the following link: http://www.booksie.com/DOSZEOfficial DOSZE stands for Desk Of Superior Zombie Experts, and it is a group of my friends and I, who know quite a lot about Zombies, and we like to share it with the internet. Trust me, I think it's pretty great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought that you could put comedy in a Zombie movie,, but they pulled it off, kudos to everyone that helped make that happen,, Bill Murray steals the show with his cameo,, Woody Harrelson was awesome,, and Amber Heard,, well she's just sexy.. a group of people try to get where they are going,, a man to Ohio, a couple of girls to an amusment park so and so forth,, along the way they encounter countless zombies as America has been overrun with zombies for more than 30 years. I love the guy's 30 rules for surviving,, my fav.. double tap,, meaning two shots to the head of any living zombie,, this is by far the funniest zombie movie out there, it actually had a decent plot,, great acting and awesome make up and effects.. what a good movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ZOMBIELANDOK... It's time to nut up or shut up.I have seen this movie before and loved it. And can say I loved it just as much the second time around.The story is straight forward enough... it is about a student trying to make his way to his parents house whilst the rest of the population are zombies. Along the way he meets a guy who is very much unhinged and on the edge... they also run into a couple of girls who are trying to make their way to an amusement park as they have been told there are no zombies there.This is not a horror as such... it is more comedy. I was laughing all the way through this film. The language and situations they all get put in was hilarious. Also the facial expressions on the cast are brilliant.There are also a few animated sections in it too which makes this film even better. When one the the guys is telling us about the rules he sticks to to survive, you see them appear in the background on the screen. The same kind of text is during the credits at the beginning. It is really well done because the letters and words get smashed and knocked out of the way by zombies.The casting was brilliant. The actors were Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone &amp; Abigail Breslin. Every one of them had funny moments in the movie and they all had good chemistry. They all worked very well together. For me though, the funniest and main character was Woody. I think he is such a great actor. He can play serious roles and comedy roles excellently.There was also the best cameo ever in a movie... The characters make their way into a mansion and then you realise it is Bill Murray's house... Bill Murray... BILL F*****G MURRAY! haha. Also, Bill has the best line in the whole film. That man is a genius and he makes me laugh so much.The make up was good... the zombies looked gross and the guts looked nice and juicy... I am glad they didn't cut back on the gore too much, but also it was not too bloody.I will give this film 8 out of 10.And remember... rule number 32... enjoy the little things.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun and quirky!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would say that this is the second funniest Zombie Movie of all time.(Sean of The Dead being the first of course!)I loved the intro, where he is explaining his rules of how to survive. It's funny because it is not the usual macho, take on the world, guns-a-blazing survival tactics that most zombie films portray. Instead this is an every day practical guide, for regular guys and gals to survive in the post zombie apocalypse. I love the contrast between the lead guy with all his neurosis and the Woody Harrelson character and even the contrast between his all American cowboy mannerisms and his love (and impending search) for twinkie bars! You could tell that he had real fun with the character. One thing I love about this movie is that the two female characters are totally kick ass, they are two steps ahead of the boys throughout the film and although they need saved at the end in typical Hollywood style (sigh) it was great to have some proper tough female characters that didn't just become screeching, semi naked, zombie food.I also loved the helplessness of all the characters, the utter pointlessness in life post zombie outbreak, the guy is just vaguely heading north,(or was it south?), harrelson's characters roaming for twinkies and enjoying kicking zombie ass and the girls, deciding that their safe place could be at a themepark. It was a really great idea, no one was trying to save the world, just trying to get by and squeeze what enjoyment they could out of life.The cameo from Bill Murray was also excellent. (and I am not even a Bill Murray fan) What a clever idea to have them end up in a celebrities house. These are just some of the things that make this movie quirky and fun and a bit off the wall compared to your average zombie flick. I have thoroughly enjoyed this a couple of times now and highly recommend it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a great and inspired cast and terrific characters.The cast of the movie are all extremely interested in their characters from start to finish,especially Woody Harrelson as Tallahassee.My favourite part of the entire movie was Bill Murray's cameo,and it wouldn't have bothered me if he was a main character in this movie,the writers clearly loved his work,and I've seen a lot of his movies,so I got all the references.Possibly the greatest movie cameo of all time.There is currently a series based on the movie,but I have yet to watch it,I don't think it looks that good,because I just cant picture these characters being played by anyone else.I don think it really needs one,but if a sequel is ever made,I will definitely see it.Columbus (Jesse Elsenberg) lives in a world that is ruined by zombies,he goes by his own rules to survive them as he trys to make it to Ohio,but makes some really friends along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh my god....this movie is a full on entertaining movie!!Ruben Fleischer delivers a super hit movie (the only one in fact, we know how disastrous 30 Mins or Less, Gangster Squad turned out to be )Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick have brilliantly written the story of the movie. it's fast paced and super fun with many many LOL moments.Cinematography by Michael Bonvillain is a complete winner!!visual effects to portray deserted USA was jaw dropping!The film stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin as survivors of a zombie apocalypse. Together, they take an extended road trip across Southwestern United States in an attempt to find a sanctuary free from zombies.THE CAST:Woody Harrelson- plays Tallahassee (yes they call themselves by the name of the city where they wanna go/come from....keeps them from getting to close or attached). he is a hardcore redneck and HATES zombies...no seriously he hates them and kills them for sport. well the zombies 'took his son away' so now they are all screwed!. Woody Harrelson carries out a legendary performance.Jesse Eisenberg- plays Columbus, a young college boy who is a very unlikely survivor. he survives because he follows a set of rules. (VERY INTERESTING RULES). he finally wins the girl's heart by breaking a very important rule. (DON'T BE A HERO). oh and he kills Bill Murray. the real Bill Murray. i can't imagine anyone else playing this role.Emma Stone- plays Wichita/Krista, a young shrewd woman who cons unsuspecting men and robs em off their valuables. she loves her little sister and is willing to do everything to keep her happy. she finally learns how to trust guys and falls for Columbus and reveals her real name Krista. Stone does complete justice to the role.Abigail Breslin- plays Little Rock, a 12 year old who helps her sister in her con acts. she dreams of going to Pacific Playland as she believes that is zombie free!. Abigail plays the role perfectly!Bill Murray as BILL MURRAY! that was the best part of the movie. a pleasant surprise if i may add. too bad he dies!Story- Columbus while passing through destroyed American cities comes across Tallahassee and the two embark on a journey through Zombieland. the run into Wichita and Little Rock who con them and steal their SUV but later due to dire circumstances are forced to stick together. they slowly bond over time and finally learn to trust each other. cameos by Amber Head and Bill Murray add humor to the story.all in all this movie is a WINNER and one of the best zombie comedies i've seen since Shaun Of The Dead.a massive 9/10 is perfect for the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Fun Zombie Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched "Zombieland" a couple years ago on DVD, and seeing that I didn't really remember much of the movie (besides the fact that I liked it), I decided to re-watch it a few days ago. "Zombieland" stars Woody Harrelson ("Natural Born Killers", "No Country for Old Men"), Jesse Eisenberg ("The Squid and the Whale", "The Social Network"), Emma Stone ("Crazy, Stupid, Love", "The Amazing Spider-Man), and Abigail Breslin ("No Reservations", "Rango"). The movie is about a group of survivors who are trying to find a place to go to (which isn't zombie-infested) during a zombie apocalypse, with "Columbus" (Jesse Eisenberg) pairing up with "Tallahassee" (Woody Harrelson), who meet a pair of sisters, Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, respectively), who are on their way to an amusement park. I thought that almost everything of this movie was pretty good. The visuals looked pretty good (I liked "The Rules for Survival"), I thought that the plot was alright, the cast was splendid (Woody Harrelson, in particular), the action with the zombie killing was very fun to watch (I liked the ending action scene in the amusement park when a whole bunch of zombies came along), oh, and I also liked Bill Murray's cameo appearance in the movie as himself, as I thought that that was pretty good and funny. Overall, this is an action-comedy-zombie movie which is definitely worth watching if you're looking for a movie with 1) zombies, 2) action, and 3) comedy!8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't worry! This isn't a typically bad zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the past, there have been uncountable amounts of zombie films where people are turned into zombies who now have invaded cities. However, I really enjoyed this for a few reasons. The characters in this film are much interesting than they were in many others such as the 2012 Cockneys vs Zombies. The acting is surprisingly good and the humor actually works alongside the dark tone to the film. At no point during the film did the humorous tone really detract from the movie as a whole.This movie is based around four people named Colombus, Tallahhasse, Wichita and Little Rock who are amongst the only survivors of the deadly disease. The two sisters are attempting to get there way to an amusement park where the zombies have yet to invade whilst Tallahhase is going around finding Twinkies and Colombus, at first is trying to find his long lost parents but must eventually save the woman he loves, Witchita.This film isn't a typical go around the city with slaughtering after slaughtering of zombies. This movie clearly depicts a lot of emotional moments which make us care for our characters. The story is very moving with a lot of comedic moments which actually make you laugh. Overall, this is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world has been overrun by zombies and has few survivors ... that tells Ruben Fleischer in "Zombieland" (2009), his new film that proposes a new comedy about the undead, which is about the trust in others and how we always need the other to survive.It is narrated in a linear fashion and from the point of view of the protagonist: Columbus, played by Jesse Eisenberg, who is presented as a guy insecure, paranoid and unsociable. Throughout the story, he and the other survivors will help them stay alive and risk the possibility of being betrayed. We do not know who is good and who is bad, the only thing we are sure of is that they are dominated by the fear of knowing that if a zombie bites become one ... they are afraid to stop being themselves, what they want is to survive, find stability and move on, which leads them to fight for their lives and face whatever it takes.Everything that happens directs the viewer to worry about who will die and who will survive, even remains some mystery about people who know Columbus, do not know if you can trust them, do not fully know who they are, and that helps keep the suspense and retention.&nbsp; The touch of comedy is interesting, because it is a film that could be scary, but the funny thing helps make the film what it is: intelligent, knowing balance between entertainment and the depth and seriousness of the story that is counting because it makes the viewer laugh at the moments that must laugh, keeps the suspense and the story moves on naturally.It is a film that is entertaining because it is about zombies, but finally, the great thing about the film is not due to the zombies, is due to the protagonists, the story itself and the good performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombleland is a movie that is very funny and offers the audience a very entertaining movie. In fact, this is the film that kind of made zombies popular again after hardly existing for several years prior to this movies existence. Just watching this film, I had one heck of a good time watching all the jokes and gore being interwined.This film is about a group of humans joining together in a post-apocalyptic United States and trying to head to a amusement park in California by staying alive and beating up zombies.The acting is great. Jesse Eisenberg came in to his own with this film and Adventureland back in 2009. Woody Harrelson certainly cracked me up as the tough, no-nonsense kind of guy. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin were great as the con girls. But the best part was Bill Murray. He was by far the funniest part of the movie.Overall, this is a very funny "horror" film. It's not a horror film per se but it does feature elements of one such as the gore. This movie, of course, reminded me of the other great zombie comedy, "Shaun of the Dead." I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are only a few times where I find that a movie is an incarnation of awesomeness. This is one of these times, because not only is "Zombieland" an excellent zombie film but it is also filled with humor and gives the viewer what he wants : laughs and gore. Of course, the horror never goes beyond acceptable, and the director made sure that sensitive viewers would be able to forget about the gory things and focus on the jokes that comes with them. Practically all the violent moments are funny and Jessy Einsenberg is just perfect in his part. It feels like Mark Zuckerberg decided to randomly shout out zombies, with an excellent Woody cow-boy trying to find Twinkies. Emma stone and the other girl (I can't remember her name) were also convincing and overall the acting was quite good. The hard rock soundtrack that comes along with the really good-looking special effects just fits perfectly to the film, and adds more of that "Fuck it" feeling. If you don't know what I mean, the entire movie should be taken as something completely crazy and bad-ass at the same time. Kind of like an action comedy in the style of "The Other Guys" but with zombies. It's never really serious like "Shaun of the Dead" was sometimes, which is why I preferred this movie. "Shaun of the Dead" had a different sense of humor and sometimes lost track of what it really wanted. It felt like if the director was hesitating between making a zombie film or a comedy. Here, it's never the case, the whole team knew what the wanted the ending result to be, and the made it.Conclusion : awesome movie to watch with your friends and some beers to have a good laugh and spend a good evening. - A.C.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day 1 Of My 31 Days Of Horror 2.Halloween is around and it is time for my second 31 days of horror. First up is Rueben Flesier's Zombieland, a dark comedy that takes a look at what happens when the zombie apocalypse comes up.The film follows Columbus played by Jesse Eisenberg who has been thrust in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. He goes on a journey to meet his parents in Columbus Ohio. He comes across Talahasse played by Woody Harrelson. Talhasse is on a quest to find and eat the last Twinkie ob earth. From there they meet up with Witchita played by Emma Stone and her little sister Little Rock played by Abigail Breslin who are con artists wanting to go to Pacific Playland theme park. The characters do not like each other at first but soon grow on each other.This is one hell of a fun ride. The performances by the main central cast with the standout performer being Woody Harrelson. The story is written very well with some of the funniest writing I have ever seen in a film. The sets are great, making you think that the world has become a barren wasteland. The action is fantastic. Lets not forget the best scene in the film, The Bill Murray scene which has to be the funniest moment in the entire film. I recommend Zombieland. It is one of the best comedies of the last 5 years.Rated R For Horror Violence/Gore And Language.1hr 28min/88min.32 uses of the F-word.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite zombiemovie made so far. I really like the cast, although it only contains of 4 people (not counting the small role Bill Murray plays). I mostly love the role Woody Harrelson plays. A tough man who loves to murder zombies on a quest for the last Twinkie out there. I've seen a lot of movies with Emma Stone in them, where I liked most of her roles, including Wichita in this one. Her sister (played by Abigail Breslin) and her are what you could call con artists, manipulating people to get what they want. About Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone : It was quite predictable they would end up together, but fun nevertheless.Last week, I heard they are planning to release more Zombieland movies, turn it into a franchise or a TV series. I have heard anything from 8-18 parts. To me it's like this : You either get eaten by a zombie or you kill it. I don't think you could make 8-18 movies about that, and I hope it doesn't end up flopping. A great example of a flopping franchise would be Police Academy. I liked the first movie, thought it was very amusing. The second one was okay, but worse than the first one. The five after this one were just dreadful. I hope this doesn't happen to Zombieland, but only time will tell. I'm certainly looking forward to seeing more of Zombieland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any fans of Romero's 'Of The Deads' or Edgar Wrights 'Shaun' are in for a good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an audience member, to get the most out of Zombieland, there has to be a certain amount of surrendering to the material. Anyone familiar with George A Romero's 'Of The Deads', or Edgar Wrights 'Shaun' should breeze through all 88mins with a permanent smile. That said, i wouldn't go as far as to conclude that 'Z-Land' is purely for the schooled flesh- eating aficionados among us. Like it's UK counterpart, 'Shaun', this is top notch silliness played for laughs first, with gore and splatter for seconds. Like the zombies, the jokes come thick and fast. Eisenberg and Harrelson make an unlikely, but highly likable screen duo while Emma Stone adds a dry, sexy charm. If there's a weak link amongst all this fun, it's Abigail Breslin's 'tougher than the guys' 12yr old character who serves as nothing more than filler and soon becomes irritating. The writing by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is razor sharp and although the zombie film is a worn formula, there's enough clever ideas and humour injected into recognising the personality clashes within our central group of characters to make Zombieland feel like a fresh take on the genre. It goes without saying, but probably shouldn't that the make-up and special effects are also a joy to behold and the tight running time assures that the film seldom sags. One last nod must go to a very special cameo. For anyone who hasn't seen the film, i won't spoil it here, but it's a treat and yet another fun ingredient to add to what is a joyous, efficient and likable film watching experience which while not quite measuring up to Edgar Wright's similarly themed zom-com effort, comes a very, very close second best. And that's saying something. 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best "fast zombie" &amp; Harrelson flicks I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love zombie movies...especially "fast zombie" movies. I also love Harrelson. This flick is one of the best of both of those categories.Be forewarned: this movie is sometimes silly and a bit of a farce. It won't go out of its way to explain the intricacies of how the zombie apocalypse began, beyond a quick one-liner. There are also a few "yeah right" moments. You might find yourself thinking that, with a little more thought, this film could have been even more awesome.But, in the end, none of that matters...at least not for our purposes. This film is awesome for its entertainment value, rather than for an accurate depiction of how people would react in a zombie apocalypse. If you want to see more of the latter, check out The Walking Dead. However, if you want to see a great cast kick some zombie ass in creative ways and throw hilarious quips at each other, along with some cool camera shots, an original use of Rules for surviving the zombie apocalypse, and a theatrical-money-shot ending, buy--don't just rent-- this movie...you're going to watch it multiple times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A mad cow disease turns most of the population into zombies. Columbus(the always annoying Jesse Eisenberg), is a college student trying to get to Ohio to check on his parents. He meets Tallahassee(Woody Harrelson) along the way. They stop at a grocery store in pursuit of Twinkies and shoot many of the undead. At the store they encounter two adolescent girls, Wichita and Little Rock, who con them out of their guns and steal their car. Luckily, while walking, they find a Hummer filled with weapons. Seeking revenge on the two sisters, they end up in a battle and eventually negotiate a truce, and travel together as a foursome. They make it to Hollywood and meet Bill Murray at his house. He is disguised as a zombie, which leads to a very funny outcome. The finale is at an amusement park where they turn on the rides with the lights attracting hordes of the flesh eaters. The guns are put to good use as the night wears on. Zombieland is funny and Woody Harrelson is great. The one minus is the grating Eisenberg, who I just don't get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Zombieland is not exactly the movie you would describe as a "serious" horror movie. And, for me, that is the whole point behind the movie.Personally,I believe that it deserves a 9/10 rating and that does not mean that it is the best movie ever known to man. It means that it is one of the best movies in its kind and that it succeeds in delivering a straight-forward blend of action, zombie shooting, parody elements and even some more emotional moments.Now, as far as the acting is concerned, I can say that all of the actors and especially Woody Harrelson did an amazing job and as a result, every scene, from simple conversations to zombie-smashing is depicted in a very natural and vivid way.What is more, when it comes to the scenario, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick created a storyline that can support endless gunfighting, humor and action. Basically, Zombieland, is a movie that does not depend too much on its storyline and just uses it as a means to make things even better. As a result, there may be some gaps in the whole story but this can be considered ,in a way, as one of the advantages of the movie, together with the excellent stage direction.All in all, it is a ,very fun to watch, zombie movie and each and every of its 88 minutes is worth watching. If you are into zombies, action and parody-style humor then this is definitely a movie for you!Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So silly it had me laughing my head off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching Zombieland and I have to say it is so much fun. I was laughing throughout and I'm pretty sure that I was watching it the whole way through with a silly smile on my face. That is how this film will make you feel because it is so silly, but so good at the same time.The plot is a little threadbare but I'll let you know what the plot is meant to be. Jesse Eisenberg plays Colombus, a student who is one of the few survivors of the epidemic which has turned everyone else into zombies, hence calling the USA; Zombieland. Due to him being a bit of a loner, he decides to head across the country on route to his parents in Ohio. As the film begins we see him begin his journey and via narration he tells us his situation, and also explains the rules he has to endure to survive. These rules are put forward with funky graphics on screen and with a short hilarious clip of the problems if you break them. This shows you how quirky this is going to be from the start.Whilst on route he meets a bad-ass zombie killer called Tallahassee, played brilliantly by Woody Harrelson. They become a duo and both head across America, Colombus en-route to Ohio and Tallahassee to find the last box of Twinkies in America. As they travel they encounter zombies and Tallahassee shows us why he is such a bad-ass when it comes to killing them.As they continue they meet two sisters, Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin), in a supermarket, who end up coning them and leaving them car less and weapon less. They set back off on foot and find themselves a hummer, complete with machine guns galore in the back, their lucky day. In their new car they eventually come back across the sisters and this time they join forces. The sisters are en route to a theme park, in order for the youngest sister to enjoy a bit of her childhood instead of living in a post apocalyptic world; also they believe it is zombie free. On their way they take refuge in a Hollywood stars house, resulting in a hilarious cameo, and then once again they hit the road, attempting to avoid zombies and get to know each other a little better.The film doesn't have a lot going for it in terms of story, but what it lacks in it makes up for in laughs, acting, and chemistry. So much about it is fun that you forget the films negatives. The cameo scene steals the show, and one of the lines, their final lines in fact, is absolutely brilliant. The final scene at the theme park is also great and the zombies themselves look hilarious as well as slightly scary.The four leads are brilliant together, especially Eisenberg and Harrelson. Harrelson has some great scenes when he takes out zombies, with the graphics flashing up 'killing of the week' when he makes a good take down.I can't praise this movie enough. Don't get me wrong it isn't the best film out there, and isn't the funniest comedy but it is a hell of a lot of fun. People will state that it is an American rip off of Shaun Of The Dead which I agree it probably is. The director even admits that he wanted to make this because of Simon Pegg's zombie comedy. The point is it knows it is a slight rip off but doesn't take itself seriously enough too care. Shaun Of The Dead has a better story than Zombieland, but Zombieland is just as much fun. Watch this film and I'm sure you will laugh out loud a lot more than once.3.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.uk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Use of Zombies Since SHAUN OF THE DEAD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's getting to a point where zombies just aren't frightening anymore. Most "scary" zombies movies are cheesy schlock tossed directly onto DVD or low-budget independent films because zombies are easy enough to pull off with a basic understanding of makeup effects and enough friends/extras to fill out a crowd. Edgar Wright did the world a favor in 2004 when he reminded us that zombies could still be useful movie fodder in a comedy sense with SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Five years later, ZOMBIELAND revives the winning zombie/humor combo in one of the best horror/comedies ever. The movie was expanded from a television pilot from screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and exists in a world where Mad Cow disease has mutated into an epidemic that turned the world's population into mindless, violent, flesh-hungry zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is a college student making his way through the desolate destruction from Texas to Columbus, OH in hopes of finding his family alive. He crosses paths with bada** zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and the two band together on their journey eastward. On their trip, their duped by a couple of sisters who jack their wheels and redirect them towards Pacific Playland in California where rumors have spread of a zombie-free zone. ZOMBIELAND has everything you could with for in a zombie movie: it's hilarious, features some great zombie kills, boasts a couple of the latest Hollywood hotties (Emma Stone and Amber Heard), and the best cameo appearance in a movie I've ever seen.Sorry, George Romero. Zombies are funny now. As much as I'd love to see another genuinely scary zombie flick, I'm pretty sure the social commentary aspect of zombie culture has run out and now they're best used as gore-filled punch-lines with old ladies dropping pianos on their heads. I could be wrong; there's plenty of zombie movies out there I've haven't seen yet but this is the best use for them in my opinion. I really wish the pilot for the TV show had been picked up. If the writers had been able to keep up the sharp writing, the show would've been a guaranteed hit. I know I would've watched it religiously. The whole idea of the "Zombie Kill of the Week" would've been awesome. I love the characters in this movie because they feel real. A lot of zombie movies feature survivors that are deadly serious that are always on edge, but the characters in ZOMBIELAND each have their own quirky personalities. They've been dealing with the zombie menace long enough that they're past the constant state of fear and panic and find fun in their situation. Each of them copes in their own way: Columbus with his set of rules (a great recurring gag), Tallahassee with his zombie killing creativity, and Wichita and Little Rock's quest for the rumored safety and childhood memory of Pacific Playland. Their humor, tantrums, and occasional painful memories feel legitimate. Let's be honest: if you found yourself in Hollywood, CA after zombies have slaughtered the population, wouldn't you go nuts in a celebrity mansion?I'm an idiot because I didn't see this movie until over a year after it came out. By the time I saw it, the big cameo in the second act had already been spoiled. I knew who it was, but I didn't know the details or context behind their appearance. If you haven't seen this movie and have somehow avoided spoilers, try and check it out with a clean slate. It makes the whole bit that much funnier. With the exception of the celebrity surprise, Woody Harrelson is the best part of the movie. If they ever get around to doing a ZOMBIELAND television series (or at least a sequel?please do a sequel), I hope Woody's there. Tallahassee is the best character in the group with his zombie kills, Twinkie obsession, and a back-story that comes out of left field in the second half of the movie that gave his character a whole new depth. Jesse Eisenberg makes the great "straight-man" in comedies but he's not too different from characters his played in other movies, but he has an awesome chemistry with Harrelson and he's charismatic enough for the audience to believe he'd have a chance with a girl like Emma Stone. Stone and Abigail Breslin deserve credit for their work here, but there characters really don't amount to much more than plot devices to move the story along (a love interest for Columbus, a reason for the trip to Pacific Playland). Overall, ZOMBIELAND is one of my favorite movies from 2009 and a total must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland stars Emma Stone of Superbad and now Crazy, Stupid, Love. It also stars Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine, Woody Harrelson, and Jesse Eisenberg.While I wasn't sure what to expect at first. I was glad I watched the film.I won't tell you how the characters interact for fear of spoilers but these 4 vandals, really are vandals surviving during a Zombie apocalypse and they all have great chemistry.A good amount of humor is mixed in here as all 4 characters have the dynamic ability of working in comedy. But don't shy away this is still a zombie movie and a pretty nasty one at that.....Blood and guts, blood and guts, blood and guts. Let me say it again...it's here along with a great script.It looked awesome in HD. Go watch!***The only reason I didn't give this a 10 out of 10 is because some of the cursing, especially from Eisenburg felt forced and fake. Was it acting? Or was it because in these kind of movies writers try to force the F bomb in too much? I'm not sure but it was super fake and it's not funny. I am sick of dirty movies especially when it's B movie esk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Zom-Com that's worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this in Hollywood, FL at Regal Oakwood 18. It was the last showing and I didn't mind because I had a good inclination that it'd be worth the money and it was. I don't remember the ticket price or if they gave a student discount. The auditorium was about a quarter full. Everyone stayed nice and quiet during the flick except during the funny parts which were numerous. That translates into being able to enjoy the movie properly. Nobody talking or acting stupid, air temperature was just right, and it was easy to find a good seat which were plentiful and comfortable.It's an entertaining movie. I ain't think very much of Jesse Eisenberg. Reminds me way too much of Michael Cera. Really dry, expressionless humor and delivery. I'd never seen either one of their movies. This'd be my first Eisenberg flick. Because I'm a zombie movie fan is the main reason I wanted to see this, not for any of the stars. So unless Jesse E. picks up another good role I'm interested in seeing, this'll be the only movie of his I'll be seeing. Not saying he did a bad job. He played his character perfectly. Harrelson wasn't bad either. Neither was Emma Stone (scorching eyes) or Abigail Breslin. Good casting all the way around. And yes, they do explain the reason people were zombified. Another plus.The filmmakers are green but this is a good step up for them in quality. I don't have any complaints about this movie. It's engaging in the fact that some things you can see coming if you pay attention to the "rules" presented in the beginning. Cussing, blood, violence, mild gore, high zombie body count, and lots of comedy. Great characterizations too. A continuous thing about end-of-the-world movies like this is that humans just can't seem to get along. Even if they're an endangered species, humans will off each other over the pettiest of things. Never fails. We all suck. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 stars. Stick around after the credits or you'll miss something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dint get a chance to watch this movie in theatre. Anyway, i've downloaded this and watched at home. Wat can i say...it was far beyond my expectations. When i saw the trailer, i thought..yeah 'another tryng to be funny zombie movie'. This one s definitely one f the best feel gud movies i've ever seen. Even zombies were superb. Unlike some old movies, where zombies walk slowly, in this one..they'll run after us....so its kinda more fun. Yeah this movie s funny..i found myself laughing most of the times. Really humorous one....i mean humour, not some joker type comedy. And yeah its thrilling also... The movie consists of mainly 4 characters. A teenage guy, funny middle aged guy(not so aged probably around 40), then two sisters. One a teenager and the other a younger one.The hero...our guy, yeah he have certain rules to be followed during this zombie period. He follows them like double tap, seat belt,checking the back seat of the car...which had really savd his life before. And the chemistry between him and the gal s nice...will keep u wondering whether they'll fall in love or not. The middle aged guy who loves twinkies...s very funny. The little gal also have a gud role. I'l say a definite watch movie...if u r looking for some thrils and fun and gud laughs and feel gud stuff. All in one...GO FOR IT... :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lightweight quick-witted subgenre movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is actor better suited than Woody Harrelson to play comically disturbed tough guys he probably doesn't have enough juice to open a film. His casting and that of Jesse Eisenberg as the nebbish-y Columbus Ohio elevate this feather-weight zombie comedy from good to very good. The plot which could be thoroughly summarized on an index car is also aided by gimmicks including titles which interact physically with the world of the film (similar to TV's "Fringe") and some "Lost" style flashbacks. The rapid-fire and snappy dialogue (reminiscent of "The Girlmore Girls") also helps although there are obvious gaps where the writers take a breath after running short of it. To his credit, neophyte director Rubin Fleischer does not resort to gore that to fill the slow parts and limits the heavy blood-play almost exclusively to the beginning exposition of the zombie infection. Zombie films are often interpreted as societal allegories and this one could also be viewed in that light. The characters spend a lot of time driving a Cadillac Escalade and a yellow Hummer H2 the two least politically correct vehicles. Harrelson's Tallahassee is travelling the ruined U.S. society in search of Twinkies, the least politically correct food. The two female con artist characters (there are all of 6 total characters) have set for their post-apocalyptic goal getting to the Pacific Playland Amusement park -- such parks are the least politically correct and environmentally unkind form of entertainment. The Columbus character has managed to survive because he abides by a set of politically correct rules (another gimmick) that effectively make him a zombie of sorts. So is the spread of the zombie virus a means of lampooning the spread of political correctness so pervasive that nearly everyone thinks and behaves in a self-pious homogeneous fashion? Maybe. Although the hilarious Bill Murray vignette in the center of the film doesn't quite fit the thesis. Murray's classics including "Stripes", "Meatballs" and "Ghostbusters" are risqué at times but never counter-cultural. Deeper meaning or not, this is a film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be blunt, Zombieland, is hilarious. If you're looking for a good zombie flick, then you wont be disappointed. This movie has great action,comedy and characters. The characters are the type that are likable. You get attached to them, and care what happens to them. The atmosphere is excellent too. You really sense the despair in the movie. Society has completely collapsed because of the zombies, and they do an excellent job of showing that. However, you don't need to worry. The vast majority of the flick is comedy. You won't get bummed out. If you like zombie movies, funny or serious, then check this one out. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite zombie movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland made me laugh so much that I almost cried. I especially loved the beginning of the movie, it is just so weird and different from all the other movies I'm used to see.Zombieland follows two guys, Columbus &amp; Tallahassee, who have figured out a way to survive in a world swarmed with zombies. Columbus is very scared and not much of a brave person, and he has figured out that his fear can keep him alive. Tallahassee is a badass who kills a whole lot of zombies, his only wish is to get his hands on the last Twinkie on Earth.I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and I must say that this one is my favorite alongside with 'Shaun of the Dead'. This movie has a great concept and I so much enjoyed Bill Murray's part in this movie, he has the most awesome scene in the movie, it was hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to nut up or shut up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever you need affirmation of Woody Harrelson's charismatic virtues, "Zombieland" is Exhibit A. Granted, a big part of it is the character as written (and it's done well) with its collection of killer lines, but Tallahassee is the comedic backbone of the whole movie. And the guy brings the good ol' boy charm in spades. And I love that he's battling the undead in a quest for Twinkies. It's one hell of a character.And it's a fun movie. The cameo/bit-part (I dunno if it'd count as a spoiler, but I still won't say who it is) is totally from out of left field, but still adds to the movie's charm. The truly odd thing I've found about this movie is, as likable as Harrelson is, they somehow manage to drain loads of likability from Emma Stone. That was surprising, and not something I'd thought possible. But it's still a fun movie, and it's gotten a surprising amount of play from me over the years.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining zombie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story itself is not complicated at all. Pretty much what you see in the trailer is what you get story-wise. There is no explanation for what's going on and there are no "bad guys" other than zombies. It's just four "friends" (lack of a better word) surviving the apocalypse. This isn't a bad thing because it provides so much entertainment! The film really hits the mark with the humor. It's crazy how dead-on the humor is. The actors also brought a lot the their roles (especially Woody Harrelson) and each one was a PERFECT choice.Although it is a very funny movie, it never lends itself to being a true comedy because it is filled with scares and awesomely grotesque violence. Nothing like a good banjo to the face.The best part of the film was the violence. Seriously, if you aren't watching a brutal, slow motion kill, you're watching Woody Harrelson kick zombie ass like a pro. Zombie fans need not worry because these zombies are vicious and bleed a LOT.Though the film felt a little more like a romantic comedy with some of its elements towards the end. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I can see why many were disappointed by this. Maybe without these clichés this film would have been better.One thing that may leave viewers disliking this film more is Bill Murray's cameo. There are of course a lot of complaints about his short cameo, and I agree. His cameo really felt out of place and just was not needed. Though there are also those whom prise his cameo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My goodness, I loved every second of this film. Yes, it is quite gory, but there are only a few gory scenes, and all occur in the first 25 minutes. The rest of the film is pretty bloody, but no more guts and gore. This film is so worth watching. Unless you're a cynical 35 year old living in your mothers basement in Mississippi, then GO WATCH THIS MOVIE. You'll laugh your head off. There is a scene with a clown zombie, which is quite scary, but you'll get by. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a large, gruff Texan with a craving of Twinkies, is searching for his hometown in Tallahassee, Florida. Woody Harrelson plays the part beautifully, as the bad-ass of the movie. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), a geeky sort of bloke who has a set of rules to keep himself alive. He's never had a girlfriend, and in his one shot, she turns into a zombie. He has no choice but to kill her. Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) are two sisters who have nothing but each other in an America torn apart by insane flesh-eaters. This movie will not scare you. It is funny as hell and you'll love it if you are not huge on horror movies. Go watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth the Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story- Two months after the outbreak of a plague that transformed the majority of humans into flesh-hungry walking dead, two survivors meet. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a nervy, nerdy, loner; while Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) is a wild man warrior who's ready to handle any and all zombie attackers. The two soon bump into con-artist sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). After some initial clashing, the odd group heads to Los Angeles--with the promised land of a supposedly zombie free amusement park as their destination. Is it worth the watch? Yes. While violent and crude, zombieland is also great fun. It posses the rare qualities of a horror-comedy, managing to have its overall sense of excitement and tension supported, not undercut, by the moments of laughter. The cast is uniformly fine, with Harrelson as a real standout- - and commerical director Reuben Fleischer jumps to the big screen with verve and intensity. The film's affection for prior zombie movies is clear, but zombieland never breaks its own rules.Travis Clark Movie Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected something totally different, when i put this movie into my DVD player i was hoping for a hardcore survival zombie film, what i saw was even better.This movie is hilarious and has great acting. It is no "Dawn of the Dead" type of movie, i think Zombieland falls into its our category with comedy and action, sort of like "Shawn of the Dead" except better. I love how i can connect to the main character of this movie. Overall, seriously is one of the best movies i've ever seen. I like this movie when i'm in any kind of mood, rather than some movies that are purely one type of mood. I continue to watch this movie from time to time. Never gets old!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breaking the Rules of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Accepting the offer refused by the master of horror, John Carpenter, virtually unknown filmmaker Ruben Fleisher directs a very capable cast consisting of three future A-listers in Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, as well as the ever-reliable and extremely underrated Woody Harrelson in horror-comedy Zombieland, an enjoyable take on a genre screaming out for some mainstream originality. The film centres around Columbus (Eisenberg), a young man living in solitude, believing he is the only person remaining on a planet overrun by the undead. His chances of survival, as well as the opportunity to gain the closest thing he's ever had to a real family, increase upon meeting the trigger-happy Tallahassee and con artist sisters Wichita and Little Rock, all of whom decide to stick together and fend off the zombies as a unit.In a film full of positives, the most refreshing aspect of Zombieland is the way in which it injects brains into a genre typically lacking in any at all. Where most films of this nature usually consist of young, good-looking teenagers screaming and running for two hours, Columbus couldn't be more different from these stereotypes. He understands that to survive in Zombieland you need things like cardio (Rule #1), seatbelts at all times (Rule #4) and, if in doubt, double tap (Rule #2) to turn a 'maybe' kill into a 'definite' kill.This is conveyed best in the opening scene. Running from a couple of zombies, Columbus comes across a car. Fumbling to get the keys into the lock on the door, he sees that his predators are making ground quickly, so he gives up on the keys, lets them chase him around the car park once more so he can again distance himself from them (Rule #1), then returns to find that the car door was unlocked the whole time. It almost feels as if Fleisher sat down, watched a heap of B-grade horrors and thought 'I'm going to make a movie where no-one in the audience will be able to say, "If they just did X, then they wouldn't have been killed by Y."' As I said, very refreshing, and very funny.Speaking of funny, the bulk of the laughs unsurprisingly come from Tallahassee, a loose screw whose hatred of zombies is surpassed only by his love of Twinkies. Apparently quite the movie buff to boot, he'll make you laugh in a scene you didn't expect to find funny with a Babe reference, and his particularly unsettling banjo tunes (followed by a compliment no-one would ever want to receive) leave you certain he'd be first in line for a Deliverance remake. Oh, and on top of all that, there's the cameo to end all cameos.For all the competence in the acting department, the film does falter in the Third Act. What was built up as something of a road-trip movie with the occasional assassination along the way turns into an absolute kill-fest in the final fifteen minutes. Sure, it's watchable, but really couldn't be further from the established tone of the film. The ending is ultimately predictable, but this is a minor gripe of mine considering one of the hardest tasks to undertake in filmmaking is to create a satisfying and unique conclusion to a dystopian film, regardless of genre. Comedy in various forms comes through thick and fast, but it is the film's brave steps forward to eradicate some of the most stale of horror clichés, as well as offering a range of individualist characters who are all likable in some way, that tips Zombieland from the 'average' into the 'pretty good' category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>8th best movie of all time, 2nd best movie of 2009!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Zombie Land staring Jessie Eisenburg and Woody Harlson, is set in a post apocalyptic America, two months after mad cow disease became "mad person disease" which later mutated into "mad zombie disease." Eisenburg's character, Columbus makes up his own very smart and hilarious rules to survive the apocalypse. He meets Harlson who is the exact opposite of him and will risk his life for a Twinkie. Later on they meet two girls who help them fight the zombies. And the movie is basically about these four different people using team work to fight zombies. The writing was probably the strongest part about the film. They are able to make very chuckled jokes through out and give depth into the character while showing you the fun of fighting zombies. The battle sequences were also very impressive with all of the Awesome ZOMBIE GORE!!! The whole movie is fun, funny, filled with great dialog, and is more thrilling than The Hurt Locker.

		<shortDescription>Pretty good zombie comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So zombies have taken over the world and survivors are few and far between. A cautious college kid is on his way to Columbus, Ohio to see if his parents are dead. Soon he meets up with a Twinkie loving wild man headed to Tallahassee. They soon run into two girls who get the names Wichita and Little Rock. Between the four of them they have one wild adventure heading to various destinations and avoiding zombies, but having bloodbaths with them when they do see them.This is a movie I had wanted to see for some time, but honestly never expected much. Zombie movies is one of my favorite genres and when comedy is brought in to the mix it usually doesn't work well, but Shaun of the Dead really changed that up and made a great zombie film with comedy, not a comedy with zombies...and thats what this was, just a comedy with little actual zombie screen time. There was lots of blood and some gore and it was a fun feature for those who like gore.I did like it, but I didn't love it, it was missing real huge laughs and definitely missing the zombies. It was a fun film to set through and see and hear, but I think one time is enough.Ruben Fleisher did a great job directing this film and I give him props for such beautiful work. The kid 'columbus' had a list of zombie survival rules and it got annoying seeing them pop up so often, that was one of my major flaws... The film starts out with Metallica's For Whom The Bell Tolls as slow motion shots of zombies are shot, that was a beautiful open credits accompanied by great song.. The movie had many great songs making it a nice soundtrack too from Hank Williams to Velvet Underground to Willie Nelson to Raconteurs it had many good songs.Acting was great here too Woody Harrelson always does good and here its no exception. Jesse Eisenberg playing the lovable dork that he always does was good. Been a fan of Abigail Breslins since I first saw her so that was good. Not sure if I had seen Emma Stone before, but she did great here. Bill Murray playing himself was wonderful and I laughed the hardest at him, loved that whole part. Also a small part for Mike White was nice.The movie starts out with promise but goes downhill and the zombie action is never that good. It isn't hilarious and it is not a film I'd want to see again cause it offered very little - but I do suggest anyone who hasn't seen it and likes horror comedy should in fact watch it 5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ZOMBIELAND (Ruben Fleischer, 2009) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I have often said, I am not too fond of the zombie genre (at least the flesh-eating variety), so I was not exactly looking forward to this one; however, knowing it had a strong sense of humor (zombies are lured out into the open by the strumming of "Dueling Banjos"!), I was willing to make one more trip to the well. In fact, once one gets over the initial "do we really need another zombie spoof?" feeling ? especially keeping in mind the satirical elements in George A. Romero's vastly overrated original DAWN OF THE DEAD (1978) and, obviously, the equally ultra-hyped SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004; which was voted "best comedy of the decade" for cryin' out loud by the British magazine "Empire"!) ? ZOMBIELAND proves quite enjoyable most of the way. The film's second trump card is the (obviously human) characterization, not a typical asset in this sort of gory fare: here, in fact, we have two guys (geeky kid and gung-ho modern cowboy ? the latter played by Woody Harrelson) and two girls (the younger being LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE [2006]'s Abigail Breslin) against the rest of the world, infected with some virus (as always) and thus appropriately dubbed "Zombieland". Despite its trim running time, the majority of the action occurs during the opening and concluding sections (with the creatures a blood-vomiting and often obese lot, one is actually thankful for it!); that said, the highlight is perhaps the hysterical scene at Bill Murray's estate (with the "Ghostbusters" star appearing as himself and even becoming an unfortunate victim of the paranoia that understandably grips the normal segment of humanity). The remainder, as already intimated. is devoted to the budding relationship within the group ? Harrelson takes on the kid against his better judgment but, then, both are repeatedly double-crossed by the girls (who had made a pact not to trust anyone); of course, at the end, they are happy to join forces and the teens even become romantically involved. New-hand director Fleischer brings plenty of style to the table and generally succeeds in breathing new life (no pun intended) into a by-now exhausted formula; by the way, who would have thought I would ever be hearing an all-too brief snippet of "Oh! Sweet Nuthin'" by my beloved The Velvet Underground on the soundtrack of a zombie movie? Needless to say perhaps but a sequel to this one is already in the works?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It started with Columbus talking about rules and how to survive and kill zombies. He then is walking down the highway with cars abandoned on the highway, and he notices a truck coming towards him, and he hides behind a car. When the truck pulls up by Columbus, he ducks behind a motorcycle with his rifle ready to shoot who ever steps out of the truck, thinking it might be a zombie driving it. This is when he finally meets Tallahasee. His new partner in zombie killing. Tallahasee lets Columbus in the truck and drive off. Driving to different areas of the United States.Tallahassee and Columbus are finally after a while are growing on each other after they were annoyed with each other. They stop off to a grocery store. Tallahassee has a thing for a Twinkie. His search for the last Twinkie in the world. Tallahassee kills three fat zombies in the grocery store. All of a sudden a teenage girl runs up to them both and says she needs some help. The three of them go to the back of the store and Tallahassee and Columbus get held up by the teenage girl and sister, and steal the truck.Tallahassee and Columbus are furious about what happened and start walking to look for another vehicle until they come across a house that has a hummer. Tallahassee and Columbus looks inside the hummer and find a bunch of guns. They take the hummer and back on the road again. After a while they run back into the teenager and sister again and get held up again. This time they are traveling together. They all finally grow on each other and stay with each other until the end. They get to Beverly Hills. The rest you can figure out on your own. It is the most fun and funniest movie I seen in years. I am keeping this movie for life.I love zombie movies. It beats Sean of the Dead, and some of the zombie movies. I would recommend this one for anyones collection. Enjoy this movie, I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Are you sick of all the hype surrounding "Twilight"? Are you hankering for a return to proper monster movies, where the monsters want to kill humans rather than fall in love with them? Well then, you'll love the awesome "Zombieland".It's hilarious (though people looking for a scare may be disappointed that it leans more towards comedy than horror), has plenty of gore and lots of cool zombie-slaying set pieces. Better yet, a sequel's been scheduled for 2011.The story is simple enough: modern-day America is a zombie-infested wasteland. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is seemingly the only 'normal' human left. Despite his scrawny appearance, he survives through a series of self-made rules, illustrated in a funny montage. On the way to see his parents, Columbus meets Tallahassee (a kick-arse Woody Harrelson, channelling his inner action hero), a redneck vigilante who's taken the zombie situation into his own hands with a big car, big guns and anything else he can get hold of. The combination of Columbus-Tallahassee harks back to the best buddy cop movies ? Columbus is the uptight nerd, Tallahassee is both the main hero and the comic relief (he has the funniest lines in the film). They meet Wichita ("Superbad's" Emma Stone) and her 12-year-old sister Little Rock (an all grown-up Abigial Breslin). Like Columbus and Tallahassee, they've found a way to survive by sticking together. From here the film treads a conventional path: the foursome team up, Tallahassee's secret motivation is discovered and there's a romantic sub-plot between Columbus and Wichita.Don't be put off though, as this complements all the inventive zombie slaying, with plenty of blood splatter on the screen as the zombies are killed with an array of cool weapons (like garden shears). There's plenty of gore too: blood and goo oozes from the zombies' mouths as they feast on their victims out in the open, devouring the vital organs and drinking the juice from their bones. Throw in a brilliantly self-deprecating cameo from Bill Murray and you have a sure-fire recipe for awesomeness, a must see for anyone who love zombie, comedy-horror or action films in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The movie is full of funny little jokes and one liners. The special guest pokes fun at himself. The movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously. It is not just another zombie movie trying to capitalize on the recent very good remake of Dawn Of The Dead. The cast work well together. Although this is not a movie that does not need character development the movie makers have managed to make sure you feel something for the characters. There are no masses of explosions all too common in too many movies today.Yes the characters are somewhat stereotypical, but in this movie it works. Go see it, and make sure you bring your funny bone along, as it will be tickled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This doesn't, but it ties in equal place with Dawn of the Dead. I thought it was great from start to finish. It combined horror with comedy, which hasn't mixed well in a really long time.SPOILERS: I really enjoyed the rules. It wasn't much like Scream, but I liked how rather describing a genre, the movie made up rules for things people failed in doing in previous zombie movies. I enjoyed Bill Murray being in the movie, but I wish that he lasted longer in the movie, being in it from the parts where he began to the end. I liked it as a joke with them reciting the Ghostbusters scene but I hated the bit when they were paying their condolences to him after they accidentally shot him. I just found it stupid. Apparently, the gore was a couple of notches down and a lot of the mutilations happened off screen or were barely visible.10/10 I highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The zombie movie that gives you a Woody!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the hilarious opening scenes, in which its teenage loser protagonist Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) informs the viewer about his hard and fast rules for surviving a zombie ravaged Earth, it is evident that Zombieland is going to be a seriously fun ride, and the cool slow-mo credits sequence, depicting a variety of living dead mayhem to the strains of Metallica, only go to reinforce this fact (classic thrash metal and stylish zombie action: they sure know how to get my attention!).The film follows anxiety-ridden nerd Columbus as he attempts to travel to Ohio to find his parents, teaming up with Twinkie-loving, hard-as-nails zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) on the way; but when he meets and falls for pretty con-artist Wichita (gorgeous Emma Stone), who has serious trust issues and a younger sister to protect, Columbus' sense of self-preservation falls by the wayside and he realises that, to be truly happy, risks must be taken and that rules are for wimps.With lots of stylish zombie slaying, bags of visual gags, plenty of slick gore (including CGI blood, unfortunately, but I guess that's just a sign of the times), a quite surreal moment midway featuring a surprise cameo from a well known comedy movie star, and an exciting, action-packed climax set amidst the attractions of a theme park, Zombieland provides solid wall-to-wall entertainment for zombie fans who enjoy a good laugh along with their graphic gut-munching.No doubt people are going to refer to Shaun of the Dead when talking about Zombieland, since both films are zombie comedies featuring a dash of romance; but to compare the two films is pointless?Shaun's humour is so typically British and Zombieland so American in style that they actually bear very little resemblance to each other.Let's just be content with saying that both films rock, but in their own unique way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Land of the Rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Zombieland' is a fun, exciting, action-packed comedy-horror, but unfortunately, I didn't like it as much as the general public and critics. Sure, it was all I just mentioned (the "special guest appearance" and the rules not only flashed on screen, but used as props, were all great) but when it comes to Zombie-humor, you could do better with 'Shaun of the Dead.' That all being said, this one's worth a viewing. Columbus is a loner who lives by rules in a land overrun by zombies, but he meets wildcard Tallahassee and the buddy-comedy begins. Add in two annoying brats (you could say they turned more selfish in attempts to survive because of the outbreak, but they clearly show these two are fiends prior) and you got just another group attempting to maneuver through the living dead. As much as I, personally, have a distain for Harrelson, at very least, this movie gave me two characters who I loathed even more, said brats: Wichita and Little Rock. I especially hated Little Rock more. Eisenberg ("Columbus") holds his own, funny for some part and Harrelson (Twinkie-obsessed "Tallahassee") is actually enjoyable. The movie's hardly original, and wildly predictable, but overall I'd recommend for light-hearted (despite the gore) fun. The surprise cameo had to be one of the major highlights, yet was ruined by Michael Phillips on 'At the Movies' (shame on you!) Again, though predictable outcome, the cameo has the best line (albeit one word) in the film: "Garfield." I've seen more zombie movies than I probably can count, so I do know the rules, however it was fun how they presented and reminded us of them. I would like to have the entire list, just out of curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twinkies never sounded so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Definitely had more than a few LOL moments. In contrast to the dry British humor of 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Zombieland' is much more in your face. Some one-liners that are destined to become classics. "Time to nut up or shut up!" The movie features lots of gore but not a lot of scares, and tons of action. Another plus is the many pop culture references from the last 20 years or so. Watch for the hilarious cameo by a very well known person, at least to us older folks. I love that the little girl didn't know who he was. Makes me feel so darn old.I conclude this review with my Zombie Plan. When the zombie apocalypse comes my first move will be to head down to the marina, find a good size yacht that doesn't need a large crew, stock it with plenty of food, fuel and DVDs, and head out to sea. Hopefully, some day, find an island that is infection free. Still need to find a couple cute girls to accompany me. Any takers? It is our duty to rebuild the human race after all.PS: Somebody really needs to write down the Zombieland Rules. Those could come in handy.</fullReview>

If you like brutal gore and dark humor you will be pleased with it.It is packed with what i like to call sh!t yea moments. Where usually just me and my friends get so excited that we can't help but yell "sh!t yea" Example: Jokers pencil trick from "The Dark Knight." Only difference was the whole theater seemed to be yelling with excitement. If you get a chance go see this one. On another note I would like to comment on how HOT Emma Stone is in this. If you have seen her in "Superbad" she is no prize pig. She is slimmed down and wears tight leather pants and knee high boots in this. you could watch the entire movie on mute and still get quite a thrill to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Targeted at a specific audience...namely 21-year-old males who still read comic books and listen to Van Halen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crassly-funny zombie flick from screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, designed like a movie pinball machine replete with guts and gun-toting glory. A ravaged world of flesh-eating zombies is pitted against disenfranchised youth Jesse Eisenberg and über-macho, Twinkie-eating zombie-killer Woody Harrelson. Mostly threadbare comedic thriller, aimed at twenty-something males; although occasionally prodding and amusing, the film gets completely lost while delineating Eisenberg's lack of romantic skills while wooing the ladies--which it does so determinedly. Second-half falls off sharply with an unfunny cameo from Bill Murray playing himself, plus a limp showdown with the zombies at an amusement park. Eisenberg's dryly self-assured presence brings out a sassy side to Harrelson which makes the actor more tolerable than usual, however the mindless destruction is predictable, obvious, and repetitive. ** from ****</fullReview>

Now a movie that is extremely overrated is the Shawshank Redrmption, we get it he's in jail big whoop! I liked that movie but it doesn't get to me like zombieland does. And I'm more of a Comedy/Sci-Fi person so I don't enjoy dramas or crimes that much. Zombieland. 10/10, for the zombies, guns, comedy, Emma Stone(yes!), and Bill Murray. And also that how many people say it sucks but it's still got a 7.8 rating. Top 500!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fun, but I was thinking it would be more of an actual zombie movie. In reality it is a romantic comedy with zombies. It follows the standard romantic comedy formula wherein boy meets girl. Girl hates boy. Boy and/or girl wins the other over and they fall in love. Yawn. And while Shaun of the Dead was also a romantic comedy, this movie spends all its time being cute and kitschy and does not offer up any moments of real horror (Shaun had quite a few moments) and thus fails in what it purports to be - a zombie movie. However, the part with Bill Murray almost makes me want to give the movie more stars than it deserves, because it is brilliant. But in the end this movie tries too hard to make zombie bashing "cool" and spends no time at all scaring its audience or making them think.</fullReview>

How on earth could a stupid movie get made? American likes stupid fu#$ed up products like this one.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note to self: Lose weight and start working on that cardio program!Should recent apocalyptic films be believed, one of these days we're going to be hit with a virus out of the blue, either engineered or a force sent by Nature, that we're going to turn into angry blood-lusting zombies eager to munch on our fellow man, and woman. And should that day arrive, like in 28 Days/Weeks Later, the Resident Evil franchise, and now Zombieland, working out will become too late too soon, since these new aged zombies sprint with full force compared to George A. Romero's lumbering undead.In fact, Zombieland could spawn a franchise of its own too, since it has solid back stories established for each of its main characters - the geeky Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), redneck ace zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and con-sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who together just seem to be always one step ahead of the boys, thanks to the advantage of gender and some major trust issues, which in any zombie flick you'll know come into play since one can be expected to off a close one in the event that they turn, for self-preservation reasons naturally.Narrated by Columbus, do remember to look for this film from the video store (or your home video library which I will urge you to get) should things outside start to suggest the onset of something ugly. Things like when your wildest fantasy, or Columbus' with that hot chick neighbour from apartment number 406 (Amber Heard, whom all the boys would like to know) start knocking at your door from out of the blue. Contained within this film are 32 rules - OK, so most didn't make it to the final cut but the important ones definitely did - to surviving a zombie onslaught, #1 of which is Cardio (note to self again).Director Ruben Fleischer plays it fast and loose, with plenty of sight gags to boot, especially when reminding us all, like an instructional video, on all the positive examples from Columbus' rulebook, complete with an animated take of the rules themselves. And the relatively short runtime of coming under 90 minutes just makes you beg, yeah beg, for more, which of course is a good thing.The casting here's something to die for as well, with Woody Harrelson heading up the motley crew as the cool as a cucumber zombie executioner with a sensitive heart, continuing his comedic turn in recent years and from his last big budgeted action film 2012. Jeese Eisenberg's relatively new, but plays the formula geek down to a subtle pat. I haven't really seen Emma Stone as a tough-as-nails cookie, so here's one for the road, and Abigail Breslin might just have taken on her first action-movie role aside from her usual dramatic ones. It's been a long time since I experienced that much fun from a film, so I'll go ahead and rate this as highly recommended and a firm contender for one of the top films of this year. Last I heard a sequel's coming up too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite possibly better than Shaun Of The Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming out the horror-comedy Zombieland, I was surprised how much I liked it. I was personally getting a little tired of zombie films, but then Zombieland made me want to see ever more zombie films. It is a funny, original, cool film with a lot of awesome zombie killing. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, who you may know from such films as Adventureland, Roger Dodger, and The Squid And The Whale. He plays Columbus, a boy who survived becoming a zombie because of his long list of rules. He figures he's the only non-zombie left, until he meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a man who doesn't have any rules. Tallahassee also is dying for a Twinkie. Watching Eisenberg and Harrelson make sparks off each other's characters is great fun, even more so that their characters are different in every way imaginable. Tallahasse and Columbus soon meet Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abagail Breslin) in a very, very, very funny scene. They are two more non-zombies. Mike White is hilarious in a 5 minute role as a gas station clerk that they show as a couple of examples before becoming a zombie, and Bill Murray makes a hilarious cameo. White and Murray alone make Zombieland worth seeing, but there's about 500 more things to love about Zombieland. This is a very, very, very highly recommended film in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't go as far as to say that this movie sucks, but it isn't really that good or "cult classic" like some say. The best part of it is the beginning, which is really funny and creative, introduction to "the rules" and storyline is well done, all jokes are in place and main character and his "sidekick" seems to be OK, but things start to go down hill when they meet with couple of chicks. Storyline stars to drag and seems to be more focused on poorly developed cliché love angle and morals about trust than on zombies. Segment with Bill while was kinda pleasant on the other hand was completely pointless waist of time. So the story drags and the deeper movie goes the more you start to hate all or most of the characters because they turn out to be a complete idiots. The ending doesn't help either because they all survive and you leave the cinema with a void in your mind, thinking about wasted time, because the good parts of this movie just doesn't last enough and boring cliché stuff drags for too long and makes your mind go numb and skeptic. So yeah, while it may be one of the better choices if you absolutely got to go to the cinema now, don't believe the hype - you may be disappointed if you do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 reasons this movie is better than Shawshank Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) Humor. There wasn't much humor in Shawshank Redemption; this movie had more humor. That makes it better by my calculations. Jokes ranging from facebook to fat people to nerds filled my heart with glee. I literally "lol"d, if you will, at many points in the movie. 2) Death Scenes. Shawshank Redemption had a few death scenes, but I didn't get the point. Every death in Zombieland made sense. Every death felt important, planned out, and intrinsically important. 3) Plot. Shawshank Redemption didn't make sense. How could a man get out of prison? Prisons aren't supposed to let people out, that's why they're called prisons. Shawshank Redemption forced the plot on the viewer. In Zombieland, postmodernist scripting allowed the plot gaps to be filled in with the human mind! The writing style empowers the people to solve the problems of Zombieland for themselves. 4) Tim Robbins vs. Robin Williams. Let's be frank, Tim Robbins just isn't a good actor. That's why Forrest Gump won all the Academy Awards in 1994. In Zombieland, Robin Williams is funny, smart, and knows how to go out with a bang (pun intended). Robin Williams reminds the audience of Caddyshack and Ghostbusters. Tim Robbins reminds the audience of Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Anchorman. Robin Williams is just a funnier man.5) Michael Cera. Michael Cera is funny in everything he does. Zombieland is just another example of something funny Michael Sera acts in. Shawshank Redemption's best actor is probably Morgan Freeman and that's only because he was in the Dark Knight (my favorite movie). Shawshank Redemption doesn't have Michael Cera. Plain and simple. Reviewing this movie in a comparative manner to the #1 movie on IMDb will give you, probably a moviegoer yourself, a good perspective of how good Zombieland really is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Zombie Comedy Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching freshman director Ruben Fleischer's audacious but entertaining lowbrow horror movie/road comedy "Zombieland" reminded me of author Max Brooks' tongue-in-cheek manual "Zombie Survival Guide" about surviving a zombie apocalypse. Brooks establishes the difference between "Solanum" zombies?zombies spawned by a virus--as opposed to voodoo zombies, along with helpful tips to outwit a zombie. Remember, zombies are reanimated corpses or a mindless human being. Despite their complete lack of intellect, zombies compensate with violent, uncontrollable behavior. For example, Brooks recommends that you keep your hair trimmed so a zombie cannot seize you by your locks and take a chunk out of you. Incidentally, the zombies in "Zombieland" qualify as "Solanum" zombies. Radioactive fall-out didn't create them like the zombies in director George Romeo's touchstone 1968 horror picture "Night of the Living Dead." Scenarists Rhett Reese of "Clifford's Really Big Movie" and television scribe Paul Wernick have forged a formulaic, uneven two-star road picture. Nothing occurs here that you haven't seen in any other z-movie. Blood, gore, and guts constitute an integral part of the action, but "Zombieland" is rarely frightening. Think of it more as a young, steroid Woody Allen meets "The Road Warrior" in a Looney Tunes comedy about zombies run amok. Meanwhile, the scenarists' attention to characterization, dialogue and the humor ranks as four stars. A virulent strain of mad cow disease precipitated the zombie epidemic. A college student from Austin, Texas (Jesse Eisenberg of "The Hunting Party") has managed to survive the zombie holocaust. He is driving back to Columbus, Ohio, to visit his parents. The trouble is that he doesn't know if his parents are alive. Our protagonist is also somewhat of a modern-day, urban hermit who doesn't venture out that often and prefers to play video games. As the narrator, he dictates his laundry list survival rules. First, 'cardio' heads the list. You've got to be faster on your feet than the zombies chasing you. Our narrator informs us that the fat humans were the first to die. Second, he advocates the 'double tap' rule. Shoot each zombie twice to make sure that zombie is kaput. Third, he warns us that restrooms have ceased to be havens of privacy. Somehow, zombies learned that they could corner their helpless prey in a toilet stall. Fourth, you must always wear seat belts, because you will survive a car collision and the zombies will not. Fleischer takes these first four rules and demonstrates each in the gas station/parking lot scene as our hero tries to elude three zombies. Fleischer renders each rule in visual text graphics like something out of "Fight Club." Later, our hero meets an older guy in a Cadillac truck with a bulldozer scoop on the grille. The older guy agrees to give the kid a lift, but he doesn't want to know his name. Instead, they refer to themselves by their destinations. Columbus is going to see his parents, while Tallahassee is searching for the last Twinkie in America. They cruise the accident cluttered four-lanes of a destitute land until they run into two females. These gals are sisters, and Tallahassee nicknames them Wichita (Emma Stone of "Superbad") and the girl Little Rock (Abigail Breslin of "Signs"). No sooner have our heroes met the heroines than they pull a fast one on Columbus and Tallahassee and steal their truck and their arsenal. Predictably, our heroes go after them. Wichita and Little Rock are bound for a California amusement park called Pacific Playland where there are reportedly no zombies. You can guess what greets them when they wheel into Pacific Playland. Despite the overall predictable plot, "Zombieland" still serves up some thrills and chills. Primarily, this movie succeeds as a release valve for anti-social behavior. The humans kill the zombies with no more thought to their demise than if they were playing a first-person, shooter video game. They destroy stores as if they were vandals. Having Bill Murry around, playing himself in a cameo, is simply genius. Woody Harrelson of "Natural Born Killers" and "Adventureland's" Jesse Eisenberg develop a rapport with each other that makes them seem believable despite their differences in age and intellect. People who cannot stomach the blood and gore of a standard zombie movie may not survive "Zombieland." Although the film carries an R-rating, director Ruben Fleischer doesn't try to gross you out like he could have. He shuns close-up shots of zombies dining on road kill. When he does show a road kill munching zombie, Fleischer relies on humor to underwhelm the horror. The zombies of "Zombieland" are fairly typical. They attack fearlessly in mobs with nothing on their minds but killing people and gnawing the flesh from their bones. These zombies all appear basically alike. They are easy to spot since they are in some stage of physical decomposition, with rotting flesh, tarnished eyes, and gaping wounds. Unlike traditional "Night of the Living Dead" zombies, they can scramble across open ground like an aggressive football team. Zombies of the fleet feet variety first showed up in the 1980 Italian gore fest "Nightmare City." Fleischer films the first encounter between Columbus and Tallahassee as if he were shooting a Spaghetti western with the appropriate south-of-the-border favor music. The most suspense that he can milk out of the material is the climactic showdown in the amusement park when our heroines are trapped on a drop tower ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laugh Out Loud Funny, Sweet, Gory, Violent. Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zombieland" is funny and sweet. It is also gory and violent. I'm not into gore and violence so I averted my eyes a lot. The humor, sweetness and inventiveness of the film were worth it for me."Zombieland" includes many zombies and their grotesque deaths, of course, but its structure is a road movie. Characters are named after their hometowns. Columbus meets Tallahassee; the two men then meet Wichita and Little Rock. A boy grows into a man by violating his own rule, "Never be a hero." Strangers bond. Lessons are learned. Hugs all around. Very sweet, and laugh out loud funny along the way.Woody Harrelson gives his finest performance as an eager zombie killer. He's so good here I really wished that there had been an Anton Chigurh zombie Harrelson could have offed, to even the score after "No Country for Old Men." "Zombieland" is a lot like an older, forgotten road movie, "Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins," in which a marginal man (Alan Arkin) makes a road trip and bonds with two female con artists. No zombies in that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not as good as the critics are saying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twice the critics have set me up to love a movie and after seeing it, I walked away slightly disappointed. The first time was "District 9," a true disappointment considering the acclaim it received. This time, to a lesser extent, it's "Zombieland." It's not "Shaun of the Dead." Too bad, too. It's more like "Juno" meets "Shaun of the Dead," without the pregnancy fun.Bill Murray's cameo is great fun. Woody Harrelson does light up the screen at times, but the movie's main character is Jesse Eisenberg as "Columbus," who is quirky and fun, but never lights up the screen as well as Woody Harrelson does. Trust me, Woody gets LOTS of screen time and I believe he carries this movie.The characters are rather shallow. With Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin never being fleshed out much more than Amber Heard's "406." Would have been interesting to find out why these two sisters were traveling together before the zombies attacked.In general, the storyline is rather thin. There are zombies. Lots of them. They're angry and hungry, though not necessarily for brains. There is a reason given for how they turned, but it's not much of one and it's easy to miss the quick reference to "Patient Zero." Otherwise, not much is said to explain them. (Do zombies need an explanation?) Anyway, not bad, but not great... enjoy with lower expectations than the critics say and you'll enjoy a real gem of a movie. Expect something better than the average zombie movie and you'll probably walk away a bit disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its a subtle blend between Shawn of the dead and 28 days later, if you try and compare this film to them you'll be disappointed. Mild comedy, and mild zombie action, for a mild result.Perfectly watchable for someone who doesn't want to be scared and wants to have a good time. Its a good movie, but not as awesome as critics put it, but most importantly I wasn't bored at any point in the film. Only thing that made me groan was the cameo of a certain actor (avoiding spoilers) filled a good 20 minutes, which was too long for the tiny comedic relief.7/10, worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends really wanted to watch this and at first I was dubious but while it isn't "Shaun of the Dead" it is really funny.One or two of the jokes are telegraphed and as usual with Zombie movies I found myself asking why, oh why, when characters do the most stupid things, while trying to avoid being eaten. Especially towards the end where two characters who have proved very cunning throughout the entire movie loose all of their common sense during the final few scenes. Don't run up to the roof or into the basement, get out of the house! Not sure that this will ever obtain cult classic status but I would however recommend this to anyone who likes Zombie movies you will not be disappointed, I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

I wish this had been one of the new season shows on fox or something. Once you see the movie you will see that this would be a lot of fun to tune in each week and see the latest exploits of the main characters. I would even settle for a 30min show. I wish the film had been longer. This was probably the shortest movie I have ever seen at a theater that wasn't a cartoon. Otherwise 10/10. I hope we will see a sequel at the very least. I haven't seen a Zombie movie this funny since a group of us watched Fido, a movie about a boy and his pet Zombie. I am not sure if this would be a date movie but Wow, I would see it again NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went a saw this movie on Friday. And from the very beginning it gets right to the story, action, and humor. And it doesn't really slow down til the end, at about 90 minutes. The "plot" is explained early on, so you know what is happening and why. However the "plot" isn't the reason for the movie. The point of this movie is simply the chemistry between the characters; the humor; and killing zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is good. He is great at a kind of awkward character/ comedy role. Woody Harrelson is perfect for this role. I am so happy to see him in a movie again. I think he is very funny, when in the right role. Emma Stone, whom I think is hot, is good in her role. Abigail Breslin, again good in her role. Interested to see if she can transition from a child actor, to a grown up actor.The movie really isn't intended to be a horror film. So don't go in expecting a dark humor/ horrow movie. It is basically a straight forward comedy, just having fun, not meant to be taken the least bit seriously.You will laugh at Harrelson's twinkie obsession!!!And I don't want to ruin anything. But I will say that there is a cameo appearance that steals the show. The whole audience was laughing so hard at this part, it was hard to hear some of the movie for a couple minutes.This was one of the first movies I have seen in along time, where after it was over, most of the theater clapped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good zombie movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies are something we will never grow tired of. For generations there have been countless zombie movies, as we, the audience, just can't get enough of people chomping on the bone matter of other people. But with so many zombie movies out there, one can't help but strike similarities with each other. Seen one zombie movie, you've seen them all, right? So what makes this zombie movie different from the rest? Zombieland is a comedy movie, not a horror movie. While some scenes are played for shocks and horror, the majority of the film plays on the comedy aspect, even in horrific situations! However, I personally believe that is the downside to this film. While this film is a comedy, I like my movies with mixes of genres. The movie could have done with some proper horror scenes.That leads to the next point. The humour. The humour is very predictable and somewhat childish, so if you are someone looking for a smart and adult movie, look elsewhere. That said, the humour does work in areas, especially with a certain someone in their house.The movie does do things right. It is surprisingly well written, the characters developed enough to keep us entertained. The zombies look great, and the kills are glorifying! And what else can you ask from a zombie movie aside from some great kills and humour to go with it? The movie entertains and it does it well, but if you are looking for somewhat long lasting and will be remembered in years to come, look elsewhere. This is not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is the next entry to the horror comedy genre. It is directed by Ruben Fleischer who did some episodes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, but no movies. It stars Jesse Eisenberg who was in Adventureland earlier this year, which I thought was a very good film. It also has Woody Harelson in a rare comedic performance and he's brilliant in it. It also stars Abigail Breslin and Emma Stone. The acting is of course very high quality especially considering that 3 cast members are Oscar nominated actors.The plot is very simple. The movie takes place in a time where the zombie apocalypse has occurred and America is now known as Zombieland. Columbus, who is played by Jesse Eisenberg has his own rules or surviving Zombieland and he's actually doing pretty well by himself. That is until he meets Tallahassee played by Woody Harelson and they agree to travel together to their destinations. Along the way they meet two sisters who are constantly stealing their car. The whole movie, they are travelling to their destination stopping to kill zombies. They are travelling to a Hollywood amusement park that is supposed to be zombie free.It is important to note that that these aren't traditional zombies, but they are living people that have been infected with mad cow disease that has become mad human disease. It really isn't a big deal because there have been several great zombie films with this angle, such as 28 Days Later. I like that there isn't much of a plot to Zombieland because that leaves a lot of time for some really intense action scenes and jokes even though the movie is only 81 minutes long. It may sound too short but the movie itself is so satisfying that it feels like the perfect time.Zombieland worked for me on so many levels. It happened to be the funniest film I've seen in a very long time. Not a single joke fell flat for me. I think this has the potential to be a comedy classic for years. Before Zombieland, I would say that the best zombie comedy was Shaun of the Dead, but I think it was a little funnier than Shaun of the Dead and a lot more fun. There's also an amazing cameo mid-way into the movie that has to be the best cameo in years. The audience was applauding during this epic cameo. I'm not going to be spoiling it here because it will not have the same effect if you already know who it is. The movie also had a good amount of gore and you could tell that it wasn't CGI. I was pleased that they didn't have too much CGI gore because it looked really fake and cheesy in some of the movies that were used in My Bloody Valentine and The Final Destination. That's all I have to say about Zombieland. I think it will appeal to different people. Both comedy fans and horror fans will both love this movie because there is a balance of both in here, though if I would have to pick one I would think that it is more of a comedy than a horror because everything is played for laughs. You shouldn't miss the best comedy of 2009. I give Zombieland a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Five on my Zombie Movie List! So good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those of you who know me know that I can sometimes go off on a rant about crap movies having no problem getting a wide, theatrical release while good films crawl around under cover of "Mom and Pop", small screen venues or after hours purgatory?if the see the light of day at all. There are movies that get rave reviews during test screenings that are still battling it out to even get a DVD release. So, seeing a zombie genre film that is this much fun, this entertaining, and this original in wide release is just so damn refreshing."Columbus" (Jesse Eisenberg) is a loner with compulsions who is trying to get back to his home in?Columbus?after the zombie plague has ravaged the world. He's worked out certain rules to help himself stay alive in this dangerous, new environment. On the road, he meets "Tallahassee" (Woody Harrelson), "Wichita" (Emma Stone), and her sister "Little Rock" (Abigail Breslin of Little Miss Sunshine fame) and the four of them work together to make their way towards a safe spot where there are no zombies. The basis for a classic, road trip scenario.When I first saw the trailer for ZOMBIELAND, I wanted to love the film. I wanted it to be an amazing, 2 hour fun park ride. However, we all know trailers can be utterly deceiving, tricksy and false! However in this case, just like GRINDHOUSE before it, Zombieland had everything it promised ? fun, comedy, horror, interesting story and, of course, ZOMBIES.Zombieland walks the fantastic line of horror and comedy. Not since the likes of SHAUN OF THE DEAD have I had so much fun in a horror film. The story is a vehicle for situations to arise and little more, but it's a zombie film and that's all it needed to be. The main four characters are grand in their roles and bring enough to them to make them interesting without getting too muddy or clichéd. The movie never takes itself too seriously, but also avoids becoming silly. One minute you are giggling at a sight gag and the very next second you are startled by a sudden zombie mishap. Witty writing and attention to the story arc made it all work well together.This is a very smart horror film as well. Someone has done their research on both the genre and it's fans. I am a huge zombie fan. I've seen many a zombie film. Reese and Wernick gave me fantastic zombie action while calling out things that drive me crazy when I watch lesser zombie fair. They play with genre norms, clichés and lore to bring a truly witty and engaging story to the screen. Clever visual gags and some fun cameos and setups had me wanting more and more of what this film had to offer.If you're a fan of zombies, comedy, and some fun scares, this is SO the movie for you. Don't wait, just go see it and enjoy! We need to reward the efforts made to bring smart horror to the main stream audience and keep the turn key, shock, "set 'em up to be killed" horror pablum at bay.malcojojo amoreeroma.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Simple Ss Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In almost any definable way, "Zombieland" is an easy movie to review. There is not myriad of layers to pull back, there is no deep allegory or social commentary ? rare in a zombie film ? there is no Art House-like direction, bizarre script, or really anything that is beyond just regular-like. That in no way, however, means that "Zombieland" is a film one should ignore.Sometimes the viewer of a film are so aware of the trickery, reveals, twists, and hidden meaning offered up to them ? canny to keep an eye out ? that he forgets the reason he goes to see movies in the first place: To be entertained. I was appalled when I saw on some fora where the wonderful Trick r Treat was being deconstructed and denounced because the viewer, in those cases, had forgotten that not every movie is directed with sequel building, dense allegorical connections, or overly cute cleverness in mind. If a person is the type that could not watch "Trick r Treat" with the understanding that it is whimsical slice of childhood fear produced with a loving infatuation for the subtler and more honest feelings of Halloween and the thrill of being scared; and if that person wants gore, archetypal origins story, torture, twists, and a whole heap of pop psychology, then both "Trick r Treat" and "Zombieland" are movies that person should sit out. They're not going to get it.However, if one likes to be entertained, to laugh and chuckle, and to come away from a movie ? not feeling moved ? but feeling as though he just paid a fair price to have a lot of fun for 80 minutes, then "Zombieland" is a movie that person should check out.Jesse Eisenberg is Columbus. He introduces himself at the beginning of "Zombieland" with a funny and gory montage involving others while explaining his main rules for surviving in Zombieland. There is also a small flashback sequence that just barley touches on the beginning of the trouble with zombies.Columbus is a neurotic loner and has never been close to his family. He feels the need, though, to see a familiar face ? or even another non-zombiefied face ? so he sets out from his college in Texas traveling to Columbus hoping that his family might be alive. Shortly thereafter he meats Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). Tallahassee is a zombie killing party animal who believes in one thing: Enjoy the little things. For Tallahassee the little things can be a good zombie kill, having nice wheels, testosterone enhancing firepower, or, his holy grail, a fresh Twinkie.Though they are opposites, Columbus and Tallahassee form a partnership and decide to travel together. Once traveling they quickly meet up with Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) ? a young woman and her aged 12 sister. The two girls are more wary of forming alliances and leave Columbus and Tallahassee behind a few times before the four finally agree to head west together to an old amusement park outside of Los Angeles that is rumored to be a zomebie-free zone.That's pretty much it. The middle of the movie turns more to a light romance between Columbus and Wichita as Eisenberg assembles his typical charming neurosis while trying to woo the ballsy bad girl Stone. Franky the romance part does not work that well. Eisenberg is charming in the same way he is in every role he is seen in, but Stone was a non-factor. I didn't buy the bad girl, I didn't buy the romance, and in many ways Stone was slightly upstaged by her younger co-star Breslin. However Stone was cute enough and so little of the film was wasted on the romance as to make it forgivable.As I am sure many have heard, there is quite a surprise cameo in the film. I am not sure how much of a surprise it is; I remember reading production news about the film and there was word that this actor was on the set. Either way, surprise or not, it is one of the best cameos of recent memory with some cult worthy scenes playing off that actor's well known body of work. It works as being ridiculously funny and as a great segue between the road movie first act and the escape and rescue third act. The cameo also does a nice job of helping one forget the non-starter romance side plot."Zombieland" has a running time of just over 80 minutes and those minutes are well spent. My gut feeling is there might have been a lot of sappy character building and romantic scenes cut out of the movie and that led to the shorter than average length. Great, I say. "Zombieland" is not a story that takes 100 minutes to tell. The 80 minutes are packed with action and humor and is short enough so that the one mismatched ingredient is easily forgiven. "Zomebieland" is great fun and movie that can be enjoyed in almost any environment. What it excels at is reminding us that movies are at their best when they deliver uncompromised fun and enjoyment.from: www.PopBunker.net @popbunker</fullReview>

The story was simple yet effective, and despite the idea being the Zombie Apocalypse scenario that's been said, done, and done again a thousand times over it was a refreshing new spin on the genre. The actors had solid performances, the zombies were convincing, and the gory special effects were great. Hell they even managed to get Bill Murray in there (I was searching frantically for Dan Akroid once I realized this). Solid acting, truly hilarious, and the story was great. And for any who might be thinking it, no this is far from a Shawn of the Dead ripoff. I can only say this, go see this movie!

		<fullReview>This is one of the best zombie movies I've seen since Planet Terror. It's funny, and fun, and a great time if you like horror comedies and amusement parks. Nobody uses their real name to avoid attachment, and instead go by their intended destinations. Columbus is a college student who has rules and tries to see if his parents are still alive. He meets Tallahassee, who is a tough redneck that tries to find the last Twinkie on earth. They meet Wichita and Little Rock, two sisters that are con-artists. After finally getting along and becoming friends, the sisters leave because they don't want to get too emotionally attached. They head off to Pacific Playland to enjoy the rides, but they unintentionally attract a bunch of zombies nearby. I love how they use the amusement park equipment to kill the zombies. I highly recommend that you go to ZOMBIELAND!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat smart, relatively funny, but no horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the previews and the first couple of seconds, I really wanted to dislike this movie: another zombie comedy, narrated by a neurotic geek (yet not a New Yorker), who looks like he's wearing some ridiculous wig. But not long after that I started to enjoy this movie. It has the best opening credits scene in a while, thanks in part to a great Metallica song. Then we meet the narrator: the overacted geek, with countless neuroses (why are there no mentally healthy people in movies?)- even before the world turned to Zombieland. Now that all of the world is filled with zombies, he's even more neurotic.The initial scenes are all tasteless bathroom humor- literally. Then he tells us how the world changed for him and what he's doing now. He's by himself walking on a highway on his way to his parents' place in Ohio. He runs into a complete jerk on his way to Florida. This guy is somewhat sadistic in his treatment of zombies, likes to destroy things, and is on a mission to find Twinkies.They join forces begrudgingly and head East. Twice they are fooled by teenage girls into giving them their weapons and cars. Then they all agree to drive to...darn California of course- can't have a movie without that.That's when the movie goes downhill fast. They decide to live in a mansion and for the next 15 minutes a Bill Murray adoration piece follows that makes no sense. Finally, the girls decide to go to their destination: some amusement park. The geek by then has of course fallen in love with the older girl and has so to go after her. In a bizarre filming mistake, the girls leave in the morning and get there at night, when the guys go after them they get there in 2 minutes. So now it's dark of course and the girls are attacked by zombies while they are trying to enjoy the park all for themselves.What I liked about this movie: despite dangerously close to annoying, the script is smart. The jokes aren't just punchlines. There is some cultural criticism here as well. Who are really the zombies? Most of us "alive" actually live like zombies pretty much. Another positive is that there was no multicultural cast just for the sake of being politically correct. There are some good zombie kills. There's some good gore, at least in the beginning. The first part filmed in Gorgia (as Texas and Arizona) is good: outdoors in the country, in daylight.The problems with this movie: the cast, especially the weirdo lead character with the wig, who hired these people and why? I don't care for Harrelson a bit, let alone the whole Murray deal. Enough with the neurotic characters already. Tough teenage girls? we've seen that a couple of times too many. The second part taking place in California, in the dark, is like a different movie entirely, and not nearly as good as the first part. It would be perfectly fine to have a horror movie without a conclusion at night. There is zero sense or fear or dread in this movie.Overall, it's a different, refreshing comedy- and that's really what it is- a romantic comedy perhaps, set in Zombieland, where only 5 humans have survived. Visually there are a lot of interesting elements here. While overall, the script follows the basics of all scripts, there are a lot of intelligent bits here and there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone rates movies differently but I rate a movie on how much I enjoyed the film and with that being said, Zombieland gets a 10/10 for me. This zombie action comedy flick sparkles with its hilarious twist on the idea of a zombie plague and hilarious cast. The idea of spoofing the classic zombie outrage was first introduced to us by Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg in the hilarious Shaun of the Dead. The creators of this movie who were inspired by that classic deliver a movie that is as witty and hilarious as Shaun could be. The thing that amazed me most by Zombieland was the fact that it kept me interested and laughing out of my seat from beginning to end. Starting with the very first scene of the movie where Columbus is explaining his rules, pulls you in from there and you never look back. But the real star of the movie is of course Woodie Harrelson. Imagine his character from Natural Born Killers turn up the funny but instead for a knack of killing humans, its zombies. He pulls his role off flawlessly as the Zombie killing machine, Tallahassee, with a twinky fetish. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin are great in their roles as well. Their characters show the love two siblings have for one another when everyone else in the world has vanished. The mixture of tough and bad ass action scenes, along with funny and sympathetic ones is greatly spread throughout this film. And lets not forget the great cameo by Bill Murray. This was just an extra bit the makers of this movie threw in their to make a great film even more exceptional.Zombieland is a great zombie action comedy that will remain as a favorite for a while. Go and see this and hopefully you will enjoy it as much I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Time to nut up or shut up!" ZOMBIELAND REVIEW</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is one of my first comments on this site. So to all you wannabe Eberts, cut me some slack.Once I sat down in the theater I really wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I had heard great reviews and the trailer caught my attention, but something kept telling me this movie might not live up to any expectations. I couldn't have been more wrong, Zombieland is one of those movies where once you leave the theater you'll be talking about this movie for awhile. Just the sheer amount of "oh snap" moments (mostly death scenes or kills, I won't go into too much detail) will make want to yell "OOOOH" followed by a burst of laughter.I think the main thing I was concerned about was Jesse Eisenberg. I thought Adventureland was a great movie, but in all honesty he ruined that movie with all his Michael Cera-like attributes. However, this time around he wasn't as annoying, he still played that same exact role but it fit this time around. Besides that everyone else did a terrific job.The cameo that was being talked about all over the internet exceeded all the hype. Know about who's making the cameo didn't ruin it for me, it only made it funnier. Guaranteed you'll laugh at the screen time he has, especially his final minutes (hope that didn't give too much away).To end my rant, just go see the movie. It's worth every penny, but go see it on a weekend night. Honestly, the audience's reactions were priceless and well worth sitting in a crowded theater. Hope you thought my input was worthwhile and have fun watching a great movie.-FURYFIGHTER</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This is my comment/opinion, like they ask for. If you want the plot, it's not in here.) This movie was fantastic. It's the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. There were people on here who downed it, saying it was an awful horror movie. That's like going to see the movie Superbad and saying, "I wasn't even scared, how dumb." Plus, anyone who said it was bad was most likely not even watching it, and instead playing with themselves in the theater.It was pretty short, but it's good that way. The humor pretty much never stopped coming. Myself and everyone else laughed throughout the whole thing... with the exception of the guy two seats down... he laughed hysterically.But yes, go see this movie! It was great. If you think otherwise, you may want to go see your doctor, because there is something wrong with you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great way to start a career for Ruben Fleischer, (and I'm not being sarcastic). Following in the gory footsteps of George Romero and Robert Rodriguez, Fleischer brings the story to life for eighty minutes of virtually flawless fun. I guess it could have been a bit longer, but I am fine with it.When the story begins, the world is already a hellhole. A virus has turned the world into a Zombie feeding ground. Our hero and narrator is young Columbus, who takes on the world solo, and stays alive because he follows his thirty one principles, which include: wear your seat belt, check the back seat, and don't be a hero. One day he teams up with Tallahassee; a twinkie-loving, trigger happy cowboy The two of them later team up with Witchita and Little Rock; a couple of sister bandits, cute but dangerous. They all agree to head for Pacific Playland California, where there are supposedly no zombies. Along the way they get to know each other like a family.It ain't scary for a moment, but it ain't dull for a moment either. There are jokes here there and everywhere. Only six members of the cast are not zombies, (well maybe seven). four are our heroes, one is a nerdy gas station clerk, and one is (I'm not supposed to say, but you may find out sooner or later). As a horror comedy, this film is one step above many of its predecessors (the most recent of which is Shawn of the Dead), because it offers likable characters, possibly the most memorable since Tremors, twenty years ago. Although they are not perfectly rounded, we spend just enough time with them to know who they are, what they want and so on and so forth. Now that I think about it, if this movie does well enough (and especially considering the ending) There might be a sequel in store, but that is another movie. Go out and enjoy this one for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Narrated by the socially-isolated and rules-obsessed Columbus (Eisenberg), "Zombieland" is a film which, in my opinion, did a much better job than other notable zombie/comedy (zomedy, perhaps?) films, such as "Shaun of the Dead," of fusing the spirit of the undead (if the undead have a spirit) with a generous serving of all kinds of humor. Whether it be slapstick gags, ironic happenings, grotesque violence, or simply re-iteration of character eccentricities (which quickly become apparent), "Zombieland" kept me smiling at every moment.Columbus, with his list of 32 rules which he obsessively follows, and to which he attributes his very survival, is trying to get from Austin, TX to his hometown of, well, Columbus, OH. On his journey, the audience learns of his self-imposed isolation, even from his parents. He hardly ever lets anyone into his life. When he tried before the dawn of Zombieland (or Z-Land), it nearly makes him one of the undead in one of the most memorable flashback scenes I have ever witnessed. Along the way, Columbus gets paired up with the nothing-left-to-lose, Twinkie-seeking Tallahassee (Harrelson). Although the two have nothing in common, they complement each other perfectly because they are polar opposites. Their clashing personalities contribute to them teaming up with a duo of sisters, Wichita and Little Rock (Stone, Breslin).With the two sisters in tow, the audience witnesses Columbus and Wichita getting close. The film takes slight digressions for the sake of relationship depth. We discover much more about all four of the survivors in Z-Land. After this slight digression (and a spectacular cameo), it's back to the double-barreled boy to deal with some Zombies.Zombieland did not disappoint in any way. Indeed, it's what I needed after my first week of university to start off my junior year. Great laughs, great action, and a surprising degree of depth made this film a brilliant experience for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woody Harrelson came to me in a dream last night and told me to see this movie...not really, but he might as well have. I went in with a few reservations, including the seemingly common fear that it would follow heavily in the footsteps of Shaun Of The Dead, which I love dearly. My worries proved to be unfounded. Having only seen the trailer once or twice, I didn't think about it much before seeing it, and I wasn't disappointed.I won't discuss the plot or reveal any spoilers, as I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said, but I will say one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie is it's pace. It's very fast-paced, gets started right away, and doesn't stop, making the most out of it's 90-minutes. One of the most enjoyable intros I've seen, and definitely tops among zombie movies.Just the right amount of gore, fun, engaging action, and hilarious dialogues/characters. Casting was dead on, done as a zombie apocalypse movie should be, with only a few pivotal characters, and Woody Harrelson simply made this movie. Cinematography and production was incredible, a very sleek, very modern, and accessible movie. I'm tempted to go see it again, as I really can't say enough good about Zombieland. As another reviewer said, the most fun I've had in a movie theater in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you are out of shape in Zland, start adding some Mrs. Dash to your ass, because you are about to be zombie chow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Swift shot: Zombie flicks and me usually don't get along well, when they are seriously driven, but Zland doesn't take itself too seriously ? it is just a sweet ass ride, one that you will want to experience again and again. You'll want to bring different people with you to gauge their reactions, see if they are savvy enough to catch on and find out if they could keep up with the rules of Zombieland. And I know this film is layered, so seeing it two or three times couldn't hurt.Right out of the gate this friggin movie has you by the nuts! From the very beginning, you are introduced to chaos and mayhem. But, fret not, even the meek can survive in Zombieland, if you remember to follow the rules. Rule #1 ? Cardio! If you are out of shape in Zland, start adding some Mrs. Dash to your ass, because you are about to be zombie chow.Zombieland has many rules, and if you pay attention you will see them strewn about this amazing film, using that interactive caption technique (you've seen it on a cheesy VW commercial). The rules will be forced down your throat over and over again, but each time is more clever and creative than the next. If you are like me, some douche-bag will be sitting behind you reading them out loud and guffawing as the butter and snot drip out of his mouth, because he is a douche-bag ? so it stands to reason that the concession people hocked a luggie in his popcorn. And if they didn't, they should be fired . . . immediately.Just when you think you have this film completely figured out, director Ruben Fleischer throws in a great surprise which I am sworn to keep quiet about on pain of death. Let's just say, you won't see it coming, and while there are quite a few predictable moments in Zombieland, the few times things aren't always as they seem will challenge your experience.Apparently Mike Cera was not in this film, and I really gotta stop getting actors mixed up, it was Jesse (Columbus) Eisenberg, who was in Adventureland earlier this year. I think I can figure out which one he had more fun shooting ? at least from what I saw on screen anyway. Woody (Tallahassee) Harrelson found his niche with his redneck rendition of Rambo meets Rowdy Roddy Piper. Tallahassee relishes squashing zombies, thrives at it, and teaches Columbus some new rules . . . and when to break those rules.Delicious, delectable, devious Emma Stone plays Wichita, who is trying to navigate with her own set of rules as she desperately tries to lead her sister, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) out of Zombieland and to the Pacific Playland theme park ? or, Disneyland to us r-tards. I think the set they used was straight outta Adventureland or wherever they shot National Lampoon's Vacation . . . Wally World. In fact, it would have been somewhat apropos to use Wally World.You will enjoy Zombieland; as my dad used to say, "it's an E-Ticket ride!" My review can't do justice to the experience that is Zombieland ? go see it, then run right back out, grab some non-luggie popcorn, and see it again! And if you dare wait to "rent" this, please mail your testicles to some Swiss lab, because you got a rotten pair!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy horror!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hallelujah! Here's a horror-comedy narrated with tongue planted firmly in cheek. First-time director Fleisher asserts that genre-bending can be as much fun as the proverbial full of monkeys.Cut, then, to a futuristic America overrun by ravenous flesh-eaters. Against all odds, a gang of 20-something (Eisenberg) has survived the zombie epidemic.In his foolhardy mission to find his missing family, he teams up with agunman (Harrelson) and a pair of wacko sisters (Emma StoneAbigail Breslin).Next: the quartet combats a full of creepy crawlies. Clichéd? Perhaps, but also outrageously funny. The outcome is cartoon gory and yet thought provoking while tackling the subject of family relationships.Zombieland is remarkable, too, for a brilliant sequence featuring Bill Murray, playing himself, disguised as one of the 'born-again' dead.Packed with belly laughs, the script also makes striking use of voice-over narration. Towards the climax, though, the goings-on become way over-the-top.On the acting front, Woody Harrelson is nothing short of extraordinary. The young trio Jesse Eisenberg,Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin, are all likable.For its technical bravura and irreverent humor, Zombieland is a ticket to buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomely Funny and Action Packed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I have really enjoyed myself in the theaters. Sure, Inglorious Basterds was genius and District 9 was also quite good, but that's about all I can recall really enjoying this summer. Now with fall upon us, it's time to head into a new season of film and ramp up for the winter. Zombieland is a great start for the season. In fact, this is really just a summer movie that missed the deadline. It would have been one of the better films this summer, and is one of the better films I have seen as of late.In Zombieland, our focus is on Columbus, an almost neurotic shut-in, is trying to get home to Columbus, Ohio after zombies take over the world. He soon meets Tallahassee, who is simply trying to survive, and find a twinkie at that. The two hit the road, and we find ourselves on a zombie road trip that will have you laughing all along the way.The best thing about the film is that it is in equal parts action packed and funny. Well, probably mostly fun, but there is enough of both comedy and action here to satisfy. However, this is not gag based comedy, thank god, but rather based on it's characters, which is a relief for zombie films. Jessie Einsenberg is perfectly cast as Columbus, who seems afraid of the world at large, but is pretty much forced into it by the zombie situation. His narration, which could have been annoying, is actually quite funny from the very beginning. Just as funny are his rules, which continually pop up in comedic fashion to remind the viewer of their importance. Woody Harrelson is also quite funny as Tallahassee, whose mostly muscle for the film, but also provides quite a bit of comedy through his "nut up or shut up" type of character. Completing the cast are Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Witchita and Little Rock, respectively, two young femme fatales who take our main characters for quite the spin.The comedy in zombieland lends itself more to today's style of humor in films, that sort of realistic and awkward humor that has been pervasive in any film starring Seth Rogan or Michael Cera. While it's not exactly that style of humor, the most funny moments are the most human ones. Tallahassee's quest for a twinkie, Columbus' neurosis, tearing up a souvenir shop, even Bill Murray's guest appearance. These are all some of the funniest things about the film. Sure, all the stuff involving the zombie's is fun and funny, but what really shines here are the characters, which keep from being typical, plywood staples of the zombie film. Many will probably compare this to Shaun of the Dead, and it's a justified comparison. This ranks right up there with Shaun and should be an instant zombie classic.</fullReview>

I didn't really care about that..the movie took no time to explain WHY the zombie apocalypse happened, it just did and I think that is just fine, especially for this type of zombie film..and as for the rest of the storyline/plot.. it was fine I guess. Everything flowed well, I didn't think there were any stupid, useless scenes in the movie or anything like that. Its a movie about zombie killing what more do you want? the acting? I think each actor played their character quite well, especially Woody Harrelson..he was the best.So yeah, its a very entertaining film...I know its easy to compare to Shaun of the Dead, but to say which one is better? In my opinion they both stand on their own..I don't think its necessary to compare the two to one another too much.So yeah, GO SEE IT!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but ultimately disappointing, and nowhere near as great as Shaun of the Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touted as an American version of Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland follows Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), and sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) as they fight and drive across the United States, avoiding becoming the next statistic of an all encompassing zombie infection. For those wondering, to avoid any real connections to each other, the group goes by city names to avoid exchanging their real names. An interesting touch in an otherwise bafflingly disappointing film.I wanted to love Zombieland the same way I do Shaun, but sadly, the film fails to deliver the same way that low budget British rom-zom-com did five years ago. It has the intentions to be an amazingly hilarious horror film, but it never delivers on the promises of the hysterical trailers.Speaking of those trailers, they are the biggest point of contention I have with the film. They reveal almost every single one of the best jokes. Outside of the crazily hilarious and out-of-this-world cameo appearance, the trailers show and tell almost everything else. And if you have had the misfortune of learning which actor appears in that cameo, half the joke has been ruined already. It feels a bit mismanaged on Sony's part, especially for such a ridiculously short film (80-minutes and change), to basically give away all the best parts. It is something that a lot of studios have tended to not really do so much anymore, but here it just feels silly. A lot of these lines were laugh-out-loud hysterical the first time, but on the second round, seem not so clever or unique. Many of the lines suffer even worse fates. They simply lose their luster, and end up being not funny at all.The film also lacks what is key for every good film involving zombies: satire. George A. Romero became famous for his zombie films, but only because of the ulterior messages he was using the flesh hungry horrors to put across. Isolation and fear were always apparent in his films, and every film from Shaun to the incredibly overrated 28 Days Later has used some part of his famous works to make their own film shine all the brighter. Zombieland does away with this almost entirely. It wisely does not elaborate to in-depth on the cause of the infection, or even how far it reaches (is it just in the United States, or has the whole world become zombies?). But outside of Columbus' rules to live by, which comically appear every few minutes during his narrative speeches, the film never makes an attempt at satirizing anything. It just makes jokes at the expense of pop culture, the cameo actors previous films (good and horrible), and Harrelson's bizarre redneck attitude. Any attempts at drama fall flat on its face.The film also suffers from having an episodic feel. I found it strange how the film seems to take place almost blatantly in acts; sticking to one conflict, subplot or setting at once, and never moving out of it. Learning that the film was supposed to be a television series helps shed light on why it felt this way, but does not explain why the filmmakers did not attempt to jazz it up with more scenes in more places. It gives the film a great low-budgeted feel, and makes it feel more authentic and diverse. But after seeing what a group of amateur South Africans did with 30-million dollars in District 9, I have come to expect a bit more of low budget film-making. Even Shaun manages to do a whole lot more, and from my understanding, it was made for a fairly smaller amount of money as well. The problems Zombieland suffers from here could have only been amended in editing. But with how straight and to the point the film tends to be, I doubt there was any room for added filler at any point (outside of a very dry section taking place shortly after the two groups meet for the first time).The inventive camera angles and consistently dystopic feel are the most powerful points in the film. While the entire film is not made of crazy and unique camera angles, there are plenty that feel original or used far too often. They give a certain taste to the film that makes it much better than it actually is, but do tend to make the film all the more uncommon. The hard rocking soundtrack is pretty well done as well, setting the tone for the film right from Metallica's opening note over the hugely entertaining opening credits.Eisenberg, while saddled with playing almost entirely the same character as he does in Adventureland, does some fairly good work here. His narration adds a comical element to the film that would have been sorrowly missed, and even with his same-note performance, he manages to be convincing in the role. Branching out and doing more unique things with the character could have only been beneficial to him. Harrelson, much accustomed to playing silly and unhinged characters, is solid throughout the film. He has enough finesse and charisma to work off his much younger supporting cast, and manages to make his role fun from beginning to end. Seeing him in roles like this begs the question of why he has not been playing and sticking to characters like these at all times. Stone and Breslin do some decent work in their roles, but are never really explained like Eisenberg and Harrelson are. Their one-dimensionality is a bit silly in the long run (especially when looking at their actions in the final act), but both actresses are convincing in their roles.Saying Zombieland was anything like Shaun of the Dead was the first mistake anyone made with this film. It is a fairly competent film in its own right with good performances, but nowhere near the classic Shaun is and will always be.6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a long time fan of Zombie movies. From the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead to 28 Days Later and Zombie Honeymoon. I was very excited to see this and not only did it live up to all my expectations but it FAR surpassed them!!!The story is standard fare for a zombie movie. Several survivors meet up as the movie goes on and band together to survive and bond. The thing that makes this movie fun and unique is the WAY it is all pulled off and put together. There are easily TWO break out characters in the movie. Both by two top name actors. The first was Woody Harrelson's character of Tallahassee, The "bad-ass tough guy". Not only does he kick so much ass in the movie but he is fun and funny and loving. The big surprise you find out about him near the end of the movie , which i won't spoil here, makes you love him. The second one... SPOILER SPOILER Is the short lived character played by Bill Murray....as himself!!! Not only was it EXCITING to see him in it. But every little scene he is in... is stand up and memorable.... even when he's a dead corpse! If you love or like or even slightly enjoy horror or zombie movies... i FULLY recommend you see this movie! it has all the scare and gore you could want and also lots of great characters and laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies zip past the road to nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into Zombieland with the idea that it is a Zombie film you will be disappointed. What Zombieland is at it's core is a Coming-of-age, road trip film ala 1980's. The trailers for the film are misleading and if they had marketed the film for what it is, it would have seemed inventive and not so run of the mill. Don't get me wrong, there are Zombies out there, but they are just part of the set-up for the movie, the real story revolved around an introverted young man who is forced by circumstance to abandon college and make his way home. He is sidetracked by an older man who leads him on an adventure where he meets a young woman whom he must ultimately save. I think that the writers must be familiar with Campbells "The Hero of a Thousand Faces", because like Lucas's "Star Wars" the characters come from those pages.It is not a film without interest though. If you ever wondered what would become of those people that dress up as famous people on Hollywood Blvd., or what would happen to Eddie Van Halen or Bill Murry during a Zombie plague, you'll find your answer here. There are some terrible and unforgivable mistakes in this film though: The first is that it never really resolves itself, the film rambles on and comes very close to making a point then steps back and goes in another direction. Most importantly; the end of the film is a let down. It almost seems like it was an afterthought and the Director gives each character a chance to kill zombies and then drive off with a little voice over narration that is suppose to satisfy the time one spent invested in this film. It is truly annoying for anyone who has seen Dawn of the Dead and wondered what they would do in a Zombie plague; these characters choices make no sense at all. I won't talk about the acting outside of the fact that Woody can not cry to save his life without making it look phony (I though he was pulling the lead characters leg, but it turned out he was emoting). Finally, the lead character sets off on a quest that is discarded without any remorse. There is no way to feel for these characters, they are empty, fractured and one dimensional. Bill Murry who makes a brief appearance in the film, makes one wonder if he had lost a poker game to the producers. That segment of the film is the biggest "Why ?" of the film. There is no reason whatsoever for them to be at Bill Murry's house !In the end it is not a good Zombie film, and it is a so-so road trip/coming-of-age film. It isn't worth $12 to see and it isn't worth $24 or so to buy on DVD. Wait and rent it and it may seem better than I make it out to be. I can certainly understand that this poor review will annoy some people who love zombies of any kind, as an avid played of L4D I understand; it is just that this film doesn't do it for me. Well..it could be worse...it could have been directed by Rob Zombie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is a classic horror-comedy, with exciting and funny parts throughout the entire film. In my eyes, this movie surpassed the 2004 horror-comedy, 'Shaun of the Dead', with more action. Zombieland is a very fun film to watch. Fleischer, the director of Zombieland, did so very well to entertain audiences with combinations of action and comedy. It jumps right into the action at the very start, which was very well done. With a touch of romanticism, all characters have been portrayed by their actors perfectly; very well casted movie. The best thing about the movie is the list of rules in which Columbus follows in order to survive the zombie outbreak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enter the word "Zombie" into the search engine of the Internet Movie Database and you're likely to yield results for everything from Night of the Living Dead to Zombie Prom. They've become more or less of a staple of the Horror genre since their subsequent invention by veteran movie director George Romero (Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead). For those of you who are still stuck in the Stone Age, you may be asking yourselves, "What exactly is a Zombie?" According to a loose definition from Answers.com, a "Zombie" is: A supernatural power or spell that according to voodoo belief can enter into and reanimate a corpse. Holy catfish! As you would presume, an outbreak of such an entity would be catastrophic! It would be the end of the human race as we know it! It would be?Zombieland.Originally designed to invoke fear into audiences, more recently film executives have come to realize the potential for just how funny these damn things really are. It all began with Shaun of the Dead, a Dawn of the Dead rip off, that shed some light on the comedic value of the "living dead". Before long each and every Weinstein brother, cousin and nephew was in on the action and so rose the birth of "spin offs" (such as Fido about a young boy growing up in the fifties who has his own pet Zombie), so many in fact that audiences were beginning to experience that "Touristas" effect (you know, the one where you feel like gauging your eyes out if they decide to make one more movie about a bunch of teenagers taken captive on a deserted island). Along comes a trailer for Zombieland. Ugh. Not another one. Wait, but it stars Woody Harrelson? And that guy (Jesse Eisenberg) from The Education of Charlie Banks? And that really, really hot, no-name actress (Emma Stone) from Superbad?!?! And Abigail Breslin? This certainly can be no ordinary Zombie schlock film. That's because this IS no ordinary Zombie schlock film.Zombieland's opening scenes draw you into a world where everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) has been transformed into flesh hungry corpses. With the speed and determination of Michael Phelps on his fourth lap, these things will stop at nothing to hunt down, corner and feed on the living. Sounds pretty gross huh? Zombieland is far from a gore free zone for the squeamish. In short, if the thought of seeing someone's intestines dug out from their stomach and eaten disgusts you, keep your ten dollars and put it toward the next Harry Potter remake. What separates Zombieland from its competitors is its excruciating originality. For all ninety minutes of the film you'll feel as if you've left reality behind. In this world you're the minority. In this world, there are rules, and you'll be taught to obey them and to utilize them if you'll have any chance of surviving through the end credit roll. With Columbus (Eisenberg) and Tallahassee (Harrelson) as your guides you'll learn quickly as you make your way through hordes of the undead in pursuit of intelligent life, as well as maybe a Twinkie or two (it'll click when you see it).For all that Zombieland deservingly should have failed to be, this cinematic gem shines surpassingly bright. From pitch perfect acting by Woody and Jesse, to hilarious on the mark dialog from writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick delivered with gut busting clarity, they all serve to round out the pic to perfection. Rachel Kick's make-up artistry is a force to be reckoned with and manages to give famous horror make up Guru Tom Savini a run for his money. Rookie director Ruben Fleischer proves to have a superb handle on this material, a feat that only a true genre aficionado can dream of accomplishing, and does so with a seemingly playful hand.I laughed. I jumped. I clapped at the conclusion. Zombieland was certainly the most fun I've had at the movies in a long, long time. Check it out, and on your drive home from the theater be sure to remember rule number 3, "Always check the backseat".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland is a rare gem: a horror-comedy that delivers on both fronts. It's got a fresh sense of humor and moments of gut-wrenching suspense.I've got a few minor complaints, which I'll get out of the way first. A friend saw Zombieland the day before I did, and she said she was laughing the entire time. I didn't have the same experience - there were certainly some unexpected, gut-busting laughs, but the comedy isn't non-stop. It seemed like the first half of the film had a lot more laugh-out-loud moments than the last half.Also, the horror/suspense elements are mainly an after-thought. Most zombie movies have a pervasive sense of dread, but Zombieland doesn't give you that feeling (aside from a couple fleeting moments). This is easy to forgive, though, since it obviously isn't trying to take itself too seriously.Complaints aside, Zombieland is very entertaining. It grabs your attention right from the beginning, when Jesse Eisenberg explains his tips for surviving in zombie-infested America. The use of slow-motion, narration, and superimposed text in this introduction is stellar.Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Emma Stone are all perfect for their roles, and it's a blast when they're all together. The movie spends more time focusing on their relationships with one another than developing any sort of detailed storyline, which is a good thing.Once the credits roll on Zombieland, you'll be left wanting more. Given the buzz it's received, and its well-deserved box office success, a sequel seems likely. If and when that happens, you can count me in.</fullReview>

If you love violent or comically gory movies than this is a great one. Also much more of a comedy then I thought it would be. It even had a brief tear-jerking moment that quickly turned right back around to comedy. Just as funny if not funnier than "Shawn Of The Dead". This kid Jesse Eisenberg is hilarious and I hope to see him in more upcoming comedies. Woody Harrelson is always is great and perfect for the role in this movie. Greatness!

		<shortDescription>ZombieBusters: Your funny bone will be ripped out and gnawed on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No critical analysis is possible. I just flat out loved this thing and there is not much more that can be said. It's the best comedy I have seen since Tropic Thunder. There's gore galore, it's a zombie movie after all, and it's not for kids but the worst stuff is over in the first few minutes of the movie. From then on, it's sheer inspired goofiness all the way. Zombieland is so good in fact, I wonder if it will kill off the zombie genre. If you watch Zombieland, you simply will not be able to watch another zombie movie without thinking of this one. Casting is perfect. I think this is Woody Harrelson's best comedic performance since Kingpen. And Bill Murray is in it! And he's funny for the first time is years and they're riffing on Ghostbusters! OMG, what more could you want? Man, we needed this movie.The premise is that some kind of virus infects the burger chains and the next thing you know anyone who has eaten one of the mad-zombie burgers is crazy for "manwiches." I don't know about you but it makes sense to me. Now, movies about only a few survivors of the end of the world taking on the crazed remnants of civilization are old hat these days. Think about (or not) that awful Will Smith vehicle I Am Legend. Half the trailers these days show movies where people are running around screaming about the end of the world. Get a grip. Zombieland makes the end of the world fun again. It doesn't worry about anyone's sensitivity and doesn't have a serious bloody bone in its body. It's like Mad Max on goofy gas by way of Douglas Adams. Someone must have told the writers to go crazy and not worry about a thing. And you know what, the result is a script that is pretty darn good, a real rarity these days. The survival tips which pepper the film were so good in fact, I was tempted to take notes. I mean if you must have an end of the world movie, at least tell us how to deal with it. Zombieland does just that. My only criticism is that I wished they have made the movie longer so we could see how other survivors are coping (in the film we see only one, a nun who can dispatch zombies with the best of them). I'm embarrassed to say this, but I hope there is a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really fun movie, and there's a lot in it that's great. It's clever, the characters are great, it's very well made, etc.But a big part of the appeal comes out of the visceral joy one finds in watching one person split another person's head open with a baseball bat.There are more and more movies coming out that ask us to take pleasure in violence. And the violence is becoming more and more brutal, more sadistic.I'm not sure what to make of it. I don't think the movies are causing problems. But I do think they might be reflecting some fairly ugly things going on in our culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie!! It was just so much fun. Part of this of course could be the fact that I was with five of my friends who all love to act stupid and make funny comments to each other every now and then during a movie; In this situation this movie is nothing short of perfect. It was hilarious! so much so that about 15 minutes in, me and my friends couldn't even continue to joke anymore in between laughs from the movie. The different simple locations used in the movie like a supermarket,theme park, celebrity's house, etc. were all well chosen and kept things interesting. Also the way the story is told with the main character's narration and rules, as well as a few flashback's to how things were before the whole Zombie thing happened were all placed nicely at different times in the movie. Woody Harrelson did an awesome job and really owned that character. The only thing I'd say I didn't like was the acting from the youngest character "Little Rock". I didn't really buy her trying to act tough attitude. All in all, a frickin awesome movie. Oh and one thing that sometimes worries me is that sometimes a movie gets killed by a bad ending. Thankfully that did not happen in this movie. It left me satisfied and can't genuinely say that for too many movies</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back from the film. Being a big fan of zombies I'd been looking forward to Zombieland for some months, watching each trailer and trying to keep my expectations somewhere in the middle as to not ruin the experience.The film is hilarious and everyone in my theater seemed to be enjoying themselves. The movie provided plenty of laughs and plenty of jumps for those not used to Zombie movies. Like many comedies this one doesn't take itself too seriously and breaking the fourth wall is common practice, there are little reminders everywhere that this is just a ride to be enjoyed. The runtime of the film is just over an hour but as you watch you'll realize just how much humor, heart, and gore is crammed into that 80 minutes.Using zombies as a back drop to deal with human social interaction and dropping a coming of age story into a zombie apocalypse. Everything is there in balance.If there is one flaw to the movie it is undoubtedly its overuse of narration by the main character and it wasn't until a little later in the film, when his constant interruptions were few and far between, that I felt truly immersed in the film. Its an extremely solid zombie comedy and a plain old good time for anyone who loves the undead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to HATE it... I really did</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the trailer for this film, I didn't think it was going to be all that good. I am an old school zombie fan, and I don't care for many of the modern films. I like a few of the European films from the 70's &amp; 80's, the original Return of the Living Dead, and of course.. Romero's films TOP the list. In recent years, the only zombie movie that has really jumped out at me was Shaun Of The Dead. Barring those films, I haven't likes too much of the zombie sub-genre. Zombieland however, is a very noble effort. The idea of Comedy Zombie movies doesn't sit well with some people, and I understand that... But I do think that a lot of time and attention to detail was put into this movie. The casting was (overall) good, the story-line was decent enough, and the action/gore is well spaced and fluid. For the most part the writing is good. There are however a few awkwardly written exchanges, and a few humorous lags. But these problems are VERY minimal, and the momentum makes up for said lags. Will Zombieland go down in history as an "epic" zombie film? I don't know. What I do know is that if you like the genre itself, and want to see a good stab at it with a budget, then this is worth a viewing. -JB</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of 'turn off your brain and enjoy'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is NOT a film that will be up for any awards this year (except for maybe those from Fangoria), as it is not an art or prestige movie--nor is it something you'll likely see in the Criterion Collection! No, this film is about as far from this sort of movie as you can get, as it's a 'turn off your brain and enjoy' film--one you can't think too much about but there is still something about it you'll probably like. I say PROBABLY because if you can't stand gore or profuse swearing, then go no further--this is clearly a film to avoid. But, provided you have a relatively high tolerance for this sort of thing, it's a good bet to see--in particular if you've seen and enjoyed "Sean of the Dead". While "Sean" is a better film, it's roughly along the same lines--an irreverent comedy about zombie-killers!What is particularly good about this film is the dialog and characters as they seem very out of place and just plain strange. One (the narrator) is a total geek, one a maniac who, on some level, actually seems to be ENJOYING the zombie outbreak (Woody Harrelson)! These two later stumble upon the most unlikely pair of girls--an 18-or so year old and her 12 year-old sister. I say unlikely because they repeatedly get the upper hand on the two men and prove that brains, not just brawn and a desire to kill, are what counts. As for the rest of the film, it's mostly mindless violence, action and laughs. Now there is a very special moment around the middle of the film when the quartet meet a new friend. This is GREAT but I don't want to say more as it would spoil the surprise.Mindless, crazy and worth seeing. This is a great one to rent or watch on cable, but it probably isn't good enough to merit adding it to your DVD collection--but you be the judge of that. Surprisingly good.</fullReview>

Woody Harrellson has a great time with his role and Abigail Breslin once again proves that she's the most talented actor of her generation. Where the film fails though is it's gore factor. It's squeamishly violent, unnecesarily so and the scene in a native American shop is offensive and crude. Comparisons to the vastly superior Shaun of the Dead are unavoidable and Zombieland lags in the middle becoming a zombie-road-trip which is boring. Zombieland does have a few laugh-out- loud moments though and Bill Murray an hilarious cameo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now THAT is how you do a post-apocalyptic-zombie-horror-comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment you hear geeky college kid 'Columbus' (the narrator's home city; one doesn't bother with real names after a zombie apocalypse) give his opening narration (reiterating his own version of author Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide) over a very imaginative credits sequence, you realize that the zombie genre (or rather zombie-comedy sub-genre) may still have some life in it yet!On the long, dead road home to see if his family are alright (not that he was particularly close to them, mind you), Columbus meets 'Tallahassee' (Woody Harrelson), a one-man zombie war machine who embodies the gun-toting, SUV driving, liquor-guzzling, made-in- America bravado and bluster that make him both hero AND comic relief. He releases some of Columbus' nerdy inhibitions (but not too many) and in turn, Columbus helps him on his own 'quest'; to find and devour some of the last remaining Twinkies left in the universe! Now that is some of the most brilliant product placement I've ever seen (right up there with ET's Reese's Pieces!).Before long, these fledging 'Luke and Han'-style partners meet up with a pair of sisters, Wichita and Little Rock, who have their own agenda (and seem to not care who they step over to achieve it). Of course, the girl-shy Columbus is almost instantly taken with the older sister Wichita. After a few misfires in the relationship, a shaky truce is formed. It is at this point in the story where the group goes on a quest back west (to an amusement park) because wherever you come from, it's ALWAYS better out west (or east, if you're from the west!). It is at this point in the story that the movie gains it's title, as the amusement park becomes a kind of zombie-filled version of "Wally World" from National Lampoon's Vacation (which was, in turn, about middle America's zombie-like quest for 'family fun'). Ironic.But up to this point and well after it, the movie is already an amusement park (forget any plot holes like potentially running out of gas, food, etc; this movie is a comedy/horror e-ticket ride)! From the colorful ways Zombies are dispatched, to Columbus' oft-repeated on-screen lists of rules of survival (which 'interact' with the movie very creatively) and all the way to Hollywood with a hilarious cameo by Bill Murray as Bill Murray (reteaming him with his Kingpin costar Harrelson), the movie is a new high in the zombie/comedy sub-genre (right up there with "Fido" and "Shaun of the Dead" in my book). Also, having recently re-watched "Shaun of the Dead", it seems the "zom-com" has found the long way home. For just as 'Shaun of the Dead' is a clever, very British send up of the American George Romero dead movies, "Zombieland" is a clever, full-bore, 'ugly American' cousin to 'Shaun of the Dead!' And like the most gaudy amusement parks, it is also a hell of a lot of fun! Well worth the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another finger-lickin' good entry in the zomedy genre...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..."Zombieland" isn't quite the masterpiece that its current IMDb rating would seem to indicate, but nonetheless earns its place alongside genre entries like "Shaun of the Dead," "Fido," and even hoary old classics like "Return of the Living Dead" and "Dead Alive." Written and produced by a reasonably experienced writer/producer team, "Zombieland" features a serviceable, if not terribly original, script that succeeds primarily on the strength of decent ensemble acting and strong production values. Much like Zack Snyder's reworking of "Dawn of the Dead," the best part of "Zombieland" is the opening sequence, a lovely, kinetic intro that sets the extremely comic-booky tone of the film.The leads handle their (mostly) stereotypical roles well; Jesse "Cursed" Eisenberg riffs on his well-established Jewish nerd persona, and likewise, Woody "Cheers" Harrelson does his shtick. Emma "The House Bunny" Stone and Abigail "Signs" Breslin play our nebbish leads' faux antagonists with aplomb, despite the lack of much to work with character-wise. It's mostly the production design by Maher "The Guardian" Ahmad and camera-work by Michael "Cloverfield" Bonvillain that carries things along with sass and vinegar. Ruben Fleischer's debut feature direction is competent, if unshowy; there's really only so much one can do with a relatively pedestrian script.The ratings on this one are going to drop considerably once it reaches home video (with its older, more sophisticated--and jaded--audience) and wider international distribution. "Zombieland" is sufficiently entertaining, but a far cry from a Top 250 film, or even a Top 500 or Top 1000. Zombie fans will not be overly impressed, since the "zombies" are pretty much "28 Days/Weeks Later" viral infection victims and not the undead; head shots are not required. Nebbish comedy fans will have to deal with the extraneous gore, and road movie fans will have to endure the film's general lack of significant characterization and thematic content.All that said, "Zombieland" is still fun. Just don't be fooled by its current lauding here on the IMDb. Instead, simply let this one whet your appetite for the eventual release of "World War Z," which will (hopefully) make you forget all about "Zombieland."Edit: Had a second look at this one on DVD, and stand by the above comments. It seems obvious to me that younger viewers than myself are easily impressed, apparently by slo-mo spewing of bodily fluids, bouncing of zombie breasts, and TV-grade one-liners. Again, this one is more than worth a watch--it's far from bad--but don't expect to be cranking this one through the visual cortex on a regular basis; there's just not enough meat on "Zombieland"'s bones to provide more than a snack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see for any zombie fans out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its the zombie apocalypse, the streets are deserted, buildings are destroyed, and everyone except a small group of survivors are flesh eating monsters.This is hardly a new concept in the horror genre, having been done over and over and over, can Zombieland be more than another tired, clichéd zombie flick? Definitely. With likable characters, witty dialogue, and tons of zombie killing action, Zombieland makes it to my top 10 list of favorite zombie comedies.One of the best things about this movie is the characters, Colombus (Eisenberg) is a nervous, socially awkward teenager who survived the zombie apocalypse by following his own set of "rules". While Talahassse (Harrelson) plays the exact opposite; a zombie killing badass who doesn't follow any rules. Along the way they meet two young girls Little Rock and Witchita (Stone), who are on a quest to get to Pacific Playland, a theme park that is supposedly zombie free.While the dialogue between these characters is very natural and funny, it can become a bit tiresome as a large portion of the movie shifts away from the zombies and focuses on them instead, this is in my opinion, one of the movies only flaws.The zombies themselves are very scary looking, and although they are absent for a somewhat large portion of the film, the climax more than makes up for it with nonstop zombie killing awesomeness. (A note to zombie purists, the zombies in the film aren't actually true zombies, more like 28 days later infected people)Overall, this film is a fresh, funny zombie comedy that can be ranked up with the likes of Shaun of The Dead, and Return of the Living dead. While it does suffer a few minor flaws, it still is a must see for any zombie movie, horror, or comedy fans. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To survive in this land you must follow the rules!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, is it just me or of all the genres in horror is the zombie movie the one that makes the best comedy. Not only do you have this gem you also have "Shaun of Dead", "Dead Alive", "Return of the Living Dead" one and two, "Reanimator", "The Undead", and many more. This one is a nice little zombie comedy that is more comedy than horror by leaps and bounds as there are lots of scenes where the zombies are not seen for long stretches. Almost all the zombie munching comes right at the beginning of the film as the lead guy code named Columbus goes over the rules that have kept him alive so far and shows what happens to those who do not follow them. Then the next stretch where there is a lot of zombie action is the end which is still not quite horror, but is tense enough at times to make for a good action sequence with still just a little touch of comedy to make it perfect. The film basically follows this young man as he meets another calling himself "Tallahasee" as everyone they meet go by where they are from rather than their name. They are just trying to survive, perhaps with destinations on their mind or perhaps nothing more than trying to find a Twinkie. The story is simple, but very effective, be prepared for a very funny cameo appearance. The acting is great, but then I always enjoyed seeing Woody Harrelson from his Cheers days so it was nice seeing him in this role. The other cast members are great too. The film does not over stay its welcome, nor does it run time feel to short. Great movie, good gore effects and very funny comedy, why oh why do zombies make me laugh so?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zombies never learn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is exactly what it sounds like. Zombies are everywhere and they are hungry. In his feature film debut, director Ruben Fleischer presents an Americanized version of Shaun of the Dead, only this is more about the zombie killing. It stars of Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus. He plays one of the few remaining non-zombie humans left. He is methodical in his survival tactics and rarely takes chances. When he decides to head out of Texas and towards his hometown in Ohio, he encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a Twinkie loving, zombie killing fanatic. The two team up and head on out of Texas.Along the way they run into more zombies and more non-zombies, including Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin). These presumably innocent little girls will stop at nothing to survive. They give Columbus and Tallahassee more than they bargained for.The theme of the film, like almost every zombie/post apocalyptic story, is survival. The characters don't give their real names, only their home towns for fear that they might become too attached to another person. Loneliness is part of the life when trying to survive a zombie epidemic, but having someone to talk to doesn't hurt, just as long as you're okay with killing them should they become infected. I though Shaun of the Dead dealt with this more than Zombieland did.Dealing with a zombie infestation means that you will more than likely have to kill someone. There is plenty of that here. The blood and gore is more on the comic side of the spectrum. It's over the top, very red, and not discreet whatsoever. It's cartoonish at times and never really grosses you out, unless that kind of stuff really bothers you, but I think for the most part the humor and the story will overlook it.For a movie about zombies this is a pretty smart film. There is a lot of physical humor, i.e. killing zombies, but it is wrapped up with funny dialogue and outlandish situations. Harrelson in particular is right on target here. Even Eisenberg does a good job. He is a more emotional Michael Cera, which is a good thing. There is a cameo by one of my favorite comedians, but I won't say who for fear of taking away from the surprise. Needless to say, I was in hysterics.I was surprised how invested I became with the characters. I knew this was a completely ridiculous plot and that zombies aren't real (at least this kind) so I expected just to go along for the ride. The characters are very well drawn out, each with a distinctive personality and back story. It made the film a little more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Poor old Zombieland. It is always going to be the second zombie comedy and, to that extent, it's always going to be in the shadow of Shaun Of The Dead, but that doesn't mean it's inferior, because it isn't. It is, however, very American in contrast to Shaun's extreme Englishness.There is little in the way of story, but a fair amount in terms of character work. And all the characters are likable notwithstanding their substantial flaws. The humour, of which there is plenty, flows naturally from the characters and their situation, and the splatter effects are fine (these, by the way, are the modern, new, go-faster zombies, not the old stumbling around type).All four main characters are well played, with Woody Harrelson enjoying the opportunity to play broad. Jesse Eisenberg seems born to play everynerds, although I find his resemblance to British stand-up comedian Alan Davis somewhat distracting. I am very taken with Emma Stone - having seen her now in The House Bunny, The Rocker and now this, each time she has done well with very different characters. And I think Abigail Breslin is going to have a very effective transition to grown-up actress.This movie entertained me solidly all the way through and I recommend it.</fullReview>

In an industry where mundane horror films are being spat out of the money making machine Halloween after Halloween after Halloween, this comes as a completely refreshing zombie movie. A very funny reflection on America. It is original and delicious from beginning to end. The cast were perfectly chosen, making the film even cooler than it would've been anyway, - had the film makers chosen a more dire cast the plot alone would've been able to make the film average. Eisenberg is especially superb, adding comedic sweetness to a surprisingly gory film (given its 15 rating.) Not at all predictable, the film is definitely worth seeing. My only small criticism is that the subplot between Tallahasse and son could've been brought in to the film a bit more which would have brought even more depth to his character. Otherwise brilliant development between all characters.Summary: The most awesome action sequences I have seen in a long time. Incredibly cool. Eisenberg is one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies of this generation, and movies of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>F*****g awesome intro!!!. Amazing characters, fairly simple but FUN plot. Bill Murray shows up in it, and it's a funny scene after scene with him.So where to begin the praise and envy I have for this movie? I really don't know because the movie is goddamn good. It's such a feel good movie that you just wanna see it again and again. I know I'm getting this for blue-ray when it comes out. I never felt so good after watching this movie. I literally walked out happy and full of life, it made me want to play fallout 3 on ps3, going on a killing spree shooting every feral ghoul I could find, like Tallahasse.When I first saw the trailer, I knew it was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be as good as I think it is now. I'm sorry if I keep repeating myself, but this movie is just what the movie industry needs. This is like the American sequel to Shaun of the Dead, which was an awesome movie as well, but Zombieland is much better.It was slapstick humour, but VERY GOOD slapstick humour. That's what I call comedy. Glad this movie made the IMDb top 250, I think it deserves to be in the top 20 though, a spot under The Hangover. The narration by the lead actor was great, the character's personality is what you'd expect from today's kid. Not that it's a bad thing, I love keeping myself isolated so I can enjoy playing my video-games.Woody Harleson was so great in this film, I personally think this is his best movie, ever. I know, people will argue that Natural Born Killers was his best. It was, until I saw this movie. And I never was that much of a fan of his. I always thought he was a weird guy in real life, but this character really suits him. The zombie-killing redneck who has nothing to lose because the very same thing that made zombieland killed his son, his only innocence in life. He was a devoted father, who after seeing his son die, became a devoted redneck killing machine.It's great how this movie combines every human emotion at the right parts. Because the irony of it is that human life is great, what would the world be without humans ans just mindless zombies? I recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humour and people who are laid back and not up-stuck liberals. You probably shouldn't go with your kid to the movie, you should let him/her go by themselves. I'd probably recommend this movie to virtually anyone.And finally, the bonus ending was LOL! Nonetheless, after watching this movie and walking out, you'll feel really good, you'll feel all types of good emotions. You're happy you spent money on this movie, you probably want to buy it on DVD or blue-ray, and/or you will see it again with someone who hasn't just because it's so good. This was truly the best 90 minutes of my life I've ever had. I hope this gets the cult classic title, and I think it will. A lot of people will remember this movie 10-20 years down the road, and we'll probably pop it in your video player or whatever technology exists out there in the future. This is the feel good movie of 2009, and I'd say it's in my top 5 movies of 2009, I hope this wins an Oscar, but it won't since Oscars are saved for Oscar bait movies like the reader and the curious case of Benjamin button. GO SEE IT, IF YOU DON'T....YOU HAVE NOT LIVED.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain spoilers.Just got back from seeing this with my 14 year old son. We both thoroughly enjoyed this movie which was a whole lot o' fun! Scares me a little that I didn't find it all that gory, from the opening scene on. :-) All but six of us left the theater before the credits finished rolling, so we got a treat at the very end.Lots of good lines doled out by Harrelson and Eisenberg, who played off each other very convincingly.I'll probably rent it when it comes out on DVD, because I can only imagine the outtakes from the scenes with Murray and Harrelson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best zombie movie that has been made in years. In my opinion, even better than Shaun of the Dead. See it. Giving a synopsis of this movie, just might ruin it for many. If you've seen the preview, that's enough. Go see it. Okay. One guy is a paranoid, hypochondriac, and the other, just wants his favorite sweet treat, a Twinkie. Then there are the two sisters. Personally, I didn't really care for their characters, but they do grow on you. The rules that the paranoid lives by, are rules that every zombie fan needs to know. Your survival in Zombieland depends on the rules. The best part of the movie, really is the cameo by a famous star. If you've already seen it, don't tell anyone who it is. Just tell then to go see the movie. With any luck, there will be another Zombieland movie. We need more care free, kill'em all zombie movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Columbus is a big wuss -- but when you're afraid of being eaten by zombies, fear can keep you alive. Tallahassee is an AK-toting, zombie-slaying' bad ass whose single determination is to get the last Twinkie on earth. As they join forces with Wichita and Little Rock, who have also found unique ways to survive the zombie mayhem, they will have to determine which is worse: relying on each other or succumbing to the zombies.For this review, I'll refrain from comparing ZOMBIELAND with SHAUN OF THE DEAD, even though I probably will in the course of writing it. To start things off, ZOMBIELAND has one of the most beautiful opening credits scene in movie history. In fact, it's reminiscent of one I saw in WATCHMEN months earlier. But let's get to the point, much like the movie, which runs at a scant 80 minutes: ZOMBIELAND is one of those laugh-per-minute movies in which most of the jokes thrown on the screen work because they are clever and witty.It's also not one of those movies in which survivors are looking for a cure or loved ones. In fact, there's not much of a story structure in here. Just think of it as a road trip movie that happens to take place in a world filled with zombies and that's part of the fun in this movie. It's about a group of people who, at first, don't trust each other but slowly, and surely, start to grow on one another. This adds humanity to the movie. At one point, one of the characters call ANACONDA an R rated movie when it's really rated PG-13. This shows that everybody makes mistakes and aren't perfect.As funny the movie is, there's also a sweet and an endearing side to it. One such character we come to love the first minute we see him is played by Jesse Eisenberg, whom many will compare to Michael Cera, although Eisenberg has appeared in movies before Cera, including CURSED by Wes Craven. Along with him, the rest of the cast really make the movie have a higher standard than most in this genre. Woody Harrelson is just perfect for the role, having some great one-liners too. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin also do a great job. There's also one great, hilarious cameo in here which I dare not spoil. You will have to see it for yourself.Although the zombie genre may seem dead, movies like ZOMBIELAND give it a reason to stay. The movie is very funny but also has a sweet side to it. The movie has it's touching moments along with some zombie action, especially towards the end. Oh, and if you're worried about the short running time, don't worry about it. The movie felt longer than that. Watch it if you're a fan of the zombie genre. If you're not, I still think it's worth the watch. Oh, and I've managed to not compare this film with SHAUN OF THE DEAD!</fullReview>

I was laughing, had tears in my eyes, laughed some more, and about jumped out of my skin on quite a few parts.Zombie movies are so few and far between, well, good zombie movies, that it's exciting when a good one comes along.The humor in the movie is actually funny, the action is fantastic, and it's just an all around fun movie to see.The actors are fantastic.

		<shortDescription>This Zomedy has real heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I can understand how some of you horror buffs who didn't see the trailer might be disappointed by the lack of said thrills in this genre bending flick. And its true one of its movie posters does feature prominently two shotguns, a shovel and a bloody chain saw but just because a movie has zombie in its title doesn't mean it's a supposed to be scary. Now get over it and enjoy the little surprises in life because this movie is frigin hilarious! Zombieland is a very cleverly written very well directed teen action comedy set in post zombie flu apocalypse. And as a "zomedy" it joins the hollowed ranks of at least two other films I can think of. Fido and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. OK, OK so you probably haven't seen either. Fido is a terrificly funny inde about keeping zombies as servants with an inevitable working class revolt. And Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is about... well... killer tomatoes. Which I know are too round and too red for zombies. But they both combine cannibalism with comedy in a sweet ketchupy stew and so will help you understand the genius of zomedies. Which is that with a zomedy you can have all of the gory kills and hardly any of the "why am I watching this" guilty shrills. All while laughing your butt off. And yes, you might also compare it with Shaun of the Dead. But, thats more of a scary zomedy. Or "dark zomedy". In fact if you were to compare it with an Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg film, Hot Fuzz is closest in style. Both are fast paced thrill rides full of laughs, kick ass slow motion sequences, gallons of fake blood and a surprising amounts of genuine character development. Just substitute walking dead for all the crazy village people in Hot Fuzz and its a true zomedy as well. Then again maybe that makes Zombieland just a hilarious action comedy with zombies. Either way Zombieland its a Purell fresh, Twinky powered road trip through a very funny zombie hell. Now ball up or shut up and enjoy the movie for what it is.Oh and it's true it also has the best celebrity cameo since Bob Barker kicked the sand trap out of Adam Sandler in Happy Gilomore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>zombies, thrill rides, and a killer cameo - and that's just the gravy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at an advanced screening as a reward for dressing up like a zombie and showing up ready to chow down on some medium-rare brain steaks. The experience was a blast. As for the movie.....I haven't seen anything else with Jesse Eisenberg before but I have to say he was perfect in this movie. And Woody Harrelson... come on, Woody playing the most bad-ass zombie killer ever. Need I say more? I won't spoil any of the awesome moments. I won't tell you who shows up for one of the best cameos ever. Or the clever visual comedic elements. And I won't give and overly long review just because I loved this movie.The fact is if you like comedy at all, or if can enjoy the little things like cannibalism and gun powder, if you like good performances or can understand the temptation to brush a beautiful girl's hair back over her ear this movie is for you.And that's it - Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What every comedy these days should look at for inspiration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before my review, me let just get it out of the waySHAUN OF THE DEADThere I said it, because frankly, every review I have read so far about Zombieland has to have a reference to Shaun of the Dead somehow.Many do compare this movie to Shaun of the Dead. And while the two movies share the same theme of zombies and comedy, they take the idea of the zombie genre very, very, VERY differently.This movie starts out with Columbus, played by Jesse Eisenburg, who is afraid of everything and is pretty much a wimp. Frankly, being in a zombie infested world is still not a good enough reason for Jesse Eisenburg to grow a pair in a movie. Colombus is trying to get back hometown, but then comes across Tallahassee, played by Woody Harleson, who is the very opposite of Columbus. He is not afraid to kill zombies with whatever he has on him whether it is a bat, gun, clippers, or a banjo. The two then comes across Little Rock and Wichita, two girls who have survived the zombie apocalypse not just because of their gun-ho nature, but because of trickery and deceitfulness. And at that point, the rest of the movies is just zombie slaughter after zombie slaughter.FYI, the reason for their weird names is because their name is the location that each person is planning to go to get away from the zombies.The movie is just hilarious and always have quick jokes throughout that do not drag on like most comedies do in their movies. And with Eisenburg narrating the story, it is even funnier. Woody Harleson is the funniest of them all. Even with the scenes without him, the film is funny but when Harleson is in a scene, it just becomes better. And Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin playing the two girls were also really good.What this movie did that really made me proud of this movie was that they actually created a zombie film. With many movies out there that poke fun at things, they often forget the things they are poking at. In this movie, they wrote a movie about zombies and then added comedy to it, so now you can appreciate it not just as a comedy, but also as a zombie movie as well.This movie is definitely not for the weak of heart because like most zombie movies, it does have it's share of blood, gore, and graphic images, all of which I thought were cool, well-caught on camera, and realistic. And I also really liked how they supplemented the zombie slaughtering with metal music. It really fit in well.And if you have seen Shaun of the Dead, do not think that you will watch it again when watching this movie because like I said before, they are different. Zombieland had awesome action sequences while Shaun of the Dead stuck to a more slower pace. Plus, Shaun of the Dead's setting was before the zombie apocalypse, while Zombieland took place during the zombie apocalypse. And for Zombieland, the whole movie was dedicated to zombies while Shaun of the Dead also stuck in some romantic comedy sub-plots.This movie is a well-crafted film that has everything you want in horror comedies. Bloody violence, laughter, and more bloody violence after that. There is nothing in this movie that I could find wrong in it and hopefully you will not either.4.5/5P.S: This movie probably contains one of the best cameos that I have seen this year and in a long time. It was funny and well-executed. You would never guess who it is. You just would never guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have 3 words for this movie: BEST CAMEO EVER! This movie was very very well done with just the right mix of gore, plot and humor. To build a zombie movie strictly on a foundation of drama and horror is to invite disaster. Sure there have been movies to do that well, The original Night of the Living Dead, for example, 28 Days, and even I am Legend. But more times than not if taken too seriously, a zombie movie without an element of humor just tends to be grim and joyless and just not much fun to watch. Zombieland was just a great film that was infinitely enjoyable on multiple levels! One of the things I found most interesting was the lack of back story given in the setup. The country is overrun by zombies with very few survivors, yet the electric, gas and water still work. We are given a brief history of the outbreak and aftermath but besides that, very little further information. I suppose it is just a given with the movie makers that the major utilities are on autopilot and will simply continue to run until any vital machinery gives out. It is not a bad supposition, and makes for a more colorful and visually exciting world, but it does strain credibility somewhat. Aside from that minor detail, everything else was as nearly perfect as it can be for a film such as this. The casting was brilliant! Woody Harrelson was simply perfect as the efficient and effective zombie killer. Jesse Eisenberg was a great in his role as his nebbish traveling companion...though at times his mannerisms were reminiscent of other actors whose stock in trade are similar. By that I mean that you could have dropped Michael Cera or Topher Grace (as Eric Foreman) into the role as "Columbus" and it would have been a seamless replacement. This isn't a bad thing, but rather a bit predictable. OK, to sum up: Fantastic movie that was just fun to watch. One of the first movies that I didn't adjourn to the parking lot to have a smoke at some point...and that is high praise. Usually you can see a dull spot or lull in the story from a mile away and can therefore pick a spot to have a smoke without missing anything vital. With this movie, I didn't find anywhere that I felt I could take that quick smoke break. I knew that the pacing of the film was such that as soon as a slow point did appear, it was going to be here and gone just THAT quickly. Again...not to spoil is for anyone, but, BEST CAMEO EVER! and that is all I shall say. When you see the movie, you will know of whom I speak.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombieland somehow managed to breathe life into an aspect of horror I thought dried up along with George A. Romero's career and that's zombies. What started out as a fairly fresh idea has been milked dry with every situation going in every possibly way you could think of. You know Zombieland is going to be a bit different as soon as the movie begins. Columbus does a rundown of some of the most important rules he's learned while living in Zombieland leading up to the credits playing over slow-motion scenes of people being chased and eaten by zombies with "For Whom the Bell Tolls" by Metallica playing the entire time. The cinematography and the way the characters on screen interact with the letters in the opening credits is incredible. Blood splattering on the screen, glass shattering, and the way everything seems to be jumping out at you. To be honest, it's probably one of my favorite openings to any film ever.Jesse Eisenberg's character Columbus immediately made me think of Michael Cera when I first saw the trailer. It's a role that's so similar to the roles he's played in the past and I found it kinda funny that a new trailer of Cera's was attached to this film. After that first reaction though, it didn't really bother me. In fact, the entire cast does an incredible job with the roles they play. Woody Harrelson is fantastic and steals a good portion of scenes as Tallahassee. With everything else going on, Tallahassee is on this quest to find a Twinkie and it's pretty hilarious watching him lose it whenever he can't find them. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin as Wichita and Little Rock add more to the film when they're acting as a sisterly team rather than when they have scenes separately later on. Their cons are pretty spectacular and priceless in execution.One of the most interesting factors of the film was something that made its way online two weeks before the film was even released. Zombieland originally started as a TV pilot. Before the cast we're familiar with now was set, Patrick Swayze was going to cameo as a zombie and there were several moments paying homage to Ghost that just sounded amazing and comical. They actually had several people in mind to cameo in the film. The actor they wound up going with is wonderful in their own right, gets plenty of screen time, and manages to steal quite a few laughs, but the Patrick Swayze zombie would've been just as good if not a bit better considering the circumstances.The finale of the film that takes place in an amusement park is one of the best closing sequences to a zombie film ever. It's surprising no other zombie film has gone that route. The way the rides and carnival attractions are incorporated into zombie execution is marvelous in itself.Zombieland is witty horror entertainment with a great cast and clever cinematography. A roller coaster ride you immediately want to ride again as soon as its over. What's surprising is it might just wind up being the best all around horror film to come out this year. As the tagline says, I strongly urge each and every one of you to "nut up or shut up."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went with my fiancée to see this, and from the opening scene it was a bang-bang kind of film, action from one scene to the next, but with enough humor to take the gruesome edge off. Plenty - I mean *plenty* - of gore and laughs to boot. Those who have a weak stomach might think twice about Zombieland. Even I squirmed during some of the more intense violence. And this is the new wave of zombie. Forget the slow meandering living corpses with outstretched arms, moaning and groaning. They kick, scream, run, yell, jump and hoot -n- holler their way to feast. I enjoy the honest spin, how the protagonist gives the true low- down on survival skills. Much of what he shared had me nodding in agreement. The producers take the road less-traveled to give an honest approach of how to cope with zombie life, as though they sensed the frustration of audience members who wind up screaming in frustration at how stupid main characters tend to deal with dead people. Near the end of the film I had to knock a point off for a small dose of stupidity (in my mind) with the main character who paused a while. I felt like kicking him in the britches. But the plot twists and terrific spin by the climax had me sold completely. All in all, it was well worth the price of admission, plus a bucket of popcorn and soda! Just do yourself a favor: Wait past the end of the credits, okay? I had a feeling with such comedians that there had to be an end scene. That isn't a spoiler cos I'm not telling you what it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Zombie film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is PURE ADRENALIE! Simple as that. I expected a horror/comedy along the lines of Shhaun of the Dead, and that is exactly what I got, but better. The screenplay is clever, very clever. It has a lot of jokes here an there, and gags also, and it is a great screenplay, whether horror or not. The characters of Columbus and Tallahassee are written with incredible wit and depth, and you cannot wait until one of them starts talking again. Jesse Eisenberg gave a very good performance and really made us feel for his character, and because of him, I loved the film as much as I did. Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin were solid, and were also a lot of fun to watch. The zombies are wicked! The film has some of the best opening credits, and the cameo by Bill Murray was great. It was hilarious, and I was surprised how much I liked this film, but not only for the zombies, but for the comedy and characters. Overall, this is a film with strong writing, accomplished directing, and very good acting and characters, no matter the genre. I am pleased to say, this is the best zombie film I have ever seen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really fun if you go in expecting a fluffy zombie flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, right off the bat, that I went in expecting a gore-filled black comedy - and I was disappointed. What we have here is a light, comedic, mildly violent romp through, what the incredibly charming Jessie Eisenburg calls, Zombieland - and if you go in expecting that, you will really love this movie.Zombieland is a silly flick at heart... thinks it wants to be a teen romance flick... and is a little confused whether it also wants to be a horror movie as well. Columbus, (Eisenburg, channeling Micheal Sera... and is a lot more charming than Sera could ever be), wants to get to, well, Columbus, and Tallahassee, (Harrelson playing a mix between Peter Griffin and Snake Plisskin), wants a twinkie. They kill zombies in silly ways. They meet some girls that are also silly. They have a silly run-in with a pretty awesome celebrity. They have a silly time in an amusement park. Sure, it's a silly movie. However, it's not incredibly crass, not over-the-top, and it knows exactly what it is, which is a silly movie with zombies here and there. With all this silliness going on, they (strangely enough) also find time to be kinda dramatic in a few scenes, and downright touching in others. However, what this movie is not is scary. You may find yourself jumping at MAYBE one or two scenes... but I doubt it. If you expect a fun little zombie movie with that girl from Little Miss Sunshine, the guy from Natural Born Killers, that kid from AdventureLand, (who apparently likes making movies with the name "land" in the title about amusement parks... plus, is INCREDIBLY cute), and some girl that I'm sure has been in other things, then you'll enjoy yourself. Please go in expecting that, because you'll be bored otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so i went into zombie land figuring on watching a decent zombie spoofish type movie and a movie like that its best too go in with low expectations because its very easy for a movie too try too "Be" funny and just fail miserably. This on the other hand managed too mix the perfect concoction of humor and gore.Casting in this movie couldn't be any better gore looked fantastic and oh the movie itself the humor couldn't be better timed.This is the first movie I clapped out loud at all well dying laughing.I would also like too make a special note too Woody's performance he is more excellent then the rest who are also excellent he is just a hair better then the rest. None the less This was one of the best theater experiences in a long while and I cant imagine how anyone couldn't have a fun time watching this. So....... Go see it would ya!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im a horror geek. I will watch any horror movie from anywhere by anyone. Now with that said ZL is a movie that lacks potential &amp; constantly wants to remind you that it is very hip &amp; oh so cool. Everyone knows that just because you act cool doesn't mean you actually are right?!?! Maybe im burned out on zombie movies maybe my recent disappointment towards a certain Mr.Zombie &amp; his most recent cinematic adventure left me cold or maybe both. I don't know. The premise of ZL is simple a rampant infection turns everyone into zombies the world ends a zero meets a hero hahas &amp; violence ensue. Good news Mandy Lane &amp; Bill Murray are in it. Bad news Abigail Breslin &amp; Jesse Eisenberg are too. Btw which came first the Eisenberg or the Cera? Ahh who cares they both suck. Oh yeah Woody Harrelsons in it too.Ka Ching!!! Hope that worked out for you. Every joke fell flat. Every action sequence was anti climatic. There's no chemistry between the actors. Hey guess what you can polish a turd. Bottom line is what you see in the trailers is pretty much all you get. Next!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Twinkie! My Zombie Kingdom for a TWINKIE !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zombieland" superficially looks another umpteenth zombie-comedy, and that's definitely not a good first impression because we have literally been served dozens of these since the release of "Shaun of the Dead" and even the most hardened horror buffs are slowly beginning to disregard them. However, this is one zombie movie that has to be seen by both genre fanatics as well as by people who are merely interested in a good hour and a half of laughs, ingenuity and cheerful acting performances. "Zombieland" is a seemingly unpretentious and straightforward mainstream horror movie, but it's actually a lot more intelligent than it looks. For starters, Ruben Fleischer's film slyly evades the whole set-up and origin of the zombie plague. The United States of America have turned into Zombieland in barely two months and that's just the way it is. All the slow and stupid people have died and lead character Columbus only briefly refers to the virus that caused all this death and destruction, but apart from that the film only focuses on here and now. Survival is the only thing that counts. To remain alive, the lone and nerdy teenager Columbus ? named after his hometown ? composed a simple list of essential Zombieland rules. These particular list of rules, which is regularly referred to, is another very intelligent an vital element of the script. The rules practically summarize the essence of zombie horror cinema! The include simple and obvious tips like aim for the brain and always check the backseat prior to getting in a car, but these are things that everyone already yelled to other films in an annoyed tone of voice, because people keep making the same stupid mistakes. Columbus first teams up with the macho cowboy Tallahassee, who seems more interested in finding a Twinkie than in surviving the zombie mayhem, and subsequently the deceptive sisters Wichita and Little Rock who steal their car ? twice. Although the general conception in Zombieland is that you're better of alone, the four versatile survivors travel together and develop a peculiar friendship. The third really smart thing about "Zombieland" is that it contains quite a few effective and beautiful metaphors about things like friendship, sacrifice, puppy love and even humanity. The diversification of characters results in a lot of terrific dialogs and downright hilarious situations. Columbus is an anxious and phobic nerd whereas his partner Tallahassee (glorious role for Woody Harrelson) is a trigger-happy hillbilly who finally found a purpose in life: killing zombies. There are numerous great sequences, including adrenalin-rushing opening credits to the sound of Metallica's "For whom the Bell Tolls", a cameo of a fantastic Hollywood star as himself and a brilliant finale in a Californian amusement park. The film isn't too gory (ideally accessible for larger audiences, in other words) but the make-up effects on the zombies are splendid and occasionally quite scary (the clown zombie!). The film may perhaps have been inspired by the aforementioned "Shaun of the Dead", but it's a soon-to-be-classic by itself. It's the most entertaining and feel-good horror film of the year!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOT Worth All The Fanfare, But A Decent Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always leery of movies that come with a lot of hoopla and grandstanding. Rarely do they ever live up to my expectations.I wanted to see this movie though and went in with an open mind and low expectations. Saves disappointment later if I don't expect much and the movie turns out to stink.Hollywood/Big Budget/Non-Indie movies being crapped out by Hollywood are just that, crap and the quality of big budget movies has gotten worse and worse...almost to the point that I will watch nothing but Indie movies now.So when a big budget Hollywood movie has such fanfare, budget and all the goodies Indie movie makers only wish in their wildest dreams they could get their hands on, it better be worth my $7.While not really worth the money I paid to see it, it was a halfway decent movie and a lot of fun.The world has ended thanks to a plague and nearly everyone has become zombies. A few have escaped the nastiness and one of them would be Columbus, who keeps a checklist of things to keep him alive.I do have to say that how the checklist is sneaked in here and there in the movie, when one of Columbus' "checks" have been made, is really cool.Anyway, he decides to take off to Columbus, Ohio to find what may or may not be left of his family and on the way there he meets Tallahassee, played the way only Woody Harrelson could have played this part. He actually made the movie and being as I am NOT a fan of his...that says a lot coming from me.Tallahassee is headed for, you guessed it, Florida and insists that no first names be used in identifying themselves because then you get too close to people and that just makes it harder later if they die, turn to zombies, etc.Makes sense. Along the way they meet two scheming and detestable young women, Wichita, the older sister and Little Rock, the younger sister.On a side note, I just have to say, if the point of having them in the movie was to make me hate them...it worked. They are perfect scam artist cons and I'd have fed them to the first zombie I could find.And so with the four of them teaming up to survive, the journey begins to find a place where there are no zombies.This movie has its funny parts. It's campy, silly and at times, stupid, but it is worth going to see if you can get in for cheap.Just don't expect a thinking man's zombie movie, don't try to make it have deeper meaning or in any other way attempt to psychoanalyze this movie.Just go see it for what it is...a silly and at times, smile/laugh inducing movie and I think you'll be delightfully surprised at how fun it can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Funny horror movie???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow The birth of a new movie category - was it spoof, horror or a comedy? All I know was it was brutal and graphic and fun at the same time. I some people with kids and maybe its a sign that the times they are a changing or maybe the parents saw the made for TV trailer and said oh this looks like a great family film!? Ah no... Not unless your raising Charlie Manson II. As I said its pretty graphic, they do a great job making the zombie people being killed really look like they are being killed and they swear a lot and I do mean a lot! Now that being said you were warned and trust me, I normally laugh during Horror movies anyway, but at least in this one I supposed to. I saw the trailers and figured it may be OK like Shaun of the dead, but this one wasn't even in the same category. The acting was a great job by all the actors but a huge round of applause for Woody, Woody was top notch.Worth a watch on the big screen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally, I thought that Zombieland was a useless pile of drivel ? (and I'm being nice about it when I say that) ? Basically, it's a film that failed on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start ... so, I'm not going to even bother ? It's a "comedy" about rampaging zombies taking over and our four "heroes" trying to keep out of their clutches ? and quite frankly it would have been better for all concerned if the zombies had finished off these four characters in the first act ? Apart from a fairly comical cameo by Bill Murray (as himself) ? the rest of the film has no redeeming features to speak of ? This is definitely NOT a film that you see twice ? or can recommend ? unfortunately, my main regret is that I got to see it even once ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A teen comedy disguised as a "zombie" movie that has more bore and snore than gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland is a mediocre movie filled with flat humor and dialog that sounds as if it was written by an 8th grader. The only thing that saves this movie from being a straight out stinker is Woody Harrelson but other than that it's just a dud. I didn't care for the protagonist, the so called "zombies", the silly "rules" or the two female characters. They're so annoying that I was wishing that the infected would kill them. The filmmakers tried too hard to be funny and when that happens it always end up pear shaped. I was expecting something entertaining, maybe in the vein of Brain-Dead or Shaun of the Dead. Perhaps I was asking too much. I have seen DTV movies that work a lot better than this. I just wasn't buying into anything the director was selling. The movie didn't work as either a horror film or a comedy.The dialog was bad. I mean an adolescent must have wrote it. I didn't care for the pop culture references and the "hipness" of it. The overuse of movie titles, rehashing dumb clichés and the forcefulness of the situations was too clunky for me. The movie was obviously aimed for the late teen crowd because they're the only ones who will buy into this mediocre film and will think it's "cool". Real fans of zombie movies will not be amused by it. What I really can't stand are the "zombies". These are not the classic kind but the ones from Demons or 28 Days Later. They can run (I guess being infected gives you superhuman endurance and speed) and leap obstacles in a single bound.The direction was flat. I didn't like the way the scenes flowed or the way the action moved along. One minutes it's like a music video and the next it plods around slooowly.... The big action set pieces seem like a pastiche of action movies. I know logic has no place in a horror movie but Wichita gets off like two dozen rounds out of her shotgun but doesn't reload once and when she's in a real pinch, she's OUT of shells. Another scene that sticks out is when Tallahassee is shooting through the grate that surrounds that carny stand. There is no way he can shoot out through it without killing or severely maiming himself.Last but not least is the big "cameo". It's no surprise if you have seen the credit list. Bill Murray playing himself hiding out in his "mansion" out in Beverly Hills. Bill hasn't had a hit in years and I doubt he's still living the life (maybe the "high" life) like the way he did during his heyday in the 80's. He appears "wearing" zombie makeup and blending in with the rest of the dead. But truth be told if you read the celebrity blogs, he looks like that after hanging out at one frat party too many (that's another story). He really does play himself, hung over and shuffling around in a daze.Overall, I wouldn't pay to watch this movie. Maybe when it hits CineMax in a few months or when you can rent it for a dollar at RedBox. If you love Shaun of the Dead (Yes I am comparing it to this movie because that's how the studio is marketing it) then you will not care for this one. But if you love the teen comedy crap that Hollywood seems to be churning out then you'll definitely want to see it. Light on gore but heavy on bore and snore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does Zombieland deliver? Yes and No... more no than yes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a fan of the undead since I was 6 I pretty much am a sucker for anything zombie. hell, I have even played one in Land of the Dead, and made two of my own low budget zombie films.After seeing the trailers for Zombieland I thought, this looks like it will be a good movie, and the word of mouth just made it sound better and better so i was excited to see it today.I headed to work early so I could leave in time to catch an early matinée, I was psyched, got my ticket, my popcorn, and drink. Found my seat and settled in, but when it was all over I wasn't sure what i really thought of Zombieland.So, After letting it simmer for a few hours. here is what i think. You will walk away feeling a bit unsatisfied, but your not going to complain you spent $10.00 on it. The best analogy I can give is your thinking you're gonna have this great orgasm and in the end it just didn't happen. You blow your load, but you're not sure if you want seconds or not.The Murray cameo is easily the best part of the flick, and the film has a moral to its story, but it just didn't deliver in the way the trailers make it out too.Final grade - 7.0 out of 10</fullReview>

Emma Stone is hot.The bad: The lead guys.The ugly: The plot decays over the film's length and finally dies in the third act, which depends on the characters doing incredibly stupid anti-survivalist things. It's as if you're running away from zombies and suddenly stop for a smoke.How the hell can anyone rate this above Shaun of the Dead is beyond me. You gotta scratch your head when this film shares a coveted space amongst the likes of Aliens, The Thing, and The Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Zombie Movie, Ho Hum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland (R, 1:27) ? Other: Comedy, 3rd string, formulaAnother zombie movie, ho hum. It's also supposed to double as a comedy, except for not having any funny parts.As far as they can tell, the last 4 not-undead people on Earth, named for the cities they're headed toward, are:&nbsp;? our narrator, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), an inept geek saved from zombiedom (zombiehood?) by his aversion to interpersonal relationships and his obsessive adherence to a bunch of rules stochastically determined by prior zombie encounters&nbsp;? Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a good ole boy who's discovered that his true calling in life is killing zombies in as many different and spectacular ways as possible&nbsp;? Wichita (Emma Stone), the obligatory really hot babe of approximately the same age as the protagonist&nbsp;? Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), younger sister of Wichita and her accomplice in running confidence swindles on kindly strangers back when there were suchThe guys meet up first, and shortly thereafter they run into the gals, who proceed to swipe their truck and guns. The fellas track them down again and get their replacement truck and guns stolen as well. Finally, they all figure out that it might be better to travel together. (This is one of several places where the flik might as well have been entitled Duhland.) For lack of a better idea, they head for Pacific Playland, site of Little Rock's fondest girlhood memories, splattering many zombies both along the way and after they arrive.Some of Columbus's rules:&nbsp;? #1: Cardio (be fit enuf to outrun the zombies)&nbsp;? #2: Double Tap (an insurance shot or whack after the 1st one puts them down)&nbsp;? #3: Beware Bathrooms (you're trapped, and your pants are around your ankles)&nbsp;? #4: Seatbelts (so that you stop when the vehicle does, even if the zombies don't)Each of these is colorfully illustrated. In one of the only bits of novelty in the movie, these phrases appear prominently on the screen every time Columbus mentions them, but sometimes the words fall off or get run over, etc.The sisters, OTOH, have only a single rule: "Trust no one, just you and me.".The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and you're not expected to, either. There are some mildly amusing bits, but it's nothing special. Better production values bring it in 1 notch above Zombie Strippers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say, definitely not my favorite zombie flick. I like the zombie makeup effects, but the movie relied on startling the audience rather than really scaring them. The characters in the movie however... made some of the dumbest zombie... epic fails I have ever seen in a zombie movie. It had a few good zombie slaughterings. But the mistakes that these people made were too bad, it lost credibility with me as a good zombie movie. Another terrible subplot of the movie, was the Twinkie fetish. Come on man. Its the end of the world. Let go of the Twinkies. Oh, the Bill Murray cameo is hilarious, the outcome... obvious... another thing I didn't like about the movie. There just weren't enough things that I actually liked about the movie compared to the things I didn't. The girl characters I didn't like, the guy characters I didn't like most of the time, Tallahassee was funny sometimes. Overall rating not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice Buddy/Zombie Pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombieland (2009) *** (out of 4)Nice horror/comedy has the world overtaken with zombies and Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) and Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) trying to find a safe harbor. It's funny that this entire movie is built around zombies yet they're not the best thing about the film nor are they really the most important. I think we get a few nice jokes built around the zombies like the overweight people being the first to die during the outbreak simply because they couldn't run fast enough. We even get a few more funny jokes about the "rules" of trying to stay alive. For me, however, the best part of the film was the actual road picture and the relationship between the two men and eventually the sisters (Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin) who join them. Both sides are so different that you can't help but have a wonderful time with them and this is especially true of the men. They're meeting and eventual getting to know one another leads to plenty of wonderful scenes including an instant classic where a Hostess truck is crashed off the road and Harrelson goes to investigate in hopes of finding a certain tasty treat. Another highlight happens when we get Eisenberg's flashback to the girl next door finally taking note of him. What really makes the film work are the performances with Harrelson showing why he's such a great comic talent whenever given the proper screenplays. He hilarious here and delivers his finest work in many years. Eisenberg is equally good and his scenes with Stone are very charming and cute. There's also countless gore for the horror fans but it's all done in a rather tasteful manor, or at least as tasteful as it can get. I do feel the film begins to drag a bit but that's just a minor issue to an otherwise fun movie. The funniest bit has to do with a cameo that I won't ruin for those who don't know about it. The payoff is perhaps the biggest laugh I've had in many, many years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a good story at all.... Things happened for no reason. It has that same loser in Adventure land, trying to find himself and figure out who he is. He also narrates the entire movie, talking about life, what a gay loser. If you want to watch a movie that is dominated with a guy trying too figure out who he is and make friendship, opposed to kicking zombie ass. That's what you'll see. It was so boring and I thought about walking out a couple of times. I was waiting for the movie too end. The only reason I didn't leave was because I was there with a buddy. This is another movie that shows that Hollywood is out too lunch and making our viewing experiences that much worse. Literally, the most random stuff happens in this movie. Don't watch it.
