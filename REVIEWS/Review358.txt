		<shortDescription>Documentary film-making at its best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It runs for three hours but it feels much less, such is the power that this documentary holds. Absorbing, you get sucked in and the film has this grip on you.If Reality TV is your thing, I'd seriously give this film a go, then you can stop watching Reality TV and start to recognise, understand and prioritise real-world situations that actually matter, like racism, poverty, drug abuse, peer pressure and well, dreams.You'll fall in love with the characters, and there's even a bad-guy for us to boo. You can sometimes question the manipulative techniques on display, but the film is actually not as guilty as some, the makers have a genuine affection for their subjects and do as much as they can within the rules of documentary to help them out without compromising their objectivity.Be that as it may, this film should be compulsory viewing for many younger audiences, as it shows you exactly how real life differs from the garbage that passes for representation of youth on TV and in film today.I really can't say enough about the need for more films like this, the fact that the Academy Awards were changed because of the strength of this film goes some way to showing you exactly how powerful it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Dick Vitale would say, "AWESOME, BABY!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ten years after I first saw this film, based on the mention that Siskel &amp; Ebert made on their show, I am still blown away by it.A good case could be made for this being the best motion picture of all time. It is simply amazing. The characters (if I can call them that) in the film will astound you with their depth, and this movie will suck you right in... if not to the Cabrini Green projects, at least into the lives of these 2 young men and their families. You will cheer for them, feel their pain, their sadness, their triumphs... and their determination to achieve something better for themselves and their loved ones.I bought the DVD the day it was released, and can give high praise to the good folks at the Criterion Collection. The accompanying booklet contains 3 excellent essays/articles as well as a complete list of the people in the film. The extras on the DVD are well worth watching, escpecially the commentary from Arthur &amp; William.To Frederick Marx, Peter Gilbert, and Steve James: Great job, guys. Your dedication to this project, and your understanding of the subject matter (that it was about more than mere basketball, from the beginning) have made a truly excellent film. Thank you.To Arthur Agee &amp; William Gates: You are both exemplary men, and the example of your lives, your perseverance, your awareness of yourselves and the world you live in, should serve as role models for all of us, regardless of age, color, or income. You are both heroes of mine, and have been for more than 10 years.To the Agee &amp; Gates families: Thank you for allowing these filmmakers access to your lives for so many years. I have wept at your hardships, and screamed joyously at your triumphs. Your dedication and love for each other is nothing short of inspirational.If you are reading this and you have not seen this film, PLEASE go get a copy and watch it. You will not have wasted a single minute of your life by having done so.A truly awesome film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true testament to the encroaching world of pro sports</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film simply exemplifies the reason why I hate most Oscar voters. This movie didn't even get a nomination, and it was one of the most successful documentaries ever! This especially exhibits the encroachment of coaches, family and other parties when it comes to the well being of inner city kids, who just happen to be good basketball players. Considering the state of pro basketball now, this kind of shows how the downward cycle of basketball was seeking lower standards. Sometimes funny, often times sad and poignant, this film is easily one of the best documentaries of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The filmmakers here show an admirable dedication to their art and to the underprivileged, spending five years tracking two kids, Arthur and William, and their dreams of basketball stardom. The two subjects and their families are simple and somewhat naive, in an endearing way. Their struggles, sometimes unflattering, are put forth for us to relate to, and we all can. Of course this is about two kids and their love for basketball, and about the "road to" that takes place as they try to get there, but it's really about the way people in near-poverty live, the education system and its downfalls, the manipulation of organized sports and tendency for people to try and achieve their goals through others (Arthur's father, William's brother), and the situation between blacks and whites in America. In one scene, Arthur laments being around mainly white kids for the first time in his life, and says it'll be difficult but he'll manage. That kind of relaxed confidence is so rewarding to watch. The film has endless insights into the black urban experience. Of course not every family in the ghetto is in a position where a father is a criminal and drug user, but when two kids in the same story are in that situation, it's got to be somewhat prevalent.It's the kind of movie that's sustaining, and there are so many transcendent, revealing moments that stand out: Arthur's mother, such an inspirational woman to watch, as she gets her nurse certification; Arthur's family talking to another family in a cafeteria, with his mother high-fiving an elderly white lady; the descent into and path out of drug addiction; and a scene where the man who recruits these boys says that sometimes he has doubts about himself when he sees the pain that's a part of these kids' lives. Spike Lee makes a brief appearance giving a speech to the kids, and his pessimism is the only sore spot in the film.We don't have to work for any of this, we don't have to question it. There's nothing to clean away before we can get to the real thing. This is the real thing. A curious moment, however, is one scene where Arthur's mother explains to us at one point she had her electricity cut off, which suggests that the crew wasn't there to film that period. But the next scene has her walking in the dark with a lamp, that seems like an undeclared "reenactment" of something they missed, for editing purposes. But the criticism of manipulation in documentaries is tired. Yes, the possibility of tricking an audience into believing something with a documentary is greater, but unless it's political in some respect it doesn't matter. Documentaries are supposed to be presented how the filmmaker sees fit. With no license, we'd have 350-hour documentaries.At one moment near the end, William's coach says goodbye to him and as he walks out his coach mentions that that's the system: one goes out, another comes in. It feels like we're saying bye to a member of the family. This is a life-affirming experience, a family that should be visited again. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This gets my vote for the best movie of all time!! I know, it sounds crazy to say that about a documentary, but to me, this film has more drama, truth, realism &amp; emotion than a thousand Hollywood movies put together. I've seen it over 30 times, and it never ceases to gladden my heart to see Arthur &amp; William's story. The scene where Arthur's mom receives her diploma from nursing school has to be one of my all time favorites. For me, this is one of the rare three-hour movies that I never wanted to end. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real, human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hoop Dreams" is a film about real life, because that is what it's exactly about, real life. I feel that I must put a stronger emphasis on the word "real" to get my point across. This isn't some hokey, Hollywood drama about living out a dream, but is about two aspiring young athletes rising out of the dredges of the Chicago ghetto life and into the flash and glitter of the NBA.Though I'm not a hardcore sports fan, nor am I really into movies about sports, but I really admire basketball, as I feel it has a kind of grace and natural balance that's lacking in most other sports this vigorous. That is why I like some of the film's exhilarating on-court action that is interspersed evenly with the human drama.Directed by Steve James and produced by Frederick Marx and Peter Gilbert, "Hoop Dreams" originally began as a 30-minute documentary about rising ballplayers, but the filmmakers quickly saw that 30 minutes was just too narrow a scope for their story. This realization came when they witnessed two teens, William Gates and Arthur Agee, as they both try to join the NBA, much like their idol Isiah Thomas.In total, 250+ hours of footage was gathered over the course of a five-year period and then edited into an engaging 171-minute documentary, following the two teens (from ages 14-18), as they attend expensive Catholic schools, go through the rigorous on-court training, meet the demands of their coaches, and live out their dreams. (Director Spike Lee also appears at a training camp and gives some of the aspiring players some less-than-inspiring advice about what their skills mean to the people at the top of the ladder.)We watch as their poignant, real-life struggles unfold on the screen, and watch as time after time they get stonewalled by the system of bureaucracy and racism that's meant to be especially hard on two young black boys from the ghetto. They have difficulty with making decent grades, financial issues, preparing for the ACT, sports-related injuries, and must contend with problems at home as well, including trouble with family matters (Arthur's relationship with his father is especially touching and sad; William welcomes a new addition to his family while still in high school).For years, success stories, such as "Hoop Dreams," have dominated Hollywood cinema and have won over legions of audiences, but we've never seen anything like this. Gates and Agee are both bright-eyed and ambitious that they're embarking on something that's historically significant to their lives and community.This is the best movie about basketball and reality I've seen yet because of the simple fact that it's real; no scripts, no phony Hollywood theatrics, just "real" action, drama, and emotions.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Better Documentaries You'll Ever See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At three hours, this is a long but interesting documentary about two Chicago-area high school basketball stars, William Gates and Arthur Agee, who try to make something from their basketball talents. Both athletes, of course, dream of becoming pro players some day. There are hundreds of similar tales each season - of great players, mostly black - who don't make it through college or even to college despite their enormous talents and one can get idea of some of the obstacles by watching these two guys.Gates is recruited by St. Joe's, a powerhouse Catholic School which claims Isaiah Thmas as it most famous cage alumnus. There, Gates plays for a typically gung-ho coach and has a lot of ups and downs, both on and off the court. However, he's a lot more mature than the other subject of the documentary: Agee.Agee also is recruited by the private school but can't pay the tuition and is kicked out in his sophomore year. He then returns to his neighborhood public school and eventually becomes a star.Gates graduates and goes on to Marquette while Agee attends a junior college. From that point, a summary at the end of the film brings you up-to-date on what happened to the kids.Thus, almost all of the three hours is devoted to these kids form junior high through high school. The families and friends of these athletes are interesting and the film really documents the different lifestyles between blacks and whites in the USA.It's a fascinating picture for people of any race. For non-blacks, it shows them a window into a whole different world. This film is obviously not just to highlight basketball players but to show life as it exists with a lot of poor black families: the good and the bad, the achievements and the big mistakes. I enjoyed it just as much the second time as the first. It's one of the better documentaries I've ever seen, so don't let the length of it discourage you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb supporting "cast" powers this excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hoop Dreams" brilliantly follows multiple parallel stories, bringing the viewer into the lives of two families of inner-city kids looking for a chance at the "big time", their ticket out of the ghetto. Although the main focus is on William Gates and Arthur Agee, their "supporting cast" is equally enthralling. From William's jaded brother Curtis, sublimating his own basketball aspirations to the reality of his blue-collar mailroom job, to Arthur's indomitable mom Sheila, doing the impossible every day as she keeps her troubled family together, there are a thousand reasons to cheer, laugh, cry, and rage packed throughout this amazing, inspirational, cautionary documentary. By examining not only the players but also their families and environments, we are given a clearer view of their aspirations and motivations, what they plan to achieve and what they wish to avoid. I will not summarize or elaborate further. If you have not seen this movie, put it on the short list. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Objective and Quiet, but Powerful Statement to Represent Disadvantaged Youth in Urban America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Basketball is a ticket out of ghetto." (William Gates)"... nobody cares about you. You're a black, you're a young male... The only reason why you're here [Nike training camp] is so you can make their team win. And if the team wins these schools get a lot of money." (Spike Lee)These phrases, which have persisted as common knowledge among the African-American community during last several decades, have become familiar to the non-hyphenated Americans in the 90s, thanks to the films such as Boyz N the Hood and He Got Game. Among them, Hoop Dreams, a documentary that follows two black youths during a five-year period, is the most objective and the most quiet, but the most powerful statement to represent the disadvantaged youth in urban America.The film reveals the pattern they follow. Being deluded by the luxurious surface of pro sports, they neglect education and then ending up going nowhere. The community suffers the vicious cycle and their feelings that the system exploits them remain.Kudos to the filmmakers for their insane amount of work. They must have gone through numerous negotiations to attend and film various scenes, such as family's private events, classrooms, academic counseling, recruiting sessions with college coaches, and surgery operation rooms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. Back in 98 I had the unexpected pleasure of catching it on PBS. At first I casually watched it, having heard of it upon its release a few years earlier. Not too far into the three hour running time, I found myself going from casual onlooker to absolutely hooked.The story is amazing in its scope. Four years of high school and some brief college material are documented here. We hop on board the lives of two high school basketball stars from Chicago, all but consumed with the desire to play in the NBA. Both boys are similar in some ways, and yet very different. As their story unfolds, you become very aware at how real this story is for many young athletes. All Hollywood clichés are left in the dust and the truth only a documentary can muster pulls us along for what seems like a film that is strangely too short. Three hours have never gone by so quick.Your heart will cheer, break, and then cheer again for these two great kids as they struggle with their dreams of reaching the ultimate level, as well as their struggle to just find a way through their daily lives. I won't do you the disservice of giving away anything. Just sit down and watch a great movie, and find out for yourself. Good Stuff!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Engrossing documentary about two inner city kids and their struggles to make it into professional basketball."Hoop Dreams" made a big splash when it was released in 1994, and there was a big controversy around Academy Award time when it was deemed ineligible in the Best Documentary category. It likely would have won had it been nominated, and it ranks right up there among some of the best documentaries of all time. This is mostly due to how engrossing the storytelling is. You forget you're not watching a fictional film, which just supports the claim that truth can be more compelling than fiction.You don't have to be a fan of basketball to enjoy this movie.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoop Dreams has got to be the best sports film ever made. Obviously it is a DOCU-DRAMA, but, it is very down to earth and very real. Great commitment from the filmmakers to follow the lives of Arthur Agee and William Gates from their Freshman year in HS to College. The film also shows life in the inner city of Chicago, drugs, crime, poverty and everything else under the sun. You can really appreciate how much Agee's mother loved him and she worked so hard to support her family. Gates's mother was also very supportive of her son, and I could really see the love from both mothers just pouring out to their kids. This film will be talked about for years and years and I'm sure millions of people will learn something from this. I recommend this to everyone.</fullReview>

A 5 year project following 2 Cabrini Green kids thru high school- this movie has more drama and ups and downs than most major pieces of fiction - both get recruited by a catholic prep school in the burbs- only William Gates is retained- meanwhile the Agee family does not have the money to keep Arthur Agee in the school- the twists and turns in this compelling drama reel you in and have you cheering during the good and crying and cringing during the bad. This movie should be shown to any kid that thinks it is easy to play sports and that is their only way of success- A+</fullReview>

The general story arc is not novel (poor kids with dreams of making it as pro athletes), but connecting with the drama, the suspense, the disappointments and the successes of the characters is the strength of this movie. The situations and consequences are very real and you find yourself rooting for and against the forces of everyday life.

		<fullReview>It's a testament to how powerful this movie is that I didn't care in the slightest about the subject matter, and yet still was very emotionally affected by the trials and errors of these two kids. I've always viewed sports as that thing that I do to have fun, and I stopped playing once people started taking it so seriously that it became too competitive to be fun.But seeing these two boys drive themselves through troubles with funds, injuries, and scholastics in order to pursue their one dream is very inspiring. It's yet another work that makes your typical normal middle-class life seem banal in light of the accomplishments and struggles of the underdogs.Basically, it's like watching all of those millions of "underdog sports" movies, except this one has the added tension of being real: these kids can fail at any moment, and sometimes a last-second basket gets missed. In a way it displaces all of an entire genre of sports movies and makes it only necessary to watch this one, one that is real, has real characters, has real dialog, and has real risk.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply outstanding. This documentary spoke to more than just the overlying story of the two young men who followed their overriding dream by doing what they deemed necessary, with the film itself chronicling their true-life tribulations along the way. It also spoke to the thousands of young, urban, inner-city youth who try to follow a path laid out for them via desegregation court orders, bussing from inner cities to far-flung suburbs, all in the hope to receive better educations via superior academic and athletic facilities. One of the most poignant scenes showed Arthur and William both alighting from the bus that has carried them from Cabrini-Green to a seeming Heaven (the Catholic high school in the suburbs where they matriculated), and trudging through the snow up to the entrance to the school, after a bus ride of more than an hour, starting at 6AM. The effort shown in this one act speaks volumes for the dedication these very young adolescents had toward attaining their goals, as well as the hopes their parents had for their future well-being. The true-life events detailed throughout the rest of the documentary enhanced and heightened the emotional triumphs and failures as seen through the eyes of these two youths and those closest to them.At the same time, one could also see the ruthless, non-forgiving side of competition, and how it could be used to manipulate those participating in it.This was and is truly one of the most outstanding documentaries of all time. I would urge anyone, anyone at all, regardless of their background relating to sports, to sit back and watch this documentary, and to try to see it, feel it, through the eyes of the protagonists. It is unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Important culturally but the quality of the film doesn't match its value as a marker in modern reality cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first moved to England in the mid-nineties, I took advantage of living in a city and having an art cinema near me for the first time ever. As a result I saw many things that I wouldn't have otherwise seen and Hoop Dreams was one of those things. At the time it was getting a lot of buzz about it being a rare film about real life and it also interested me as I had just started getting into basketball as well. Since then the film has become one of those films that is generally well remembered but not seen very often (at least it is in the UK). I eventually managed to get hold of it again recently (again thanks to some of the very kind users on IMDb) and I was looking forward to watching it again.Unfortunately this also meant appraising it again and it must be said that, watching with modern eyes almost 15 years from its release (and longer since it started being made) it doesn't stand up as well as I would have liked. As a rider on this it must be said that Hoop Dreams still has value considering what it is and when it was made. Nowadays we are used to every other programme being some sort of real-life fly-on-the-wall programme, simply because they are popular and cheap to make. However these differ from the ambition here, which is to chart the progress of two boys looking to basketball as their way to a better life ? a project that spread over many years with many hundreds and hundreds of hours of video to edit down (and accordingly the film did get the Oscar for editing). So what we are left with is a film that does a solid job of telling these two stories and marks itself as a bit of a modern milestone in reality cinema. It must be noted though that being an important film in terms of what it does is not the same as it being a really good film.The problem is that it doesn't totally manage to tell the story in a way that engages on a personal level and inform on a more general basis ? both of which appear to have been aims. The film is solid when it comes to the focus on the two boys but the problem is that, as individuals, the film doesn't make them particularly engaging people for the audience to care about and I didn't get a lot of drama from their respective journeys. OK they were interesting enough and also pulled together in quite a succinct manner but it never gave me much of a reason to really be held by the tale. Surprisingly bigger events in their lives are frequently just mentioned by the narrator (the father getting on and then off crack is dealt with in one line). Of course this is why it is important for a larger message to be clear and, in the case of Hoop Dreams, the bigger picture is the reality of the "making it out the ghetto via basketball" dream and the limited options to those who do not have this. In this regard the film doesn't achieve it because it is too tightly focused on the two boys and their families. There isn't a feel of the scale of this, of the challenges facing those who don't make it, of the desperation to make it and so on. This is a real shame because it could have made a good film into a great film and were the film made today one does think that it would be a pre-requisite. The dated presentation doesn't help ? obviously visually it is of the time it was made but I remember the cheesy sax music as horrid and time has only made it worse.There is no doubt that the scale and aims of Hoop Dreams and its cinematic success makes it an important part of modern reality cinema ? it is just that the film isn't as good to watch as its reputation deserves. The editing is good but the structure lacks a personal hook and doesn't manage to deliver much in terms of the bigger picture. It is still worth seeing and it is "good" but it is hard to understand why so many people lavish praise on it without pointing out its many faults.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very special movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a powerful and honest movie this is. While non fiction films with screenwriters and actors try so hard to fit in honesty while creating touching scenes and making you believe in the characters, Hoop Dreams does it better than any film I've seen with little effort. While watching it, all the hairs on my body stick up and I get tears in my eyes every time. I've never seen a more touching movie about real people attempting to overcome the odds in my life. It's because we know the reality lives beyond the camera. Unlike films like Rocky, Hoop Dreams actually follows underdogs who stay underdogs after the camera turns off making it even more touching and profound.Following Arthur Agee and William Gates, Hoop Dreams begins when they're young kids just playing basketball on the school yards. Scouts from prestigious middle schools, their families can't afford, are sent there to find pure talent on the courts. A scout finds Arthur presenting him the opportunity to go to Saint Josephs with a basketball scholarship. Arthur is confident he will make it to the NBA. He even says so whenever he sees the shoe commercials and won't let his mom or anyone else discourage him with the harsh reality.After meeting Isiah Thomas and playing him one on one in awe, Arthur is kicked out of Saint Josephs on account of his low grades and not being able to afford it. His coach, at Marshall, says "it doesn't take a genius to realize he was kicked out because he didn't play like they expected him to play. They would have worked something out if he played like they expected him to play" (not an exact quote)Meanwhile, Arthur's transferred back to Marshall while William becomes a sensation on the court. Hoop Dreams also follows the families attempting to survive in the tough Neighborhood. Williams brother is an ex ballplayer who's living his dream through William. He gets a job as a security guard and feels he has amounted to nothing. William even says, after he learns he will not make it to the NBA "Sometimes I feel Curtis should stop living his dream through me". Stuff like that is what makes Hoop Dreams incredible. Arthur's father starts dealing drugs, but repents. The harsh realities also kick in on the court. Junior year, while in his prime, William has an unexpected leg injury. He gets numerous operations and even misses most of a season. Although he gets some major scouts attentions at a basketball camp, the leg prevents him from playing to his highest potential ever again. His dreams of NBA basketball, day by day, become more a dream than reality. Meanwhile, Arthur is playing great basketball but his grades are low. He will not excel in his school work like he does on the court.Senior year, Arthur and his underdog commandos make it down to the state finals and overcome the odds. William gets into Marquette University and obviously is not very excited about it. Hoop Dreams is by far the most touching film I have had the privilege of watching. It's amazing to watch two kids and two families attempt to overcome the odds and accomplish a dream. Anyone can relate to this film, not just basketball players. Watching two kids do something they love and get rewarded for it is a magical experience for not only them, but for us as well. Even the disappointment they endure hit us where it hurts. Hoop Dreams shows the harsh realities, unlike many Hollywood films. Arthur and William never make it professionally, they miss important foul shots, and they end up at colleges they have no interest in.This, of course, is all a part of life. By showing all of this Steve James creates something really special that lives beyond the camera entering your heart. Hoop Dreams is one of the greatest movies ever made. You might think i'm overstating it, but 3 hours of this movie opened me to things in life no Hollywood movie has dared to try. While most movies work so hard to touch your emotions moving you with fake situations and unbelievable twists of fate, Hoop Dreams does it for 3 hours and more with such a subtle effort.10-10 for this miracle of a movie!! Sorry about the long review, I just love this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seen this movie in a film class, and have fell in love with it ever since, and even still to this day i watch it!!! This documentary takes you on the ride of your life!! I now have a greater sense for how important athletics can be in ones life, and the things that athletes will do to fulfill their dreams!! I bought this film on VHS when it first came out, and i was definitely not disappointed. I would also like to mention that i had the privilege to meet Mr. William Gates, at a 3 on 3 basketball tournament recently, in which he was the guest speaker, I would have to say that i was so amazed to see how compassionate he was, and the man that he turned out to be. It was a great experience for me to be apart of. I would like to say to all those who have seen this remarkable documentary, be on the lookout for Hoops Dreams 2 which will be released in the near future!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing documentary lacks scope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoop Dreams is about two promising basketball players and their experiences playing in high school. At the beginning, the two boys get a scholarship to a private school known for having an exceptional basketball program. Even though it requires each of them to take a ninety minute bus ride one way every day, the school presents a huge opportunity for both of the boys; it's much better in practically every way than the lousy under-privileged schools they previously attended.The film is very restrained in making its point which is something I found odd for a documentary film; I don't watch many films like this but I thought the idea was for the film-makers to make a clear argument rather than present a load of facts and allow the viewer to draw his own conclusions. In any case, it's pretty clear to me that the film is critical of the process that leads these students to be recruited to play basketball at the tender age of 14. It turns out that the scholarship the boys get doesn't cover all expenses and so it proves to be impossible for Arthur Agee, the boy who initially shows less promise, to remain at the school for more than a year. This wreaks havoc on the already pathetic boy who has to deal with his family's extreme poverty due to his father's drug addiction and his mother's health related inability to keep a job. William Gates, the more promising boy, can't afford to pay the fee either but the school finds a sponsor to help him because of his more advanced skills.Arthur is really the more interesting character here as he is plagued with problems from the get-go and he has to try harder to get anywhere. In addition to his poverty, he has to deal with his father's attempts to live vicariously through his success. He struggles to find his own identity. For a good portion of the film, Arthur tries to copy the success of an NBA star from his area, going so far as to borrow the older man's nickname for his own use.It struck me that both of these boys weren't paying enough attention to academics or social skills as they both seemed rather immature and ignorant, particularly in terms of their future potential outside of basketball. Their academic failure is also made clear by their struggle to make an 18 on the ACT, a score that is well below the national average.Hoop Dreams does a good job of telling the story of a little more than four years of the lives of two boys; it's an engrossing enough film to make its three hour run time go by fairly quickly. The film also tells something about the environment promising athletes are thrust into from an early age and how they're sometimes manipulated into spending huge amounts of time doing something that really won't do them much good in life all in the name of making the dream of NBA stardom a reality. I would have liked the film more if it had a bit more context and scope; as it is this work doesn't add up to much more than the story of two individuals when it probably should have said more about the entire system they're immersed in. I also feel that the film-makers should have taken a stand and made some attempt to analyze the story they told, their refusal to do so looks like a combination of laziness and cowardice to me. Still, Hoop Dreams does enough right to make it a worthwhile viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a 'basketball documentary'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard a lot about this documentary, but had never seen it. I've even read comments by few people calling it their favourite film, "even though it's a documentary" (as if that was a bad thing!). It's understandable to see why this film speaks to the hearts of so many people."Hoop Dreams" follows two teenaged Chicago residents, Arthur Agee and William Gates, and their dreams of becoming professional basketball players - more than that, basketball superstars a la Michael Jordan. From their first year of high school until they start college, we observe all of the expectations, efforts, joy, disappointments, and numerous obstacles that make their journey.Will Agee and Gates manage to overcome all the obstacles and become more than most of their peers even dream to achieve? The suspense is well-built through clever editing and a good sense of rhythm, pace and storytelling (documenting is also storytelling, after all), and the film doesn't feel 170 minutes long. By the end, you realize you've watched two real people growing up and doing what they can or cannot - failing and trying again - to achieve their goals and dreams, no matter what are the odds imposed by their economical and social backgrounds. Hoop Dreams come(s) true as both a slice of life and a fascinating socio-anthropological study. Not bad for a 'basketball documentary'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basketball and social class in America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll never understand the USA's obsession with high school sports. Putting this much pressure on 14-18 year old kids and calling them athletes and referring to their basketball as a 'career' is harmful. Sure, it's an entertaining game but that's all it is. Once business takes over all bets are off and lives are ruined. The promise of the American dream of wealth and success is nothing but a bald-faced lie. These topics were briefly touched on but for the most part the movie was a rather passive documentary that simply chronicled two different boys' lives in high school basketball for four years. That in itself was interesting enough for me to give this movie a good rating. The people are compelling and it was good to know that eventually at least one of the boys came to realize that his NBA dreams were unrealistic. The movie still presents a powerful portrayal of the lower-class inner city blacks in America and the desperation they have to endure. One of the only outs for their kids seems to be sports scholarships. Enter the over-zealous coach, competitive scouts and legions of fans. It's interesting to see because no one in Canada is as obsessed with high school sports. I think it's mainly because it's the only way out for poor, inner-city blacks in America. The concept makes for an entertaining, emotional documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There has been few times in my movie watching experience that one is able to have such a complete experience. The only thing that does not stand out is the music. But the whole movie delivers on such a pure level it stills stands out as one one the must watch films. The characters are complete because they are real human beings. Their lives have twists that can only happen in real life and cannot feel contrived because everything is real. I kept thinking and still think that you cannot write stuff this good. The families were presented in a perfect way and the way they were presented made the movie complete. I do not follow any sports and actually never really understood why people get so obsessed with them and have tried to have my friends explain it to me. They really were not able to get across the point like this movie does. It shows how at the age of 14 not only are the kids seeing basketball being their only way to a better life, but the whole family puts all of their hopes and dreams in a 14 year old kid. But by the end of the movie you see what young men can do with the lives they are given and create themselves even if it may not be exactly what they wanted. But this movie really gives insight into how lives are built and how hopes and dreams actually work. At 3 hours this movie is a long one, but I wanted the movie to continue so I could see what happens for the rest of their lives. I have to give full credit to the directors who risked 4 or 5 years of lives on two kids and got on film one of the most human movies ever produced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spike Lee Should Thank Steve James</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you compare Hoop Dreams with He Got Game, it has so many parallels that you wouldn't believe. Spike Lee takes about 3 stories in Hoop Dreams and uses it for his own film. The manipulation by high school coaches and recruiters are threads in both stories and even the mostly sinister recruiter and coach characters act the same, in their demeanor and intensity. To Spike's credit, he's going for realism all the way, yet it's fictionalized. Hoop Dreams, though, is the true story.Denzel Washington's character clearly is a takeoff from Arthur Agee's father who's in and out of the picture, involved with drugs and his ultimate hopes for redemption. And yes, Spike is in Hoop Dreams, too.Just the feel of both pictures is identical, particularly the montage in Hoop Dreams with the various coaches and scouts talk in a series of clips are mirrored in He Got Game. My only hope is that one doesn't just see one without the other, to learn how some of our best documentaries provide the texture to some of our best fictional films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best documentary I have ever seen. Better even, than Crumb. A local video store was going out of business and I bought this film for $5 after seeing that Roger Ebert had said something good about it on the cover. I was reluctant to watch it however; I could care less about a couple of inner city kids who like to play basketball. I could care less about a basketball movie. But this isn't a basketball movie. It's a movie about how we treat each other. It's an important film. As a result of it involving me so much in the story, the film made me interested in basketball also. I couldn't believe some of the stuff that happens in the film and I was far more interested in this documentary's "plot" than I was at the latest popcorn flick. There is some good social commentary on how blacks are still treated unfairly, made more important because the film doesn't go out of its way to be a "message" movie. It's almost 3 hours long, but it flew by. It's very juicy, it's never tired or mechanical, it's got real life to it. It has passion.If this can be included as one, I also think that aside from being the best documentary I have seen, it's also the best sports movie.I felt real sympathy for these kids and their families, although that may be the last thing they want.I hope that people would search out this movie. Not enough people watch documentaries or are willing to. But if done correctly, on an interesting subject, they can be more rewarding than any film of any genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Representation of The American Dream in Film Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many filmakers of the past hundred years have rendered their visions of the American Dream, until Hoop Dreams came along in 1994 no one had actually presented the dream itself. That is this film's greatest accomplishment, the stark portrayal of the lives, hopes, dreams, and aspirations of two remarkable young men. Basketball is at once a driving force of the film as well as a mere backdrop to the actions of the two gentleman. This film has too many positive aspects to mention, so I will just sum up by saying that Hoop Dreams hits at the core of what it is to be American, regardless of age, gender, race, social standing or any other defining factor, and to see this film is to remind us all of our common existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may sound simplistic, but "Hoop Dreams" is one of the best documentaries ever made, in my opinion. If I had to make a list of the greatest films of all time, it would rank up there with the likes of "Spartacus" or "Schindler's List".Sure, you are probably thinking that I am giving "Hoop Dreams" too much praise. It's a documentary, not a drama. But this film satisfies in ways that many dramas cannot. It is a story filled with triumphs, tragedies, disappointments, hopes, and of course, dreams. Real life is greater than fiction.The film essentially follows two boys who have a dream to play in the NBA. Sounds simple; indeed, the filmmakers perhaps thought they could put together a nice little movie of these high school boys chasing their dream. But, the lives of Arthur Agee and William Gates were more complicated than that.Instead of a simple film about two boys, the finished product is a compelling, complex, thrilling, and inspirational story that should be seen by all. In fact, it should be required viewing for kids who are about to enter their high school years.I still am surprised that "Hoop Dreams" affected me so much, considering that I am not a basketball fan. You don't need to be, because it is about so much more than a ball game.My recommendation is this: do not tape this movie from TV, or even rent it. If you can, BUY IT. You're going to want to see it again, and each time you do, you will get something out of it you did not get before.Absolutely, the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As far as documentaries go, this one is the best. Shot over a period of four years, the director does a masterful job of presenting the lives and dreams of two young kids in the Chicago ghetto. But this movie goes beyond that. We get to see just how important it is for a young black kid to dream of playing in the NBA. It is the only way for these youths to escape the cycle of poverty, to make their families proud and to be respected in a white man's world. Both William Gates and Arthur Agee start at the same level. They both get partial scholarships from the prestigious St. Joseph's high, they both have the same amount of talent, they come from the same background. But fate has different paths in store for them. Gates lucks out and gets a sponsorship that would allow him to finish his education at St. Joe's. Agee does not show improvement, no-one seems to believe in him either and he is kicked out when his parents cannot pay for half the tuition. High hopes are pinned on Gates. The director does a terrific job of coming again and again back to Isiah Thomas'-the famous St. Joe alum- trophy case. He is the ghost that constantly haunts Gates. The young boy is under a great amount of pressure to succeed, from his coach, from the school, from his brother -the former basketball star who never made it big-, his mother. A knee injury makes him lose his confidence and his hopes of playing in the NBA are lost. Agee, on the other hand, is thrown back in the gutter. No one thinks he will ever make it big after leaving St. Joe's. He is tempted by drugs and gangs, his father abandons them at a very critical time, his mother loses her job. He no longer dreams of playing in the NBA. He still plays ball for Marshall, a poor inner-city school. Through another twist of fate, he leads his school to a miracle run in the state championships in his senior year and all of a sudden he can dream again. I'm giving all these details because I know this documentary is worth watching. It's not just an insight in African-American culture, but also a story of two kids who you can root for, and perhaps even see a part of your life in them. I was genuinely touched and moved. Congratulations to whoever made this documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really was a treat to finally see this film. I had heard so much, but had never been able to find a copy of it. The fact that I was unable to find a copy was a shame, considering I live only but a few hours from where the story actually took place. "Hoop Dreams" perfectly sums up the storyline of this docu: two inner city youths hoping to one day make it big in the NBA. This docu tracks the progress of William Gates and Arthur Agee through their entire high school career. It makes no bones about the politics of high school sports, especially in a scene where Agee is booted from a Catholic school because he was unable to financially meet the requirements. Which, in all honesty, was a bogus reason. They really booted him because they didn't feel he had "it". It being the talent to bring this school to the championship. Whereas, on the other hand, Gates, who also was recruited to attend this school was supported financially by outside influences and had continued support all throughout his high school career. "Hoop Dreams" compares and contrasts like no other film I have ever seen. Even if you are not a fan of sports, and even if you don't like documentaries this film is as enjoyable as anything you're likely to see. An American classic. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hoop Dreams" is one of the finest films I ever seen. It is easily the best documentary subject ever put on celluloid and it is a blueprint to all film-makers (especially those trying to break into the industry). It is late-1980s inner-city Chicago and two youngsters (Arthur Agee and William Gates) are preparing for their high school careers. Neither know one another, but they soon become linked in the fact that they are both recruited to go to the prep school that then-NBA superstar Isiah Thomas (a hero to both) attended. We then follow the two over a course of five years as they try to make their dreams of basketball super-stardom come true. "Hoop Dreams" is a definitive example of a true documentary (something that most never do understand the concept of). It is a film that took years and years to make. It told a story that most of mainstream America did not understand or even know about. It relied on lots of planning and lots of luck to all come together. This was a labor of love and desire for the film-makers involved (most notably director/co-writer/co-editor Steve James). "Hoop Dreams" is the cinema in its rawest and most untamed form. It is not a film that was developed for profit, awards or recognition from others in the entertainment community. It is a film that was made to educate people and tell a story that could not have been conveyed by any other form of mass communication. An Oscar-nominee for its mind-numbingly difficult editing in 1994. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing Hoop Dreams again is like revisiting someone you haven't seen in a while, and you get caught up on who they are and think back to what it was like when you knew them, and then you realize you never even left in a weird way. These two guys, Arthur and William, are kids who could make it in basketball, but can they make it in life? The film poses many questions, and we just want them to get out of the mean streets of Chicago they're in, which is always so close and yet so far away to accomplish. Ultimately we might think they can make it - they're good kids, so they won't sell drugs or get into crime, at least not so soon after graduating high school (if they can pull their grades up) - but who knows? It really comes down to luck. I'm not sure if that's what the filmmakers intended to show, but time and time again in Hoop Dreams, which runs almost three hours but breezes by seemingly as it goes past four years of high school, we see how luck, good and bad, plays into Arthur, William and their family members. Take for instance how the two of them start out at St. Joseph's. They're spotted by a recruiter and go to the school because they look promising playing basketball. Both do well in the school, but while William gains some notoriety as a top notch player going into Sophomore year, Arthur has to drop out because his parents can't pay the late fees and the fees due for the upcoming year (all of about two grand, which as one can see is how much they're struggling to get by). So their lives diverge at their respective schools, St. Joseph's for William and Marshall for Arthur, all because of luck.But it doesn't stop there. Things happen beyond anyone's control. William gets a knee injury and can't play for a while, leaving him on the bench despite his desire to play; Arthur gets better as a top player at the school, but slips in grades when his friend drops out to sell drugs; William has a baby, and her future may depend on how well he can impress the recruiters for a college; family members, like William's brother (also a once promising player himself), get in trouble, or Arthur's mother who has job problems but overcomes it to become a nurse. All of this is all apart of that desperate but likely struggle to attain something of the American dream, or some version of it, and how the two players are like little superheroes to their families, but have their own personal struggles to deal with too.It's a tableau, an epic look at two lives and, of course, basketball. Going in I remember I thought "I'm not a big fan of basketball, will I like it?" Never should that thought cross your mind, since even a non-fan will be biting their nails and cheering on Arthur and William during their games - the characters lead the momentum of the games, as opposed to all of these pseudo-inspiring sports movies where we know mostly what will happen. Here, anything is possible, and tension rides high (albeit we often see condensed versions of the games, used by a somewhat effective narrator in the director Steve James). It's important that it's about basketball since the teens playing it are at high stakes for their respective futures, so it's not just a device. We see how dangerous life is on the other side of the dream - divorce, drugs, crime, death, despair, poverty - and so whatever 'dreams' of the title carry with it are paramount, and sometimes costly.I cared about what I saw the first time, and cared about the characters again revisiting the film. It's inspirational without having to force it, and a fine coming of age story as well. And if you wonder what happened to these kids after the movie (after the end cards say what happened during college life) you're not alone.</fullReview>

Not that I agree or that it's right, but it's true. I cried more than once during this film. Tears of pain and of joy... Wow. It's truly a masterpiece. How much effort was put into this film can only be imagined. There was real love put into this movie, and you'll take love out of it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glimpse into innercity life, NOT African American life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoop Dreams is a compelling documentary about the lives of two young men with dreams of making it big in basketball in order to escape the harsh realities of life in the ghetto. Yes the boys are black. That's no surprise. There are plenty of black people living in identical surroundings of that of Arthur and William. However I can not stand to read these comments on this site, which I am assuming are written by white people, about how it is a glimpse into "African American" life and culture. How ignorant can you be? I am black and from the Chicago area and my life was nothing like this. I grew up in a five bedroom home with an accountant for a mother and a dentist for a father. My father was never addicted to crack. I never witnessed a drive by shooting. There were no teenage pregnancies in my household. That's not to say those things are something to be ashamed of. You cannot help where you were born. But for you ignorant white people who live in your sheltered little lilly white bubble, open your eyes and your minds and realize that white people aren't the only people who are diverse. Just because my skin is black doesn't mean I grew up in the projects. Black people are no more monolithic than our pasty counterparts in Caucausia. I watched the movie and was intrigued by a life I had never seen or experienced and my skin happens to be rich in melanin. It is not a reflection of African American life. It's a reflection of life in an inner city ghetto. That's it and that's that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>setting the record straight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the comments about "Hoop Dreams" I feel that I must help to set the record straight. Though a few of the reviewers saw this film correctly, the vast majority see this film as a basketball movie. It is not. This is a film about poor and impressionable children who are promised a better life by people who seek only to exploit them. Form the opening seen where the fat Artful Dodger-like recruiter is watching 14 year old boys play basketball and trying to entice them to attend the same prep-school as Isaiah Thomas, to the moment when Arthur is expelled because he cannot pay his tuition, we see how savagely exploited these poor children are. They have been reduced to work-horses by white America, promised a better life if they compete on the modern-day gladiatorial stage. These kids will never make the big show, and they will never escape the ghetto. They will perform like circus clowns until they no longer have the ability to excite us. This is modern-day slavery and apartheid on display in the USA, and some of you folks out there have the nerve to criticize these desperately poor families for accepting a welfare check. Shame on you for perpetuating such exploitation. This film is not about basketball. This film is about the continuing development of a minority underclass in this country, and the fact that we all promote it with our love for gladiators, and our Dickensian willingness to exploit children to fulfill our gluttonous desires. This is a film with heroes and villians. If you think its just a heartwarming story about kids playing basketball, then you are one of the villians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoop Dreams, a story of two young basketball players and the struggles in their lives.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeremiah Goodwin Whitaker Expository Writing 10-19-15 Film ReviewFilm Review: Hoop DreamsFor my film review I chose the documentary "Hoop Dreams". This film goes through the struggles of two very talented African American basketball players, Arthur Agee, and William Gates. Both who were recruited by St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois. Which was a majority white school. Hall of famer, Isiah Thomas, is an alumni of the school. The film shows what their lives was like. It also shows their daily struggles.In my opinion I believe Arthur had it the worse out of the two. After being recruited to St. Joseph and playing he was kicked out after failing to make payments on the tuition. To me I felt as if they tried so hard to get Arthur to come to the school they wouldn't just let him be kicked out like that. I feel like they would have had some kind of agreement to where he could make payments. For example and installment payment. Or somebody in the school or an organization could've done something to keep him there. Also there was a point in time he had to go back to his local school and was just getting by with his grades. He also had to do it without his father for some time. Arthur seemed to not care about school altogether at one point. He had to go to summer school multiple times just to stay in the correct grade and graduate with his class. William gates had a better life but it was not great all the time. Like Arthur her too played for St. Joseph's. But unlike Arthur he played varsity. He seemed like he was the next sure thing to make it into the league. But no basketball player has a perfect life. At one point he struggled in his school work. He cared more about basketball than school. But eventually he got his life together and started to make the grades. Even on top of that he still excelled in basketball. Injuries began to plague him in his junior year in high school. He had a knee injury that could have cost him his whole year. But he battled back and continued to play. He messed himself up by going out to play when he was not completely healed though. During his experience at a Nike basketball camp he found himself struggling and injured his knee.Personally I don't think this film has a specific audience. This film can be watched by anybody. From basketball lovers to people who love a good story. There isn't anything wrong with it necessarily. Some may view it as a typical story and not care about it in anyway possible. Other may see this film and think of it as an absolute masterpiece. The point is every one is entitled to their own opinion. No matter if its bias or not. We can't tell a person if they are right or wrong about anything they say or do. The audience sometimes chooses the film not the other way around. In my opinion I think this film is a good film. Normal basketball documentaries start off while the player is in college or in their freshman year in the National Basketball Association (NBA). While with this film they start earlier in these players lives. There is a way that the story is told so that we can feel as if we are with them in their struggles and can feel the pain and suffering they are going through. Most people would look at this as a typical story of two young African American boys going through a basic struggle. But it is much more than that. This story is about two people chasing their dreams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROGER EBERT's Personal Recommendation; really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The time has finally come for me to watch the documentary that Roger Ebert himself CREDITS "one of the greatest films of the decade." Well, I was not let down one bit, but I definitely wouldn't go as far to consider it that high of a review. But one things is for sure, it was definitely worth it, watching Steve James's HOOP DREAM.Our story follows two aspiring young high school students from Chicago who dream of becoming the next big thing in BASKETBALL. One is Arthur Agee and the others name is William Gates; the two differ in many ways, but luckily, their stories really don't intertwine. ? What I found really amusing during this 3 HOUR MOVIE was how dynamic each character is and what their purpose to this story was. Such as the parents! Arthur's family undergoes a lot of dysfunctional problems, and only time will tell if their story is a good one.I believe this film is great for young basketball dreamers, but also any young adult who decides to follow their dreams. One can connect really easily with the lifestyle and realize that it isn't just about (winning) the game. It has much more to do with that.I RATE this doc a 8 out of 10 on IMDb. Nothing too unique, but definitely something that should not be missed. Students who study documentary filmmaking can really learn a lot from this feature. If it is one thing that it teaches you, it is that YOU CAN ONLY LEARN FROM THE BEST.? Michael Mendez</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Gates and Arthur Agee are two poor Chicago teens struggling to make it like their idol Isiah Thomas. Gates from Cabrini?Green gets a sponsor and go to good white school. Agee from West Garfield Park struggle as family issues force him to attend the local public high school. They both have highs and lows with many surprises. Gates faces injury issues and trying to maintain his early promise. Agee's father gets into drugs but his team at Marshall may be the Cinderella story.It's an eye opener for its insight into sports, poverty, race and the school system. Even more than that, it shows that real life can't be scripted. There is more drama and more surprises than many scripted fiction. The real life drama is so compelling. It breathed new life into the documentary genre and created controversy when it wasn't nominated for the best documentary at the Academy Awards. The main drawback is that the movie follows more on the basketball. It's certainly understandable because the basketball follows a schedule and has inherent drama. Their personal lives do get sufficient treatment to deliver some insight into the family's lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Portrait of Time and Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film following the lives of two inner-city Chicago boys who struggle to become college basketball players on the road to going professional. Gates lived in Cabrini?Green while Agee and his family resided in West Garfield Park.Although never a basketball player or from a poor neighborhood, this touches home for me a bit because I am from the Midwest and have spent a fair amount of time in Chicago. And then add Marquette University, a place I have been to countless times, and you are practically in my backyard.The strength of this film is that -- despite the title -- it is not about basketball. That is what drives the narrative, but the deeper story is one of race, class, poverty, unemployment, crime, family values and more. These are real issues, and whether or not we face them, they are holding entire communities back from succeeding.Although violence is never a focus of the film, it remains ever on the edges. The families of both men have experienced losses since the release of the film. On Thanksgiving morning 1994, Agee's older half-brother, DeAntonio, was gunned down at Cabrini?Green. In September 2001, Gates' older brother, Curtis, 36, was shot to death in the Chicago Lawn neighborhood. Arthur's father, Bo Agee, was murdered in 2004.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hoop Dreams" follows two Chicago teens, Arthur Agee and William Gates, for 5 years. Both hope to eventually make it to the NBA to play basketball but their more immediate goals are to receive scholarships to top basketball colleges.In the history of documentaries, "Hoop Dreams" is super-important and it helped usher in a newer style and scope of documentaries (such as the many excellent films by ESPN). I do appreciate that. However, after I watched it, I found myself underwhelmed. After all, the film has a current score of 8.3--and that is incredibly high. So, I think I found my expectations were just too high. Additionally, and I know this will perhaps sound mean, but I really didn't find myself that connected with the characters. I was hoping they'd get to live their dreams...but why should I pull for them as opposed to any other young wannabes?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Remarkable Filming and Editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about halfway through this film when I realized that these people were looking into the lens of a camera . I know that there was a little mugging at times and little signs of embarrassment that gave one the sense that the camera was there, but for the nearly three hours (there must have been so much more footage) these young people led their lives for us to see. This is the story of two young men who have grown up in the projects on the South Side of Chicago. Each is quite a basketball star and they have the dream of someday playing in the NBA. Their families are poor and in some cases, unstable. The kids are stars in their own high schools, but do have some issues with attitude and commitment. Having come off the playground and then getting all this attention does work against them. They are both sent to a school, St. Joseph's, in suburban Chicago, that produced Isiah Thomas. It is a school that has been incredibly successful, with an incredibly intense Coach who looks a little like a cross between Joe Paternor and Alfred Molina. He rants and intimidates and doesn't seem to individualize much. One of the young men doesn't have the financial wherewithal or the more observable talent and has to leave, returning to his old school. It is implied that The second is a more mature player but when a knee injury enters the picture, he begins to lose his confidence and doesn't reach the level of performance that he had hoped. This is a cutthroat business which is made obvious. St. Joseph won't even release the boy's transcripts until he pays up. His parents have to get on a payment plan and then it takes time. This is important because in order to get any kind of a scholarship or to even enter another school, he needs these to graduate. Basketball is everything. I won't go into all the details. Those before me have done that. I want to compliment the effort and time that went into this presentation. We see so much of the humanity of a culture so different from most of ours. The filmmakers and the participants have put their hearts and souls for us to see. It's not always pretty, but they were willing to give that much of themselves. See this. It took me over twenty years to check it out. I am in awe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really good Documentary about two high school students becoming Professional Basketball Players. Its shot on a beta max camera but, Its the 90's you can't complain about it and there is a charm with it as well. The two high school students are likable and i fell for them when you see there success and failures in life also, there parents are Likable as well. I'm not to crazy about sports but, i did remember playing Basketball , i didn't play for any teams, i play it as a hobby and i remember being good at. OK getting off topic right there what i was saying is i'm not to crazy about sports but, the story really kept me invested and i care what was going on. my minor complains are that the film gets a little to long but, i can handle it and that i really think it would have been nice to see the two high school students name William and Arthur meet each other in the documentary which you don't see them come face to face in the documentary but, that's just a minor complain. Overall i Highly Highly Recommend seeing this documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I strongly believe that the documentary, Hoop Dreams, was very effective in showing its point, while following the lives of two high school basketball players. It was excellent due to the great interviews, and effective cross cutting between both stories. There was great pacing between the shots and each character was equally as important. But aside from the editing, the content of the film was very eye opening. What I was surprised to notice was that I didn't see much mention in other reviews of the school reforms required to make this a better country, If colleges required a higher GPA, SAT/ACT score in order to receive a sports scholarship that way players will be able to gain a good education and not be thrown out on the streets the second they get injured. Currently students are willing to not go to classes in hopes of reaching professional sports, but they need something to fall back on just in case they don't make it. And in the small chances that they do make it to professional sports, what happens if they get injured, they have no career to fall back on. This movie was very effective and inspiring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen a few of the documentary films featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, some are standard subjects, some are controversial, and some are unusual, but of course all are interesting for their own reasons, I was hoping this one would be another good one. Basically this film follows two African American teenagers, William Gates and Arthur Agee, both from inner-city Chicago, who dream of becoming superstar basketball players for the NBA (National Basketball Association). The film starts from their early beginnings in St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois, and sees them grow and progress through the following five years, including starting and graduating college, and maturing into men. William and Arthur were both recruited into the same school that Isiah Thomas came from, and put into a team where white and black people mix, which then was not usual, we see their workouts, practises and struggles through learning all about the game, and obviously their skills come into play and they do rise to become noticed. By the end of the film one of the young men grows into the star he dreamt of becoming, while the other keeps trying, but they stay true to each other and support one another through whatever happens, and their families, friends and closest supporters are with them all the way as well. With narration by Steve James, and also starring Emma Gates - William's Mother, Curtis Gates - William's Brother, Sheila Agee - Arthur's Mother, Arthur 'Bo' Agee - Arthur's Father, Earl Smith - Talent Scout, Gene Pingatore - High School Basketball Coach, Sister Marlyn Hopewell - High School Guidance Counselor, Bill Gleason - Television Reporter, Patricia Weir - President: Encyclopedia Brittanica, Marjorie Heard - High School Guidance Counselor, Luther Bedford - High School Basketball Coach, Aretha Mitchell - High School Guidance Counselor, Shannon Johnson - Arthur's Friend, Tomika Agee - Arthur's Sister, Joe 'Sweetie' Agee - Arthur's Brother, Jazz Agee - Tomika's Daughter and Arthur's Niece, Catherine Mines - William's Girlfriend, Alicia Mines - William's Daughter, Alvin Bibbs - William's Brother-in-Law, Willie Gates - Himself - William's Father and film director Spike Lee. I will be honest that I faded in and out of the story because I did think the three hour length was a bit too much, obviously the five year span of filming makes sense for this length, however I did pay attention to the actual basketball stuff, and the two true life characters are likable, so it is I suppose a worthwhile sports documentary. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing. It was number 11 on The 50 Greatest Documentaries. Good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Documentary on Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoop Dreams (1994)**** (out of 4)Wonderful documentary from Steve James who spent nearly five years with teenagers William Gates and Arthur Agee, two kids dreaming of making it up through the ranks of basketball and getting into the NBA one day. HOOP DREAMS is one of the most respected documentaries ever made and I hadn't seen it since it was originally released but this second viewer really made it clear how well this thing has held up over the years and what a remarkable piece of work it actually is. Obviously, since I was just fourteen when I originally viewed the film the entire thing really didn't hit home as well as it did today, when I'm older and understand the ups and downs of life. It's just so strange to see a documentary on people you don't know that can hold your attention for nearly three hours. Throughout that time we follow their careers through high school where both struggle with their grades and this impacts what their future might hold because of needing to reach a certain level to be eligible to get into college. We also get to see their home lives, which aren't always the best due to being in poor incomes where we even learn that their power and gas has been turned off. What works so well with this film is that it really gives you a clear portrait of life in general. I don't see how anyone could watch this film and not feel or understand what these two kids are going through and at the same time you really cheer for them even if you see some of the paint on the wall saying that things aren't going to turn out as planned. It's rare for a film to be insightful, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time but HOOP DREAMS is quite a remarkable little gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie follows two high school basketball players who grew up in the ghetto through their journey to become NBA baketball players.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Hoop Dreams follows two young basketball players from the projects of Chicago in their quest to one day play NBA basketball. The documentary provides viewers with a gripping plot line and an in depth look into the lives of the two boys on and off the court. The movie does a very good job of communicating not only the stress that the boys feel as they chase a dream that has a miniscule success rate, but also life's hardships the boys have to endure on and off the court as the movie progresses through the boy's four years of high school. Throughout the movie, the directors do a very good job of putting the audience in the boy's shoes, which is the component that makes this movie so good. The filmmakers portray the difficult environment the boys grow up in, both at home and at school. They also do a very good job of documenting the people in Arthur and William's lives that influence them the most. As the movie starts out, the audience is introduced to Arthur Agee and William Gates, two fourteen year old boys with dreams of playing NBA basketball. Arthur lives on the south side of Chicago and William lives in the Cabrini Greens Housing Project. Both are poverty stricken areas without much chance for those raised there to escape the cycle of poverty. The boys are surrounded by lots of crime and gang activity which usually keeps kids their age from escaping the projects. The movie shows scenes of what life is like in the ghetto, from kids playing in rundown parks with inadequate basketball hoops, to Arthur's dad buying drugs from some gang members, both in view of Arthur and the cameras. It is scenes like these that bring the audience to understand the type of harsh environment the boys grew up in. The filmmakers realize that most of their audience cannot relate to the boys and they need to find a way to provide the audience with an understanding of what life is like for the boys. The directors do a very good job of showing the audience what it is like to grow up in the ghetto rather than just tell them. This is one aspect that keeps the audience so involved in the movie. The character development and portrayal in the documentary is exceptional. The filmmakers do a great job of showing the audience how the two main characters mature and grow not only as basketball players, but as young men too. Arthur Agee is described by coaches as a player full of potential, but one who still plays as if he is on the playground and not the basketball court. He does not know how to play "team basketball". However, as the movie progresses, it is enjoyable to watch Arthur leave St. Joe's due to financial problems, but go on to mature from a playground player to a team player, leading Marshall to the state title. William Gates starts out much more mature than Arthur does. He is also recruited by St. Joe's and is billed to be the next Isaiah Thomas by many. William starts on varsity as a freshman and is expected to lead his team to the state title four years in a row. William is also expected to keep his grades up, score an 18 or higher on his ACT, and provide for a new addition to his family, his first born child. Obviously there is a lot of pressure on William to succeed, and watching him progress through the movie is very captivating.The movie may focus on the basketball careers of William and Arthur, but another element which makes the movie so good is the added story line of the two player's families. This allows the filmmakers to show the audience the sacrifice the boy's families have to go through in order to help the boys reach their dreams. Arthur's mom in particular represents this theme. She has to raise her family as a single mother for a couple years when Arthur's dad leaves the family. At one point in time she loses her job due to chronic back pain and has to raise her kids on welfare for a while. She and Arthur's struggles are emotionally charged and very interesting to watch those conflicts play out.Hoop Dreams is an excellent documentary, because of the filmmaker's in depth connections of the boy's dreams and struggles with the movie's audience. The film shows the viewers instead of just simply telling. The documentary is incredibly involving and a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Young Athletes, a Basketball, a Court and a Camera Tell the Inside Story of Chicago Basketball Culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original project was intended as a 30-minute short film about two young African-American athletes playing in a yard which was supposed to air on PBS. Several years later, the film became a 3-hour feature documentary film, telling a much larger story than even about the two young athletes. Somewhat similar to Ken Burns' "Baseball", "Hoop Dreams" is an exposé of life in Urban America somewhat removed from much of the fair coming out of Hollywood. The ordeals experienced by these real people, both young and older, make plots of "Beverly Hills 90210" seem mundane by comparison. And none of the participants are actors. Aside from the challenge of basketball itself, these people deal with marginal housing and transporting, food and money shortages, and even an unexpected teenage pregnancy. Also, Gates suffers a knee injury in the middle of the season.Although the outer subject is primarily about William Gates and Arthur Agee and their rise as outstanding basketball players in high school and early college, the film also has a context and subtext about American society. This film exposes the many racial divides which still exist in our society in terms of economic and social opportunities. One message which speaks loud and clear is that many of these youngsters who live on Chicago's South Side believe their only route to a better life may be through a basketball hoop, hence the name of the film. I don't think this is something the filmmakers necessarily intended, but it's a reality that becomes very apparent as the film progresses.Both Gates and Agee are highly accomplished athletes yet they struggle with their academics. Gates has an opportunity to enter Marquette University in Wisconsin, and the sports program there decides to court the young player, offering him a full scholarship to the university. They are already sold on his playing ability, but Gates' one hurdle is acquiring a minimum score on the ACT test which Marquette requires for admission. A councilor discussing the problem with Gates who has not yet scored high enough mentions that if he worked on the test as fervently as he works on free throw shots, he could pass the exam. Agee also struggles with his own academics as well, and then something hit me.Gates and Agee are highly intelligent individuals, and this intelligence exudes itself in spades on the basketball court. Neither could have accomplished their athletic goals without a high level of acumen. But this intelligence is not channeled as successfully into other areas of their lives. Whether we mean to or not, our culture often fragments different kinds of activities. Sports, and sometimes the arts, are not often seen as activities requiring high intelligence, and yet being successful in sports requires as much brain power as writing computer code. And you also have to have a well-trained body. Gates' and Agee's surroundings I believe inadvertently conditioned them to believe that the skills they bring to basketball are not the same as the ones in academic studies. And yet, they never question their ability to improve on the court but have problems believing in their abilities in the classroom, which may be one of the points of Hoop Dreams.Ultimately, the filmmakers chose two extraordinarily gifted people. When I say gifted, I don't just mean their abilities as athletes. These two channeled their gifts into playing basketball but given other circumstances they might have been able to channel them into almost anything. The hope is that these individuals, now adults when I write this, would be able to channel their gifts into any field they choose, and it looks like they have. Only a few hundred people out of a society of 300 million will be able to play professional basketball. Gates and Agee have followed dreams outside of basketball and maybe their participation in this film helped them to do that. At the same time, basketball did help them to realize they could realize their dreams, hoops or otherwise.</fullReview>

Starting as freshman, cameras document the lives of Arthur Agee and William Gates as the pair enters their freshman years at St. Joe's High School, a private institution known for its rich basketball tradition.Gates is considered the next great basketball prodigy to come out of St. Joe's, drawing comparisons to NBA Hall of Famer Isaiah Thomas, who graduated from the school in the 1960s.Discovered by a scout mining for talent in one of the city's many forgotten blacktops of the deprived south side, Agee is much less renowned than Gates, but still earns a partial athletic scholarship.Gates immediately makes the varsity team as a freshman and enjoys a generally successful first two years at St. Joe's. Letters from almost every major college basketball program come flooding in as Gates becomes one of the most sought-after young basketball players in the state of Illinois.After one year at St. Joe's, Agee struggles to acclimate to the school's "suburban" culture and transfers to a public high school much closer to his home in the city.With expectations sky-high entering his junior season, Gates suffers a serious knee injury early on, forcing him to miss almost every game while hampering his chances of garnering a major Division I scholarship.With his father aimlessly wandering the streets strung out on drugs and the family struggling to pay even the most basic of bills, life is even more tumultuous for Agee. The low point comes when the electricity in there home is cut off due to excessive missed payments.Despite his personal and academic struggles, Agee begins to flourish on the hardwood, leading his John Marshall High School team to the city championship and a berth in the Illinois State Basketball Tournament. Along the way, the team fastens a few inspiring - and equally thrilling - upsets of some of the state's elite teams.Wearing a perceptible and somewhat clunky brace, Gates returns for his senior season and seems to have lost his explosive first step and fearless attitude. His team is upset early in the playoffs, putting an unceremonious end to Gates's high school career. Despite his struggles and a re-aggravation of his knee injury during an elite off-season basketball camp, Gates manages to receive, and accept, a full-athletic scholarship from Marquette University in Milwaukee.Agee does not have the grades to attend a four-year college directly out of high school, so the budding talent signs with a Junior College in the Midwest before ultimately transferring to Division I Arkansas State.The juxtaposition of the lives of these two young men make for a compelling and authentic look at inner-city life, big-time basketball recruiting, expectations, pressure and the pursuit of a better life through athletics. You don't have to be a basketball fanatic to appreciate this superb piece of filmmaking either. It's simply a masterpiece that will transcend generations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real story about two young men's journey in achieving their dream basketball career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The documentary is very real, authentic, and touching.It is about two young men in their teens trying to make it in basketball. The movie capture about 5 years of their life in high school as basketball player.They came from tough neighborhoods. Their families went though touch times just to make sure their kids turn out alright. I have a lot of respect for them and their family as well as their school.The movie is almost 3 hour long but every moment is worth watching. A shorter version would not be sufficient to show so much truth and reality.I would recommend this movie for anybody who have have kids who are pursuing an athletic career. They would get a chance to learn the lesson from the two young men and their families.A great work! I would like to thank the filmmakers and the two families.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoop Dreams is one of the richest film experiences of 1994, a spellbinding American epic that holds you firmly in its grip for nearly three hours. Two African-American teenagers (William Gates and Arthur Agee) from inner-city Chicago struggle to enter the world of professional basketball.Epic, moving and intensely memorable, the film tackles the issue of sport as an escape route from the ghetto, but heroically transcends the clichés, delving into the backgrounds of the boys and their families, detailing the obstacles they have to face over four years, and showing us what it means to them to win - a game, a place in the team, a new life. It is truly a great American documentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an amazing documentary movie, that follows the life of two young kids, that want to become an N.B.A players. however, the way turns out to be long an winding.the amazing thing is while the movie is a true documentary, the story behind it is one of the best scripts you'll ever find in the movies. this movie scores high in every aspect of movie making. the natural way the families accepts the presents of the camera and the heroic effort of the crew that followed this kids for something like four years, are just two indicators of the high standards of this film makers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous film/documentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't think of another film that touched me the way this one did. To walk in the shoes of these families for a while, was the best education I've had to date about life in the inner-city. Having been raised in the suburbs, I was always raised to feel afraid of being exposed to the inner-city environment, but through maturity and this movie, I have a newly found respect for the struggles of the families in that arena. I would strongly encourage everyone to watch this film, and understand the strength and perseverance of these kids that follow their dreams with an unbelievable amount of adversity. It made me understand that they are much stronger than anyone I grew up with when I was their age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If someone was to script this, there's no way it would have turned out this good. A little long....but considering that they compressed years and years into six hours, pretty good. Even if you dont like basketball, this movie could intrigue you. I loved it. It works on so many levels, capturing the human spirit, and the hard streets of chicago. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent documentary about the aspirations of high school basketball players from inner city Chicago won awards from the Sundance film festival, the New York Film Critics Circle, and the Academy Award (Oscar) for best editing. Two young men are followed during their entire high-school career, beginning with their participation in playground games and ending with their being recruited by colleges. The obstacles these young men face include parental drug addiction, family poverty, and inner city violence, as well as the usual obstacles that arise in competition, including physical injuries. While each aspires to leave the ghetto, there are many reasons to suppose they may not be able to, despite each beating the odds against them by winning college scholarships. If you have never seen Hoop Dreams you need to even if you aren't a basketball or sports fan, this was great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing documentary of two young urban basketball players.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over a period of a high school career Hoop Dreams follows two young basketball players from Chicago; William Gates and Arthur Agee. While William seems to get his career started in the right place (by the same coaching and school that Isiah Thomas went to) Arthur is let go and switches to another high school with a less prestigious basketball program. The documentary gives us an in depth look of William and Arthur showing us how their lives change as they become stars. I really hope there are reunion sequels as I have felt like I was a part of their life, after learning intimate details of their hopes and aspirations as well as their sometimes very painful parent relationships.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie when I read Ebert's Great Movies. I never saw it before and I had great interest for it. The movie took me a year to find, and it was well worth it.

		<shortDescription>Riveting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As others have said, this is a 3-hour movie that just breezes by! The story of these kids and their families holds your attention more than most feature films.Having said that, I was surprised by many of the others' comments here. I didn't see this so much as a testament to the nobility of people in the ghetto, or any "guilty white liberal" perspective that keeps popping up in the comments here. Instead, I kept getting frustrated by the BAD decisions these people kept making, despite their obvious good intentions, and genuine love for their families.***SPOILERS BELOW -- IF YOU DON'T WANT PLOT POINTS REVEALED, DON'T READ THIS****For example: William Gates and his girlfriend having a child so young. A life-handicapping decision. For a guy with such big dreams, you'd think it would occur to him that that's not a great idea for a high school student.Another example: Arthur's mother going on welfare. Now, here's an intelligent, attractive, well-spoken, able-bodied woman who seems capable of doing many, many kinds of work. She needlessly subjected her family to hardships, when instead, she could have found gainful employment. (Before you all jump on me: Yes, I heard her say she was "disabled" from an injury at work. I didn't buy that -- she could have found some other kind of work. And yes, like other viewers, I was thrilled for her when she finished her nursing program, and thought it was quite ironic that she finished at the top of her class, when her son was failing his work. She was a great role model for him in that regard.)But the scene where she blames "the system" for taking away money from her family: Give me a break, lady!! "The system" gave your kid a shot at a great education. YOU are deciding not to provide for your family in the best way possible.Another example: I didn't feel one bit sorry for William's brother. He CHOSE not to finish college, and he CHOSE to live vicariously through his brother.Final example: Though this is more a tragedy, really, than a bad decision. It really was sad that Arthur's father, who loved his family and had good intentions, was so pulled by drugs and petty crime that he couldn't really "walk the walk" despite "talking the talk" re: helping his son live his dream. I was glad that he seemed to get himself straightened out -- he seemed like a good guy (and Arthur's mother seemed like a decent person, too, despite my criticisms above), so it was nice to see him come back to the family. But it's a tragedy, because that's the kind of crap that tears up inner-city families (just think: If he'd been able to keep a steady job and support his family: How different might things have been?)Other people here blamed the coaches: No way. These guys are doing their jobs. They really want to help the kids, I think. They'd rather see these guys play well, do well in school, go to college and graduate, rather than be screw-ups who can't even pass the ACT (an easier test than the SAT, by the way). I mean, FIVE times to take the ACT, and then the score has to be rounded up to a barely passing mark? Again: Give me a break!! William knew for years what would be expected of him, but he was too distracted by injuries and fatherhood to focus on stuff that a 17-year-old kid SHOULD be focused on.But I loved this movie: Anything that gets you thinking like this MUST be a good film. I highly recommend it.I'd love to see a "where are they now" kind of thing, to see what's happened to all these people, 10 years later....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoop Dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest sports movies ever and not even nominated for a single Oscar(with the exception of Film Editing, big deal). Just a great documentary feature made in 1994. Directed by Steve James and edited by Frederick Marx. One of the most underrated films of all-time.Tells the story of Arthur Agee and William Gates. Both are inner city teens who excel in basketball. It shows the struggles of their families to keep them in private schools that are expensive while keeping them conscious of their academics. They also are trying to get basketball scholarships to college. It is an accurate depiction of the exploitative world of college basketball recruiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manipulated twice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoops Dream hit it right on the nose when it comes to the subject matter it is contending with. But like many, many documentaries, recent or not, it is hard to authenticate the subject when it appears that the treatment has been doctored to the degree that the editing has the look and the feel of a feature fiction movie. For example when one of the young player is opening his mail, there's no less than 2, maybe 3, cameras to cover the event, or, more serious, only one camera and they re-shot it to order to edit a close up insert. Bertolucci once said that a fiction movie is in reality a documentary, as it records what really happened in front of the camera, and a documentary is in fact a fiction, as it is manipulated by, first, the producer's vision, then the director, followed by the cameraperson, and, last but not least, the editor. Roger and Me is another movie that comes to mind when it comes to documentary. A documentary is probably the most dangerous form of moviemaking, as it emanates the aura of genuineness and legitimacy, validating the vision (the goal, more precisely) of the filmmakers. In other words: the agenda behind the movie. Hoops is not necessarily like that, as it documents real life misfortune of the young adults whose dreams are sometimes shattered by the exploitation of real life adults maneuvering their preys for their own purposes. All the same, the manipulation of the movie technique mirrors the handling of the coaches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoy a good documentary so when I stumbled across this one I was optimistic. It takes about 20 minutes of this nearly 3 hour documentary to become indifferent to all of the main characters. The documentary's narrator goes out of his way attempting to draw empathy from the viewer but, at least to my wife and I, it falls flat. The story is about a few children that care not about getting educated, only about playing basketball. The parents and siblings don't make you want to like them either. The families all receive handouts and then have the audacity to complain that their handouts aren't adequate and the system isn't fair because they all deserve greater handouts. As a taxpayer, with a job, this movie is maddening. The parents should not have allowed their children to play any sports, hang out with anyone, or do anything else until their grades were adequate, but when the parents themselves are on welfare I guess their actions are to be expected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is nothing special. Just another story of black kids thinking they are gonna get rich playing basketball and not caring about getting educated. When they find out they aren't that good, they just go straight to the streets usually with bad results.What is hilarious are these people saying they are being exploited and "used". That is total BS. What are they gonna do if they aren't given scholarships, etc? The truth is they are given a free opportunity and its up to them to make something of it. Lets tell it like it is folks.Most of these ghetto dwellers seem to feel they are owed sustenance from the government. Where do they get off thinking that? That is why they are in the ghetto to begin with. Drugs, booze, no father in most families. These people better start taking personal responsibility or they will NEVER get out of the ghettos.Most of them cant keep a job. Did you hear the kids mother complaining that "the system" just doesn't care about her predicament of having 3 kids, no husband, no job, no money? What bs, take some responsibility for your life woman.Look at the Latin people who are in the US now. They care about family. They work hard even though they are dirt poor to begin with. Guess what they will eventually succeed. I admire their work ethic very much.If the ghetto dwellers would do what the Latin people do they would not have near the problems they have. But that will require them to work hard and quit expecting everything to be given to them so you know it isn't going to happen.The bs about how great this movie is is just people licking a.. and being PC. I am glad that it shows how these people really are. Open your eyes and see the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still can't believe so many people told me this was a "wonderful" film. This display of such idolation and worship into basketball fills me with dread and despair. Instead of trying to make something of their lives in a lasting way, these children are tempted and rewarded for physical prowess which is shown to we, the viewers, as transitory and fleeting.This is not about the wonders of the American Dream. Its the American Nightmare, and chilled me to the core.</fullReview>
