		<shortDescription>A brilliant masterpiece of atmosphere and suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one intense movie-going experience. Throughout the entire running time of the movie, the suspense never lets up.The director masterfully weaves the haunting atmosphere, and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. The acting was wonderful, emotional and nuanced, with some unforgettable moments (The two leads - Gyllenhaal and Jackman - give their career best performances, but the biggest achievement in my opinion is Paul Dano's). The musical score contributes to a sense of dread, as well as the rich sound design and the chilly color palette of the breathtaking cinematography.All those parts add up to a rare, gut-wrenching, dark and fascinating masterpiece - the kind that lingers with you long after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Prisoners' is a tightly wound thriller featuring career bests from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a sensitivity that Director Denis Villenueve and writer Aaron Guzikowski inhabit in bringing their newest film "Prisoners" from Warner Bros. to the screen. Starring an Academy Award nominated cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Oscar-winner Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano, this is a smartly constructed and emotionally resound mystery thriller that is thoroughly enjoyable.The synopsis is fully in the trailer. When two young girls go missing, one belonging to Keller and Grace (Jackman and Bello), the other to Franklin and Nancy (Howard and Davis), a hot-shot detective (Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and relentlessly tries to find the clues that could lead to the whereabouts of the missing. When a mentally handicapped Alex Jones (Dano) is found near the scene of the disappearance with no hard evidence, Keller takes matters into his own hands.I have to say that I've never been this hypnotized with the works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman, who is fresh of his inaugural nomination for Tom Hooper's "Les Miserables" has capitalized in a massive way. Approaching his character with the ferocity that made him a star in the "X-Men" franchises, he hammers his way into every scene, keeping the audience guessing about their own moral complexities. He tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done.When it comes to Jake Gyllenhaal, many, and probably for the right reasons, gravitate towards his work in Ang Lee's "Brokeback Mountain" as his shining moment in film history. I believe he's gone deeper in works like "Jarhead" and "Zodiac" but those were just the surface of what he can do as an actor. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. He also orchestrates character beats and ticks that's reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's towering work in "The Master" last year.What is very refreshing in the film is it offers a great reminder of how brilliant an actor Terence Howard is. The Oscar-nominated actor seemed to fall by the wayside following his nomination for "Hustle and Flow" in 2006, coincidentally the same year Gyllenhaal snagged his first, and now has realized his capabilities when he chooses more dynamic and passionate characters. In a film that centers around his involvement, Paul Dano doesn't have too much to offer but is completely adequate in form.The film however is not entirely perfect. Aaron Guzikowski's depth screenplay offers a great mystery story, full of twists and turns, all the bit a tad predictable, but that's not where he falters so much. His construction of the female counterparts, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Melissa Leo, are not as crisply or smoothly put together as I'd like them to be. They each have one "scene" that gives us their character's motivation and the look into their cinematic psyche however, some are thrown in quite lazily and manages to halt the story in spots.The film's technical merits all rise to the abilities of its cast. Roger Deakins, the most overdue Cinematographer in the business, captures stunning portraits of conversations, weather, and scenes that continue to prove his brilliance in the film world. The film's score is masterfully placed by Jóhann Jóhannsson while Joel Cox and Gary Roach edit the film to an impeccable pace. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. I feel there's a shorter cut of the film that would surely be a Best Picture nominee for this year's Academy Awards if it existed. The film could still garner that support with what they have now, but I think there are aspects of the film members won't be able to get around. A high level of violence and torture scenes infused with a longer run time could keep people at a distance. One thing that can't be denied is the towering works of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. The two have offered plenty of memorable performances in their filmography, but their work in "Prisoners" is cut and clear their best they've offered."Prisoners" is a magnificent achievement for the film year. Thorough, enigmatic, and purely amazing. A must-see for the movie lovers.The film opens in theaters this Friday, September 20.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.It simply raises the question: When your kid's life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.For a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.The film's atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.However, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.Highly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman's finest role?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman takes you on a trip through the intense emotions a family is put through during its darkest hour. This may be his best role to date. From the trailers you know that his character will be out for blood as their daughter was kidnapped, but throughout the film you feel his pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does an excellent job of keeping you invested in the film emotionally even through some intensely violent scenes. Its dreary setting provides no comfort, but goes hand and hand with the narrative. This film may not be for those faint of heart but should be a must see for most viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True (and terrific) Exploration of Moral Ambiguity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, what an intensely suspenseful film Prisoners was. The film commences with a naturalistic and peaceful look of a suburban neighborhood, leafless trees calmly swaying along with the cool air that encompass them. All is fine, and a perfectly normal family visits their friends/neighbors for a delightful dinner and some music. Everything is fine and dandy until both family's two kids run off to retrieve a toy they left outside. After pleasant conversation, the two families begin to realize that their kids haven't gotten back yet. The noiseless environment around them feels incredibly unusual, and once they realize that their kids have officially gone missing, chaos breaks loose. We are suddenly presented with a ruthless father (played by Hugh Jackman) who loves his daughter so much that he's willing to transcend any morally difficult obstacles to hopefully locate her. A spectacular cast, ranging from the likes of Hugh Jackman to Jake Gyllenhaal to Viola Davis and Terrence Howard, create such a chilling atmosphere that everyone in the audience immediately notices the discomforting subject matter as they prepare for a disturbing viewing. One should know prior to visiting the movie theater that this film doesn't feature morally perfect individuals. They are all human beings cast into an unbelievably frightening situation, and this is where larges amounts of debate will stir. There's one side of the audience that will persistently detest the characters' actions and the characters themselves, and there's the other side (which I am proudly a part of) that will essentially understand that people can't possibly (always) be the "goody-two-shoes" heroes, perceived in Hollywood blockbusters, in reality- that, by god, I will partake morally and ethically questionable activities to save a precious, loved one, absolutely! Such conversation/argument is healthy for it proves the memorability factor of the film itself. After you witness the terrifically-crafted picture, you will find enjoyment in discussing the movie's events with friends and family with- eventually- two sides forming over the talk. And holy crap is Hugh Jackman entirely convincing in his performance. You can see the longing to find his sweet, innocent daughter through his miserable eyes, filled with redness, desperation, and anger. Then, there's Jake Gyllenhaal as the second lead, playing an ambitious cop who holds a very impressive resume: no unsolved cases left under his plate. Can that mean his skill will greatly help in this predicament? On a similar note, Paul Dano takes the prize after Hugh Jackman for another wonderful performance. No offense or anything, but he completely fits into these immensely creepy and eerie roles. Speaking of, the soundtrack will definitely remain in that shocked mind of yours long after you've left the theater because it fills us with a sense of hopelessness and discomfort. At times, it sounds exceptionally ominous with the disconcerting sound of those violins in play. At others, it sounds like the music weeps for all those involved. The pace never seems to drag even though it clocks in at around 150 minutes as you remain at the edge of seat the entire time, utterly perplexed by everything that's transpiring and wholly befuddled by the choices that these people are making. The film will make you cringe and question the humanity of the participants or the competence of our law (that word could mean two things). Although I was slightly disappointed with the end result, the majority of the film strongly intrigued me. And, oh, how could I forget, the cinematography is simply amazing. Roger Deakins, the brilliant cinematographer behind last year's Skyfall, manages the camera-work of this film as well. As one wise critic said, a drive in the rain never felt so disquieting- a moment of foreboding. Furthermore, I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies like The Avengers. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment and "fun," such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that I'll surely be remembering. The true cinema season has started; now, let's hope every film from here on out delivers like this one did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back from the theater and to be honest I went into this movie with very low expectation! But WOW did it prove me wrong. The film left me on the edge of my seat all the time, one could argue things were slow sometimes but it only adds to the beauty of the big picture.Performance are top notch and if it was for me I would give Jackman his very deserved Oscar for this amazing performance, of course all the other performances were really great also but Hugh's stands out for me.This movie is worth your time, and I'm sure by the end of it you'll keep talking about it with your friends, for me that is a success stamp if the movie can keep my mind busy all the time.This is not your feel-good movie. This is a perfectly paced thriller which I haven't seen anything like it in a very long time. For me this was a totally new experience as I usually go for lighter movies in the cinema, but after this movie I will go out of my comfort-zone in movies more often to find masterpieces like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackman Shines in Villeneuve Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover's each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover's suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard's Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman's performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. Denis Villeneuve's last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.www.killerreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is extremely suspenseful and equally disturbing. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, whose last film was the equally spellbinding and disturbing Incendies, builds up the tension from the first frame and does not let up for the full 153 minutes of the movie. Aaron Guzikowski's script, though on the surface a child kidnapping thriller, bucks all Hollywood trends and, as well as being a taut thriller, poses serious moral issues. It also helps that the film has a first rate cast doing outstanding work: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, Terence Howard, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. Prisoners is not for the faint heated but is likely to feature strongly at next year's Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackman shines in dark thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners movie reviewPrisoners is a Mystery/Thriller film starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, and Paul Dano. Prisoners is a film about two families who both of their daughters get kidnapped and both of the families with the help of the police, investigate and look for their daughters. This is a very dark, grim, and at times is a hard film to sit through. That being said, I have created a PainOmeter scale out of five (five being the worst) to inform you guys if you simply cannot take very violent and painful scenes. This will be addressed along will the film's final score. I loved this film! Hugh Jackman plays Anna's father and is the protagonist of the film. You can see how Jackman really loses his rag and does a great job as Keller Dover. There is one scene that involves Jackman doing something that I won't spoil but you will notice it and go WOW! The story is also very thought provoking and will keep you on the edge of your seat because of the direction and character building involved with this movie. Also Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones, is this weird adult with the IQ of a ten year old and is the main suspect of the investigation. I thought he nailed just the right tone of the character and was hard to "look at" at times. My favorite part of the film was surprisingly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as the detective looking for the missing girls. Gyllenhaal still plays the role of a cop very well after all of that training for End Of Watch. Another great part of the film is that it manages to never take a rest on character building and story development. I hate when films give you time to take a break then start all over again and this film really avoids that entirely. I really have no problems with the film except for the runtime. Even though this was a great movie I just couldn't go for a perfect grade of an A+. I will give Prisoners an A solid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clumsy storytelling that ultimately ruins a potentially good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had no expectations of this movie, as I was dragged along to see it by a mate with a Jake Gyllenhaal fixation, but was pleasantly surprised to find it was a bleak-seeming action/drama with Hugh Jackman too, who's generally excellent in everything he's in. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were really promising. I liked the set-up of the 2 cozy families in their suburban idyll sharing a thanksgiving meal and discovering, to their horror, their kids had somehow gone missing. That part felt very real, very "based on a true story" and had me on the edge of my seat. As the film went on though, the clunky writing and flabby storytelling started to lose my interest.#1. My first big problem came with the utterly implausible discovery of the body in the pedophile priest's basement. First of all, Gyllenhaal's decision to move the freezer based on the flex being dangerously stretched, just seemed...dumb. Why would he care if the guy stretches his flex? It didn't seem from his reaction ("drunks!") that he thought the freezer was hiding something, and yet he opts to shove the big heavy thing closer to the socket because presumably it bothers him. Then - whoa - there's a door there, and whoa it's a big cellar (which is not that weird really), and now - whoa - look a body!#2. And next came a great big WHY? He's a pedophile catholic priest so why was he SO outraged that a man might kill kids. He abuses children but is still so horrified by a killer that he opts to kill the guy who's (again...utterly improbably) has come to him for confession, but not so horrified that he tells ANYONE the guy's story? Or attempts to find out if it's true before he offs him? Instead he just stuffs the body in the basement and drinks a lot. Hmm.#3. My next problem was the biggest and clumsiest of the plot points. Gyllenhaal finds a body and hears a weird-ass tale about child murders (and presumably there's a not a lot of those locally), but despite his incredible intellect and ability to make connections, he doesn't spot the REALLY ODD MAZE NECKLACE on the body until the drawing falls conveniently from his desk alongside it, and make the connection between the two. #4. Why is escaped and presumably traumatized kidnap victim Bob stealing children's clothes, covering them in pig's blood and putting them in boxes full of snakes? It would make sense if he was somehow part of the cover-up, or working for Alex's aunt, but he's not. So for some reason known only to himself he's stealing clothes and making it seem like Anna and Joy are dead when they're not. Presumably because he's traumatized. Or just mental. But either way, it's not really explained, it's just a great big red herring that confuses everything.#5. What is the significance of Keller's dad's suicide? Because if there is no significance, why show Loki reading about it as if it's important? Presumably (again) it's so he can find out that the building that Keller's going to is where his dad died - but so what? Why is it important, other than to cloud the waters and confuse the audience even more. Was Keller connected to his father's suicide, why was no note found...all questions we have no need to ask.#6. WTF is this all maze rubbish? Right from the poster we're led to expect some kind of maze to appear. The serial killer wears a necklace with a maze on it, Alex says "they're in the maze", Bob is obsessed with drawing mazes, so where's the freaking maze man? When Holly gets Keller to back the car up we think "FINALLY! HERE'S THE MAZE!!! But there's no maze down there, just a big deep hole full of old sneakers and dead snakes. No maze, not even a sniff of one. The only maze-related thing as it turns out, is a puzzle book that Leo forces the kids to do while they're kidnapped, presumably traumatizing them with their inability to solve simple puzzles. It might just as well have been Sudoku really, but that might have looked weird on a necklace...#7. And finally, the pointless sub-plot. Just WHAT is the purpose and meaning behind Keller's kidnap and torture of Alex? It has no real purpose other than to provide a weirdly amoral counterpoint to the other story (which would have been so much better emphasized if we'd seen anything of the girls' captivity), and leaves us confused and kind of weirdly angry with the guy. Alex is an innocent child and Keller has tortured him almost to death, so what does that make him? A villain? An anti-hero? A misguided vigilante? No-one seems to care if we know, so we end up drawing no conclusion at all and Keller ends up as a shapeless figure that we ultimately care little about.Ultimately my feeling was that this could have been a good film, if only someone with experience and a keen eye had been brought in to work on the script and iron out the many flaws. The cinematography and the score was great, and it's a testament to the director and actors that the movie was still highly watchable despite the glaring plot holes and confusing storytelling, but on the whole it was a disappointing and frustrating experience and not one I'd recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why You Might Like It: I can go on and on about the good things in this film and why most viewers will enjoy it. It has an outstanding cast that play their parts well, the directing and cinematography are gripping, and the story is something to marvel. This is an excellent film that I highly recommend.Why You Might Not Like It: I don't know why anyone wouldn't enjoy the movie. It does run over 2 hours, so some movie-goers might think that is a bit too long, but I don't think this movie will lose anyone's interest.Acting/Casting: 9.5* - As mentioned, the casting and acting is outstanding. Hugh Jackman gives the best performance of his career in my opinion. Paul Dano is downright creepy and plays his part to a tee. Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and the rest of the cast do great work as well.Directing/Cinematography/Technical: 8.5* - Let me just say that Denis Villeneuve has made his mark in the US after this one. The directing in this movie is gripping and pulls the viewer in from start to finish. I can't say enough about all of the small things that go into making the atmosphere in the movie amazing (the weather, the buildings, music, etc.) Plot/Characters: 8.5* - This is arguably one of the better abduction/kidnapping stories that I have seen. The plot is deep and has many layers that keep the viewer guessing all the way up until the very end. There is no doubt that the story plays a huge role in the final product that you see on the screen.Entertainment Value: 9* - It keeps you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Movies like this are why we go to the movies. Get out and see it.My Score: 9.5+8.5+8.5+9 = 35.5/4 = 8.875 Email your thoughts to filmwatchinfool@gmail.com</fullReview>

Oh, she just "managed" to get away -- she's in a locked room! Drugged! But she "manages" to get away . . . and another oh! her captor couldn't catch her! But the captor managed to get them the first time in broad daylight -- which is never explained! 2 - the captor knows one of her captives has escaped yet makes NO EFFORT to leave, clean up evidence, DO ANYTHING AT ALL, just stays there.3 - and when girl says in hospital "you were there" Hugh Jackman runs away to make him look like the suspect; he doesn't bother to tell anyone - like the cops - I KNOW WHERE SHE'S TALKING ABOUT! LET'S GO NOW, IT'S THE CRAZY AUNT!4 - why did the aunt not kill them after capture? Why do they need to stay alive? 5 - guy gets beaten &amp; imprisoned in a cube of pain for a week, yet can't manage to articulate "my aunt did it." He was coherent enough to say "They only cried when I left them" to Hugh Jackman when Hugh Jackman grabs him by the throat in public; but he can't manage "after my aunt took them away" when Hugh Jackman beats him nearly to death? 6 - cop is angry, goes to his desk, throws things around, by CHANCE things fall on the floor &amp; he sees a new CRUCIAL clue.It's a movie of bad red herrings, and coincidence. PS. Cop goes into a room of trunks and RUSHES to open one! It's full of SNAKES! Now if I opened up the first trunk in a room full of trunks and the first trunk was full of snakes, I don't think I would open all the other trunks, yet Cop wants to open more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overly long, grim and obvious drama with a lack of characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most complex thing to think about the film Prisoners is why any of the Oscar nominated or recognisably 'serious' actors agreed to be in it in the first place. While it is clearly meant to be, judging by the blind critical reaction, a tense, thought provoking, violent and difficult film, I found it to be too dreary, too melodramatic, too obvious and, most importantly, too long.There are few films that can, successfully, keep me gripped for 2hrs35min. JFK is one and that other Gyllenhaal detective drama Zodiac is another but what they had, that Prisoners forgot, was a complex, gripping detective narrative with possibly many solutions and actual characters. It is in these two areas that Prisoners woefully falls short.Focussing, for the moment, on the little good in the film, Prisoners is very well shot by seasoned director of photography, Roger Deakins and not badly played by the starry, Oscar grabby cast, not that they're given a whole lot to work with.That being said, my first problem with the kidnapping plot is that it was obvious. If you, like my wife and I, indulge your silly brain cells every week by watching 45min detective procedurals like The Mentalist, Castle, Elementary, White Collar or whatever, then you will see the ending of the film coming a mile away. This is because, the way it was set up and as it continued to play out, there was only a handful of ways it could play out. Now, I'm sure, for those not so used to the simple twists and turns of evening TV, Prisoners may have been a gripping whodunit but, I am sorry, if you've read any, even mildly, detective orientated books or watched a Murder She Wrote then you'll know the plot, like I did, 45mins in and will have to sit there for another 1hr and 45mins waiting for surly, grumpy, tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal to work it out too. Which he eventually does but even his, supposedly brilliant, 'never lost a case' detective is beaten to the punch by 'very angry indeed' Hugh Jackman.Gyllenhaal's detective is supposed, I am guessing, to be a tortured, dogged genius but we never see any evidence of him really doing anything insightful or perceptive, he's not a fantastic puzzle solver, good with people particularly and there doesn't appear to be a great intellect pounding away inside his furrow browed, slicked back haired head. It struck me as one of those characters him and the director talked endlessly about but forgot to put any of the motivations into the actual script. We are told in dialogue he is brilliant and we are just meant to take it as read, despite the fact that all he does is mundane and routine investigation. Yes he has tattoos, a grumpy face and spends thanksgiving alone in Chinese restaurants but apart from that, we have no idea what makes him tick, oh and his superiors and the police around him are also woefully inept.Jackman is a survivalist, all American, possible religious nut who is also an alcoholic with an atrociously bad temper bubbling underneath a, not very interesting, surface. I was never sure if we were meant to side with him so that, we the audience, were complicit in his violent actions later on but seeing as I didn't really like him from the get go and seeing as I suspected that probably Paul Dano's massively red herring probably wasn't the bad guy (just by watching the trailer) that didn't really work for me. I actually found his reaction a little unrealistic and over the top but then I also found Paul Dano's character as annoyingly, idiotically stubborn as Jackman found him. Mind of a 10 year old or not, traumatised or not, I didn't buy for one second he'd stay silent for as long as he does, when he had no problem talking to Gyllenhaal's character for an apparent 10hr interrogation (we're told and see on video).Maria Bello, Viola Davis &amp; Terrence Howard are all shockingly underused and irrelevant (mostly) and poor Melissa Leo is left playing, what slides very close to being, a comical old grandma part. Complete with bad clothes, huge glasses and a terrible wig. I am, personally, amazed that this film got made the way it did at all and, secondly, amazed that people love it so much. It's not that it's a bad film. It's fine. It just felt very obvious, mundane, grim and too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly repugnant propaganda filled vehicle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's make a crime caper where we have an excuse to show a mentally disabled man get tortured beyond reason. Even if he might be the suspect we are subjected to the overzealous rage filled attacks carried out by the kidnapped child's father. Let's also throw in some religious rhetoric to situate villainy in Christians , elderly widows, depraved sickos and handicapped people.Why were all of these vile charges crammed in just one movie? It leaves me to respond with affirmation that this movie intended to anger, upset and disgust any unsuspecting movie goer. But along with making a crime caper that involves a kidnapping, we are also given a slow moving plot filled with misleading clues, uneven continuity, numerous twists and red-herrings that don't make much sense. Many questions will be asked as you labor through this torturous drama and it only gets more aggravating and confusing. Why would a police department be so incompetent as to have the parents be committing vigilantism without any surveillance? This is highly unlikely in America, even in rural Midwestern towns. Did the writers bother to consult Law authorities on investigative and forensic procedures? Because they seem non-existent in this unbelievable tale.The most unforgiving and unsympathetic performance is Hugh Jackman's character who completely absconds any sense of responsibility and regard for law, humanity and common sense. As we see him emerging into madness and sadistic rage we quickly lose any empathy for him. How is it that any person can enjoy or be fascinated with the brutal torture of a feeble and mentally incapable simpleton? It's just an exercise in ugliness and perpetuates into the extreme. It was overdone. It would have been more believable if the torture was attempted and later foregone, realizing the method of debriefing wasn't working. Jackman's acting is way over the top and fails to draw any sympathy. Perhaps it was bad acting or a faulty script. It's as if the director was pushing him in a weekly actor's workshop to go the limit with unconstrained rage. It doesn't work.I also was annoyed at Gyllenhall's sleepy performance. For a detective who is supposed to have a stellar record, he sure missed much of the insanity going on with the people involved. This movie is also anti-authority and rebellious in its stance. Showing cops get maligned and disrespected is commonplace as the parents just freely go about their neurotic business of vigilantism.Many times I asked myself, 'Why is this happening? What did that mean? How is this guy involved? How did this old lady ever orchestrate such a kidnapping spree without getting caught? She seems a wee bit too old and frail to be carrying out such a demonic feat with grown men. Why did the other suspect break into the house while the mother was there? What exactly was he after? Why would he show up at a Candlelight vigil and make a spectacle of himself? Lame and stupid plot making. Why wasn't the priest ever a suspect before the kidnapping? You would think the police would be led to clues as to the dead man's whereabouts. Why would the old lady wait for Dover's second visit to constrain him? Was she so certain her demonic plan could rebound after losing one hostage? Most reprehensible is this movie's conviction of wallowing in its own depravity. It fails to make a distinction between what we can assert as truthful and moral behavior and what is incomprehensible behavior. This cheesy tag-line, "How far would you go?" only ushers in a weak excuse for someone to go ballistic on anyone they suspect. Even if the person in question has the wrong look in his eye. The question is so bad that it doesn't even deserve to be dignified with an intelligent answer. The question that should be asked is "How much effort does a caring father need to put forth in order to assure the safety of his family, himself and his daughter?" By committing abduction and torture he puts himself in jeopardy and his family.I could go on with more questions, but Prisoners doesn't have any redeeming qualities. A plethora of weird clues such as snakes stuffed in crates, the numerous scenes featuring a maze, weird wall paper, bloody clothes add up to nothing in this labyrinth of trash. It's all shock material that is poorly crafted and handled. And it isn't even believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes wonder if I live on the same planet as critics on IMDb. This is easily the very worst movie of the year and one of the ten worst of all time. Poorly written way way way way too long and so filled with lies clichés and stupidity it boggles the mind. I admit as a lawyer I am biased against these kind of movies where suspects are tortured beaten senseless and arrested with zero probable cause. That Jackman would make this movie after his magnificent performance in Lez Miz could only have been for the money. His role is a one-dimensional idiot without intelligence who gets it wrong from the beginning. Jake G has the worst role as stupid numbskull cop who hasn't a clue as to what is going on. I didn't give a fig about the parents, or their kids. There was zero background on what kin of parents and kids they were. This was not even a bad TV movie, it was a waste of time. Its length is inexcusable, its plot beyond idiotic and its actors were like very bad run of the mill nobodies. They all should be ashamed of themselves--the writer, director actors and everyone else. Don't see this film. Boycott it, and if not tell your friends to forget it, God it was awful!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unnecessarily long saga where a lot happens by chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never written a review but Prisoners got my juices flowing ? in a bad way.The film is way too long, a lot of unnecessary shots, no real emotion, no saving the cat moment (Blake Snyder) on Hugh Jackman's part and one of the most significant fatal flaws in my mind ? absolutely no humour, not a pinch. It's a gritty film (and I get it), but please give me a break! An experienced writer would be able to lighten up the mood and that is a must from time to time.Now, the inconsistencies, silly red herrings and just plain stupidity: Why would the child killer go to confess to a priest when his faith dwindled after his son died and they waged war against God? The priest confirmed that the killer was "bragging" ? so what is exactly the point of going to the priest? Does not sound like a confession issue to me. Fail Why didn't they get the priest to do a photofit and connect the dots that way? If you kill a man you sure remember at least something of him? Why didn't the maverick detective think about the old Auntie's husband going missing all those years ago and perhaps make some sort of connection? Nah, it's not good for the plot. Fail The same maverick detective-solved-all-the-cases finds everything out by chance ? by chance he sees the cable sticking out from behind a cupboard which (surprise, surprise!) is hiding a secret entrance to a secret basement and the priest never even thought of getting rid of the body. Then, by chance again, the maverick detective shoves all the stuff on the floor from his desk and voila! ? A clue again! Fail Why did Hugh Jackman's character need to beat the retarded Alex ? when the genius detective interviewed him, it seemed the phobia of human touch did the job? Plus, Keller never got anything out of Alex although Alex's capable ? when the plot requires ? to utter a completely coherent and revealing sentence. Also, everybody would of course believe the retard but not the father trying to find his missing child. Where was surveillance? Oh, my next point ? the whole police force consists of the genius detective, his superior with an office, a couple of administrative guys and a forensic team of 2 ? get outta here! The genius detective does not only seem to have no training but lacking in common sense as well ? why would you not close the first snake box and let the snakes get out whilst you're opening other boxes? This is just idiotic. Fail Everybody seem to be talking in riddles ? the girl that escaped utters "you were there", everybody seem to hear it, see Keller run out like mad, but for the plot purposes, nobody reacts. Instead of questioning the girl (who, we've just witnessed, can actually speak!), they just stand around in a friendly circle. Fail Keller goes to the auntie's house knowing full well that she's a serial killer and (one in such extreme situation would gather) ? very dangerous. He TURNS HIS BACK to her and mutters a threat. For what I know, she could have knocked him out with a frying pan at that point. Fail The evil Auntie, weirdly, seems to be repeating every command twice ? open the drawer x 2, get in the car x 2, everything's repeated twice ? are the writers short of words? What's going on? Fail Oh, and a note to the director ? try cutting the scenes down or eliminate the ones with people just walking down the hospital corridors ? may add urgency to the pace and people would not doze off whilst watching a 2.5 hour film the story of which does not warrant this length.The list goes on. Yawn... Enough now, otherwise I may write into the early hours of the morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie I've seen this year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't like this movie. Not because of the gore, not because of the language, but because of the pacing, the acting and most definitely the ending. The movie went on for two hours and they left it hanging at a really stupid time - if you're going to purposely leave the ending hanging, leave it at a time point where it's a bit ambiguous and up to the viewer how it ends. But they left it hanging at a point where it's pretty obvious what's going to happen next, but denying the viewers the chance to see the story wrap up (why????)The pacing was terrible. You hardly got a chance to feel and know the characters before things were happening. You felt no sympathy for the girls, who you saw for maybe a few minutes before they got abducted. You didn't share the mum's grief because her acting was so obviously forced. The guy who gets tortured and beaten was (surprise surprise) completely innocent, which was obvious right from the start. The dad is only ever shown stony-faced or blowing his tits in a rage, except for towards the end when his guilt over bashing up a guy who's clearly innocent makes him get stressed and say a few lines of prayer, and then torture the kid some more. And at the end when he finds out the culprit is the kid's aunt, he doesn't even show a single bit of remorse over the horrible thing he's done. Also, the aunt: really? Urgh, so obvious. So tired of the same old formula in every thriller movie: killer turns out to be the one you least expect, someone you were introduced to at the start of the movie, and the crazy story behind them being the unlikeliest killer in the world is revealed only at the end. Halfway through the movie I used that formula to deduce the only person who fit it was the aunt, and prayed to God that this movie wouldn't follow the same boring cliché. But it did, even though they ended up adding a possible suspect later whose storyline they didn't bother to explain and whose purpose was simply to try and lead us off the right trail when they brought out the 'it's the aunt' card right at the end. What was with that guy? Why was he obsessed with pouring pig's blood on kids' clothes? Nobody cares, apparently.Movie makers - if you're going to make the main character some sort of antihero who's morally ambiguous, who does awful things out of desperation, who thinks they're doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, actually put in some effort making us CONNECT with this character. Show us his human side, show him feeling guilt and remorse, show him with his head in his hands saying 'what have I done?', show him feeling worried as hell about his daughter, show him co-operating with the police because he realises that's his best chance of getting his daughter back. Give us a better reason for him taking the law into his own hands than just him thinking he's better than the police at judging who's a criminal and who's not. Show him TRYING to act like a decent human being before succumbing to his emotions and going ballistic. Show him doubting whether what he's doing is really right at all. Show that good side as well as the bad. REALLY show it, because the few moments he showed a sliver of distress, he seemed more angry/upset that the kid wasn't talking than that he may be doing something awful. Because this whole movie I was almost hoping his daughter would die just to serve him right. I felt more hatred towards the father who was alternating between praying to God and torturing a mentally disabled kid than the woman who abducted his child. Epic fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winner: Worst Police Work on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers ahead. Not that it matters.Oh my, what a waste of top talent and resources. This could have been a taut, effective, thoughtful little thriller, but the ridiculous plot holes and logical inconsistencies doom it (along with its unnecessary length). The Hugh Jackman character is such a glaring box-checking conceit that it diminishes any complexity I'm pretty sure we're MEANT to appreciate about him. Religious? Check. Hard-working common man? Check. Struggling in these dire economic times? Check. Adorable, loving family? Check. Tragic family event in past that molded his character? Check. Ironic plot development? Check. (The doomsday prepper gets burned; but wait, that whistle did come in handy, as we knew it would.) OK, let's stop there. I'm not saying the plight of the parents was not moving. Who is not moved by children in jeopardy, parents in misery? It's difficult to not see plots like this in terms of the basest exploitation. But it takes a sure and subtle hand to make it work, and that was obviously missing here. Many have compared it to Mystic River, which is apt, though that was a far finer film, and more believable as a police procedural. I imagine the screenwriter and director wanted us to take a hard look at what might happen when a good man goes bad for all the right reasons, but the lengths he goes to in torturing the Paul Dano character just don't make sense. Yes, maybe that's the point: Keller is beyond "sense." OK, but when the two other parents acquiesce to the torture (albeit somewhat reluctantly, but still), I wanted to throw something at the screen.While I'm still on "character," Jake Gyllenhaal's detective is an absolute cipher. Maybe this was a decision NOT to give him a backstory of any kind because that would be lame. Fine. But in place of that we get a bad haircut, shirt-buttoned-all-the-way-but-no-tie look, some twitchy blinking, and not much else. I was rooting for him mostly because he wasn't actively torturing anyone.Other complaints:*One detective seems to be assigned to this very explosive case. Other than combing the fields for bodies, no one else seems involved in the "investigation." OK, this was probably a decision so the focus would be on Loki (his name,really?) and not on some partner chitchat, and at a 2 hr., 33 min. runtime, I should shut up about it, but it so goes against any police reality, that I couldn't forgive it. *Gyllenhaal makes a decision pretty early that the Paul Dano character is innocent, and so he is released - without surveillance and without police protection, even though Jackman's character has already attacked him. Yes, I know, some perfunctory BS scene with Gyllenhaal's superior was included to explain why there was no surveillance, but that also was stupid. He was their only real suspect. And a search of his aunt's property didn't reveal . . . drugs, syringes, handguns, sedated girls? Nobody looked into the history of this little "farmily"? The aunt is taken at her word about everything. Oh wait . . . she had to be, or Hugh Jackman could not have kidnapped Paul Dano and we wouldn't have a movie.*The priest has a dead body in the basement. Obviously, he takes his vow about confessions more seriously than the commandment about murder. Oh, and that dead body turns out to be . . . Well, you know if you saw it.*The abandoned apartment where Dano is held is never searched (convenient new suspect emerges at critical juncture, too busy to send someone else over there to do a thorough search).*Red herring to end all red herrings: deranged young man with mazes, snakes, pig blood, buried mannequins, stolen children's clothing. *Just in general: too much crazy in too limited a geographical space (see Priest, Snake Boy, Crazy Aunt).*One child escapes . . . while heavily sedated? Crazy aunt nonetheless stays put, does not kill remaining child immediately. Why she was keeping them alive in the first place is not convincingly explained.*ONE person deciding that a dead child means warring with God and creating "demons" by abducting and killing other people's children is a just response to personal tragedy is far-fetched (not impossible, certainly), but TWO! Good times. Of course, the Man suffers a crisis of conscience apparently and confesses to the wrong priest. The Woman (female of the species and all that) has to keep muddling along, killing when she gets a chance. Times are tough (the recession applies to child abduction too). *The maze symbol is both too obvious (morally) and too opaque. Dead guy in basement wearing one, crazy crime re-enactor draws them, imprisoned Dano whispers it? Connection unclear.I wish I had that whistle at the end, so someone would have come and saved me from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>153 minutes long because characters can't talk?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a great movie, sensational, effective thriller, blah, blah , blah. I don't want to repeat things that have already been said. I'll just say what annoys me. Most tension in this movie comes from it's characters being unable to speak. What's up with that?1.So we got this guy, who obviously has something to do with the kidnapping of the two girls, and as it turns out, he was the one who lured them into the van. It was a sloppy kidnapping, they immediately caught the suspect, but guess what,he can't (?)speak. They said that he is on a level of a ten year old, but he behaves as he is on a level of a three year old, but still, he has a driver license(?). So we then come to all the beating,torturing and all the screaming :'Tell me where are they?' If he said: it took them to my mothers house, the movie is over. So he was so resilient to torture or simply he was to stupid to make a sentence that makes sense. The later makes more sense, but on the other hand, it makes no sense at all.2.Then comes the priest who has a rotten corp in his basement. But he just mumbles. Like he's a 3 year old as well. He isn't able to say any useful information. Who's the dead guy, what's his name , how he came to him (or with whom, with what vehicle etc, etc..) He just can't speak intelligible. 3. Them comes the guy who steals kid's clothing, using pig's blood, hiding it with snakes. He's intelligent enough to recognize a cop, to escape him, to, at the first moment, when the cop shows at his home, fool him by saying '' I've never seen you before''. But when they need to interrogate him, he is suddenly like a 3 year old, drawing and mumbling and drooling like a completely retarded person who's unable to say one sentence that makes sense. So we still don't know anything and the movie goes on.4.Then comes the girl that escaped, she's in the hospital, but of course, she is not able to speak. Or else she would tell us where she was held, and the movie's over.5.And finally , when they rescue the second girl, she doesn't seem to speak as well. Or else she would tell them about hidden basement in the yard with entrance hidden under the old car. But no...So somewhere around 80 min into the movie , I had enough. I know that they wanted that exciting, disturbing thriller, exploring moral bipolarity of every human, dark (metaphorically and literally with all the rain and pale colors). But for me this was to much and last 30 minutes was like a torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not recommended for an inquiring mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's basically 2 types of movies: In the 1st type you create a world that is so fictional and different from ours, that the viewer knows to turn off his challenging and logical mind and just go with it. Superman, Avatar, etc.The 2nd type is set in the real world. Sure it's fiction and I understand that to make this type of movie interesting you have to compound coincidences that wouldn't likely all happen in real life. This type of movie, however doesn't get a free pass on the impossible, just on unlikely.So here we have a modern setting in suburban small town New York state where 2 girls go missing. So the entertainment value here is watching how people interact and cope with the situation. Here's a few of the things that's hopelessly unreal: Cops don't go to possible dangerous places alone. Instead they call the SWAT team, or call for backup or at least have a partner.Alex Jones, the kidnapped suspect can do a 10 hour interview with Detective Loki, but can endure days of torture before he says anything to Keller Dover, the crazy father torturer. Doesn't make sense since he's hot the bad guy.Franklin and Nancy Birch, totally unbelievable. Franklin is led to the torture chamber and voices his disbelief several times before joining in. Franklin tells his wife who doesn't call the cops, no she goes to the torture chamber, tells the other 2 how bad they are and they co-operates with them.Bob Taylor, another traumatized grown up child victim, acts normal, holds down a job, but collects clothes from current victims, puts blood on them and stores them in locked boxes full of snakes on his property.So all we have is a story that is not just improbable, but impossible, scene after scene. Much more believable is Obi Wan Ken-obi getting a free pass by wiggling his fingers and saying, "these aren't the Droids you're looking for." That was entertaining. What's entertaining about an impossible fantasy of something so real and horrible as child abduction?</fullReview>

Legend has it that the first-time scriptwriter for this oddity was paid a million dollars, and then the project was shelved because they could not figure out what to do with it. Then they had a brainstorm. Just make it. And here we are with an almost-Hitchcockian pseudo-thriller that occasional resembles a police story and even sometimes a horror film. The story gives new life to the cliché, "plot holes you could drive a truck through." Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his life, but his character is so lacking in empathy that this might not be enough. Jake Gyllenhaal plays himself which ironically is more than enough to carry the role. Maria Bello is lost. Dennis Villeneuve is a great director who can make even the rain interesting and one would like to see him try his hand at something better written. Like the phone book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve, I love abduction films, I like the cast... but this movie was just boring. At one point you'll be about 20 minutes ahead of the supposedly genius detective--who doesn't seem to do much detecting whatsoever. The biggest sin of the film is that you don't care about anyone in the film. You don't care who the "bad" person is, you don't care if the kids are alive or dead, you don't care about anything and you have a LOT of time to not care about it -- more than two and a half hours! Seriously, at ninety minutes this story MIGHT have been captivating. At 150+ it's mind blowingly dull. None of the characters have any basement--none of them have more than a sentence or two worth of backstory to inform their present, the women characters are absolutely wasted. Poor Maria Bello can never catch a break--her character lies in bed the whole movie. Terrible waste.Viola Davis is the best of the cast--she almost always is, but even she doesn't get much room to do anything. The film also goes for numerous cheap shots, blatantly obvious red herrings with no purpose but to manipulate the audience. What a waste of pretty much everyone involved. Ugh.</fullReview>

If you believe that suspects can shoot themselves while under custody at police stations and torturers can stay out of prison after being found out, then this movie might be for you, especially if you enjoy watching torture. They even throw in a pedophile priest who murders a murderer. After all Hollywood can never resist a slam at Catholicism given Hollywood's high moral compass. I rarely write reviews but this piece of crud is such a waste of time that I'm writing it for those people that enjoy Hugh Jackson (I like his stuff) and want to see a movie with him in it. Even the acting stunk the place up, including Hugh's (I guess torture really isn't his bag). If I could give this movie a minus 1000 I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has some essential ingredients for a good movie, such as some good performance by Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Viola Davis, and a good cinematography, but awful script and bad directing. The movie is full packed with stupid gaping holes in the plot, which cannot be digested. The character of the detective is shallow despite the acceptable performance of Gyllenhaal. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is, but in my opinion failed big time. Also,the film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along.Overall, it's disappointing, and I felt I was the prisoner for two and a half hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good first half before the film sadly degenerates into a messy and over-complicated, convoluted second half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is the latest in a long line of critically revered movies- the type of film that gets revered to death by critics and makes it into a number of "best of the year" lists that has me wondering if I somehow got conned into seeing a fraudulent copy of the movie, or if the critics have either temporarily or permanently lost their minds. No doubt a lot of films have left me with that feeling this year (Gravity being another example), but Prisoners may be the worst example. And there's also no doubt in my mind that this film is widely loved by those film school students who only seem to love "film" and not mainstream movies, probably out of sheer fear that they'll probably enjoy one. And what makes it so bizarre that I'm saying this is that Prisoners isn't a bad movie at all. Sure, bizarre, pretentious and way in over its head at times? Maybe. But for the first half at least, the audience can assure themselves that they're about to watch a quality suspense-drama about what a parent does when their kid inexplicably goes missing.No doubt, the first half of this film is incredibly solid and for a while, I was positive that I was wrong about any misgivings I had. It's well filmed, even. Then again, anything shot by Roger Deakins will look really pretty. The film's slow and meditative pace was also a big factor in keeping the film grounded, because it almost made it feel as if everything was happening in real time. When the parents find out their kids have gone missing, their desperation feels incredibly real. Hell, I didn't mind when they brought in Paul Dano in as a suspect as soon as they did, because it did make for some interesting brain work. In particular, the scene where Hugh Jackman encounters him in the parking lot and Dano distinctly whispers, "They only cried when I left them..." was brilliantly executed. However, it's when a second suspect named Bob (yeah, it's not like I haven't seen films about kids gone missing where the kidnapper/pedophile is named Bob... get real) is brought in, where the film takes a turn for the worst. This is where the film degenerates into a mess of subplots that go nowhere, over-wrought symbolism and a conclusion that is utterly ridiculous and insulting. There are some problems early on in the film and moments where the film comes off as weak, but at least it has the performances and cinematography to fall back on. But it's here where the problems become obvious.Alright, let's ignore all the plot holes, big or small, but no matter how big or small the holes hare, it's hard to deny the second half of the movie is full of them. Let's ignore the fact that the film pretty much only happens because of a ridiculous amount of coincidences (so this kid was molested but so was this kid and this one other guy is a suspect because he was molested by this priest guy who trapped this guy for molesting kids who may or may not have been trying to turn kids into molesters and so forth...). Let's ignore the fact that there's enough red herrings in the film to make Dan Brown wince.The second half of the film pretty much is aggressively poorly written and goes out of its way to be as stupid as it possibly can, while trying to pass off as smart- which, if the reviews here are any indication, seems to have worked for the most part. Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, is set up to be this oh-so-perfect and excellent detective who apparently is infallible and has never left a case unsolved. Perhaps they named him Detective Loki because Marty Stu was too revealing. And strangely, we never get any evidence of this and we often see him making dumb decisions (like going twice into people's houses unattended, opening suspicious looking tote boxes that could be filled with something harmful- venomous snakes in this case). The aforementioned paedophile corpse found in the paedophile priest's basement has a bit where he discovers a maze necklace on said corpse (it's never explained why the priest tortured the kid rapist and murderer because HE HIMSELF IS A PAEDOPHILE) and passes it off as just something he wears, but then it takes a drawing just conveniently falling off his desk to make the connection? Oh, and what is it with this film's obsession with mazes? Bob draws them a lot and there's a bunch crudely etched on his wall, and Dano's character keeps repeating something like "There's a maze..." over and over. Then there's the scene during the ultra- lame twist where Melissa Leo, who apparently kidnapped the kids, forces Jackman to hide in a hole covered by a car... great! This must be the maze! But nope, it's just some hole. Oh, and what is this connection between Leo and Dano, and this Bob guy??? He buys kids clothes and splatters them with pigs blood and hides venomous snakes in his home as a ploy to trick the detectives and the families, but their connection is never revealed.Perhaps why this is such a killer is because there's evidence that there's a great movie bursting to get out of here in this 152-minute mess. There's great acting by Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, there's some every pretty cinematography, Villenueve's direction is as tight as ever. I had high hopes for this film, especially being from Canada, where the director is from, however I doubt that it'll be as much of a hit with the audiences as Incendies was, because the film simply thinks it's being clever. But it isn't. And it's about as obvious as a light show at a Muse concert, to make matters worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually agree with IMDb's ratings but unfortunately not this time, This movie was mediocre at best and really nothing we haven't seen before, A lot of Clichés and suspense tricks we've already seen in other movies of this type, I could not really relate to the characters and felt that the dialogs were corny and that I have already seen them on other movies. I could have given it a 7 but it was way way way too long, Could have easily fit into 90 minutes instead of 153 !!! To tell the truth I fast forwarded at least 30 minutes of the movie because I just got bored. The acting and plot were believable for the first hour but after that it got too much for me to even care, This is really NOT the masterpiece everybody here are talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shodding plotting dressed up as art.(Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSThey threw the movie away in the third act! A very competently-made, suspenseful piece, albeit with some of the whiff of anxiety-exploitation around child abduction that, say, The Pledge has, but impressively and seriously put together. A lot of the revelations are guessable, but it'll keep you watching. Yet - in the end - you may wish you'd spent your time watching something else. Because it doesn't pay off.There are many holes, but one key howler.For me, the film makers threw it all away with one piece of "let's go down to that spooky graveyard" plotting. With a jigsaw puzzle this intricate, everything has to be plausible or it all feels like a confection. And when Hugh Jackman runs off - alone, actively avoiding the police and preventing them from accompanying him - to confront the abductor, after learning a key piece of information in the hospital, all credibility goes out the window. HJ's character (Dover) simply has no reason to eschew the police's help once he learns that he has already been at the place where the children are being held. (Which narrows the options right down).The discovery of one of the missing girls changes everything. And acting on evidence gleaned from her is not something the police would resist. A bunch of talented actors and film makers let all their efforts go to waste due to this failure of plotting and motivation. It takes you right out of the movie. Of course, the whistle contrivance eventually makes it feel as if maybe this action doesn't seal Dover's fate (though the ending's ambiguity is a bit of a cop out). But - crucially - this piece of implausible action means that by the end we've kind of bailed.As for the aftertaste, the more you think about it, the more the 'plausible offscreen action' on which this kind of plot and edit relies, is inadequate.If you watch the flashback, which shows the first captive escaping, carefully you'll see that nasty Melissa Leo is held back by a hooded figure, which is how the little girl gets away. We see beige-hooded-coat-guy grab her from behind as she pursues the little girl, and then cut to the girl running and running.Now, there's only one beige hoodie guy in the film - it's creepy Bob Taylor, who by the time we see the flashback, has killed himself in police custody.So: why? Why did he kill himself? And/or why did he help little Joy Birch escape?If he meant for her to escape, why not just tell the cops and be a hero?And if he feels guilty enough to kill himself (why?), what was his motivation to save the girl?None of this is made even remotely clear.We could speculate that it's because he's a loon due to long exposure to LSD (if we think he's another abductee of Melissa Leo's character and her late husband - and this is suggested by the snakes he had; Leo's character says her husband kept snakes). Or maybe he feels guilty that he only managed to help one girl flee.But at this point in the story all he has to give is factual account of what happened and he'd be OK.Likewise, why does Alex withhold the information?Presumably we're supposed to presume that Holly Jones (Leo) had some intense brainwashy psychological hold over both boys. But that's a lot of presuming.So, the plot holes got in the way here. And, as is often the case, the film-makers papered over the cracks with some ambiguity and vagueness which the less discerning will take for artful and intentional ambiguity which makes the film soooo much more interesting.But it's not. It's just shoddy plotting dressed up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Routine and decently made but familiar to the point of blandness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners (2013)A highly rated movie at the moment, but be sure to know this is very well- worked territory, and it's a well made but conventionally made movie. There are some plot surprises but they won't be new ones. There is a detective (well played by Jake Gyllenhaal) but he's a familiar type. There is the parent (four parents, but one in particular, played by Hugh Jackman) who does some terrible things trying to find his daughter?but even this is now old territory (even Mel Gibson took that on).You won't have to suffer the mistreatment of little kids here, which is something some directors would explore and abuse. This is a story about the urgent hunting of the kidnappers before time ran out. There is no real clock to heighten our anxiety, just the feeling that the longer it goes on the more likely the children aren't going to make it. Mostly we follow the detective around as he follows leads and instincts, and the one dad who has his own idea of who's to blame.There is no good rationale for the kidnappings, either. Not money, which would have been easy, but some kind of religious freak craziness is to blame. An obsession with mazes creeps in, but even this we don't quite get. No, the specifics are endlessly avoided. Instead we are dependent on personality, and to some extent that works pretty well. It doesn't make for a whole movie, however.Director Denis Villeneuve has an interesting resume, including the hard-hitting "Incendies" which has (unlike this movie) a clear and sensational plot line. I'm not sure what made his drag this movie to an hour and a half?some economy might have been the main thing it needed, though the lack of explanation almost makes it seem a half hour has been excised already.Lots of people will not agree with me (apparently) but as a "useful" review I'm really trying to lay out the basic qualities that you can then judge for yourself. Bottom line? It's not boring even if it seems long, and it's a kind of film I like so I enjoyed it in a mild kind of way. That's a start!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 90 minutes you just want it all to end!I'm growing awfully tired of movies that just make no sense whatsoever and then just to compound your misery there's 3 or 4 pieces of the jigsaw left out of the storyline which just leaves you scratching your head at the end and wondering what's actually happened?The girls' abduction was just so abrupt and sudden you just never had a chance to make any connection or have any emotive feelings for their plight to begin with. That sort of set the tone for the rest of the movie - flat and devoid of feeling.I'm still unsure as to the motive behind the abduction and drugged imprisonment of the 2 young girls - let alone what part the mentally impaired adopted son and the detached other member of the family that likes snakes and purchases children's clothing have played in proceedings?Yet another film that's not been particularly well directed or edited and should have went straight to DVD or held back strictly for TV. I just can't imagine sitting in a cinema watching this for 2 and a half hours. You'd have a numb brain as well as a numb bum!4 stars solely to Jake for adding an element or two of tension and drama throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Americanism Through Foreign Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writing about James Fennimore Cooper, D.H. Lawrence said, "the essential American soul is hard, stoic, isolate and a killer. It has never yet melted." Prisoners is a Canadian director's meditation on this passage.Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans opened with Hawkeye shooting a deer and then praying over the dead animal. Prisoners opens with Keller Dover (Jackman) saying the Lord's Prayer as his teenaged son sights in and shoots the deer that will be Thanksgiving dinner. The parallel is no accident. Dover thinks of himself as the Deerslayer. He's a self-employed, self-reliant workman with a basement full of canned goods and ammunition stored against the breakdown of society, which he expects at any time. He's a survivalist and a handloader. He lives in a nondescript former industrial town somewhere in the part of Pennsylvania that James Carville described as Alabama. His suburban house is the smallest in the neighborhood, with the siding stained dark brown, looking like a log cabin. His only vehicle is the pickup truck from his contracting business. He seems to have come down in the world from his late father, whom he revered, and he's just barely keeping up with the mortgage. Though not a political word is spoken, he's prime Tea Party material. His belief in himself and his disdain for institutions are going to be tested to the extreme when his five year old daughter and her neighborhood playmate disappear, victims of an apparent abduction, on Thanksgiving afternoon.This is a foreigner's take on the United States. The director, Denis Villeneuve, is a French-Canadian whose last movie, 2010s Incindies, was a perceptive look at the Lebanon civil war of the 70s and 80s. Villeneuve is looking at a society whose individualism, distrust of authority, and general availability of firearms are very different from Canada, and he does not take those things for granted in the same way an American director would. Prisoners makes an interesting companion to this summer's Still Mine, a Canadian story about an old fashioned self-employed individualist who falls foul of local authority in rural New Brunswick. I've long thought that the Canadians are King George's dutiful children while Americans are his rebellious ones, and the two pictures set off the contrast nicely. This is an anthropological look by a Canadian at what a very American man like Keller Dover might do when his child is kidnapped.Villeneuve uses one of the more annoying tropes in American movies to humanize Dover ? the Validating Black Guy. Cousin to the Magic Negro, who puts the white protagonist in touch with deeper values, the VBG's function is simpler ? to show that this white man, regardless of his other faults, is actually all right because he likes black people and they like him. Dover's neighbor, friend and one-time high school buddy Franklin Birch (Howard) and wife Nancy (Davis) are cast as black because otherwise Keller Dover would come across as a complete redneck.But the essence of the Birches is class, not race. They live in a nicer house and are much more securely in the middle class than the Dovers. Nancy's a veterinarian and Franklin looks like he has some kind of office job. Their function is to react as decent, normal middle class folks would when their daughter is abducted and when Dover goes off the rails looking for the kidnapper. The parallel with our reactions to 9/11 is pretty obvious, but that's not where the movie ultimately goes.The spousal relations break pretty clearly along class and historical lines. Nancy and Franklin Birch are a contemporary married couple of the upper middle class. They pull each other through. He confides in her, she's probably the stronger of the pair, and her moral judgments are the last word between them. The Dovers are almost 19th century. Grace Dover (an under-used Maria Bello) is passive; a pure housewife who looks to Keller as her protector and hero. She breaks completely under the strain, spending all of her time in bed under sedation. Her husband is content to have it so, keeping his activities secret and warning his son not to let his mother know what is going on.Dover's opposite number and antagonist is Detective Loki, the star of this small town police force, and apparently the only detective on the case. (I find this improbable. For a crime like the abduction of two five year old girls, a one horse police department would get overwhelming support from State Police detectives). Loki is zealous, smart, though not as smart as he thinks, and willing to fall back on shouting and violence when nothing else seems to work. He's cracked every case he ever worked on, and he expects to crack this one. He's also got the official mindset that regards Keller Dover's insistent involvement as a clear nuisance if not something worse. But he's got far more energy and drive than his police chief, a mediocre man who has learned to rationalize mediocrity with philosophical resignation.The plot is full of trap doors and red herrings, and you have to pay very close attention to the dialog to pick up what you need to know. Even if you do, I think that one key element is left unexplained. You will be completely involved in what comes next for two and one-half hours, and there will be a lot to chew on when it's over. Definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over Done Script, Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners, being argued as one of the best movie of the year, left me disappointed. The backbone, the script of the film is highly manufactured. It's very apparent that the writers decide to maze up a simple idea into something astounding. However, the plan backfired, and in hindsight we might as well think that the film would have been better off as a simple family under stress episode.Gyllenhall, Jackman, Bello all pack in great performances, trying to carry the inconsistent story line and loop holed play, but that would not be enough. Gyllenhall, continuing from End of Watch, plays the clichéd part of the super smart Detective, (who has solved every case he's been on....duh), and throws in some great improvisation, which makes the part more likable. Jackman as the troubled father is near perfect, in perhaps one of his finest performance.As is typical of any Hollywood thriller, there are quite a few psychos on the prowl, some over the top scenarios and of course unreal backgrounds that pop out of nowhere.Watch it to enjoy a great acting fest, but not for a great thriller.</fullReview>

There are so many absolutely absurd holes in this plot that we spent more time pointing them out to each other than watching the film. The soundtrack was poor, which was unfortunate, so we often missed key words or sentences and that didn't help, I'll admit. But it really was the writing of the plot that put us off. If actions taken by the characters don't make sense, then we lose interest and that's what happened with us about an hour in.I'll not bother saying more than that as it would constitute spoiler after spoiler if I picked apart what we saw. You can make up your own mind if you watch it and perhaps you'll make more sense of some of the characters' actions than we did.I'll just end by saying that it might try to be a modern "Silence of the Lambs", but it falls far short of that high standard.</fullReview>

However, I did finish watching it. If this movie had been quiet throughout, it would have helped insomniacs to finally get a good night's sleep. Watching paint dry is a better alternative. One of the ironies of this film has to do with one of its producers - Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg was one of the leads in Peter Jackson's, "The Lovely Bones." Prisoners is a poor ripoff of that movie. The Lovely Bones was a superior film in every respect. Prisoners isn't a film that's worth watching more than once. The Lovely Bones is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the film starts with a promising air to it, the pace is good and you're thinking oooo this is gonna be good... That's short livedThe rest of the film is just long drawn out randomness... It was 80/90% predictable throughout.There are tons of wtf are you doing moments too...There are a couple scenes where the director must have said to the editor "whatever, do whatever you want". The story seems all chronological and then There is a random leap forward which suggested that they had way too much footage and had struggled to squeeze into an already extra long movie...I mean if you can tell the story in an hour and half you're not doing it right..,seems these days 2 hours is standard but this goes into 2.5 hours! And then instead of ending where it should have and throwing in the culminating scenes all together they drag it out some more and try to be clever with an open ending roll credits moment where you sit there for a second in disbelief than they could have the audacity to do that to viewers.. Then you look at the others in the room and everyone sighs and huge wtf kind of ending was that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not go too deep into the movie, but this is a movie that should not take place, past the discovery of skilrex in his RV. The children would be found at his aunt's compound almost immediately; there is nothing she would be able to conceal in the face of a search warrant for missing persons. The story would end right there, as the children are found, and are reunited with their parents.They had to make detective loki the worst detective in the history of movie detectives in order to continue the story. Here are some more silly contrivances. -Loki drives at high speed, the child to the hospital, suffering severe vision problems after being shot in the head upon the discovery of the aunt's dead husband -skilrex and the wannabe snake guy are past abductees, obsessed with mazes.. but the backstory of mazes is not explained in any way, shape or form -skilrex is supposed to be mentally retarded? I've never met a mentally challenged person that acts like that.. why couldn't he just be autistic? -loki sees the dead pig head in the sink, but has the parents identify the clothes, leading to the parents believing their kids are dead, ahead of receiving the lab report on the blood -loki for some strange reason dismisses the B&amp;E from the wannabe, despite there being an open window.. only later does he find clues left by wannabe .. I can't remember the rest, but there are moreIn any case the acting and atmosphere are pretty good, so if you ignore the gaping plot hole, you might enjoy it.. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Police 101: Never enter an interview room with your duty weapon. This movie displays why.Police 102: When a person is examined and displays the mentality of a 10 year-old, yet possess a driving license, a detective worth his weight would enquire at the license office how this came to pass. Something might be learnt which sheds light on the reality of the displayed behaviour. Something a seasoned detective would not ignore.Other law enforcement failures, but the movie does do well otherwise.Jackman and Gyllenhaal play very believable characters. I was quite impressed with Jackman's part. His emotions are running wild as he wants his child found. And Gyllenhaal does well feeling stymied by the system and a Captain who is more worried about perception and budget than solving crimes. Great acting on all parts. Very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the Thanksgiving, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello), their teenage son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and their little daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) go to the home of their neighbors and friends Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), their teenage daughter Eliza (Zoë Soul) and their little daughter Joy (Kyla-Drew Simmons) to celebrate together in a lunch party. Anna and Joy want to play on the street and Ralph stays with them. The girls play in a ROV and Ralph brings them back home. Later Anna asks her father to go to their house with Joy to seek her emergency whistle and Keller tells her to call Ralph or Eliza to go with them.Later the families realize that the girls went alone have vanished and they call the police department. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case and he arrests the teenager Alex Jones (Paul Dano) that drives the trailer. Soon they learn that Alex has the IQ of a ten year-old boy and he is discharged. When he is leaving the precinct with his aunt Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), Keller presses Alex and he says to Keller that "the girls have not cried when he left them". Keller asks to keep Alex imprisoned during the investigations, but Loki cannot hold him anymore. While Detective Loki investigates the pedophiles near the location, Keller decides to abduct Alex to torture him and find where his beloved daughter and her friend are, crossing the thin line between right and wrong. "Prisoners" is a mesmerizing, ambiguous and gritty thriller about the kidnapping of two girls by a sick serial-killer. The plot is divided in interesting premises that raise the discussion of what is right and what is wrong when the life of your daughter is in danger. Is Keller right or wrong abducting Alex after listening to what he told him? The police work is flawed, leaving Alex without surveillance just like in the real world. This movie has magnificent cast and cinematography and the story has glimpses of the dark Franc-Dutch "Spoorloos" (1988). The open conclusion is another plus in this movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Os Suspeitos" ("The Suspects")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Raw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is the kind of movie that has little to no action, but is more of a watch to see details and listen closely dialogue. It starts out joyful and happy, almost immediately it is filmed (and acted) so that it is incredibly realistic and relatable. Things change drastically when the two little girls just vanish into thin air. Now, I won't give away spoilers because I don't want to ruin this movie for anybody but let me tell you this, it is incredibly wrong and at times a little slow but it holds true to the realism of these kind of events. You bite your nails wondering where the children are and you begin to doubt if Hugh Jackman is doing the right thing by abducting (and torturing) a boy who he thinks took the girls. Each parent is shown as they spiral downward from fear, anger and loss. Jake Gyllenhaal gives his best performance as Detective Loki, his bad ass attitude slowly chipping away into desperation. The movie may not be the best out there but emotionally, it makes you question how far you would go to find the person you love and just how hard will you cling to the belief that you are right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relentlessly grim...and rather predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRISONERS seems to win a lot of plaudits amongst reviewers on here but I'm afraid it's the type of film that left me cold - literally so. Like MYSTIC RIVER, this is a film that has an icy gloom about it, with broken, unlikeable characters, murky cinematography, and a relentlessly grim storyline. It's the sort of film you watch and then go and have a cold shower afterwards in a bid to get rid of some of the ickiness.Sadly, the storyline of this film is a very predictable one that borrows heavily from other movies, and originality seems to be in very short supply. The first half of the picture involves child abduction and revenge and seems to have been borrowed from the B-movie THE TORTURED, although thankfully it's not quite as graphic as that film; it's still nasty, though. The second film turns into a police procedural triller with nods to ZODIAC as a grim-faced Jake Gyllenhaal wanders around trying to piece together clues.On top of all this, at two and a half hours PRISONERS is overlong and rather stodgy. The only thing it has going for it is the A-list cast, which lifts the material quite considerably. Hugh Jackman is fine in a serious role, and we know Gyllenhaal can do this sort of thing in his sleep. Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, and Melissa Leo are all solid too. It's just a shame the material is so below par given the ratings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>153 mins. Why?The opening sequence is joyful. I got a laugh when black dad couldn't play the trumpet, and the kids were happy. Then the disturbing disappearance.It's intense, it's elaborate. But it's just an extended episode of a cop show - and there's loads of unrealistic scenes where the cop investigates on his own. That's denial of pension rights there.One great thing is the performance of aunt Holly, but the director cut it short. What about a chase scene where a lithe granny outshoots a dull detective? Never seen that before.And one great irony was the torture of the child-man by the desperate parents - how could they ignore this in the end of the story? Nuts.I've read great stuff about this director, but it felt ordinary (except for the snake thing - like the spider in Enemy?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as it could have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the movie was fine, good with the RV and the girls leaving. The movie really fell apart when they brought the Alex guy into the police station. They say he has a low IQ so he couldn't have done it alone. OK thats great but why then would you not look at his guardian after that? And he was a kidnapped boy himself so wouldn't he be in the system? I know he was not arrested , but seems to me they would check more then his name for a double kidnapping. Not to mention he wouldn't has a ssn and they can tell when he got it under that name which would lead to a DNA test anyway.After that though he is kidnapped and again by Jackman character. Why would that detective who has never lost a case not think to finish searching the residence finding him. Also don't these family men have jobs? Plus no captain would leave him without a car to watch him in the first place. Aside from that they have these clues to finding the girls like the maze, and chose to instead lead this line of Jackmans character torturing Alex. They do not have any part of this movie dedicated to what's going on with the girls so glad I didn't spend money when this was in theaters. Acting was good has a good plot with the kidnapping just done very wrong after the first few scenes. Very unrealistic from a legal stand point. Also did a bad job of keeping me engaged I paused the movie about halfway through to check my phone and facebook even got on youtube. Writing and directing failed this movie its a shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow paced, tacky decisions, poorly constructed, and unresearched,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is slow paced and there are many slow long drawn out scenes. the movie would benefit if it moved faster and had different shots &amp; angles and possibly even music in different scenes. personally i feel overall this movie was poorly constructed and would have been much better if worked on by a team of different professionals.this movie lacks some realism. this movies version of realistic scenes is....so holly-woodish and fake. i mean certain scenes seem to me as an avid-movie buff to be.....as real looking as a fake apple is to hold and touch. and the dialogue and decisions of the characters and their character-build are as sharp as a polished marble.some things i didn't like: i didn't like the African American actor who played one of the fathers in this movie. i don't like the way he looks, sounds, or that he couldn't play his instrument in the beginning, and i don't like his comments. i would have preferred him to be someone else with different dialogue, and directions. i don't like how the detective in this movie looks like a frickin ex-con prisoner. when i first saw him i thought he was the antagonist/bad-guy. the detective was made to look this way cause some fool in the production crew thought this was the hot-guy look teens go for and maybe her personal preference for men so she (or he?) made this character look this certain ex-con fashionable way. to me his look and the things he says and does is totally unprofessional. I didn't like how the detective talks to his boss (captain) with disrespect and disdain in his voice as if he is superior to him- the the captain hearing and witnessing this disrespect allowed it and seemed incompetent. this to me seems entirely unresearched and fabricated. in other words it's unrealistic. if a detective talks to his commanding officer in any agency in any town the way this fellow does in this movie he would be looking for a new job quick. yet im supposed to buy that this hipster cool detective can get away with this? why? and his captain is some loser behind a desk? is this a comedy? no. its just badly written because it's unrealistic.Anyway...the detective is supposed to be some genius of a guy who has solved all six of his cases and the actor who plays him does as good of a job as he can with poor dialogue and direction but unfortunately its not enough to save his poorly constructed decisions. what i mean is- this actor does what he is told to do- and he is told to do some dumb things by the director/writer. otherwise i have no problem with the way he looks or talks to his captain. what i mean is- he is SUPPOSED to be a genius detective but what he actually does and says in this movie opposes his role as a genius because there is nothing highly intelligent about discussing astrological signs in his opening scene, being disrespectful to his boss, and disregarding rules and doing things by the book. nothing he does is really special at all is what i mean.....he has this higher than thou attitude but what we see him do in the movie is new yorker-ish in the bad attitude sense and is common! so he is written and introduced by another character as being "special" but he does nothing special! His actions are rudimentary and unprofessional- that is why i say this movie is poorly constructed and poorly researched!This movie reminds me of some South Korean thriller movies but are not as fast paced and fun to watch as them. I recommend you watch The Chaser and I Saw the Devil if you liked this junky movie.The things I liked about this movie: The main characters Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have great acting skills and presence in this movie. they are likable fellows and i enjoy seeing them in this movie and have an affection for them because of other movies i have seen them in. they practically save this poorly structured and poorly written movie. without them this movie would appear on Lifetime channel as a TV movie as it is poorly made like one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed Opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tricky one. I'm going to try and avoid any form of spoiler so there'll be a certain amount of tip-toeing through the tulips. Denis Villeneuve's 2013 drama was released to widespread popular and critical acclaim.Hugh Jackman plays Kelly Dover, a survivalist minded yet ultimately decent man committed to protecting family from a hostile world. However, Dover is thrust into impotence when his daughter and her friend go missing. As the pressure mounts on the police to produce results Dover takes matters into his own hands.So, a great set-up. It looks great. All mute greys and dark brooding realism, but, it is shot by Roger Deakins so we would expect it to be visually fine. The characters are well drawn. The drama unfolds gradually and slowly over the first 90 minutes and is absorbing, gripping with the smack of truth. The performances are good (Maria Bello as the distraught mother and Gyllenhaal as the frustrated lead police investigator in particular). Maybe, it's being a father myself but I found Dover's sense of frustration and impotence at his inability to protect his family engrossing and the film asked some profound questions upon the line we draw for own limits and actions.However, everything collapses in the last third act as the film decides to get, well.... silly. All the good work done previously is undone as the plot takes a turn to the formulaic. It's as if the film-makers lost confidence in their set-up.The film switches tone from an engrossing drama into a rather silly police-procedural/ serial killer finale. From fine to formulaic in one movement. At one point I was expecting to hear, "He puts the dog into the basket..." The potential to be great dissolves away and the film becomes merely.... OK. Which is probably more of a crime than being rubbish. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, was I wrong about this movie.I thought it was, in fact, about "prisoners" in prison ? maybe trying to escape and I put it off for the past 2? years, although I did want to see it and others expressed high praise for it. I just thought it was some Shawshank Redemption film about the wrongfully accused. And I did keep thinking the dad was going to play that role in the first half to two-thirds. But, that couldn't be further from what this great movie was. It's an incredibly well-written, wonderfully acted, deep and moving thriller about two families struggling with the loss of their respective daughters. It's also a definite movie to see at bare minimum a second time.One wonderful (to start with) Thanksgiving, two neighboring families enjoy their meal together and in a blink, two of the family's daughters vanish. When one young male is accused of abducting the girls, one of the rightfully distraught fathers makes it his mission to find his the girls by making the man talk. All the while, a police detective is attempting to find them, too, but using the law and his instincts vs. the emotional father's antics. Probably the only downfall of this movie is that it's just too long. As much as I enjoyed the movie as a whole and all the interesting, sometimes shocking, sometimes very emotional scenes, it just kept going on and on. That said, I am SHOCKED this wasn't nominated for the many awards it deserved. The two leads themselves, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal alone should've nabbed some competing acting nods, not to mention, best picture and screenplay.While it's easy to compare this to the following year's Gone Girl, they're pretty separate in stories, though close to the thrill of the chase and intrigue. This one was slightly better, and it didn't have Ben Affleck, to boot. So, if you missed this one, but loved Gone Girl, you really need to see this.Actually, just see it, no matter what. It helps if you have small children as you can sympathize, but even without kids, it's still an emotional roller coaster that's great all the way to the ending.***Final thoughts: I don't know why I stayed away so long. So many recommended it to me. It was my invalid vision of what the movie's plot was and hopefully I won't let that happen again. Definitely want to see this again fairly soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keller and Grace Dover's worst fears come true, their six year old daughter Anna and her friend Joy go missing, suspicions point to Alex Jones, the driver of an RV which was parked near by. Detective Loki is in charge of the case, he has no choice but to release Alex, having only circumstantial evidence to hold him on. Desperate father Keller decides to take matters into his own hands, kidnapping Alex, hiding him behind a false wall and battering him regularly into a confession.This is one of the darkest, most bleak films I can remember, almost slightly too bleak in terms of tone, a wee bit too harrowing in parts, that said it was exceptionally well acted, well directed, and definitely one of those films that stirs the emotions. I wish it wasn't so long, it seemed to go on forever.Far from being a feel good film, it's violence with linger with you long after the credits have rolled.Paul Dano was brilliant in his part, such a good actor, possibly the best element of the film, although Jackman puts in a stellar performance too.

		<shortDescription>Crime Story For Adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in "On Dangerous Ground" (1951) in which half-crazy detective Robert Ryan is about to beat the living crap out of a suspect to gain information. Ryan's features twist into a pustule of hate, hardly human. "Why do you DO it? Why do you punks make me DO it?" And then he goes frantically to work.This is a a more complex story of the kidnapping of two little girls and the lengths to which the parents and police are willing to go to either retrieve the victims or find the bodies. But the most complicated character, the father who engages our interest because he instrumentalizes his grief and anger (Jackman), does more or less what Ryan does in the earlier film. He goes berserk, tramples on the law, and reduces a half-wit that he suspects to a bloody pulp.There are harmonies in the sometimes torpid story that I didn't quite get or wasn't sure of. There are ominous organ chords, a drunken priest who is a red herring, and references to penance. There's a candle light vigil for the girls. It's deep enough, even without any spiritual content. After all, when you get right down to it, the question raised by Jackman's tactics is: "How far is it ethical to go in torturing a prisoner, even in a good cause?" It's a medieval issue but recently a more contemporary one.It's a long movie -- too long, really -- and it could have benefited from more ruthless cutting, yet it all adds up. The director, Villeneuve, effectively captures the drab aspects of working-class life in one of those flat, brick, ranch-type residential neighborhoods on the outskirts of a small town in Pennsylvania, actually shot in Georgia.The acting is, well, hard to describe in a word but maybe "naturalistic" will do. It's something like "All The President's Men" in that respect. The kidding around and the hesitations and interruptions don't sound as if they were being read from cue cards.Jackman is fine as the enraged father who is determined to beat a confession out of his retarded prisoner, but he's not a sadist. He doesn't ENJOY doing it. And the scenes are truncated, avoiding the nasty current affection for torture porn that has infected movies like "Unthinkable" or the unbearable "The Killing Gene." The viewer is likely to be "for" or "against" the other characters but Jackman's is problematic. He's not just rude or irrational. He's brutal. It's what makes it the most interesting role.In fact, everyone pulls his or her weight, but Maria Bello is truly impressive, though she doesn't have that much screen time. And Mellisa Leo as the mother of the chief suspect is outstanding. One of those distant, suspicious, kindly authoritative, slightly sour Midwesterners, though she's from New York.The ending collapses in upon itself. People do idiotic things like search dangerous places without calling for back up. Without warning, a familiar character splits open and reveals the demon within. Cliché follows cliché. I still don't exactly understand it. The rest is tense, involving, quite well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is like that one friend or comedian you know who's know who tells overly elaborate stories or jokes that you have to applaud for the effort if nothing else. Intentions seem to be in the right place, delivery is going smoothly, there's a handful of ups and downs that aren't terribly cliché but you swear you've heard one or two before, and when all is said and done you nod in approval and open the door knowing they'll be back soon in another form with another tale.Comparisons to strange friends aside, Prisoners does its best to keep a child abduction story above Lifetime Movie levels. What does this is the acting of the two leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman, and the violence both on display and implied. Jackman convincingly continues down a rabbit hole of anger and frustration as a distressed father, and Gyllenhaal almost follows suite as the detective assigned to the case. Both elevate the material a bit, but neither can save it from the excessive runtime of 2 1/2 hours and a handful of mystery/suspense clichés. If it weren't for the cast and the caliber of acting the film wouldn't have made the splash it did when it was released.</fullReview>

Its a terrible feeling that the director puts you through and I hate him for that. I would wait for the DVD and hopefully he will fix the ending on a special extended directors cut edition then you will have the ending this movie deserves.

This suggested that the film must be struggling either because of quality or because it is a hard sell ? and it certainly seemed that the latter was most likely to be the reason for the sales push. The plot sees two young girls go missing on thanksgiving in a small rural town; a suspect is found and while the police try to figure it all out, the emotional impact on the two families starts to take its toll.This is a hard sell, even before we get to the meat of the story everything has a downbeat tone ? even Thanksgiving seems a subdued affair with the grey skies and rain. From here it gets darker as the children go missing, the investigation starts and morality is testing in the actions of the characters. On this level it mostly works pretty well ? mostly. The realistic tone to everything draws you into the story and it keeps you there as things start to get murky both in terms of the investigation but also the actions of the characters. This offered a much more interesting film than just a straight police procedural and for a lot of the time it does have real impact to it, but gradually it shies away from it ? having its cake and eating it at the same time. This leaves the mystery which is also not as satisfyingly as I would have liked; it was solid enough but with the cast and the dark, adult tone to the film, I was hoping that the narrative would be brave enough to match it in many ways. It did a decent job, but it really did feel like it walked it back too much in too many ways. In terms of length it does run long and would have been better if the mystery hadn't included so many different branches within it.The cast justify the tone and everyone is excellent ? to the point where I wished the material hadn't seemed to lose it in the final third. Whether this is a shot at Oscars I don't know but everyone is as strong as the castlist would suggest. Gyllenhaal has a straightforward character but makes a good presence from it; he has an intensity and presence that works for him and the film. Jackman does a great job with a changeable character ? bravely ploughing into his actions with determination and as a result it is a shame for his performance that the film doesn't hold together as well as it should for the final third. Support is generally very strong as you would expect from Bello, Howard, Davis, Leo, Dano and others.Overall Prisoners is an engagingly dark and murky crime thriller. The mystery is flawed but still good, while the morality questions are well presented if not fully followed through. A shame for the strong performances that the film doesn't totally hold it together and deliver, but it is still worth watching for what it does well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glum, overlong, and goes off the rails before the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two small girls, the daughters of two families, are abducted while playing outside. An unbalanced man is taken into custody but released for lack of evidence. The detective on the case continues to pursue leads, but one of the fathers takes matters into his own hands, seizes the suspect, and tries to extract the location of the girls from him. But maybe he doesn't have the right person...There are good things about Prisoners, starting with the performances of Hugh Jackman (father Keller Dover), Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), and Paul Dano (suspect Alex Jones). The situation is a good one, the moral issues are interesting, some suspense is generated, and the cinematography and production design is very good at conveying a cold, dark world where cold, dark things happen.There are some not-so-good things about it too. At 153 minutes it is overlong by at least half an hour. The final third goes seriously off the rails story-wise. The moral issues are never really addressed. The female roles are, by and large, underwritten. And, ultimately, it is a somewhat dispiriting movie.I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prejudiced story about Justice for the few. **warning spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****Warning Spoilers don't read this if you plan to see the movie****This fascist propaganda movie could actually have become a good story with the right ending and message. Seldom have I watched a movie where I ended up hating practically every character shown. In terms of depressing finale this movie even beats "funny games" since I actually started rooting for the so called "bad guys". What scares me is that most people don't grasp how morally repulsive this movie really is. It makes me scared of todays society when movies like this one gets an 8.1 average rating and most people actually think that the end justifies the means, and that police brutality, torture, sadism, suicide, assault, retaliation are stuff you can be OK with if there only is a suspicion of a crime. Don't get me wrong, I've grown up with the Dirty Harry and Death Wish movies, and they didn't leave me upset at all. I even enjoyed them. Junkfood for the brain. At least in those movies they catch the bad guys in the act most of the times. But this movie is disgusting. I've got nothing against it portraying selfish, egoistic evil psychopaths and unprofessional people, but it's the moral stand that it takes in the end that makes it awful. They deliberately edit out the scene where Detective Loki finds the tortured and mentally disabled Alex. And everything is immediately forgiven as long as you have committed the right type of sins. During the 2 and a half hours they showed so much egoistic sadistic violence by "the good guys" that I even ended up hoping the girls would be dead. You don't care about them anyway since their characters aren't developed in the story. All crimes should be punished in this movie, not just the ones that media decides are the worst. At least 3 of the parents deserved jail-time, probably all four. The detective should've been suspended if not prosecuted for the way he handled that interrogation. Even the captain was at fault. If the movie showed good police work and real heroes this movie would've gotten an 8. You can't have a morality tale with an hypocritical message. As entertainment it's OK but it's dangerous entertainment and you should never forget that. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The real problem with this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. I don't understand what the director was aiming at. The film tries to be Mystic River and Seven at the same time. Was it a drama? Was it trying to be suspenseful? It fails both way. It's too full of thriller clichés to feel dramatic, it's too morally ambiguous to be an entertaining thriller. Everything is quite good: acting is great, the atmosphere too, and Villeneuve is a great director. But all the ingredients just don't blend together, I felt like I was watching two different movies at the same time. Still trying to understand what the ending is supposed to mean.</fullReview>

In fact, as I was watching it, I almost started to believe that it IS a good movie, and I really DO enjoy watching it.What a ridiculous beginning for a review.WHAT"S GOING ON WITH THE SCRIPT IN THIS MOVIE?! Pedophile priest kills a child murderer in his basement after confession? WTF? Recreational vehicle, Puzzles, snakes, labyrinth necklaces, socks, open window, 1 white girl, 1 black girl. A guy with an IQ of a ten year old arrested, released, kidnapped beaten to a pulp then placed in a hot\cold torture shower box. And what was that for anyway? It never amounts to nothing even though it's a big part of the movie. Another guy lives not far away (it's a small world), himself a former kidnapping victim, got messed up on LSD...buys children's clothing...confesses, commits suicide even though he is not the killer...pffff...I don't know... Killer grandmother is at war with god you see...her husband was a kidnapper too...had a labyrinth necklace...so she kidnaps children... because it figuratively speaking turns their parents into demons!!!! WTF??? OH! And the best part is, if you think about it, the movie is not focusing on these things anyway! The grandmother, the retards, the righteous avenger pedophile priest, the grandmothers labyrinth loving, child killing husband, all of these mind boggling things are not explored or fully revealed at all. They seem to be there just to serve as background for us to chew on while we gaze at the glory of Hugh Jackman making himself look highly distressed for 20 million dollars or whatever...</fullReview>

Pointless, virtually plot-free, full of idiotic red herrings, derivative, BEYOND gratuitously violent - need I go on? I will go on - I created an IMDb account just so I could warn people away from this atrocious mess. I kept mentally comparing this movie to "7even," which in spite of the violence had an actual plot, made sense, and lent us some insight into the characters' psyches and motivations. The red herrings in "7even" were woven into the movie and not just thrown in for - what? - effect? Distraction? Shock value? I think they were for distraction - to distract us from the fact that "Prisoners" just blows.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Story was good. But I don't think it could have been directed any worse. First of all movie was extremely slow. The pacing the timing was so awful. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes that could have been shortened or not used in the movie at all. I can say at at least 1 hour of the movie could be cut out and the story wouldn't change, in fact it would be better. The slow rhythm of the movie made it like drama more than a thriller. There were parts where it got really really boring. Jake Gyllenhaal's bad acting made the movie even worse. And it had the worse ending ever. The only thing good about the movie is Hugh Jackman. He's kind of saving the movie with his great acting. Other than I can say that it has a good and strong story, but unfortunately turns out to be a really bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 7 Deadly Sins of PRISONERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>7. Rain. Constant rain and snow. The story is gloomy, I get it. Does it also have to be relentlessly dark and poorly lit?6. When was the last time you watched any decent film, or TV show for that matter, where a sensational headline-grabbing crime against children is investigated by one-- count him, one-- detective. This small town may have limited resources, but when two young girls go missing, even a two-man department puts both men on it. When Jackman blames Gyllenhaal personally for not finding the girls quickly, it took a few seconds for my eyes to roll back into place.5. Nobody locks their doors. Even AFTER the girls go missing, one of the possible bad guys walks into both of their houses, while people are at home, and steals items. Easy peasy.4. The Paul Dano character endures 10 hours of interrogation by Gyllenhaal, then when he is released, suddenly whispers a clue to one of the fathers (Hugh Jackman), which no one else can hear, and therefore no one believes. The result is Jackman capturing and torturing Dano for a week-- and he still won't talk. Why not? So the filmmakers can have him tortured twice.3. The other suspect (David Dastmalchian), another man who was once kidnapped and abused, keeps trunks full of snakes in his house. Evidently, this is just to scare the police, and the audience, but it only confuses things.2. Okay, I know this will be about as popular as saying that Ryan Gosling actually looks like a gosling (which he does), but here goes: Jake Gyllenhaal has one expression: doleful. Given how dumb his character is, that almost works. Still, you'd think that an animal expression would cross his countenance occasionally.1. Motivation. While we drown in motivation for Jackman's vigilantism, little motivation is provided for the crime(s). We're told the kidnappings are the perpetrators' way of "getting back at God" because their son died. It's a lazy, trumped-up reason for a thriller. And the balance is way off. The filmmakers wallow in the torture of innocent suspects, motivated by "good" characters (Jackman, Howard, Davis), while the real villain is hardly seen until the end, and the motive for having tortured children is only mentioned in passing. It's amoral film-making. By the time the movie is over, my relief and apathy were so great that all I wanted was escape. If I'd had a toy whistle, I'd have been just like Hugh Jackman at that point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated hyped miserable movie! I felt like a movie theater prisoner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I should have put a clothes pin on my nose before sitting down in the theater because the "Prisoner" just plain stank.And Hugh Jackman is supposed to be better in this than in "Les Miserables?" Good God. Lock up the screwballs who actually tell you this nonsense.Of course the story line is about two young girls taken while their parents whoop it up in the next room but in no way can this film come close to "Taken." The only one taken is the guy who spends an admission price to see this "Prisoners" bomb. And so with Jackman's daughter and Terence Howard's daughter kidnapped, Terrence keeps cool while Hugh go bonkers beating up everyone in sight. Screaming, effing everyone, banging heads, beating people to a pulp, locking people up in makeshift closets...I mean it's as if Hugh had lost big time at a roulette wheel in the Mirage.The superior acting belongs to Jake Gyllenhaal, the head detective assigned to the case. He's kept busy as all hell trying to keep a lid on Hugh's head about to explode and on the analyses of data that offer clues to the whereabouts of the young girls. He blinks and twitches during the film but I'm not sure if it's part of the act or fear of wild man Jackman beating him between takes.The movie is OVERLONG by at least 30-45 minutes. It drags unmercifully. The plot is complicated but I figured out right away that the popcorn was too salty. I'm a BIG Hugh Jackman fan. I've seen him in person on the Broadway stage twice.He's enormously talented but oh how this picture conceals it. SAVE YOUR MONEY or have a clothes pin handy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost In the Maze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sleepy town of Conyers, Pennsylvania is transformed into a cold, bleak world submerged in misery in Denis Villeneuve's dark crime thriller "Prisoners," released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 17th. The film entrenches viewers in a maze of hazy moral boundaries and pushes the limits of desperation in its characters, made up by an all-star line-up of accomplished actors. Rife with obscure religious symbolism and cryptic reoccurring motifs, the tangled mystery of Prisoners gives enough substance to satisfy but leaves enough unanswered questions to tantalize, reaching a Goldilocks-like equilibrium for a whodunit film.Hugh Jackman plays the rugged God-fearing survivalist Keller Dover, who is thrust to the brink of despair when his daughter and her best friend disappear on Thanksgiving Day, despite his obsessive precautions and preparations for the worst. Dover's helpless desperation drives him to kidnap and brutally torture the main suspect in the case who was released, the unnervingly enigmatic Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Jake Ghyllenhaal plays the suave and poised Detective Loki heading the case, whose analytical investigation is the counterpart to Dover's vigilante revenge, resulting in explosive scenes on screen when the two alpha males face off, like "the cowboy versus the sheriff," according to Villeneuve.Unlike Liam Neeson's over-the-top ass-kicking in Taken, Jackman's portrayal as the unstable grieving father is believable and heartbreaking: his rampant violent rages convey a bottomless sadness just under the surface threatening to consume him, and one scene in particular one-on-one with Ghyllenhaal shows the actor's immense ability to bare a character's soul with utter conviction. The grisly torture scenes prove cringe-worthy, but Jackman is stellar at toeing the line between keeping viewers' confidence or losing it altogether with his frightening, ugly, yet all-too-human performance. Whether Dover is a monster or a martyr is left up to the viewers.Detective Loki's character doesn't achieve the same depths as Dover or even Jones: little character development and back-story in the script leaves Loki hanging as a blank slate, but Ghyllenhaal compensates with spot-on character tics and a reassuring composure on screen. His character's stylish wardrobe, sleek hairstyle, and mysterious zodiac-like tattoos make him a more visually stimulating figure than the no-nonsense Dover, adding another dimension to the character, if only aesthetically.Supporting actors Terrence Howard and Viola Davis anchor the film as the Birchs, the neighbors whose daughter also goes missing. Their refusal to condone Dover's actions help keep the film grounded as realistic, and Howard's performance as the broken father paralyzed by grief is a welcome contrast to the crusading Dover. The viewpoints of the older siblings in the story however, along with Dover's wife, are sidelined in favor of pushing the plot forward with Dover's grappling with morality and Loki's determined search for answers. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano are highly memorable in their supporting roles as Holly and Alex Jones: the two are adept at keeping their characters in the neutral zone of suspicion, a difficult place to remain for long in a mystery film.Composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's brooding score exemplifies the film's weariness and growing tension, keeping the pressure simmering throughout and only surging in release for the film's climax with the song "Through Falling Snow." Cinematographer Roger Deakins beautifully composes every frame, and doesn't shy away from peering through opaque filters of rain-soaked windows and shadows in the noir tradition. He often uses an expressionistic icy color temperature laced with deep blacks to manifest the characters' isolation and dread.As his first Hollywood (and English-language) film, Villeneuve has earned his place among the Hollywood elite with the star-studded thriller Prisoners. While the film may be too hard to digest for some, fleshing out every parent's nightmare for a nerve-wracking two and a half hours, it is an overall worthwhile captivating experience, with moving performances and a compelling mystery. This is one maze you'll love to get lost in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve delivers a movie with perfect cinematography: the direction and mise-en-sc?ne are top-notch especially with regards to the work done on lighting, the shots are almost of surgical precision and perfectly underline the narration.Speaking about the content now, the story is relatively captivating, as is the atmosphere, and carried by an excellent Jackman Gyllenhaal duo. But the movie loses too much time trying to develop a plot and characters that ultimately are quite shallow.A lot of scenes are very conventional and don't help broaden the perspective, and you even sense some hesitation on the writing at the end especially regarding the false leads which are not properly integrated and seem to serve no purpose whatsoever.As the movie progresses and the outcome unfolds, you begin to realise the banality of the story, its lack of impact and depth on every level.It is therefore a nice package but that sounds a bit empty, you don't end up overwhelmed after watching Prisoners, far from it, it's actually more of a certain disappointment that emerges considering there was better to do with these elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ending (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off with the parents frantically looking for the kids and retracing their steps to look for clues to there whereabouts. The parents check all places after they have exhausted all other leads, then the older brother of Anna and older sister of Joy recall the kids playing on a van outside on the street and how hard they fought to get them away from it. The family decided to call the police giving this as good place to start.The the van is eventually found that same night and the driver tries to escape but ends up running the van into a pole in the struggle to get away. Soon after the cops try to interrogate the driver Alex Jones and he is let go on the grounds that he is mentally unfit to cooperate with interrogation and is released to his Aunt. ,Keller Dover Anna's father hears of his release and goes to the police station to try his hand in the interrogation and ends up wrestling with him until they are both pulled apart Alex whispers to him loud enough to where he can hear it but low enough to where he would be the only one Alex told him."They only started to cry when I left" This gives the story a creepy edge to it that no one can deny at the time. The detective Loki searching for clues and the midst of this the father kidnaps Alex and tortures him to try and find his daughter after he hears Alex singing the same song his daughter sang on the day she was taken Keller finds after days of searching this is the only alternative The detective follows up on a lead after he gets the plate number from thestore clerk and gets an address there after he shows up and everything was pretty formal up to when Loki started asking questions about the girls then he started to panic and try to shut the door in the detectives face. Loki then restrains him and starts looking for the girls in the house nothing there except all the writing in the house being creepy drawings of an obvious psychopath. Loki finds a group of suitcases in a room that was shut in the house he opens all of them to find snakes and bloody clothes of children. He then brings Keller and the Other daughters family in to verify articles of clothing Joy's family comes out of the office crying and it doesn't leave Keller much hope many of them were not a match for Keller daughter except her pink sock which he seen was definitely hers covered in blood stains. He then takes off to torture Alex one last and final time because he believes his daughter to be dead and he thinks its Alex s fault. Loki does more investigation work and interrogates the mystery guy ends up killing himself with Loki's gun after he starts babbling about the maze and never getting out. Loki is left really with no other options. Keller then goes to the house Alex stayed at apologize for overreacting with Alex and he gets the background of Alex and how he was related to her and how her husband isn't around anymore. After leaving Alex's aunts house he is called and told that the other girl Joy was found and she is in the hospital and she is recovering Keller cares of her well being but still tries to asks her where his daughter is and if she is OK Joy lifts up her head with a terrified suspenseful look said "she tied us up with duct tape" and that gave all what Keller needed to make his next move he returned to Alex's aunts house with a handyman tool kit to fix some things in her house to get inside to look around. Keller then tells the old woman "I don't want to have to hurt you" and the woman pulls a gun on Keller and says she has his daughter and then proceeds to tell him shes been kidnapping and killing kids for years. Alex's aunt and her husband were proud of it Alex's aunt said there's only one way to his daughter and that is to drink a recipe her and her husband made to drug induce motor skills of its victims and put them in a daze to where there really is no fighting back. Alex's aunt then proceeds to put Keller where he had his daughter when the police came looking around and is left there. Inevitably finding Anna at the kidnappers house through detective work of things introduced earlier on that come to light later in the story Loki shows up at the kidnappers house shoots her when she pulls a gun on him and shoots him in the eye he is injured rushing to the EM for treatment for Anna. A lot of mystery movies are doing this these days but the ending of the movie just before the Detective Loki shows up to stop the kidnapper the father of one the girl that didn't escape earlier on is still down in the cellar underneath the old muscle car in the yard. Because of this finding at the kidnappers house the house is obviously stripped searched and just before everyone goes home form digging up the yard all day Loki hears a faint whistle in the background and fades to black so the Director decided to end the movie this way more suspenseful i suspect.The movie did very well on its opening into the family scene how they did and put everyone in a down spiral and show just who you really are when faced with such a horrible thing and how things unravel. A sense of reality so to speak and the actors did a good job portraying their characters the movie has got a good solid plot to it.</fullReview>

But one day when his daughter &amp; her friend go missing and the police fails to make any breakthroughs for days, Keller takes matters into his own hands &amp; sets out to find his daughter by targeting the prime suspect for information before it's too late.Denis Villeneuve's direction here carries the very riddles &amp; moral complications of his previous works and these elements eventually end up playing a major role in shaping up the whole experience of this film. Roger Deakins' cinematography is another standout as the entire film has a dark &amp; mysterious ambiance enveloping it &amp; even the sequences filmed in minimum light are able to retain a crisp clarity.Coming to the performances, Prisoners has a pretty reliable cast but it's Hugh Jackman &amp; Jake Gyllenhaal who end up impressing the most. Jackman plays Keller Dover; the grief-stricken father of the missing girl, &amp; delivers an emotionally charged performance. But he is constantly challenged by Gyllenhaal who delivers a knockout performance as Detective Loki; the officer spearheading this perplexing case.On an overall scale, Prisoners is a labyrinth of moral &amp; ethical ambiguities represented through the degeneration of an immensely faithful &amp; God-fearing person into a remorseless sinner, all exhibited in a darkly compelling manner, and it's also an interesting focus on the devastating change an event like the one depicted in this film can bring in any parent out there.

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best of 2013 and is very intriguing, and the director made such a good haunting atmosphere with heavy rain, storm, and cold winter makes it dark and emphasizes on the nightmare for the parents when they lose their kid. The movie can and will occupy you till the end for many truths to be uncovered. The Acting by Hugh is Oscar worthy, and Jake and Paul have given their best performance so far. The music is so good, filled with sadness, and I loved the cinematography. This is a must watch movie for everyone, excluding children, as it includes violence.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners possessed an intensified, unrelenting atmosphere that is provides a uniquely captivating atmosphere. This psychological labyrinth covers multiple layers of how people are prisoners in their own complicated world. The film thoroughly and informatively explores all the character perspectives with refined detail, however in instances this tight grasp the story has on depicting the explicit stress each person displays perhaps gets in the way of a fluent, coherent story line. Subtle moments in the film such as Loki's tattoos, Bob Taylor's boxes of snakes and more significantly what was the ultimate outcome to Alex Jones go unexplained. Nevertheless with phenomenal lead performances, you can happily ignore minor plot flaws to this riveting mystery and cynicism this film hits the audience with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gyllenhaal and Jackman steal the show in Denis Villenueve's Prisoners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman is just flat out intense throughout the movie.. PERIOD... IMO, this is Hugh's best performance in a movie.. He plays a caring father, an alcoholic, and a man who will do anything to find his daughter.. Literally anything, including torturing and beating a man who he believes knows the location of his daughter.. Gyllenhaal is just as good.. He plays an ideological, by-the-book detective with a mean streak.. Gyllenhaal is not overshadowed in the least.. In fact, he shares the main character spotlight in this movie.. Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Maria Bello all play their respective roles to the tee.. Viola Davis in particular is on the top of her game in this movie.. Melissa Leo is what she is... She plays Holly Jones.. A crazed women who lost her son to cancer and now finds it as her responsibility to rage a war against God.. All and all she plays the role well. The movie is one of , if not the top movie of 2013.. It's a 153 min(2hr and 33min) masterpiece.. Exciting all the way through.. Great strong performances by the leading men drive the movie.. Character driven, suspenseful in your face movie... I give it a 9/10.. If 9.5 was available, it would get it... I've only gave 7 movies 10/10... Just to show how highly I recommend this flick...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the year's wonder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I witnessed many surprises this year and 'Prisoners' is one of those made me stun. With the big names in it, the movie revolves around a mysterious incident that puts two families into the sorrow. The deeply moving characters and its emotions are the movie's plus point and of course the great performance by the great actors as well. It is refreshing to see Hugh Jackman in a role the father to a missing child.A similar kinda movie to 'The Lovely Bones' where two young girls are go missing and their parent's never ending search for them begins. With a single clue they begin to dig every detail to bring back their children along with the help of a young cop. As expected character diversion had an important hand in mystify and confuse the viewers without falling for anything to conclude their prediction before it reveal itself.Fine photography. It was pleasant to see cool frames where there's no sun glare but always cloudy, shadow and dark atmosphere something like the movie 'The Awakening'. It brought real close to us the real grief of a family that we can almost feel it. Good or bad ending, the way it ends is all matters. In this story they give us an opportunity to take it either way as you want. One thing I was not convinced is the motivation for the abduction. The reason seemed to me a silly but in reality everything can be possible and sometimes it won't need reasons at all. Finally, it is a must not miss movie from the 2013 film calender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sterling Suspense Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a beyond any doubt one of the best suspense thrillers in recent times. Denis Villeneuve and team have very finely exhibited a stupendous drama flick. It possesses a gripping story, thus getting the audience's attention. It is bolstered by some exceptional acting skills and a justified conclusion. Though it is a crime film, not much of action is portrayed, the only reason being is that the situation in the film doesn't favor it. The first half is a bit slow paced as in most mystery films, but it is the second half where you start getting more and more curious about the truth. The cast assembled was first-rate. Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, a desperate father trying to find her daughter, was top-notch, undoubtedly. Jake Gyllenhaal who played the role of a detective, was meritorious. Viola Davis &amp; Terrence Howard, in supporting roles managed to pull out an average performance. Maria Bello, who played Hugh's wife in the film was moderate, performance wise. Melissa Leo, although having lesser screen-time was brilliant. Paul Dano's challenging role was executed finely. The director deserves some real appreciation for this one. He clearly manages to enhance the plot, making it intriguing and exemplary. The screenplay has been brilliant, very well scripted. The music, editing and cinematography departments too have perfected their jobs. All in all, the movie is one hell of a masterpiece, not much witnessed in present times. It's about a father crossing all his boundaries to protect his family. It's a revelation about how a single person's missing can turn around the lives of so many around him. Watch it and it'll be surprising if you don't feel the same as I feel.</fullReview>

Boasting an All-star cast, and a plot mildly familiar to The Lovely Bones (though slightly different, and far more adult than The Lovely Bones), it was more than The Lovely Bones could have ever hoped to have been.With fantastic Direction from Denis Villenueva, and spectacular acting from Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Maria Bello, Paul Dano, and Terence Howard, this film is extremely engrossing, and powerful.An absolutely spectacular, engrossing, suspense-filled drama.

It portrays the atmosphere perfectly, the desperation and despair.Jake Gyllenhaal performs as well, if not better than he did in Zodiac. Hugh Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career, an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion.I have always thought Hugh Jackman didn't know how to play anything well except for Wolverine. However this movie in combination with Les Mesirables has changed my mind.This movie is definitely one of the best of 2013. It stands up there with Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River as one of the best movies about child kidnapping there is to date. It grips you throughout with an atmosphere of suspense and mystery. Showing how the kidnapping effects the families and the detective associated with the case. A definite must watch for anyone who appreciates an excellent thriller or drama film.A 9/10 for me and it earns a spot on my favorite thrillers list.</fullReview>

The movie manage to keep you in a great suspense the whole time and the ending was well put. Also the actors manage to love the movie by the end. It s close to another great movie with some kind of a resemblance, "Mystic River". The main plot is not so different end the ending is also similar. For a two and a half hour movie i would recommend you those two movies. You won't regret watching "Prisoners" if you like thriller/drama kind. Too bad i didn't saw it first on the cinema, it would have been a better experience to watch. I just hope it won't take long until i'll watch another great thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie raises an answers a lot of questions... Not All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*For everybody that disliked the movie: Watch the movie again, and closely, you probably won't, but seriously, say every plot hole I read about in the negative reviews, are explained in the movie. And NO the movie doesn't automatically stir you in the right direction. It shows things that look important, but aren't. The police mainly looks at unimportant stuff and it makes it so frustrating!To start: normally a movie explains the story, this movie doesn't, the camera is 'just' an eye, watching a story developing in front of it. In combination with the brilliant acting, a master class Stanislavski, it gets a tremendous realistic feel. Just this will bother you later on in the movie, because maybe you don't like what you see. It places you in amoral situations, but the movie doesn't judge what you see (the camera is just an eye, watching). The movie plays with the audience, so if you are the average movie watcher and you like movies straight forward, maybe this isn't the one for you.It doesn't want to explain everything, and I believe that's good. PLZ!!! Stop with the movies that go and explain minor plots, like we don't have any brain that understand and figure out. Start with: USE YOUR IMAGINATION! (sorry). There are some movies that do a very good job in leaving the audience with a 'what the f?'example: Inception. Does the whirl fall???? they don't show, so maybe instead of talking about the little twitch it made in the end, the movie suggests that you have to search somewhere else. CGI everywhere just to keep your eyes from seeing that small detail that explains EVERYTHING, just for the close watcher. LOVELY.This movie overloads you with false clues, raises so many questions, that you miss the important details. And if you follow closely, you'll figure it out before the big: SO THAT'S THE ONE!8.6, so a 9 starsPs. the movie breaks many cliché's. While (real)life is filled with cliché's. So how people say that this movies (with it's scary realistic vibe) was filled with the same old, I can't understand. If it wasn't it would be a more fantastic movie, which wouldn't make it much better, definitely not as realistic. A Master Piece, and luckily most people where able to keep their attention, to notice it.Pss. for the people that found Loki story unrealistic... talk to a cob. *MINOR SPOILER*: Would you move the fridge? I will tell you, any decent detective would've!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst."Prisoners is a dark thriller that will have you at the edge of your seat during almost the entirety of the film. It was a very intense experience. It is hard not to compare this film to Mystic River or Gone Baby Gone because those two movies set the landmark for modern thrillers dealing with abduction. Prisoners almost lives up to the standards that those two films set. Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve, follows up his Oscar nominated film, Incendies, with this intense thriller that manages to capture the audiences attention once again. Incendies was one of my favorite films of 2011, and despite Prisoners not living up to the perfection that film achieved, I still thought this film was highly entertaining and satisfying. There were a few minor plot points that didn't work for me, but that didn't take anything away from this great film. It is a more mainstream film, but it manages to follow a similar approach as Fincher reminding us of Se7en or Zodiac thanks to its dark and haunting atmosphere. I am a huge fan of this genre and really had a fun time trying to solve the mystery through the small clues that Villeneuve masterfully presented in the story. Prisoners was without a doubt one of the most gripping and intense experiences I had all year. Unfortunately it is a little too intense and at times I felt the film could have used some moments to release such tension. Anyways Prisoners is a highly recommended film and a must-see. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a family man who is always prepared for the worst. He is a survivalist with a basement full of provisions and is teaching his older son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette), how to hunt. He's married to Grace (Maria Bello) and they have a daughter named Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). One afternoon, Keller's worst nightmare comes true while they are hanging out with their friendly neighbors the Birches. Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) have two kids about the same age as Ralph and Grace, Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). While the two families are having a lovely time together, Joy and Anna decide to go back to Anna's house, but when the Dover's come back home they are horrified to discover that the kids never made it back. Ralph remembers that they were playing next to a strange RV that was parked up front which is now gone. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is appointed as the lead investigator in the case and the first thing he does is locate the RV. The driver is a disturbed young man named Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who has the IQ of a 10 year old and with no evidence to incriminate him Detective Loki has to let him free. His Aunt (Melissa Leo) comes to pick him up and explains how naive and innocent he is. As hours pass, Keller begins to get more desperate and convinced that Alex was involved he decides to take matters into his own hands. From here on the tension begins to escalate as they try to solve the mystery.Prisoners succeeds as a neo-noir thriller building up a lot of tension with a very dark atmosphere which is perfectly captured by cinematographer Roger Deakins. It adds to the mysterious mood of the story which on its own is already pretty intense. The screenplay, written be Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is very well written with a very interesting premise and some great twists. My only complaint with this film has to do with the lack of a strong female character. With such a strong cast, I thought that Maria Bello or Viola Davis could have been given a stronger role, but the film focuses mostly on Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. They both give very strong and convincing performances, and Gyllenhaal has surprised me over the last three years with very good films (Source Code, End of Watch, and now this one). I guess he has been choosing his roles very wisely lately because his next film also looks interesting (Enemy which is also directed by Denis Villeneuve). Paul Dano also gave a strong performance as his character's motivations were very hard to decipher. The strong cast and the interesting story make this a very entertaining film despite some minor flaws involving character motivations. It is one of the best recent thrillers coming out of Hollywood and I doubt you will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts well but ends up being tiresome and exhausting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a small town in Pennsylvania, two families get together to celebrate Thanksgiving. But during the night, their two young daughters disappear without a trace. A hunt is put forward, and the only suspect seems to be a retarded man who was in a RV outside the house at the time. He is detained and soon released for lack of evidence, but the hothead father of one of the girls (Hugh Jackman, in a spectacular performance) decides to pursue the man and eventually kidnaps and tortures him in order to get information. But this is just the beginning, since there is almost two hours more of film.This thriller seems very exciting at the hour point, but in the latter part descends into a tiresome series of twists and dead herrings. By the time the running time of two hours and a half has past, the audience is exhausted. The movie also suffers from serious leaps in logic and even basic continuity (WARNING: I will reveal some spoilers now): 1) when the retarded man is detained, the house where he lives with his aunt is apparently never thoroughly searched though it will turn out to be the place where the girls were held captive, 2) when other suspect kills himself in the police station, this is news in the local newspaper, but one policeman investigating the case is apparently unaware of it, 3) this whole subplot with the seeming suspect played by David Dastmalchian is never fully explained (and how he got a gun to kill himself?), 4) I find it unbelievable that the other parent (Terrence Howard) agrees to torture the suspect.Maria Bello gives a fine performance as the troubled wife of Jackman. So does Jake Gyllenhall as the main detective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally Hugh, this is what we wanted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately I must begin by admitting I am not a Hugh Jackman fan. Compared to Christian Bale's Batman and Toby Maguire's Spider-Man Jackman's Wolverine is one dimensional, child friendly and as far removed from what Wolverine should be as is possible. It is also unfortunate that Wolverine is his defining role. Why? It is unfortunate because Hugh Jackman is a world class and quite simply phenomenal talent. Granted the physique gained from his preparation for Wolverine aids in his portrayal of a dominant, controlling figure. But nothing should be taken away from him here, he is ferocious in the pursuit of his daughter's captor and I for one believed he would do anything (or more apt anything to anyone) to get his daughter back. His testosterone filled male, physical dominance is akin to Marlon Brando's Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire. In short Jackman is simply stunning to watch. Special mentions should also go to the always fantastic Jake Gyllenhall and Maria Bello but this movie is all about Hugh Jackman and why he has finally found a role that highlights why he deserves his place at the top of Hollywood royalty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman is Keller Dover, a Christian father of two who enjoys hunting with his son. Dover and his family attend a Thanksgiving dinner over at their friend's house, Franklin and Nancy Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. It is there that both family's six year old girls, Anna and Joy, go missing. Jake Gyllenhaal, as Detective Loki, is assigned to the case but is unable to put Dover at ease. This creates a conflict between the confident detective and the frantic father. It's not long before Alex Jones, played by Paul Dano, is arrested under suspicion for the girls disappearance but due to a lack of evidence, he is released. As Detective Loki continues on with the investigation, Dover, in desperation and out of fear for his daughter's life, decides to take matters into his own hands.Everyone involved in this production, including actress Maria Bello as Dover's wife, Grace, are at the top of their game. Hugh Jackman has never been better, surpassing his performance in The Fountain. Jake Gyllenhaal is no longer seen as Donnie Darko here. Detective Loki proves to be not only his most powerful performance but also the best character he has ever played. In fact, Detective Loki might be the best on-screen detective we've seen in well over a decade. All the amazing performances aside, everything about Prisoners is perfectly executed. Cinematography by the best director of photography working today, Roger Deakins. The haunting music, provided by the masterful Icelandic composer, Jóhann Jóhannsson, is used to maximum effect. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve has brought Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay to life without cutting any corners or wasting any expense.Prisoners is a painful character study within the most thrilling mystery put to the big screen since Hitchcock defined the genre. Villeneuve has perfectly balanced the ambiguity and ambition of a modern art-film with an entertaining Hollywood thriller. Even with a running time over two and a half hours, the suspense never stops. In fact, it will continue to linger long after the credits finish rolling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best crime movies since Se7en</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners was the best movie of 2013 for me so far. It delivers the perfect atmosphere for a crime theme as it thrills us and provokes our thoughts all along. Scriptwriters have chosen to have two main characters: Jackman as the father and Gyllenhaal as the detective. Since the film's structure is dramatic instead of thematic (in which case the script should focus mainly on the relationship of two characters) this could seem a bit of problem for the audience to get into the movie. Although this is not the case thanks to the common goal of the characters: Finding the girls. And surprisingly having two main characters is one of the aspects which makes this film different from its similars. Yet one can't help but thinking "How would it have been with just one main character?". Prisoner was near excellent until a certain point but unfortunately it falls short to greatness just before its ending. That certain point is being the moment that the father runs away from the hospital to Jones' residence. The very obvious inconsistencies were:1) Keller's idiotic off-guard approach to Jones's house. 2) Aunt Jones' hurry to kill the girl instead of first facing the detective at the door and sending him out.I would have given this film a 9 without these flaws. Still, the best film I've seen in a period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Dark Abyss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens after a family is shattered by the disappearance of a small child is darkly explored in Prisoners. Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, is on a personal mission to find his daughter before its too late. An old truck camper as mysteriously seen in the Dover's neighborhood reveals an oddball suspect likely purposely named Alex Jones. When the police are forced to let Jones go Dover's obsession to take matters into his own hands quickly spins out of control. This is set against the mystery of Jone's apparently mental deficiency and seemingly innocuous aunt who is his caregiver. The film quickly proceeds painting a dark psychological thriller. Whatever is going on with Alex Jones and his aunt seems more pathetic than threatening even though Jones is most certainly is involved. Caught in the middle is police detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Loki's character is as intense in his will to find the two girls as is Dover's. Clearly, being on two different sides of the law while solving the crime puts Dover and Loki at odds with one another. The performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaal are such that these two create a mountain of tension on an already "edge of your seat" atmosphere created by the writers and pounded home by the excellent atmospherically dark location shooting.Brilliantly, Prisoners doesn't give up too much as it builds a bleak picture of how all approach the battle of good versus evil. Moral questions swirl like black storm clouds touching all involved. This is a complex crime thriller that makes the viewer uneasy for the entire ride. It has a feel of realism and intellectualism while being 100% accessible save for the dread feeling of depravity which makes watching akin to witnessing a macabre disaster. In this regard one wants to look away, but simply can't. Prisoners achieves everything it sets out to with a cast non-parallel who all give uniformly excellent performances (i.e.the best ever from Jackman and Gyllenhaal to date). The supporting cast is above all scrutiny with spot-on direction and cinematography combining to weave superlatively written story never veering too far out or even feeling remotely like a crime story retread. This is a highly recommended movie - a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a tense and at times frightening movie. There are times throughout the film, except for the ending, where it almost seemed like a symbolic, supernatural crime mystery. The ending is satisfying, however, too neatly packaged for everything that came before it to have lasting impact.It has some truly amazing performances. Paul Dano once again delivers another eerie and uncomfortable performance. Favorites like Hugh and Jake also impressively portray stark characters. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of a stoic, independent and religious man seems to capture the spirit of the quintessential American man.The plot, although it has good effect, also has a lots of -- "and then his eye caught that, and that solved everything!" -- moments that are a staple of average detective mysteries. There is however a thematic and symbolic undercurrent throughout the movie that really sets it apart from the average of this genre. However, this good theme is somewhat spoiled by a very literal explanation the villain gives near the end.Overall though, I was biting my nails and completely enthralled by it.</fullReview>

You relate to his hurt even though you may not have experienced it. When he cries, my heart literally weeps. The toll this family goes through feels so real and unfair.Howard is good at his supporting role. He is unwilling, unsure, confused, scared, he is all that Jackman is except he shows it so much more than he Jackman.Gyllenhaal, I was so unsure about this character. I could not understand why he is the way that he is and still don't. I take it as this was just who his personality was; awkward and too into the job. He executed his role great and I enjoyed watching his character unfold into a sort of madness.The entire cast together was perfect. I love a movie when everyone is so well fitted together that you forget you're watching a movie. The plot was disturbing and quite dark. As a parent I felt enraged and angry. I was battling what side of the fence I would be on if I were in the position and I got made at myself for not knowing which person I'd be like; Jackman or Howard. The decisions in this film that the family makes is the hardest I think any person would have to make. . . . .the gem of this film lies in the very last minute of the movie. It's the hardest minute to watch and when the screen went black, I stared at it waiting for it to come back on with a different ending. I loved the ending. . .the felt it, I understood it but I didn't want it to be.Overall, this film is beyond amazing and you will enjoy it's grittiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previews/trailers for this film never resonated with me so I had it pretty deep on a "to see list", but the opportunity arose to take in a showing recently. This film has stuck with me for a while now--it has a presence about it that crawls underneath your skin. It deals with very adult themes and can, at times, be tough to view, but it is an important film that allows us to witness how some individuals handle adversity and frustration. Many of the critic reviews acknowledge the work by Jackman, but it is the work by Gyllenhaal that really wowed me. His cop was a fascinating character who appears to have had a rough upbringing, has overcame it, but now chooses to dwell alongside the lowest forms of society. A beautifully filmed movie with tremendous acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion this movie was great and the director truly managed keep the experience thrilling throughout the whole film. I couldn't easily tell what was about to happen which I usually can do when I watch movies. The mystery and confusion, you was really left wondering and asking a lot of questions and most of the time I was glued to my seat following the ongoing hunt.Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job portraying his character of a police detective who works tirelessly to complete his job. So it's definitely a big up for the best performance in his career in my opinion. A lot of people has complained and raised a lot of questions about the ending but don't be discouraged. If you use critical thinking and extrapolate a little bit you'll understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll keep you in your seat, till the end; great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subject matter is one that some might consider overdone, since there have been several movies with the theme of child abduction in recent years, but you don't want to miss this one, because it is so well done and the performances are flawless. The directing and script were a very pleasant surprise to me. Unfamiliar with director Denis Villneuve, whose rating for his previous feature film, Incendies, was outstanding, I now know I'll have to see that one as well as the one that followed, Enemy, also starring Jake Gyllenhaal.The movie starts by placing you in a certain comfort zone with Keller Dover bonding with his son Ralph, respectively played by Hugh Jackman and Dylan Minnette, on their return from a hunting trip; they then join Grace and Erin, mother and daughter, wife and sister played by Maria Bello and Erin Gerasimovich, for a Thanksgiving dinner at their neighbor friends' house. The second couple Franklin and Nancy, the Birch, played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis and their daughters Eliza and Joy, played by Zoe Borde and Kyla Drew Simmons respectively, are indeed friendly neighbors; they make interracial relationships appealing and seem as normal as it should be (something too seldom mentioned). This will be the only relaxed moment you'll experience, before the drama starts to unfold. Joy and Erin go missing; we can only guess how and when, but that guess may be one of the few you'll get right. The director will smartly leave you with your safe guess as the details are not revealed and need not be.The drama will take you down a few dead ends, to keep you on your toes; and you'll be made to experience the parents frustration with a few of your own, all in the process of keeping you very interested in the next development. With the likes of the actors in this cast, how could you not expect good performances? You get them, and not one character is cliché, especially detective Loki, played brilliantly by Jake Gyllenhaal. You will be torn by the dilemma 'doing the right thing' vs natural 'instinct' I know most will feel with the performance of H. Jackman, whose character goes beyond wishful thinking on the audience's part. If that wasn't enough, a series of suspects, all despicable but non aggressive will have you spinning with anxious anticipation. Who really abducted the girls, was it a loner or a dark sect, what was the motive if not what first comes to mind (which you'll get wrong by the way).This movie is so well done that the mere expression on Loki's face in the last seconds, before the screen goes to black, tells you immediately what the final outcome is, and you're smartly left to fill in the details to your heart's content. Simply brilliant; you'll be encouraging your friends to see it. I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good kidnapping movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one thing someone could say about this film, that would be "woah... has it been 2h30m already?". I must say, I heard a lot about this film before watching it, I even read the reviews. Everything about it lived up to my expectations. What I was expecting to see was a film that would keep me at the edge of my seat, which it literally did, a film that would have me guessing all the way through, which I tried really hard not to do but did anyway, and finally a film that -as a friend had told me- would have a predictable "twist", which it sort of did. This is a very good action/thriller/drama kind of film that really manages to capture you from the very beginning and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout. It's not that we have not seen stuff like this before; kidnapping movies tend to be ubiquitous, but there is something about this one that stands out. Jackman gives an outstanding performance, easily said about the rest of the cast as well. I highly recommend this film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a really good movie that I had little to no expectations going into the film which actually made for a better viewing. I think the trailer didn't really do this film justice in terms of how good it actually was. The cop played his role expertly well, he had that sense of a tense nature and one that would go all out to get what he wanted to get. I love the start of the movie and the taking as well as how it was hinted at. They did that so well and built it to such a great degree. The use of the rain when they went out to try and find them also really heightened the situation. The whole tale did drag on quite a long way, but I cannot say I was bored at any point. Yes, there were some loose ends which I didn't quite get as the movie went on in terms off several things that didn't really add much substance to the plot and a few things that in my opinion were a bit confusing, nonetheless, the role of the sub plots and the smaller characters was once more done well and each of them really fitted the type of play they were in. The ending to the movie really opens up the chance on more of this but to be honest, I don't see where they can go. Probably would have score 7.75 for me but will round that to 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is marked by very strong performances and many moral/religious complexities. The story brings basically many ethical and moral questions: what would you do to protect your family? Would you torture someone to detract information? Jackman juggles these moral queries in an emotionally gripping performance. In Keller you have the tortured father who could not protect his child. In Loki you have the guardian of a community who has sworn to protect and serve. It's not surprising to see such religiosity in a film of incredible and uncompromising darkness. Villeneuve makes everything work, with an experience stimulating on an emotional and spiritual level. Thrillers like this should be embraced. Prisoners proves compelling, thanks also to the subject matter that practically demands emotional investment from an audience: children in peril. The film's pace is an endurance test, an excessive 2 and a half hours runtime but everyone gets to share in the dread of the final revelations. Does the end justify the means? All in all it's rare to find a film that really works on all levels, but that's exactly what Denis Villeneuve's and his cast have constructed with Prisoners.</fullReview>

"Prisoners" shows us that our worst fears can sometimes take control of our minds and change our way of acting and thinking. So what if you lost your daughter and no one is capable of helping you? "Prisoners" is the story of two families who are confronted with this exact situation. In 153 minutes we are invited to look to the changes in the family members's behaviors while they lose their hope. Finding his daughter is the one thing that Keller Dover, played by Hugh Jackman, has on his mind and when he sees that Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is not following his clues, he decides to make justice by his own hands. This powerful and emotive story about families, love, and fear is one great Drama full of suspense and outstanding performances by all cast members.

		<shortDescription>A decent (if absurd) mystery that is gorgeously shot and competently told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is a methodically paced mystery about two families desperately searching for their daughters who disappear on Thanksgiving Day. Many people (my wife included) will stay away from this film based on its premise alone, finding the misery too realistic. This is unfortunate because director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and the cast of Hollywood heavyweights have created an engaging story that is really more focused on the mystery of the girls' disappearance than on the misery of it. Now, the script can be pretty heavy handed and far-fetched at times, but there is much more to praise. There are plenty of unexpected maze-like turns, some great sound editing, and "Prisoners" may hold the distinction as being the most beautiful film of the year. However, the movie's main draw for many people will be the cast, which is filled with powerhouse performances. While some of the actors may be bordering on melodrama, the acting throughout is darkly stellar. Above them all is a quiet but powerful performance from Gyllenhaal as the detective given the unenviable task of solving the puzzle. This may be the first film of the year that feels to be reaching for an Oscar or two. And with some strong performances, beautiful cinematography, and a dark twisted mystery (which the Academy loves), I wouldn't be surprised to see it pop up again next February during the big ceremony. "Prisoners" definitely delivers as a decent, if at times absurd, mystery that is gorgeously shot and skillfully told.</fullReview>

The director gives us the free choice to pick up our character side, which evolves with the complexity of the situations. This leads to a constant questioning about the right and bad way to solve the case. I just regret that the intrigue lacks a bit of pace.

		<fullReview>This film deserves the praise it is earning and here's why. Firstly you have a very solid cast. Each character play out their roles with solid performances, solid enough to become emotionally attached and sharing some part of the pain they are feeling. The films tempo is also nicely applied, applied correctly so that throughout each scene, you become interested and curious as to what may happen. Much of the storytelling is done in a stripped back style, a muck more basic ground of storytelling but an elegance that makes it so fulfilling and worth much more than that. If ever you've played the game The Last of Us, then you''ll understand what I am trying to explain. Overall I highly praise this film for being such a great watch, but also the feelings I was given whilst watching this movie, such as; suspense, intimidation and the thoughts of each scene I still have after reaching the conclusion of this film. If ever you gain an opportunity to watch this film, I highly recommend you go and see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard were incredible in this ensemble cast film. Viola Davis and Maria Bello were very raw and convincing as the wives but it was Jackman and Gyllenhaal that stole the show. A gripping a visceral tale about two girls being abducted and their parents and the Detective who is investigating the disappearance's experiences. It's a rather twisted psychological drama, cleverly written and powerfully performed. Set in (fairly) small-town America with poignant crises of faith adding a shadow and depth to the tragedy. Clues along the way were subtle and the unwinding plot was natural and not contrived. It was an intelligent film.Tense and edge of the seat all the way through, made darker by the weather, and simple non-SFX almost old fashioned filming. It had a vintage seventies feel, despite being set in modern times. It made the viewer question morality, choices and how far you would go to protect your own. Jackman's descent into desperation was relatable and understandable. His scenes with the Paul Dano were terrifyingly good.Dark but essential cinema viewing. Brave performances by all actors and great direction and screenplay. You may feel shredded as the credits roll. Possibly 9/10, not sure yet. Highly recommend it, but don't sit anywhere near chatting teenagers, you'll need to concentrate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am curious what the IMDb community thinks about Loki, and his past/personal life. First of all, you have to love the name Loki, as in low-key; which he is kind of the antithesis of. Maybe he is not as outwardly animated as Jackman's character, but you can see tons of rage. Anyway back my my real point/question... First of all, he never drinks. We never see him take a sip of alcohol. When the police chief offers him the whiskey at the end, he immediately dismisses it. Could this be nothing, sure. Could it be something, perhaps. Cops are notorious for being drinkers, as even a little reference from shutter island will support: Teddy Daniels: Soda on ice please, thanks.Dr. Jeremiah Naehring:Oh, you don't indulge in alcohol I'm surprised. Isn't it common for men in your profession to imbibe?Also, the reason why this stands out to me so much is because there is also one scene where I believe Jackman's wife asks the detective if he has kids. He never answers the question. He defers to some generic line like "we will find your girl" but thats not before hesitating for a second. Maybe I'm thinking too much into this; but the hesitation and look on his face struck me. Is there a connection to his hesitation to this question about him having kids, his refusal to drink alcohol, and the reason why he solves child disappearances for a living? Who am I to say. But these are things that struck me and things I think about. My $0.02</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career best performances in this tantalizing suspense thriller. The story, the plot, the screenplay, the acting, the direction, the set everything is perfect and is comparable only to the legendary 'Silence of the lambs'. I generally do not dare to compare any movie to the later but i am just compelled to mention this here. For a movie to be this good everything has to come together. If the story does not pack the punch than no matter how many dollars the producer spends on the movie it can't become legendary. Prisoners is an excellent story which is fully complemented by the acting performances of Jackman, Gyllenhaal and every other cast member. Paul Dano (little miss sunshine) who plays the character Alex is worth a special mention here. He plays a disturbed kid in this movie and is essential to the maintenance of suspense and he does it seamlessly. I urge you to watch this movie in the theaters. It makes sense to encourage and appreciate brilliance which today is so rare in the movie business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When It Comes to Holding "Prisoners", Emotions Can Be Stronger Than Iron Bars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "Prisoners" simply starts with two families, the Dovers and the Birches, in a nondescript town, sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. Then the two youngest members of both families, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go to play outside supposedly under Anna's older brother Ralph's supervision. They get close to a next-door neighbor's RV, but quickly leave when a pair of ominous eyes stare at them from inside. Soon after, both nine-year old girls are missing and apparently kidnapped. Methodical, persistent Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), with a perfect case-solving record, strives to find out who abducted the children and why. There are a few suspects, but the most prominent one is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a child-like young man who lives with caretaker aunt Holly (Melissa Leo) and who is arrested after violently trying to flee Loki and the police in the same RV. So now it's simply a matter of getting Alex to confess to the crime and reveal where the two girls are - isn't it?Perhaps,it's not so simple. "Prisoners" spins an elaborate, deliberate, and intelligent mystery with its share of clues, red herrings, and frustrating dead ends. But I believe the movie's primary focus IS reflected in its nuanced title and how the characters react to it. Both families, including Grace Dover (Maria Bello), Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) are understandably psychologically imprisoned by anxiety, suspense, tension, and horror at their loss - almost to the point of inertia. However, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is not so passive. He is imprisoned by more than just fear; he seethes with vengeance and wrath. He is not satisfied with what he sees as cursory treatment of primary suspect Alex by Loki and the police and is enraged by Alex's release from custody due to insufficient evidence. Insufficient evidence, hell! Keller, a home renovator, has his own ways of making Alex talk...As the mystery progresses, "Prisoners" takes the time to explore Keller's struggle between justice and revenge and the viewer's attitude toward his actions. As Keller retaliates with his own kidnapping and subsequent torture of Alex, I think many viewers will simultaneously sympathize with and be repelled by Keller's behavior. If we lost a child, of course many of us would rage, and swear, and be spurred to some kind of action. But would we do the things Keller does to Alex, things that begin to border on the sadistic? As it winds toward the kidnapping resolution, the revelation of the culprit, Alex's fate, and, surprisingly, Keller's ironic fate, "Prisoners" reminds us that no situation, even a kidnapping and possible torture, justifies letting ourselves being imprisoned by mindless and perhaps misguided vengeance. In this regard, Detective Loki provides contrast. Even though he gets violently frustrated by the case, Loki's professionalism and logic keep him on course and help him progress in his investigation. Keller does not do the same for most of the movie until it's too late. Like Loki, he learns the truth of the abduction, but his emotional prison may end up leading to a literal one as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting movie, full of dread and plays with the question of who the prisoners really are. Everyone is pretty good in this. Wolverine bares some claws but really doesn't channel Wolverine, we get to see some more range. Terence Howard was underutilized in a key and understated role that was very well done I thought. The main detective character was the most charismatic but the other characters seemed more real. There are other similar movies that deal with different elements of this one, such as The Vanishing and The Orphan, neither of which I want to see again though they were very well done. As a parent the idea of a child being abducted with no trace is of course very disturbing and the film makers obviously play that up a bit. Lots of crying and various people coping or failing to cope in various ways. The scenery is bleak, rainy Midwest or Canada, we get a sense of the cold and grime in these middle class people. The overwhelming flavor of this movie outside of the main plot is the essence of abuse and mental illness. We get lots of doses of that. As far as this type of genre goes, this one is more hopeful than many, there is little to no gore (one dead body that's been dead for awhile). The movie doesn't work in sharp pokes but one long slow dread buildup and it's pretty good at that. There is lots of character study here but over all I'd say it's more plot driven than character driven. The ending which I won't spoil seems to make some people think there is ambiguity but I didn't see it that way, seemed pretty clear what was going on at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is a well-acted, disturbing crime-thriller that will make you think about letting your kids wander off alone. When two little girls are kidnapped, Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is set out to put together the pieces of the puzzle. He has Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano) in custody, a boy who owns an RV the girls were playing on, but let's him go because he has an IQ of a ten year old and he can find no evidence against him. Convinced Loki's not doing he's job right, Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps Alex and torture him for information about his daughters whereabouts.The film is a 150 minute disturbing piece of work that will get to you if you have children in your life. It's a dark film that holds onto you and never lets you go. The entire time, I was thinking of my nieces and nephews and I must say, a film has never gotten to me as much as this one did. It was almost like I was in the film, living on what these people were going through, and I must say I was terrified to tears.The film had a lot of twist and turns. I suggest you don't read any spoilers, as the film is perfect without knowing what happens. Although, this is the type of film where people will probably want to check out spoilers, to know the fate of the young girls, I strongly suggest you don't.Hugh Jackman, who showed off his vocals and acting skills in Les Miserables, gives us one of the most sinister good guys characters you'll ever see. He's a very talented actor, and I feel an Oscar nomination coming his way. Who really surprised me in this film was Jake Gyllenhaal, who played Detective Loki. His character was very sympathetic to the case and I feel Jake Gyllenhaal deserves kudos for his work. He's grown into an amazing actor. I enjoyed him immensely in End Of Watch.Prisoners is one of those films you talk about after walking out of the theatre. The film is very twisted and suspenseful and I feel it's runtime was perfect for the film. Keep in mind, the film is very dark. The events that happen in this film can happen in real life, which I hated about the film, but that would be the point of the film. The film can relate to people with children in their lives and you'll just want to go home after the film and hold them. Will I ever see Prisoners again? I'm not too sure I'd want to be put through the haunting experience again. One things for sure, it was an amazing film.Grade: APlease be sure to check out my other reviews and entertainment posts on www.themovieboy77.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done, super depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just to be clear, I'm not a person who dislikes movies that are sad, challenging, difficult to watch. I think many of them have artistic value. I think this one does too because it was so well acted, so well done, and succeeded in making you think and keeping you on the edge of your seat.That being said, this was a pretty sick movie. Very depressing, left you with a feeling of dread and distrust in humans. Again, some people value that, but I just wasn't feeling it after the movie.The biggest thing for me was the fact that at the end of all this, the girls are found, and you find out the kid Hugh Jackman was torturing was entirely innocent...a victim himself. So, with that extreme moral dilemma being resolved to highly immoral, it leaves you kind of hating Hugh Jackman, and then the ambiguous ending was kind of like...really? So if he dies, whatever...he tortured another human being for over a week in horrible ways. If he doesn't die, great he's reunited with his now very messed up family. It leaves you with not caring too much either way, but it did make me think about the implications of what had happened in the movie. Anyway, great movie, one of the most suspenseful I've seen, but I wouldn't recommend it to hardly anyone I know. There are plenty of downright depressing things going on in the world, and sitting through watching a human being torture another innocent human being is just not too worth it.Afterthought: I also disliked the clearly fabricated red herrings such as Alex hanging the dog. I can understand if he was singing the song because he is simple minded like a child, but the hanging the dog was EXTREMELY intentional. He looked at Hugh Jackman, then did it. It was ONLY there so the audience would also second guess during the whole torture aspect. Also, this other kid who had been abducted who happened to be stealing clothes and imitating a child kidnapper but was ENTIRELY unrelated to the lady? Come on. Talk about just feeding the audience highly fabricated information that was essentially unrelated but made you think it should be important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may think this film is your typical Tinseltown thriller - thanks to its impressive A-list cast - but don't be fooled; this is a dark, unrelenting tale that cares more about posing moral questions within its murky world than it does about providing narrative twists and turns. Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay delivers grim by the barrel-load, but also intelligence and maturity, whilst Denis Villeneuve's direction is haunting and suggestive without being manipulative or overwrought. Hugh Jackman is front and centre as Keller Dover, the distraught father who will do anything to find his abducted daughter, and he's given credible support by Maria Bello, Terrence Howard and Voila Davis, although it's Jake Gyllenhaal as the loner cop in charge of the disturbing case who is the standout. So far so good, yet there's one major drawback that stops this gritty affair being brilliant: its length. At two and a half hours long, a large chunk of its power is lost with a bloated middle act that should've had 30 minutes shaved off in the editing suite. Prisoners is a Zodiac-esque thriller that requires a strong emotional resolve, your undivided attention and a pre-movie toilet stop.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really unmainstream crime film, surprisingly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know, I expected an extremely riveting thriller. Prisoners is a weird mixture of art-house sensibility and mainstream formulas. It's always verging on being contrived, and yet it somehow all works. It's extremely long, and yet I didn't mind the length. It really shouldn't work as much as it does, but somehow it does. Jackman is great, but Gyleenhaal is on another level with a less meatier role. This is his best performance since Donnie Darko back in 2001. The rest of the cast is solid, but Melissa Leo sort of overacts, yet again. This woman doesn't know when to tone it down at all. This is definitely recommended for all film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trivial plot improved by fine directing and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Are the days of promoting team playing over? Leading characters in Prisoners are strong individualists who are committed to pursue their case and obtain results at any cost; feelings of people close to them are less important.True, observing vigorous personalities is always catchier and attracts wider audiences - and the movie in question has enjoyed big popularity and positive attitudes already. Director Denis Villeneuve has skilfully utilized Hugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's skills, and supporting actors like Paul Dano or Viola Davis are always a firm choice. Tensions are high, viewers can ponder about guilt and remorse, gray and rainy background boosts anxiety... The length, however, is too much (pace tends to fade at times) and motives of the chief offender could have been different. The ending is versatile, a kind of summing up all preceding events... Unexpected, but still not wow!.Thus, a decent thriller, recommended to those fond of gloomy surroundings dinned by weather. But take/save your time as ca 2,5 hours are ahead...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grim Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to see "Prisoners" is to go in cold, not knowing anything, and be surprised and excited by every new twist and turn. I knew very little and had moderate expectations, so that when the early event ? every parent's worst nightmare, the kidnapping of children ? occurs I was seized by dread and anxiety which didn't let up until the final moment in the film. I see too many movies that don't really engage me, so it was thrilling to watch a movie that so completely held me in thrall.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the cop assigned to the case. He's intuitive and methodical and has a history of solving all his cases. It doesn't help, though, that the father (played by Hugh Jackman) of one of the little kidnapped girls, impatient with the cop's M.O., decides to take matters into his own hands. He's a good man who does something unspeakably bad, and what he ends up doing morally rips him apart. This turns the movie from being merely a police procedural into something altogether different, and makes it really interesting. There are monsters in the movie ? and in the world ? and they're not the big bad wolf living off in the woods, somewhere. Sometimes they live among us, in nice tidy little houses down the street ? or maybe they lurk inside us.I was afraid that the story was going to be too convoluted and that there were going to be gaps in logic (it's a testament to how involved I was in the movie that, for awhile, I was on edge about this) but these were tidied up to my satisfaction. One critic I read thought the movie was way too long, but I wasn't bored for an instant. "Prisoners" is exactly as long as it needs to be. I liked director Denis Villeneuve's careful and methodical pacing, slow and suggestive fades and preoccupation with mood (all of which, for me, increased the suspense). There were moments when this movie messed with my head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imprisoned by hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know from the first Roger Deakins-framed shot of this child abduction drama that you're watching quality. The craft is exquisite ? and the thematic and emotional content is equal to it. This is a sophisticated film that consumes material outside the staple multiplex diet: frustration, ambivalence, forgiveness, grief, rage. Prisoners has its contrivances, and a few dubious character actions, but always at the service of telling a gripping story, and asking some challenging questions.The film opens with the Dover clan, headed by Keller (Hugh Jackman), visiting the Birch family for Thanksgiving dinner. Contentment and complacency abounds. The two youngest kids go outside and don't come back. The dawning horror of the parents, and the rapid escalation in panic, is horribly and heartbreakingly played out. Keller is convinced that the child-minded neighbour Alex (Paul Dano) is the culprit. So when lonesome Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal, practically reprising his role from Zodiac, except now with new End of Watch tattoos) can find no evidence, Keller takes matters ? and Alex ? into his own bloody hands.The rain. It hasn't poured so much in a detective thriller since Se7en ? and the mood is similarly doom-drenched. There are elements of Silence of the Lambs as well, although Prisoners is a film of subtler autumn shades. It's not as stark and austere as Markus Schleinzer's Michael, but it strikes the same eerie mood, and likewise moves at a pleasingly slow pace.The performances are excellent. Gyllenhaal's wide eyes seem here to have had their naivety washed out by horror; Loki blinks hard like he's photographing all he sees. As for Keller, we first see him stalking prey. He's a predatory animal, an aggressive protector, and grief will translate into ferociousness. Jackman, a most likable screen presence, must work extra hard to fight off our sympathy. Then there are the wives. Maria Bello's Grace appears passive, but this is simply a reflection of her pragmatic husband's inability to connect with her emotionally. Nancy Birch (Viola Davis, typically intense) stays at her husband's side, gradually becoming dominant, fuelled by the agony of loss and the even worse agony of hope.There are some truly memorable moments in Prisoners. The scene in which Loki discovers child-sized boxes in the house of a suspect is pure Hitchcock brilliance. Later, his bloody-eyed race through busy traffic is probably the most thrilling car chase of the year ? the stakes could not be higher. And the scene involving Keller, a bathroom, and a claw hammer is harrowing on multiple levels: the drama is in the intention.Prisoners is distressing without being repulsive; moving without being sentimental; thrilling without being exploitative. This is the standard to which all mainstream drama should aspire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie "blind" (i.e I did not read any reviews ). I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the movie. The ending may have been a bit predictable but getting there was a fun and amazing ride. Hugh Jackman gives a very powerful performance surrounded by some excellent supporting performances. Paul Dano is fantastic as always. The material is dark and the movie is not an easy watch but it will keep you interested until the bitter and controversial end. If you love good acting and a pretty decent story then this is the movie for you. I also was impressed by Jake Gyllenhaal's under stated performance. I don't usually like the guy but he's great in this one. He's also surrounded by great performers so it's hard to shine. All and all you will enjoy this movie but , as a parent, it's not an easy watch. In fact it can be down right disturbing and will having you thinking about the content for days....but that's what good movies do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a masterpiece thriller with good acting both from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. It's a good kidnapped story, however I must say that I'm quite depressed after watched this movie. Perhaps,it's too emotional and gripping. Around 20 minutes before the movie finished,I can guess the kidnapper and here you can expect a twist and clever ending. I am impressed with Hugh's acting since I only saw him as an action hero like in X-Men or Wolverine.I do hope to see him in more drama movies. If you want a simple thriller movie, then be brace because it can be too emotional for you.I also love Melissa Leo's and Paul Dano's acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really loved this movie and it made me emotional. I really felt like I was there with the families going through everything they were going through. I felt their pain. I thought I knew what was going to happen and then something else happens and I am drawn into the movie just waiting to see what happens next. I kept thinking what if this was my family? What if I was in that position? What would I do? This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall do an amazing acting job for this movie and it also has Terrence Howard and Maria Bello. I have seen many movies this year including Elysium, Despicable Me 2, World War Z, Star Trek "Into Darkness", Iron Man 3 just to name a few and this was by far the best movie of the year so far. If you like suspense thrillers and emotional movies then this is a must see movie.</fullReview>

Jake Gyllenhaal is spectacular as the detective who investigates the mystery crime in the small town. Paul Dano plays the suspect in a way that only he could do it. What makes this so real is the other acting of Hugh Jackman, Terrance Howard and Academy Award winners Melissa Leo and nominee Viola Davis.

And, how could there be only one detective on the case? usually they always work in pairs and the detectives and the CSI's would have torn the suspects home and property apart from the beginning and ultimately found the car/well/ pit .The girls mother (Hugh Jackmans' wife) also made a marvelous recovery as soon as her daughter was found but her husband went missing.A great story but a little far fetched in the real world of law enforcement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspense from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If movies were rated according to the heartbeats per minute they caused, this one would get a top score. My heart started beating after the first fifteen minutes and kept on until the very end. That's how much suspense there is in this film. The film is very long (153 minutes), but never bores or slows down. In fact, I enjoyed every new plot twist because it would make the suspense last longer. If you like intelligent thrillers, you shouldn't miss this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The story is quite complicated, but during the film it turns out every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly. In fact, some elements I only figured out after returning home. The start of the movie is very strong. Two happy families, visiting each other for Thanksgiving, enjoy a nice evening until they realize that the two young daughters are missing. Both couples react differently. After the police releases the only suspect because they can't find anything against him, one of the fathers decides to take matters into his own hands. His despair makes his sense of what's right and wrong disappear. Apart from the very good script, other strong points are the cinematography, showing cold, rainy forests in shades of grey, and the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the lone, tough detective Loki, who is determined to solve the case against all odds. He works alone, doesn't have a family and never smiles. Even after the case is solved and he is visited in hospital by one of the mothers, he doesn't show any emotion at all. The film contains some graphic violence, and also has some rather creepy moments. This is not a nice, easy, polished film. It has some rough edges and a dark intensity. That's why I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A haunting, suspenseful and masterfully acted ambitious picture with emotional complexity and a sense of dread, especially if you are a parent considering the subject matter, that makes for an absorbing and disturbing view. The film is several steps above most other recent crime thrillers or revenge stories, deciding to not only be unforgettably intelligent with an intense story while being brilliantly grounded in reality, but to care as well. It's so potently riveting that I couldn't turn away from it until the first ending credit. I can't praise this film enough and I feel that it deserves to have the honor of being discussed as a potential awards contender starting with both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, who give what is perhaps the best performances of their careers as their character-driven roles as the two leads were raw, real and makes you start questioning about what would you do if you were ever put in the exact same position either character's shoes were in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really good example of its genre and is a rewarding watch. The performances really make this film, especially Maria Bello and Terrence Howard in their supporting roles. It's two and a half hours long, but doesn't feel like it's dragging on. It's not especially smart but there's enough suspense and grim mystery to keep your attention. I thought it picked up nicely during the vigil scene and kept my attention from then on. I liked Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Loki, and thought the eye tick and neck tattoo underscored the dysfunctional motif. There were a few clues along the way that make sense once the film reaches it's conclusion, which I guess is fun if you like figuring things out. It's a good movie and the actors did a good job, but it's not one I would watch again soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is the kind of mystery/drama that stays with you long after you've left the auditorium. Denis Villeneuve's choice to emphasize and build tension by long takes gives the film an engrossing feel, and also helps the actors to really sink in and disappear into the characters. Supported by Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography and Jóhann Jóhannsson's haunting score, the film develops a bleak world which will keep you captivated for days.P.S. The film's mood reminded me of two shows that I immensely love: "Twin Peaks" and "Forbrydelsen".Be sure to check them out, if you dug this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting slow burner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dovers a religious family meet up for thanksgiving lunch over at the Birches, their friendly neighbor. Both families have two children, a teen and a kid. By evening the two kids go missing. A creepy looking young man who had his RV parked outside is the main suspect. Detective Loki(Gyllenhaal), an efficient investigator with cent percent solve rate is assigned to the case. However there is nothing that ties the suspect to the missing girls...or is there? Did Dover(Jackman) pick up something the police couldn't? Could this father with anger issues be right after all? Morality is put to test when strong suspicions become motive for vigilante investigation. Soon Winter approaches and the case is tuning cold with dead-end leads.Thriller lovers rejoice, the dry spell for suspense masterpieces ends with prisoners. With stellar performances from the entire cast topped off with a compelling portrayal of Keller Dover by Hugh Jackman, Prisoners is 150 minutes well spent.Make no mistake this is NOT a fast paced thriller with action sequences and multiple twists. Prisoners is a slow burner that tightens the tension steadily and by climax the pressure hits the roof. The aha moment when Dover puts all the pieces in place and the consequences that follow is simply a stroke of genius from writer Aaron Guzikowski.A good suspenseful plot can be occasionally seen in an episode of a procedural TV show. Terrific acting from an ensemble cast is usually a part of an award bait drama and then rarely comes the amalgamation of both resulting in an "Argo" or a "Silence of the lambs". Prisoners definitely belongs among these classics and hopefully will be duly awarded not only for the performances but for the direction and writing that transforms a decent story into a terrific movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Puzzling Desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners. It's a slick dark crime investigation thriller raising few questions on moral ambiguity. The theme is based on kidnapping of two small children in a small town where police fails to make much progress and a parent takes matters into his own hands. Like Ben Affleck's smashing debut Gone Baby Gone, the movie's journey is about putting the pieces of clues together and in parallel questioning how much evil you can become to counter the evil? Lead actors Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhall give their best and supporting actors provide nice support. Movie takes the conventional route of a crime drama but it's the unsettling intensity in atmosphere through grey background and chilling performances that keep you puzzled in a good way from start to finish. Like other classic crime thrillers, it asks you to provide your full attention and makes you discuss it more and more long after the movie has ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating, dark, dramatic and visually poetic, 'Prisoners' is a consummate thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A two-headed thriller, "Prisoners" is one part conventional kidnapping mystery and one part psychological drama. While the mystery of who abducted two little girls haunts the entirety of the 153-minute runtime and will keep audiences glued for every minute, the film also serves as a portrait of a desperate parent willing to cross any line to get his daughter back.Those who crave the classic dark and gritty "whodunit" and also enjoy some dramatic heft and effective gravitas will find "Prisoners" an enormous gift. Exhibiting consummate filmmaking and storytelling from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, this is a true thriller that doesn't try and pull too many tricks.Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and their two kids are celebrating the Thanksgiving holiday at their neighbors' ? the Birches (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) ? house. At the end of the evening, the families realizes their two little girls are missing and the lonely Police Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets on the case. Police apprehend the practically mute Alex Jones (Paul Dano) but let him go when they can't get him to talk and don't have any evidence to bring charges. Unsatisfied, Keller, certain Jones is hiding something, abducts him and tries to get him to talk before it's too late.Writer Aaron Guzikowski, who previously adapted "Contraband" from its Icelandic predecessor, delivers a straightforward script with numerous complications. The story will get under your skin while leaving enough nuggets in the mystery to keep you captivated. Unfortunately, all the twists and discoveries might generate some difference in opinion. Nothing is done, spelled out or tied up neatly and clearly ? Guzikowski cares more about symbolism and themes than satisfying answers.Villeneuve appears to be a perfect pairing with this script, as he enjoys the symbolism and setting the tone early and often. "Prisoners" has a downright creepy vibe that will keep viewers constantly paranoid. Every shot is a portrait, with due credit to veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins. The film's stunning imagery automatically sets it apart from run-of-the-mill thrillers.Jackman's performance is the only one of note in "Prisoners" despite the excellent ensemble. The roles filled by Howard, Davis, Dano, Bello and Melissa Leo as Alex's aunt could've been done by anyone. A good case could be made for Gyllenhaal too, but his character is straightforward ? a detective whose primary concern is to solve the damn case to shake off his own expectations and those of others.The aspect of "Prisoners" that should garner the most praise is the way it incorporates strong character elements in with the main mystery narrative. Just as crucial to the story is the way Keller, a God-fearing man whose life philosophy is "pray for the best, prepare for the worst," begins to unravel mentally and morally after the disappearance of his child. He proves to be far from the protagonist when all is said and done and the resolution of his individual story becomes of equal importance to the resolution of the greater mystery."Prisoners" only begins to crumble a bit when it comes to sorting out the truth from the distractions and driving home the central themes. Religious imagery and ideas dominate the beginning of the movie and get peppered in throughout, but there's a lack of follow through. The notion of the unsolvable maze, which comes into play at one point, also seems relevant to the story, but is never explained. The movie wants you to think about its ideas rather than its outcomes, which is a fair request, but the outcomes better be straightforward enough to discern and in many cases they aren't.Dark, cold and troubling, "Prisoners" is a brooding thriller with both substantial dramatic and mystery elements. Villeneuve is a talent to keep an eye on in the future as with Guzikowski, despite the flaws in the wrap-up of the film. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

The cast are excellent so much so that my wife has now gone from liking Hugh Jackman to seeing him as some sort of mad rampaging bully, perhaps that's more to do with his treatment of Paul Dano who she has a soft spot for. It isn't Jake Gyllenhalls finest film much preferred him in end of watch but it is a solid performance. Paul Dano is excellent in his portrayal of the prime suspect &amp; the film builds up a true sense of menace &amp; suspense leading to its conclusion. The miserable setting a weather adds to the undoubted despair of the characters &amp; the direction is solid. If I have to add one criticism its that the film is 30 minutes longer than it needs to be which leads to a feeling of this is being dragged out for the sake of it.

		<fullReview>Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who watched this yesterday though he didn't mind seeing it again. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are quite compelling as a frustrated parent of a missing child and a police detective who tries to do everything right in finding this child, respectively. They both go after different suspects and it's quite interesting what the results are. Plenty of points-of-views of methods and which suspect is guilty abound and it got me hooked for most of the narrative. One might be disappointed at the way things end but since the dialogue offers clues as to what could happen, one should still be partially informed enough as to the eventual conclusion. In summary, Prisoners could be good enough for anyone not minding everything not spelled out in a neat tidy package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners was an outstanding movie! The performances of this cast in its entirety were captivating. These are all actors I was never particular fond of either, especially in relation to Jake Gyllenhaal. His character in this film had depth though and left you with certain curiosity. You know there's a back story there with all the clues and emphasis on behavior, mannerisms, and appearance in general. Also actress Melissa Leo, known for her riveting performances in Frozen River and The Fighter, totally engrosses herself in her respective character in which she worked very hard to make herself appear older and worn. This story allows you to solve the puzzle at the same speed as it's characters while asking yourself the same questions. Although both the film's writer Aaron Guzikowski and its Canadian Director Denis Villeneuve are virtually unknowns in Hollywood, their pairing with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins made this a beautifully shot film as well. The images of weather and landscape are as cold, dark, dreary, and depressing as the film itself which makes it all the more chilling. - Reviewed by AN/NR 09-20-2013</fullReview>

It makes you confront our own morality and pushes generic stereotypes (such as the priest) to the limits of our own minds. It's also rather poetic, the prisoner theme dips in and out but the ending really ties it all together and gives the title more meaning. A dazzling display of cinema.The same director will be doing the next Blade Runner and at this rate, with this directors background - it's sure to be incredible too. Bravo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this Denis Viellenueve movie, we see Hugh Jackman playing a man in crisis to which his children has been kidnapped. Throughout the film, to get to know the character of Detective Loki (brilliantly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal) who helps Jackman find the kidnapper and send him to prison. The film shows you the events that happened on Hugh Jackman trying to find his children's kidnappers, and torture them to the holt until they give him the information that he wants. The film is very tense and gritty throughout, and the whole cast does brilliantly throughout the entirety of the film. This is the film that got me to notice Gyllenhaals power in Acting and dedication to his roles, it made me become a real fan of his work, and inspired me to watch him in 'Nightcrawler, Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, and recently Southpaw) Gyllenhaal is a marvellous Actor with a lot to offer on screen, and his Co-Starr (Hugh Jackman) does perfectly as the devastated father in this movie. You can't help think of Jackman and think (Wolverine) from X-Men. But this film proves that he is capable of being a lot more than a hard headed mutant when it comes to Acting. This film is extremely enjoyable throughout, and definitely sticks with you after watching it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners features a pitch perfect cast with Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, among others. Mostly every performance in the film was great but I loved especially Hugh Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Jackman as the father of the missing girl is really believable and he delivers a performance that is truly Oscar worthy. My favorite scene with Jackman is when he meets Gyllenhaal for the first time in his house, you can really tell he is committed to the character but pretty much every scene he's in is great. Gyllenhaal as the detective investigating the case is great and he just continues to prove to me why he's one of my favorite actors. He's so versatile and can play a very wide range of roles. Melissa Leo plays the aunt of Paul Dano who plays a very troubled young man who is treated as a suspect in the film. Both of them are great and Paul Dano delivers a pretty odd and kind of disturbing performance.Prisoners is the kind of movie you think is going a certain way and it mostly does but it shakes it and twists it along the way enough to keep you guessing. From the opening shot you feel the tension of the film that endures until the movie is over. This is mostly thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the smart direction of Villeneuve. He knows exactly where to put the camera in exactly what situation, especially given the talent he had on this production. So prisoners is pretty much an excellent movie, the tone of the movie is defined very early, there is a clear structure and everything is executed beautifully. Everything that happened advanced the plot or developed the characters. It reminded me of a David Fincher film. This is a very different film than Enemy, which was also directed by Villeneuve but they're both amazing films and this is definitely worth a watch.10/10</fullReview>

Probably what stands out the most are the incredible performances by all of the actors here, but especially Hugh Jackman, who delivers an Academy worthy performance. Jackman's character is a walking contradiction, he cloaks himself in every kind of religious regalia he can, while at the same time showing absolutely no confidence in his fellow man. When adversity enters his life, he ends up abandoning all of his supposed beliefs in order to save his family. Paul Dano is also excellent as the mysterious Alex Jones, an eccentric person that Jackman's Dover character is sure has taken his daughter. Gylenhall plays the deliberate and deductive detective that like every other character in this movie, is dealing with some demons of his own. This story is tight and excellently directed, every scene is chalked full of relevant information that will revel the greater understanding later. And even after the story concludes, will leave you thinking for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, that's one really overrated movie (it even got an Oscar nomination). I don't understand why director Dennis Villeneuve is hold in such high esteem but this drama/crime/mystery film is just boring. Despite the shiny cast and the atmospheric direction this is just a mediocre missing persons crime movie that is painfully slow and lengthy. Good luck trying to cope with 153 minutes of slow motion "action scenes", like watching people crossing a road in the rain in real time (and in slow pace)! I do not know how everyone considered this movie an "emotional, absorbing and disturbing viewing" (rotten tomatoes critics consensus) but I would say that is just a disturbing viewing. period.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to state that I don't want to give any detail about the story for the people who haven't watched it yet. So, my review will not be about the story of the film, but the bad comments about the film.I would like to tell something about the comments related with the runtime of the film. In some reviews it is told that the film is too long and that is one of the reasons that they don't like it. I really do my best to understand why people judge a film with its runtime, but I cant. Cinema is the art of telling a story on the white big screen. If you need long time to tell a story, then you do it in that way. The success of a film does not depend on the runtime, gentlemen. You may say that you didn't like the film, it is that easy, but the runtime itself can not be an excuse not to like a film unless you don't make a short film. (You know short films tell the story in the shortest time as much as possible, that is why they call them as short film, but "Prisoners" is not one of them)The reasons that I like "Prisoners":1. It didn't MAKE ME FEEL that IT WAS TOO LONG. It means it took my attention from the beginning to the end.2. Techincally, I like the art directing, especially color grading and the usage of cameras.3. The acting is not as bad as some say. I don't know if you expect an exaggerated acting or not, but the acting is AT LEAST AVAGARE, but not worse than it!4. For the questions like "why did he do this, why did he do that? why did it happen like this?": I would like to remind that in every story telling you can find or make up a problem if you want to. All right, I agree with the people who think that there are some missing or nonsense parts in the story, but keep in mind that it is a film and even the best films can have knowingly or unknowingly have such problems. (Some friends of mine told me that they didn't like the masterpiece "Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon" directed by Ang Lee as people in the film were flying while they were fighting and they thought that this was nonsense. What can I do except laughing?) On the other hand, would you like it more if all questions were answered and not kept as secret? It changes from person to person, but i would not like it personally...5. Some say that they didn't like the end though it was so clean (sometimes you don't need to see the end to know how it ends). Moreover, some film makers knowingly leave the end to the person himself, so, if you cant be sure how it ends, work your imagination and let the film end in the way you wish.6. Some say that it is the worst film they have seen in 2013. Shame on you! Please respect to the people who gave effort and spent money to bring it to the white big screen. It is not a masterpiece but not a bad film, either. Do you seriously think that it is the worst film of the year? If so, I have nothing to tell you except that I collect real bad films as they have a great value in film making, but I can say that this is not one of them.As a result, it took 8/10 from me.Best Regards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, but too dark and too serious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I move on to PRISONERS, directed by Denis Villenueve from a script written by Aaron Guzikowski.I am going to try to keep this review a short one because I know this movie is very dark and serious and can get very disturbing and emotional in a few areas during the 153-minute feature running time. There will be a few spoilers in this review, so if you haven't seen the film, you may want to.PRISONERS just blew me away with it's story. Aaron Guzikowski wrote a screenplay that is just really amazing with great dialogue and a great plot in this film. The story focuses on the abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the police's subsequent search. Keller Dover and his wife Grace attends a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch and both families' younger daughters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch goes missing. Detective David Loki arrests and questions the driver of a suspicious vehicle, Alex Jones and Dover attacks Jones after he is released.Loki is doing different cases, but Dover decides to take matters into his own hands and tortures Alex Jones for answers, but he denies that he is Alex Jones and claims that he escaped from a maze. Dover visits Jones' aunt, Holly and she tells that she and her husband were religious until their son died of cancer. Joy Birch is found drugged but alive. Dover visits her in the hospital and Joy tells him "You were there".Loki searches for Dover and discovers Jones. Dover goes to the Jones' house to get information, but Holly pulls a gun out on him. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and drinks some kind of poisoning, but I'll get to that in a minute. She explains that her and her late husband abducted many children as part of their "war on God" after their son died. She shoots him in the leg and forces him to get inside a concealed pit and imprisons him in the pit, where he finds a whistle belonging to his daughter.Anna is found with Holly, but Anna is taken to the hospital and Holly is killed. Outside the Jones' house, Loki hears Dover's labored whistling from the pit that he is imprisoned in.I thought the pacing and dialogue was a little confusing, but also really amazing throughout the movie and that is an incredible but hard and challenging thing to pull off, but a lot of movies has done this really great.***SPOILER ALERT!*** Like I said in the plot, Dover is imprisoned by Holly and this was the main issue I had with the film. Because for two reasons: ? 1. She imprisons him in a concealed pit, makes him drink some kind of poison. I don't know what it is, but it's all black. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and shoots him in the leg, forcing him to get inside the pit. I think this could have been done better with music in the scene at least.? 2. The ending was a little confusing and I only watched this movie once, but I think the end is there just to set up a sequel.The acting is just amazing. Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of credit for his performance as Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki wonderfully. Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Maria Bello are all great in this film. Paul Dano plays Alex Jones and he is great in the part that he had to play and he was an amazing casting choice for the film.The only performance that I had trouble with was Academy Award winner Melissa Leo's character, Holly Jones. She had to wear make-up for the part, but she is just scary as heck in the part that she plays and what she did to Hugh Jackman's character did not seemed like a very good idea at all.This is the reason why this film appeared on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list is because of the ending, which I just mentioned. This movie really deserved the Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Picture, but the Academy only chooses great movies.PRISONERS is a great film, and I will forever be angry that this did not win an Academy Award, but Frozen wins two Oscars? That is just crazy! This film was originally rated NC-17 for "substantial disturbing violent content and explicit images", but was re-edited to secure the R rating for "disturbing violent content include torture and language throughout". I am so glad that this got the R rating because I would not have been able to watch this film if it was NC-17.The music is just amazing. The cinematography, editing, production and costume designs are just amazing.Overall, I love PRISONERS. Even though the ending got on my nerves a little bit, I still love what this movie does and what it shows. This is one crime - drama / mystery - suspense thriller that I don't think gets enough credit.My rating is going to be the rating of 10 out of 10. It's a perfect movie and you should see it. Sure, it is graphic, disturbing, emotional and violent in some areas, but if you can look past some of that, you may be able to find one great drama that will satisfy you.PRISONERS is a great film that will blow you away and the performances of Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Paul Dano in this film will certainly blow you away from beginning to end and you will not be able to take your eyes off your television screen from start to finish once this movie begins and once it ends after 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love movies and I love the mystery movies the most and sorry to blow my own trumpet, I have seen a lot of them.Prisoners is one of the best mystery movies with a gripping plot. The performance delivered by Jake and Hugh are simply amazing. You feel the characters and play them. While Hugh Jackman is on screen, you feel his pain of father searching for daughter and while Jake Gyllenhaal plays detective, you feel like a true detective. The movie keeps you engaged in solving the mystery. The ending is completely satisfying and everything, though appears to be so enigmatic all the time, makes sense.This is a masterpiece and a must watch for all the movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Prisoners so special, is that it is more than just one of the most tense thrillers ever seen, classified into the ranks of thriller-titans, like "Seven": It raises questions, builds up labyrinths and puzzles, twists the plot countless times and leaves space to interpret. You must watch out, be attentive and curious in order to find out everything, and even then you have to watch the film twice if not more times. Rounded by a genius-like actresses performance of Hugh Jackman, Paul Dano and especially Jake Gyllenhaal playing the detective Loki. How would I have reacted in cases like this? What means this? Finished with a great ending, Prisoners is a must-see for every fan of thrillers or just movies better than the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great promise but lazy execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20 or so minutes was promising and I was gripped by what might unfold...then it fell apart with too many illogical and unrealistic actions by (supposedly normal) people to 'force' the plot, which doesn't make for good story telling.Too many times, the question of 'why is he/she doing that?' pulls me out of the movie sequence and after an hour, I was forced to be a critic instead of being absorbed by the story. To the movie's credit, it kept giving me hope that things will be explained later, but sadly, more illogical actions by the main characters dashed my hopes, and by the mid-point, my mind went to 'whatever' mode and stopped caring about the story.Very sloppy police work - 10 hours of interrogation of a mentally-challenged suspect, without once bringing in an expert to try to coax some truth out; In fact, all interrogations are a waste of time (All three suspects) and the police seem to be okay with learning nothing; a detective who is a loner and 'rambo' all crime scenes by himself, and never once discusses the case with anyone else; When following a suspect, he allows a truck to keep honking him instead of moving out of the way to stay undiscovered? Must be a new surveillance method; a captain who acts like a security guard on a fairly high-profile case, never once directing his people on the investigation nor ever seemed to be interested in the case; Cuff a suspect but leaves him right beside the main door while going deeper into the house searching various rooms? In real life, the suspect would try to make a break for it, surely!; Shoot a suspect, and being shot in the process, but wait, a child is hurt, so let's not even check if the suspect is dead or call it in, just drive to a hospital with blood obscuring his view. Great, a car chase wouldn't make sense for the plot, so let's add this to pump up the adrenaline. Stupid!; stop digging because the ground is frozen, really? Urgency is not valued in police work. Anyone who has seen even one episode of CSI will shake head at how poor the investigators are at treating the case and evidence. The search scene shows a rather large police force, yet on a case with multiple suspects and leads, 'lone ranger' goes it alone. Conveniently, all the clues are on the internet because the police couldn't link various cases of missing children to find some common treads in a (supposedly - due to the 'redneck' style police work) small community; DNA tracing and finger printing must be too new to this police department so that the plot can keep going without the disruption from truth or logic. The main suspect's parents 'died in a car accident'? Let's not check his background and his parents' names.Very strange crisis-management/grieving process - one mother resigns to sadness and spends her time in bed medicated; another mother sits at home staring at old photos. Hang on, the children are not known to be dead yet, shouldn't they try to do something? No, it's easier to grief instead of looking. Why is Dover doing all the running around? And, four parents, each seem to do their own thing, unknown to their respective partners, are allowed to carry on. No one wants to 'band' together to discuss how to find their missing children, they just want to rage in their own way. A new family structure? Terrible villains - The priest who knows a dead man is in his basement, but keeps it to himself. Maybe he didn't kill the guy, but a priest is not bound by silence when known crimes are committed (kidnapping and killing children cannot be said to require the vow of silence, surely)...perhaps, he wanted in on the action? But then why let the guy die and then keep the body?; Dover becomes a kidnapper and torturer, in the hope of learning the truth, but he never gives his captive a chance to speak...every time the captive says something, instead of coaxing more out of him, he goes on a yelling rage of 'tell me'...mate, shut the f**K up and listen, maybe he is trying to tell you something. Then he cleverly constructs a box so that he cannot hear what his captive says...this means he only wants to torture the guy and not extract information as the main objective of the exercise; The old auntie seem to be an experienced abductor and child killer, yet wouldn't shoot a man threatening to reveal her true identity...why toy with him when children are her real targets? He is just an obstacle to her pursuits, so shoot him in the head already and throw him into the hole and be done with it...but noooo, we need the last whistle scene to close out the story. She can bound and gag the children when Dover comes to visit, but would lead the detective to the child (With open door no less) instead of getting rid of him before killing the child; and if her real objective is to rage against god by killing children, why keep the children alive for 6 days? Are there 'auspicious' days to kill children that we weren't told in the story? All in all, the movie has enough to keep audiences watching, but their minds must be switched off to accept the story development. Based on the plot alone, there is no reason to watch after the first half an hour. Acting is brilliant when compared to the script and maybe that is the ticket; have a terrible script so that the actors can make use of their talents to keep the audience watching. When I say brilliant, I do not mean good, I just mean it is much better than the script. What a waste of talent on this 'didn't-think-it-through' crime caper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I give this movie 3 instead of one star is that acting wasn't bad. Acting alone however cannot make up for a totally stupid plot. There were so many inconsistencies in this movie that I don't know where to start. First, the movie seems to tell about the worst detective on planet Earth. He always goes alone to places where he can expect danger. He doesn't have the ability to interrogate people properly and do research - i.e. when he finds a dead body in the priest's cellar, he doesn't even take the time to interview the priest properly. The priest tries to tell him that the killer had a family, etc. but the detective just looks bored and thinks of a way to leave the room immediately. Even though in the beginning they arrest a guy under the suspicion of having a connection with the disappearance of the girls, they never bother to do a search of his house (we later find out the girls had been there all along). Also, although ALex is officially a suspect, they never make any checks on him, nor do they check his aunt's version of who he is. As it turns out later, her version is completely made up. well, if he is just one of the boys they kidnapped a long time ago, how did he even have identity papers, driving license, etc. How come the police never checks? The maze maps, Alex's words that the girls are in the maze, all leaves the impression that these maps will actually relate in some way to an actual physical place; however, the girls are simply in the aunt's house and apparently the countless mazes appearing in the film lead only to a medallion the uncle had. Also, Alex is portrayed as almost unable to talk but on the other hand when he speaks he does so perfectly coherently. The snakes are ridiculous. I could go on forever but just don't have the energy after all the time I lost watching this film! What shocks me the most is the high result this movie has on IMDb and the hype in the comments. Absolutely undeserved!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that a movie needs to be watched at least twice to know whether it's good or not. Lots of movies aren't worth a second viewing but Prisoners was OK enough to see again.The first time I liked it. The plot is interesting, quite original despite the topic, kidnapped children. It's a bit depressing and not for sensitive souls. The actors are doing a great job and there's a dark atmosphere throughout the entire movie, mainly because of the great cinematography.When I watched it a second time and the story was no longer a surprise, I thought there was too much added thrill factor/action scenes. I think it would be a lot better without the excessive violence, a rapid car scene that is way too long and so on. I rated it an 8, a bit high maybe but I tend to like cinema with certain atmospheres and this thriller does it quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting free the perfect thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is a searing film that takes a scenario we've seen many times before and stands it on its head. The film is about the abduction of two young girls and the way it effects their families and the police who search for them. It has a circular maze as one of its central motifs, and also has a maze of a plot. As Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the distraught father of one of the girls takes the law into his own hands and remorselessly pursues one of the suspects, he becomes at odds with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who hunts down other leads.Both men work through the maze of clues from opposite directions with pieces of the puzzle slowly dropping into place. Finally it all comes together in a disturbing climax. When a thriller this good comes along, we tend to start making comparisons with the greats of the genre, Hitchcock and Polanski or more recently Demme and Fincher, but if this movie reminds me of anything it's the Dutch version of George Sluizer's "The Vanishing". Not so much in superficial similarities, but because both films share a quality that was perfectly summed up by British actor Brian Cox ? desolation. Although Cox was talking about Woody Allen's "Match Point", it's the lack of comfortable closure that generates that feeling, and all three films have it. With that said however, French Canadian filmmaker, Denis Villeneuve, is a man who rejects categorising. "I'm not necessarily a thriller fan", he says, "I didn't want to make a thriller; I'm not so attracted to genre. I thought the thriller elements inside the movie were just a vehicle for something more interesting: the dramatic and moral aspects of the story".Although we expect Jake Gyllenhaal to stretch himself in every role; it is Hugh Jackman who really challenges himself here. As Villeneuve said of him, "Good actors reach a point in their career where they just have an urge, an artistic need to explore new territory; they don't want to be prisoners of their own image and Hugh chose 'Prisoners' to move outside his comfort zone". Jackman nails the part of the self-made, self-reliant man who refuses to simply accept things as they stand.Despite improvisation on the set by Villeneuve and the cast, much of the credit for the film's power must go to the script by Aaron Guzilowski.When Villeneuve was given a choice of scripts after receiving serious Hollywood attention following the release of "Polytechnique", he chose Guzilowski's script. There are no red herrings in the story; everything in "Prisoners" has meaning and fits into the maze. It's such a cleverly thought out plot, brought to life on the screen by Villeneuve and his crew plus a perfect cast. Although Villeneuve says he doesn't want to be pigeonholed in the thriller genre, lets hope he makes a few more visits before he hangs up the megaphone and folds the canvas chair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think of someone being a prisoner, you automatically might think of someone behind bars. But apart from a physical prison, a prisoner can also be trapped mentally, either by his own doing or by someone else. This movie that starts off pretty light gets very heavy. And it is carried by its actors. Gyllenhalls characters might seem odd and out of place at the beginning, even like a cardboard cutout. But he does have more to do as the movie progresses.Still front row seat is Hugh Jackman. And while some might argue that a female should have a bigger role in this, you only have so much time to tell a story. And this is perfectly told and cut together. It might not fit your description of entertainment (and I don't think the filmmaker would love it described as such), but the movie is really great. If you like dramas in general you should be cherishing this .... and you will.We have a few grey areas that we visit and the ending did not satisfy everyone (I know from friends). But the movie could not have ended any other way (in my book). Superb movie one of the best released in 2013</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningKeller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are plunged in to every parent's worst nightmare when their daughter goes missing, along with the daughter of their close friends Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis.) The finger of suspicion ends up pointing at Alex (Paul Dano), a local impaired boy, but due to a lack of evidence, Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the detective in charge of the investigation, is forced to let him go, much to Keller's chagrin. He takes the law in to his own hands in a desperate bid to find out where his daughter is, but nothing is quite as it seems and the real reason behind the girl's disappearance may be deeper buried than they thought.Sometimes, a simple, straight-forward story can work on far more levels and have a lot more to it if there are some strong human dynamics behind the scenes of it, i.e. in this case the ultimate nightmare of any parent, the loss of a child. Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners sets itself on a much grander scale than your average staple thriller, driven as it is by a strong sense of dark, forbidding atmosphere and stark exploration of human emotions and dynamics. In short, it has a lot more going for it than your typical thriller of it's ilk, filling every second of it's two and a half hour running time with hidden depths that just keep on coming, even if at times it all just does feel a little over whelming.While it's cascading down this emotional roller coaster ride, it's careful never to forget or unduly expose the mystery element to the story, keeping up the suspense over the missing girls and who or even what could be behind their disappearance. For material of this length, strong performances are a no brainer, and indeed we have revelatory turns from lead stars Gyllenhaal, turning in maybe his most intense, driven performance yet as the detective under pressure from others that never lets up, driven mad by constant potential break-throughs that lead nowhere, but it's Jackman as the tormented parent who possibly makes the biggest impression, channeling his Wolverine anger into something that will gain him more appreciation with a different audience.In aiming that bit higher than your typical thriller fare, Prisoners may be a bit too much for some to take in, and occasionally it is a little pretentious and see-through in trying to be deep, but it is no less of an accomplished effort that succeeds in what it sets out to do. ****</fullReview>

Instead, the virtually unknown Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is responsible for what is without doubt the best movie of 2013. There are staggering performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal,intricate plot twists that keep you on the edge of your seat and atmospheric elements that will make your heart race and interfere with normal breathing patterns.

		<shortDescription>Like, a prisoner, I was caged in. I couldn't stop watching this film. It was just that darn good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter and her friend is kidnapped. Minutes turn into hours, hours turn to days. Keller turn to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) for help. Their only clue, is that RV has been parked on their street, earlier that day by suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano). While, Detective Loki is looking for evidence that links Alex Jones to the crime, Keller takes the matter in his own hands; how far will this desperate father go to find his missing daughter? Prisoners is one of the best movies of 2013 in my opinion. It's sure to get a few Oscar nominations. I have to say Hugh Jackson deserve to win, if he does. There is a very powerful scene with him talking to Loki in a car, stating out, how his daughter is looking for him to save her, not Loki. You can't help feeling for this character as he goes through an emotional hell storm. He was a man who can only trust himself. He was a survivalist, and somewhat a paranoid. He prides himself on his strength and independence as a man who can make decisions and get things done alone. That is why he did what he did and he went through a great deal of punishment for it. Keller though loses his way, and ends up in a literal pit in the ground, a "hell" as it were. Great use of symbolism. I love the fact that his wife's name is Grace. (Maria Bello). Grace gets more and more lost, as Keller lose more and more of his morals. Basically he has lost the "grace" of God through his actions. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass that was pretty interesting. Nobody in this film was the clear cut good guy and villain. Remind me of the verse 'Through a glass, darkly' in the Bible. Then, there is the many crosses, including one hanging from the rear-view mirror in Keller's truck. The symbolism doesn't get in the way of the plot, too much until the snakes came into play. I guess, it was a play on the serpent in the Garden of Eden, but it also could had meant the Norse symbol for the god Loki which is two entertained snakes, eating each others' tails which Jake Gyllenhaal is name after. Still, it could had been left out. Then the movie became a symbolism smorgasbord with the endless mazes, one eye themes, opening Pandora's boxes, tattoos, free-mason rings, and that got the plot more confusing. Research all the examples, I have stated out. You find yourself, surprising in depth this movie goes. Trust me, the plot will get confusing. I had to watch it, multiply times to get all the twist and turns. It was a maze of suspects. The allegory of the prison is a significant theme throughout the film. Each character, whether psychologically or physically, is the subject of some kind of confinement. Without giving it away, the ending of the film is a brilliant bittersweet ending, that can be seem as both a happy and tragic at the same time. A lot of parents will be hugging their children tonight after watching this film. A few people might not like this movie due to its controversial subject matter. I think some Christian conservative might find the movie as liberal anti-Christian propaganda that makes Christians look bad. I didn't see it that way. I think a certain Alex Jones in the world, might, but I see Keller going through the same emotions if he wasn't a Christian. The characters put into huge stressful tragic events that makes them challenge their own faith. I think the use of faith was highly welcome into this film. It made the film interesting with its symbolism. The second thing, people didn't like is the animal abuse. First off, no animals were harm during the filming of this film. Second off, the killing of the deer makes more morality sense than it's made out to be. Deer can actually overpopulate an area and starve the local species if not controlled. Some states have actual contracts with hunters to maintain a quota by cutting the herd. Then there is the dog scene. Let's remember, Alex Jones is not a smart guy, so it would make sense that he wouldn't know how to handle a dog. I hate to see PETA boycott the film over those, without understanding the facts and story. The movie isn't about the animals, but looking for kidnap children. People coming in, should focus more that, then what happen to the animals. The question comes down to morals and ethics. The acting is amazing. It's seems to me that Jake Gallenhaal's Loki is such an interesting character that fans of the film is asking for a spin-off movie. By the way, Loki blink so much, is probably because he is a detective, and they rarely sleep. At less, that what I got from his character development. It's a very long movie directed by Denise Villeneuve, but not boring. It was a very tense film with little slow areas. Overall, it's can be a bit depressing, but the thrill factor made this movie bearable to watch and it deserve the critical acclaim that it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense desperate feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the late night showing of Prisoners last night at the Alamo Drafthouse Richardson, TX. I was instantly sucked into the beautiful yet gritty cinematography and the director made me feel as if the little girls that were kidnapped were my own and that I was running out of time to find them. I love it when a director has the ability to draw in the audience in such an emotional way. Possible spoiler alert beyond this point:Prisoners is about two families with children in a nice suburban neighborhood that meet at one of their houses for a dinner party to unwind and enjoy each others company. Each family has a six year old daughter. The two young girls ask if they can go fetch something that they left at the other families house which is a couple of blocks away from the other families home, but they tell the little girls that they must have the older siblings permission and for them to accompany the small kids to the other home. The little girls don't ask the older kids to come with them and end up vanishing completely. The two families become very frantic and worried when they discovered that the little girls were playing near a really dirty, ran down looking RV from decades past. The police are notified, and then detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) accepts the case to find the missing girls. The police find the RV parked at a gas station at the edge of the woods. The police move in and arrest a very strange mentally disturbed, childlike man in his early 30's (Paul Dano). After long interrogation, the man is released and the father of the young white girl (Hugh Jackman) becomes enraged and decides to take matters of finding his daughter into his own hands. The film now becomes a desperate race against the clock to find out what has happen to the missing girls. Desperate measures are enacted and the parents of these children must decide how far they are willing to cross the line in order to find their kids. I would imaging that this film is very disturbing and frightening to parents of small children. I am not a parent, but I am an uncle of a 3 year old boy, and I would do the same thing Hugh Jackman did for sure.I would recommend this film to people that enjoy intense dramas, but spoiler alert: this film will make you crazy with emotion, and there is a lot of crying and freaking out from the parents of the little girls.I rated this film 8 of 10 because I thought the ending could have been better. The film was a perfect 10 until the last 5-10 min.I would like to note that Paul Dano who plays Alex is a very talented actor and he plays Alex so well that you forget he is an actor and not really a mentally disturbed victim/ kidnapper. This film shows how the kidnappers brainwash their victims with LSD &amp; Ketamine cocktails. (that should answer everybody's questions about how can a kidnapped person identify with their kidnappers and not run away. It's because the strip their mental image of who they are with the drugs)Lastly, I was kidnapped when I was 2 years old (1985) at Richardson Square Mall in Richardson, TX while my mother was shopping. I was later re-united with my family. So this film really hit home about what could have happen to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on a disturbing topic that can affect anyone. Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) and written by Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband), is a suspenseful thriller that leaves the viewer thinking this could happen to them. Prisoners follows two families and the kidnapping of their children. The film's dialogue develops each character differently, driving some mad while leaving others feeling helpless. As the story line develops it shows the range of everyone's emotions during this situation. Along with detective Loki, the two families must hold on to their sanity and their hope as all hope is constantly lost in the discovery of who has taken their children. Prisoners begins on an ordinary American Thanksgiving Day. Both families (The Dovers and the Birchs) celebrate Thanksgiving together, having a good time. While the parents are preparing dinner, the children go for a walk down the street, on this walk they stumble upon an old almost broken down looking RV. This creeps out the teenagers of the two families, who were accompanying the two younger children, they return home and have Thanksgiving dinner. Everything seems fine until the two little girls decide to go to the other family's house to look for a red whistle and do not return. Both families become immediately worried that their children are missing. The centre of attention is then brought to the RV and its driver, a 30 year old man with the IQ of a ten year old as the primary suspect for the kidnapping. Detective Loki takes charge and finds many potential suspects who all end up having connections. These connections bring together an unravelling ending leaving the viewer surprised, pleased, and leaving the theatre still thinking about the movie.The characters, and the actors who portrayed them, in Prisoners were a key element that really made this film work. Although there are many actors who brought this film together, there are really three who stood out. First, Kelly Dover (Hugh Jackman), a middle aged man with two kids and a wife. Kelly is prepared for what seems like everything, except for what happens on Thanksgiving Day. As the film develops we see the situation eat away at Kelly driving his sanity through a window as he believes his daughter should have been found by now. Leaving him looking more like a suspect than others.Secondly, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a never quit detective who has solved every case he has been involved in to date. Detective Loki's name and character in general come from Greek mythology where Loki is a Greek God. One of the myths associated with Loki is that he saved children after other Gods had given up, this is the basis of detective Loki's character as he doesn't give up to find the children. This no quit attitude satisfies the viewers, because we know there is hope, and that they will be found. I admired how Aaron also pays homage to this God during a scene with snakes. There is a myth that the God Loki is terrified of snakes after an event was performed by his mother as a child involving snakes. Loki's background is never truly developed, this works, as it leaves the viewers focusing on urgency of the present situation. However, there are some hints that his background involves some abuse due to the fact that he is so involved in this case. Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is the character who takes this film to the next level. Alex is portrayed as an adult with the IQ of a ten year old as he has suffered from an unexplained accident that occurred during his childhood. At the beginning of the film Alex is that character that the viewers want to hate on, we want him to be the prime suspect. He is that creepy, almost disturbing looking character. He occasionally mutters some words to Kelly like "They cried after I left them", which throws Kelly into his barbaric state, thinking Alex is the one responsible. As the film develops and we see Kelly take his anger out on Alex, we almost feel sorry for Alex as he begins to look innocent. Dano portrays his character so well that Alex ends up becoming a victim. The collaboration between the cinematographer (Roger Deakins) and the editing team was performed very well throughout out the film. The location of the scenes were pointed out very clearly as to not confuse the viewer and take them away from what they should be really focusing on. I absolutely loved the turning point in this film solely based on the editing and that its shots were action focused. The editors created this sense of urgency through quick cuts from Loki to the victim, to what Loki was driving through, and how we see the image begin to blur during Loki's point of view. Bringing a sense of realism to what the situation was evolving to. There was also some pretty neat shots were we see Loki driving like a maniac threw traffic. Even thought Prisoners follows a disturbing topic, it is a must see. From the moment we are persuaded it is Alex who is responsible for this heinous crime, to the side trail Loki finds that connects everything to the final unravelling, the viewer is kept on the edge of their seat, waiting for what is going to happen next. Every aspect of this film just clicked. This includes the amazing actors who brought their characters to life, the wonderful setting that set the tone for the film. I also really enjoyed the cinematographers' and editors' work and how they added so much suspense to the film. The audio was also a bonus that helped set the tone to this amazing film. In the end it was the screenplay written by Aaron Guzikowski that truly set this film apart from the rest.</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman gave away one of his best performances, he was so good in playing the complicated character that you sometimes hate and in other times you feel bad for. Jake Gyllenhaal also did a great job, his character is so interesting and you just want to know more about him. Paul Dano is unrecognizable and the whole cast did a brilliant job.We have seen so many abduction movies but this movie is different from them with its scary realism. The movie is very intense and some scenes can be very violent but you can't look away for one second because you know you will miss something.The cinematography and the soundtracks in this movie are wonderful and added more to the intensity of the movie.The movie is very interesting and you don't feel bored throughout the whole running time, it's a very dark movie and can be hard to watch at some points. It's thrilling and very suspenseful with a great ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A proper dark and interesting thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a disappointing summer of lame movies, the autumn looks more promising, with a bunch of great movies that haven't been as forced upon us. "Prisoners" is the best of them I've seen so far, and is in fact the best movie i've seen at the cinema in a while. Though that wouldn't be hard.With a promising cast, and controversial storyline, "Prisoners" looked great to me, and it is. The Plot is actually better than I expected. With great twists and turns throughout what is actually (as everyone says) a thought provoking story.Plus the cast do the best job possible in bringing it all to life. In Jake Gyllenhall, Terrence Howard and Paul Danos Case that won't be that much of a surprise. But the main draw of the movie is watching Hugh Jackman act his socks off as the grieving father. I always liked Hugh Jackman, so its great to see him actually act his a** off for a change and put away those shiny "Wolverine" claws of his for a while to make a proper dark and interesting thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgive Us Our Trespasses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are absolutely powerful in Director Denis Villeneuve's dark and mesmerizing "Prisoners". "Prisoners" has the look and resonance of Clint Eastwood's "Mystic River". This haunting morality play is one of best movies of the year. Jackman gives perhaps his best and most unexpected performance. Jackman's sheer ferocity in the tipping point of human conscience is amazing to behold. His bold vulnerability clutches our very soul. This is equally surprising given his signature as the Wolverine. I literally cringed as he threatens terrified Paul Dano as Alex with a steel hammer. In stark contrast there is a quiet scene as tears stream down his cheek as he stares at police photos. Gyllenhaal as Jackman's antagonist foil is an undeniable force. Much like Kevin Bacon in "Mystic River" Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki struggles between duty and the visceral justice. Villeneuve and Writer Guzikowski curiously never spell out Loki's physical glitches neither the gang banger tattoos. Have to admire them for respecting audience intelligence. Gyllenhaal's immersion is breathtaking whether he is comforting Viola Davis's Nancy about her missing daughter or smashing the head of suspect on a table. His screen partnership with Jackman is awesome, we witness amazing actors at the zenith of their prowess. Villeneuve is brilliant in restraining and balancing such intense performances without sacrificing purpose. We first hear Jackman's voice as Keller Dover reciting The Lord's Prayer on a deer hunting trip with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette, who is going to surprise many). Keller is a struggling carpenter, and closet survivalist. He is a family man and man of faith. Aaron Guzikowski's story's deceptive power lies in the normalcy of a Pennsylvania suburb. He foreshadows the tragic forfeit as the ends overcome the means. Roger Deakins's ("True Grit") cinematography is a profound character onto itself bestowing pristine clarity in this conflict of dark and gray. The Dovers' spend Thanksgiving with Frank and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The terrifying realization sets in that their youngest daughters Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) are missing. After frantic search in the rain, Police are called. A creepy suspect Alex Jones (brilliantly unnerving Paul Dano) emerges as the possible kidnapper. Alex also has the mind of a 10 year old. Alex is released without any solid evidence. However, Keller is convinced from an admission by Alex, that he knows where his daughter Anna is. He takes matters into his own, and imprisons Alex and tortures him until he tells him what he wants. Howard's Franklin is mortified by Keller's actions. Keller says, "Someone had to make him talk, or they're going to die!" Viola Davis as Nancy is rock solid in shocking advocacy. Mario Bello as Keller's wife Grace is sympathetic grace as a mother suffering the unthinkable. Melissa Leo is amazing as Holly Jones, Alex's Aunt and guardian. Her ordinary persona belies tragedy.All is not what seems. Keller and Loki have the same purpose in divergent paths, and make costly sacrifices. Villeneuve reminds that sometimes the world is ugly, and in resolution our souls are in the balance. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are awesome. The cast is amazing. "Prisoner" is not a pleasant movie to watch--not at all. "Prisoners" has profound power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>truly a great thriller; gut-wrenching movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a thriller which achieves a rare level of intensity and resonance thanks to the director's ability to invest the story with authenticity, emotion and originality. Compared with, say, 'The Silence of the Lambs' this slow-paced (a compliment, as the usual hyperactive pacing of Hollywood is almost a sickness) bleak mainstream film is hands down a better movie, making Demme's seem trivial, in hindsight. What I loved about Prisoners is the way that it was all about the story and the characters; the visual style was invisible and never imposed itself on the viewer. It was wonderfully directed in a manner that recalled classics by Nicolas Ray(They Live By Night), William Wyler(Desperate Hours), Billy Wilder(Double Indemnity) or John Ford (The Searchers). You could just walk into this terrifying film and feel the emotions portrayed flawlessly by the cast. The best example being perhaps Maria Bello who is my choice for best supporting actress this year with special mention going to Gyllenhaal whose idiosyncratic performance is at the heart of this film; his effortless charisma and skill place him among the very best, he is also a natural audience favorite capable of earning a very high level of empathy for his work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman at his finest in Villeneuve's incredibly powerful new drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Highs: After having seen the great Incendies back in 2010, I was anxious to watch Denis Villeneuve's newest film. Prisoners has that same intensity, being often brutal, touching and thrilling. The performances here are really strong but Hugh Jackman is the one who steals the show and this is the best role I've seen him in. Prisoners is not only a devastating drama, but it also works brilliantly as a crime thriller. At times, the pacing of this film and the suspenseful moments reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs. You feel completely enthralled by all the mystery that surrounds the kidnapping and it was also remarkable how Villaneuve explored the moral ambiguity that lies within the characters here.Lows: Jake Gyllenhall was truly outstanding, but his character's nervous tick was a little distracting for me on certain occasions. I know this aspect and the tattoos he has hint at a possible turbulent past though. The film is pretty depressing for the most part so it can be a tad tiresome with its great amount of extremely emotional scenes. Still, they were always compelling to watch and very realistic.Verdict: Prisoners is a fine drama / thriller and is another superb work from Villeneuve, being one of the best films of the year. I was totally invested with these characters and intrigued by the story at all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many flaws to be a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film, but noticed too many implausible situations: 1. Holly's house was searched by the police (before it was known she was the kidnapper) but it was not noticed that the photo of her missing husband showed him wearing the same pendant recently discovered on a murdered child killer. They notice these things in most TV detective shows! 2. The rescued girls did not mention the pit, but they must have been conscious there at times (or surely would have died if dropped in that distance if unconscious) and would have recounted that horrific experience. Thus the police would have gone there to search for the pit, especially when Keller was missing. 3. It seems improbable that the first rescued girl would not have mentioned that they did go into the RV and, perhaps also, that a woman was involved at some point (I am sure she would not always have been disguised enough or said so little that it was not detectable); these clues would have sent the police to Holly's/Alex's house for a very detailed search. 4. Keller went to Holly's house fully suspecting she was the kidnapper; he had a gun but chose to keep his back to Holly for an overly long period (in fact, until she had the chance to produce her own gun!). A sensible person would have gone there with his gun out (he was already in plenty of trouble over the beating of Alex so this would have been a criminal risk he was willing to take). 5. Detective Loki drove at high speed with a bullet wound to the head to get Anna to hospital asap and narrowly missed several accidents (apart from the fact he may have fallen unconscious) and may have killed Anna and himself; he could have phoned the hospital and met an ambulance part way! 6. The derelict house owned by Keller would have been mentioned to the police at an earlier stage; anyway, the impression given was that the police accepted quite readily that Alex must have run away (and also later Keller), both cases in spite of this being a kidnapping case! Little serious effort went into finding these two missing persons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thriller that will well and truly keep you thrilled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Narrative that follows the 'whodunnit' approach often relies on the climactic twist. Herein lies the craftsmanship of the filmmaker to keep you on the edge even if there is nothing but a simple conversation is going on the screen. You can feel the Hitchcockian bomb is there somewhere. David Fincher showed us how to hold the suspense throughout the film in his early works. Dennis Villeneuve here pretty much did a similarly splendid job.Two families see their worlds go upside down, when their two very young daughters go missing, presumably abducted. When the adept detective has to let the primary suspect go, due to lack of evidences, the father of one child takes it to himself to find the daughters. Sounds familiar? Yes, the premise is quite similar to that of a Mystic River or a Zodiac.But, the defining feature of this film would be that, every now and then it justifies its title and asks you question about who the real prisoner is. For it is us who put ourselves in the most impregnable prisons. As we see the father, Keller (Hugh Jackman) shredding his values one by one; the obsession, the pain are felt by the audience.Like mentioned earlier, it is one thing to build a premise that promises suspense; and, I am going a bit Jerry Seinfeld way here, it is a different thing altogether to 'hold' the suspense throughout the film. Credit goes to Aaron Guzikowski for the always-engaging and compelling script. Villeneuve hardly mismatches the pace of the story or loses the grip in the screenplay. Some might disagree, but I think the plot is divided in two sub-plots. One that follows the premise where the detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, relentlessly pursues the kidnapper. The other is where Keller is the protagonist; that always makes us wonder how far people can go for the love of family.When you get a cast like the one this film has, you get the chance to explore various ranges of emotion and actually get to build characters, which is not very regular in typical thriller films. The support cast was stellar with the likes of Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davies, the astonishingly refrained Melissa Leo and Paul Dano, who not surprisingly revels in his almost-silent, reserved character. Each one of them showing their acting prowess in turns. But, it is the leads that will sweep off your feet with their performances. Both Jackman and Gyllenhaal give knock-out performances as theirs were the more layered characters in the film.The final punch of the film comes from Johann Johannsson's haunting compositions and Roger Deakins' masterful work. Just sets up the grim mood of the film. Deakins' craftsmanship's best moment would be at the end, where he creates magic on screen with the city lights.5/5</fullReview>

Loosing your child. You will feel compassion, pain, quilt, doubt, conflict. The acting is amazing and i must admit, i had a long time to enjoy a movie purely for its acting instead of its visual effects or the complex story. The plot is simple but interesting, with a few twists that will keep you on edge until the end. Despite the length of the film, i did not get bored at any point. Both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal do a terrific job and i can not imagine anyone better for their roles. The rest of the cast is evenly good and the actor playing the prime suspect fits perfectly the part. All in all, it is a movie that will make you feel sentiments to the extreme and that is quite rare nowadays. I recommend it undoubtedly!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing descent into annihilated and compromised morality. Abounding with complex characters, and hidden plot levels. It takes the dare of repeatedly skipping forward briefly in time, making us catch up and fill in pieces, pieces that we do fill in. But the result is an acceleration of time that allows the makers to focus on the unfolding and deepening horror. It deeply explores how trauma redirects the moral compass. It's also a great murder mystery. A great detective story. It's rich and complex. Intensely emotional. In many ways almost as powerful as Silence of the Lambs, but more of an ensemble piece. We see the evil in supposed heroes and the innocence in supposed villains. We see unredeemed evil incarnate and total heroism. All in all, quite a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners (2013) will blow your mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners was absolutely one of the best films I have seen in a while. Ranging from story line to acting, you can't find a dull moment in this film to sit down and say "I'm actually not enjoying myself". This movie will keep you at the edge of your seat through it's 2-hour length and you will began to actually use your brain to follow the case along with Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) to find the two lost daughters. Going into this movie, I honestly didn't think I would like it. The previews looked suspenseful and I wanted to see a nice crime movie that I had never seen before, but once the credits started rolling I really had to sit back in my seat and think about what a mind-blowing experience it all is. This movie will keep you up at night just thinking about it, whether it gives you the creeps or a quick laugh over something that happened, this movie really impacts your life when you sit down and watch it in that dark room with your friends, family, or even by yourself. This is a dark movie, not one where you feel for the bad guy or where the good guy gets taken and you hear the life story of the villain, this movie shows just what happens out there when you have no idea what is going on. Humans will do whatever they have to just to find what has happened to whatever you are looking for (objects to people) and this movie shows just what a father would go through for his daughter. Of course, it doesn't show you how to cope with the loss of a loved one, but it does show you a lot of dad's points of view when they think about what they would go through to get their son/daughter back. Hugh Jackman shows this really well throughout the movie by showing us just how angry he can get. I would recommend this to everyone that likes the actors or likes a good story line and I hope you guys can see this first hand in the the theaters for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real rating: 7.8/10 Those who love dearly are destined to be victims of wrath, a true yet cynical thought. A decently paced thriller for its length struggles with the weird morals of its characters, or lack thereof in 80% of the cast, as well as their inability to see that they are all prisoners to their own ideals, beliefs, desires and wants. They are inhumane creatures being portrayed as humane and no better example of this is the wife character thanking god for one of the most heinous atrocities an average human could conduct. The acting, while a touch over the top in scenes, is stellar, the cinematography is excellent and the directing superb, the writing is actually the let down, though it feels like it shouldn't be and most will be able to gloss over this as we the viewer tend to accept weaker writing so long as our emotional strings are being played eloquently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As in all good mystery novels, the seemingly disconnected narrative threads are tied together beautifully in the last act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this several days ago and have been mulling over it ever since. The gist of it is that two girls are abducted, and all signs point to a mentally disabled man, Alex Jones (a spectacularly creepy Paul Dano), being the culprit. He's arrested by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but a lack of evidence swiftly finds Jones back on the street. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), the father of one of the girls, isn't convinced of Jones's innocence, and he vows to do whatever is necessary to bring the girls home. Villeneuve's thriller is anything but fast-paced (it runs for a whopping two and a half hours), but it's certainly never boring. The inflated running time allows for greater character development (specifically of Loki and Keller Dover), and invites us to dwell on the moral ambiguities of Dover's quest. Dover has good reason to suspect Jones, but he goes to extreme means to make him talk, to the extent that even his co-conspirators find themselves questioning his actions.I was immediately reminded of Taken, but whereas Taken might be the Death Wish of the child abduction genre, this is a more grounded and disturbing take on the material. There are extreme acts of violence and torture in this film, much like in Taken, but we're never invited to enjoy the spectacle, and the more horrific acts are mostly implied. At the same time we can understand why Keller does what he does (at one point his wife tearfully says, "you always made me feel so safe," the unspoken accusation being that he failed as the protector of his family), and find it difficult to condemn him. At a time when films can be so preachy concerning matters of morality, it's refreshing to see a movie that raises these questions without being so pretentious as to think there's a simple answer.While tackling such hard-hitting themes as the destruction of a man's soul and child abuse, it thankfully also functions as a riveting mystery. The contemplative pacing and the convoluted mystery (Loki pursues several leads, each of which appear to be dead ends) make this feel more novel-like (indeed, I was surprised to discover this was an original screenplay), but as in all good mystery novels the seemingly disconnected narrative threads are tied together beautifully in the last act. I only wonder if perhaps the solution to the mystery, as well as the motivation behind the abductions, is a little too far-fetched and over-the-top for its own good. In any case, it didn't massively detract from my enjoyment.I need not point out Roger Deakins's Oscar-nominated cinematography, but the cast is worth discussing. I've always liked Hugh Jackman, but I rarely like his movies, so it's a pleasure to see him in something that I feel is worth his time. He gives it his all here, and he is at turns heartrending and frightening as the tormented vigilante father. Jake Gyllenhaal is likewise quite good as Detective Loki, and he retains our sympathy even after making some incredibly boneheaded decisions. The grand prize, however, must go to Paul Dano for his seriously creepy yet understated performance. I don't want to spoil too much, but his soft-spoken, seemingly simpleminded character compares favorably with that of Richard Attenborough in 10 Rillington Place.I'll end this rambling review by noting something I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews. The final scene bears a fascinating resemblance to certain scenes from two different films by Lucio Fulci: Seven Notes in Black and City of the Living Dead. For anyone who hasn't yet watched this (which you should, immediately!), I'd rather not spoil it by describing them, but in the case of the latter film in particular it's almost uncanny. I can't help but wonder whether the writer or director follow Fulci's work. I was also frequently reminded of Duccio Tessari's superlative, heartrending thriller Death Occurred Last Night, which likewise sees a detective and an enraged, heartbroken father racing to locate the person or persons who abducted his daughter. In any case, Prisoners certainly brings plenty of its own unique qualities to the table. I wouldn't call it a classic, but it leaves a lasting impact, which is more than I can say for a lot of films I've watched recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We all are 'prisoners' in one form or another.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two incidents in this movie where people are taken as prisoners, the second resulting from the first, and that is certainly what the title refers to. But in a deeper level it plays on things inside us that we become prisoners of. It could be fear, or the need for revenge, or just how we look at others in the world. It is a deep and involving movie, but some parts are hard to watch.It starts with a typical suburban family walking a few houses down the street to visit another family. After a while the two small girls ask permission to go back and get something, but they don't return. Then a frantic search fails to find them.About the same time the teenagers had noticed an old RV parked on the street nearby, and now it was gone. Everyone suspected the person in the RV had taken the girls, so they search for him.Hugh Jackman is Keller Dover and Terrence Howard is the neighbor Franklin Birch. The two girls taken are their young daughters, and the two of them get involved in the search, at times a bit violently. The mothers are Viola Davis as Nancy Birch and Maria Bello as Grace Dover.The main investigator is Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He goes about systematically doing his job, but is badgered by Keller who thinks he should crack down on the RV driver.Paul Dano is good as the RV driver, Alex Jones.SPOILERS: When Alex is found at a rest stop, for some reason he panics and crashes into some trees and is caught. But questioning him turns up nothing and he is released. Keller doesn't take this well, convinced that Alex is guilty he abducts him and imprisons him in a dilapidated building Keller owns. He tortures him in an attempt to get him to reveal the location of the two girls. In the end they are found held captive by a woman who over the years had taken and eventually killed a number of children. As the movie ends Keller is seen in the building where Alex is still being held, but the cops arrive and we sense Keller will have to answer for his lawlessness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea not quite carried through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the film on a long haul flight which is not the best environment to watch a film. Prisoners follows the investigation into the disappearance of a pair of young girls Anna and Joy from outside their homes. The main focus of the film is the father of Anna, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) who is not happy with the urgency of the police investigation being led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal).The premise of the film is quite interesting as the parents are obviously desperate to find the children as quickly as possible. They see the police investigation to be very slow and find it extremely frustrating. I couldn't help but think the film could have been better. The film feels like it's been edited to suit the mass market whereas it should have stuck to it's indie roots. That may be the problem with getting big name stars as the money that is handed out to the cast needs to be recouped via the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great director's English-language debut spoiled by too-clever-by-half (and then some) screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read that French Canadian art-house phenom Denis Villeneuve was directing an English-language thriller about a distraught father searching for his missing child, it seemed like the perfect project for him. His prizewinning "Incendies" is a brilliant film that deals with the most basic human emotions in a powerful and affecting way. This one, unfortunately, is not. "Prisoners" is a long movie with an increasingly complex storyline, but there's not much characterizing going on?we learn that the distraught father (Hugh Jackman) is a gun-toting, prayer-mumbling, Star-Spangled-Banner-in-the-shower-singing hothead and that his adversary, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), is an all-about-the-job guy who eats Thanksgiving dinner alone in a Chinese restaurant. That's about it. The suspense implicit in the basic setup?two little girls go missing from a quiet suburban street; vigilante dad runs amok?starts to wear off with about an hour to go. Then screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski heads off on an ingenious but time-wasting tangent, seemingly dragging in some leftover occultist bushwa from "True Detective," and the whole movie pretty much goes to hell in a basket full of snakes? I assume the filmmakers wanted to leave us thinking about the larger implications?is torture justified to save a child's life? Maybe even, do gun-toting, prayer-mumbling, patriotic family values necessarily end up at Guantánamo or Abu Ghraib? Instead I was left wondering whether the last few puzzle pieces would have be to hammered into place. Talking of which?be aware that there are a couple of very violent scenes; my wife bailed after Jackman's character threatens to tune up a suspect with a clawhammer. Fine performances, great cinematography. Netflix subscribers: If you don't mind subtitles and what the cable channels call "adult themes," send for the Blu-ray of "Incendies."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no denying that Prisoners is gritty, intense, well acted and well directed, but the holes in the script are difficult to ignore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is just an ordinary family man who is devoted to his wife and young children. Dover's daughter Anna Dover and her friend Zoe Birch are abducted and Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to the case. Loki arrests Alex Jones based on the fact that his RV was parked near to the Dover's house shortly before the abduction. Loki holds Jones for 24 hours whilst he tries to gather evidence against him, but when he is unable to get any further information from Jones (due to him being unable to answer questions as he has the IQ of a 10 year old) and due to a lack of evidence, Loki is forced to release him. However, when Jones tells Dover (with reference to the 2 girls) that 'he heard them crying when he left them', Dover is convinced that Loki has made a mistake in releasing Jones and takes it upon himself to kidnap Jones and use his own 'methods' to find out what has happened to his daughter. Meanwhile, Loki continues with his investigations.Prisoners is a gritty, intense and emotional ride with a top notch performance from Jackman (I honestly don't think I've seen a better performance from him). His performance of a 'desperate' father who will do anything to try and find his daughter was brilliant and the fact that he was so convincing in his role helped to give the film lots of credibility. Dano was also brilliant as the rather simple Alex Jones (I thought he was really good in There Will Be Blood, but he was excellent here). The film also features Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) as the other kidnapped girl's parents. They were both good, but weren't given much to do. Prisoners isn't exactly original and we have seen many examples of films where 1 man feels as though 'justice' hasn't been served and decides to serve out his own form of justice, but I don't generally complain about a film being unoriginal as long as it is well executed and that's where the strengths lie in Prisoners. This film gets the basics right; the audience care for Dover and his plight and it's certainly very emotional and was tense and engaging from start to finish, but there were problems with the script; Firstly, there is a scene where another potential suspect is arrested and brought into a police station and when Loki gets heavy when investigating him he pulls a gun out and shoots himself. OK, how did he manage to get a gun in a police station (after being arrested) without anybody knowing? Why was he not searched when he was arrested and then again when he was brought into the police station? I can suspend disbelief for certain things, but there is no way that this would happen. Secondly, we learn that Alex Jones's aunt Holly Jones was the person responsible for the abduction of the girls. The scene that follows shows her pointing a gun at Dover and asking him to put his phone into the disposer. Dover appears to do this, but then picks his phone back up. Alex's aunt forces him into a hole where she had kept the girls hostage and puts a board across it, drives her car onto the board and leaves him for dead. What I couldn't understand is that if Dover had his phone, why didn't he use it? Perhaps he couldn't get a signal, or maybe his battery died. Who knows? This is never clarified.The open ended "conclusion" will undoubtedly divide audiences. Personally, I hate films that end like that as to me it's just lazy writing. I was disappointed that I sat watching a film for 2 and a half hours and then to find that it didn't really have an ending. Some people may like the idea that they're left to draw their own conclusions, but not me as I think it's a cop out and a very weak way to end a film.Overall, this film gets a lot more right than it gets wrong. The grittiness, emotion and tension that exists throughout the film makes this film a MUST watch. Jackman and Dano should be singled out for particular praise. What ultimately let the film down was the holes in the script and the rather lame ending. It's a very good film, but not quite as good as I was hoping it would be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit of trimming and we would have a masterpiece!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>153 minutes just seemed a little too long right from the offset and I was not mistaken. Don't get me wrong, this movie is not boring or dragging like stereotype long movies that we all are too painfully aware of. It is engaging and even nail biting at times. But, if the editors had trimmed a few rough edges, we would have been looking at a real gem.A the performances in this movie are power packed. Hugh Jackman in his determined, hell bent role of a father looking his lost daughter portrays the pain and the loss that a family will face at such trying times. His emotions and the actions he performs, even though it seemed a little over the top at times, was really well brought forth. Jack Gyllehaal in his eccentric detective who is married to his job cliché also produces a performance of note although at times it just felt a little forced than natural. The rest of the cast played around well to the central characters, although in essence had so little to do, to produce a good ensemble performance.Bottom line, a good movie which had all the potential of being a really fantastic and brilliant one but fell short due to (in my opinion) a screenplay that could have been helped if it was tad bit faster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema with absolutely no expectations about this movie and luckily, I found it to be quite entertaining. The basic plot (I'm not spoiling don't worry) involves two couples whose children get kidnapped. The performances are quite good and even more, the characters are quite empathetic (especially Jackman since you can feel his frustration and anger rising throughout the movie, Gyllenhaal does a good job as well). I wouldn't say it should have been an Oscar candidate but it's still an entertaining movie to rent or even to go to the cinema like I did. In general lines, it's an entertaining well-paced movie with a more than decent script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the trailer on "Prisoners", I was convinced it was gonna be big fat cliché and dud, but while it does have some of the storyline and suspense we're used to and maybe even clichéd, I surprisingly enjoyed the movie thanks to some excellent performances especially by Hugh Jackman and Melissa Leo, and some slick cinematography and editing. The director, Dennis Villeneuve has put together a serviceable story with infused emotions and great settings. The closest movie I can think of that has a kindred spirit to this is "Winters Bone". Both rely heavily on hostile and dark woodsy settings. The mystery comes together fair enough, but the actors take this movie up to a solid 7/10. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew so little about this film before I watched it, I really thought at first it would be a Prison film! The title is a metaphor.Prisoners has shades of Mystic River. It starts during the holidays in a small working town community where two young girls disappear believed to be abducted or worse.A suspect is found and later released by the police. One of the parent abducts and systematically tortures him. Meanwhile the detective assigned to the case methodically works the case and realises that this case may have links to the past.The film is long, harrowing in places and builds a lot of tension but keeps you glued to the screen, that is no mean feat.It may have flaws with some convenient coincidences as well as some red herrings to keep you off track.Hugh Jackman is the father who takes the law into his own hands, aided by a more reluctant Terrence Howard who is the father of the other child that has been abducted. Jackman is the religious, hard working every-man whose raw anger threatens to tip him over the edge.Jake Gyllenhaal stands out with his tattoos as the methodical Detective Loki, more smarter than he looks.Roger Deakins's moody cinematography adds a lot of atmosphere to this film which is very well acted by its ensemble cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Totally Convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overrated, this has Big-Name Stars and a Newcomer Director (made a splash with some Indie Film with an Oscar Nomination), and a Great Cinematographer. It is a Longish Crime-Investigation Thriller set in the Rurals of Pennsylvania where Two Children go Missing.There are more Passed Over Plot Points Dangling than strung up Bucks at a Hunting Cabin on Opening Day. Things come and Things go at Regular Intervals as the Movie Plays Out, and it is all to make it seem like this is an Intelligent, Disturbing, Pedophiliac Picture about an already Borderline Disturbed Dad to Snap and take Revenge.But a whole lot of it seems Forced and Throws in a Greatly Amount of Backwoods, Small Town, Religious Fervor and Soul Searching, but Never is Totally Convincing on any of it. Our "Hero", the Dad who Snaps is a Survivalist and it may be an Indication that this Contractor has a Few Screws Loose because in His Basement there are Stacks and Stacks of Crisco. Assuming the Product didn't Underwrite some of the Movie there can be No Other Explanation for this Bizarre Behavior. Water, Batteries, Can Goods, and lots of Crisco. Prayer and a whole lot of Lard will Help one Survive the Apocalypse.That is the kind of Ill-Fitting Logic that abounds in this Not Awful Movie and if Lengthy Stories that go Everywhere and Nowhere, that Lead to an Ending with more Holes than a Back Road Sign and a Pennsylvania Highway, then Go for it. Just Remember to put on that Orange Vest so You won't be Mistaken for a Movie Goer in Search of Something that makes More Sense.</fullReview>

Not to say it isn't a good film, it is, but it flattered to be a great one, and so left me feeling that someone somewhere missed a trick. The cast and their acting is excellent. Every single character works, with the exception of one and I'll get to that in a moment.The opening scenes are nicely done, have you believing in the moment up until things start to go wrong, and that next scene, where the panic spreads is really well done too.Throughout, some good acting, good moments, interesting and challenging relationships. It just needs the story to be slightly smarter. The problem...one of the characters looks and feels out of place. And midway through I suddenly realised as I'm sure many did, it was that character that was ultimately going to be behind everything. In trying to hide it through twists and turns, it almost highlights it. Really enjoyed the tense drama and the characters, but ultimately when you realise you know how it's going to play out, it's too long and just too predictable...but only just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't normally write reviews, but this time I have to do it. The movie deserves a solid 9/10 , but because of the ending, I "took" off 2 stars. I mean really? The ending is not COOL, is frustrating, is not something which let's you think about it, how it might ends and such. No, it just "tells" you that there is a happy ending, but without showing it, which from my point of view and with this kind of a story, a somehow NORMAL ending would have been amazing.An ending which should have let you think about it, was an ending without the last whistle or an ending where the cop was staring at the car, like a thinker with that nice soundtrack on the background. That would have been a far better ending and NOT this ending where somehow it tells you "hey , oh, you are there, nice, let me just...." and then the director says "CUT! Good job everyone" .Anyway, up until the ending, the movie is very strong with some minor "lefts out" here and there. Worth seeing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautifully filmed, appropriately atmospheric, impeccably acted by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and others... I enjoyed the first two hours of this movie immensely. But then... towards the end, my wife and I both coincidentally realized: 1) This was a very long movie, and some scenes didn't need to be there, while, 2) the movie skipped past some things it could have explored a bit more 3) I felt the ending left us hanging. It was a bit like a recent Steven King novel... enjoyable as hell but then the loose ends just sort of flop away at the end and leave it to you to work out in your own head. The moral of this story is very unclear. Yet... paradoxically... that's also what I like about this movie. It makes me think about justice, and what can happen when we take it into our own hands. Things that seem so clear can be so murky. The major twist at the end of this movie could have been handled better (the connection between the missing boy and the presumed kidnapper of the girls)- it was almost an afterthought. My other complaint was the bizarre way the movie DROPPED the scene where Gyllenhaal discovers Jackman torturing the boy... WHY was this scene CUT, then Jackman is free, but then... arggg. Just a frustrating ending. I half respect that, but half of me feels it was manipulative and poorly handled. This is a hard movie to review. I'm left with a movie I can recommend, but one that is almost as frustrating as it is engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captivating but maybe TOO much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strangely disturbing, plot twisting, chilling film with a religious/moral subtext, PRISONERS from director Denis Villeneuve, deals with the kidnapping of two young friends whose families are celebrating Thanksgiving together. How the authorities and their parents respond to this horrific event is at the core of this film exploring the biblical phrase "an eye for an eye", the nature of sin, and its roots in life's tragic adversities. What lengths can one go in the pursuit of justice without the malignancy of hate corrupting our very being?Passages from the bible are invoked in the first scene where we come upon a vulnerable deer silently moving through the wet, beautifully lit trees - and then the camera focuses on the barrel of a rifle and BANG ? this innocent creature falls to its knees. The tone and mood of PRISONERS is thus established and reiterated by a voice-over verse from the bible. Father and son are the hunters and Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover the tightly wound "survivalist" parent, gives an intense if not frenetic performance of a man who will stop at nothing to keep his family safe even if it means seeking vigilante justice. His wife Grace (Maria Bello,) seems to need sheltering, as she conveys a somnambulistic helplessness in the face of this tragedy.In contrast the other couple, whose child is also missing, despair and grieve deeply, but keep their moral center intact - or at least attempt to. Terrence Howard as Franklin Birch is an actor whose portrayal of an anguished father is more emotive in his understated, quiet, velvety manner than his histrionic bullying male counterpart. Viola Davis as his wife, Nancy Birch, is the voice of quiet reason, but she too is compromised by the need to seek retribution for the disappearance of her adored daughter. The unknowable can be a force for ethical transgression when one is confronted by drastic circumstances.Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, is the embodiment of the legal system - a twitching (is this part of his character or the actor's own affliction?) officer of the law with a 100% clearance rate on his arrest record; so we the spectators put our faith in him to unravel the many clues and suspects that arise, creating a deep climate of suspense. Gyllenhaal's characterization, though adequate, was not "inspired" which could be due to the many plot zigzags as well as contortions of basic legal procedures that were distracting, and took me out of the small- town Pennsylvania environment back into my own dubious head.Paul Dano plays the prime culprit, Alex Jones ? a young man with disabilities who is both sympathetic and repellent and living with his "aunt" the wonderful actress Melissa Leo. He is mentally "a child" and one that becomes the symbol of an infantile captive who is the victim of perverted rage and vengeance. Yet we are left hanging as new stratagems keep turning up leaving the audience exhausted.PRISONERS not only refers to those who are physically held hostage, jailed, or restricted against their will, but those who are moving about freely yet are psychologically subjugated by fanatical demons that erupt when the stress of an event collides with their inherent emotional being. Despite the beauty of the cinematography that delicately defined the melancholy spirit of this brokenhearted world, the movie could not overcome the tendency to engorge itself in melodramatic horror, and that is its fatal flaw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a great plot and it is filled with many layers. However, I feel like it took too long to get to the ending it was leading up to. It got repetitive and long. With everything going on so slowly, it gave the movie a fantastic sense of dread that made us relate to the parents. However, it also gave me time to think and I was able to figure out the ending twist halfway through the movie. Another thing that bothered me was the red herring that appeared halfway through. It was obvious and should have been cut down for time.Although I have my gripes, I overall enjoyed this movie. The acting was superb. Everyone did a fantastic job, but Paul Dano and Hugh Jackman stole the whole thing. They gave Oscar-worthy performances. I also give credit to DP Roger Deakins for the amazing visuals. The highlight of his work was during the rush to the hospital near the end. Simply phenomenal. I wasn't just at the edge of my seat; I was out of it, my eyes glued to the screen and fists clenched. It was so suspenseful and it was solely because of the cinematography. I also loved the plot of the movie, but I just feel like it dragged out. It would have been an excellent 2 hour movie instead of 2 and 1/2 hours.I enjoyed this movie and I'd recommend this movie. However, I would not want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last 10 or 15 minutes. When I sat down to watch Prisoners last night I wasn't expecting too much. I just wanted to see a well acted and directed thriller and for 2 hours and 15 minutes that's what I got. In fact and despite how it ended I thought this was easily the best performance of both Hugh Jackman's and Jake Gyllenhaal's careers. Sadly though once what had happened to the kidnapped daughters is revealed the movie started falling apart for me. I was as surprised as anyone to find out that Holly was involved in the kidnappings but she went from concerned aunt to a super-villain in one unearned scene and then after years and years of apparently being so careful she became sloppy for no real reason. I also think the last scene was a complete cop out. This may not be popular to say but after the horrible things Keller did he deserved to die in that hole and the fact that the film ended without us finding out if Loki found him was a cheap way to have a twist ending IMO. Part of me thinks the original script had him left there but someone from the studio didn't want them imply that Keller died so we got this open ended nonsense. I know it seems like I'm just bashing the movie but like I wrote earlier I think for the most part it's a pretty great movie. The ending just felt cheap for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting, but misdirection of clues is the reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The daughters of the Dovers and the Birches go missing after a Thanksgiving Day Dinner. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) fears the police have to release Alex (Paul Dano) for lack of evidence but something Alex said to Keller leads Keller to believe Alex knows about the abduction and may have had a hand in it. He is livid. The Police are not convinced. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) vows to find the girls.Loki? That name reminds me of the Norse God, Loki. Why use that name in here; and while we are at it the name Keller Dover doesn't exactly roll off the lips. Okay, it's out of my system. This is a good movie and it's 2 ? hours long. Why so long? You will discover why when you are finished with the movie and you look back and then understand that many of the clues were a misdirection and had nothing to do with solving the case. Of course, there are good clues too, but you will decide which ones were good or bad after you walk away from this. I cannot tell you which ones were entirely used to confuse the audience. That would be telling. But, in the meantime, you are riveted to your seat because you also are trying to figure out who kidnapped the girls and where they are either dead or alive. There is some torture in here when Keller Dover kidnaps Alex because Keller is convinced Alex knows all. Keller Dover is driven and this comes out easily by Jackman as he is good at this. Detective Loki - that name again ? (thought it was out of your system) goes about his business in a methodical/logical way tracking down clues as they arise. We keep waiting for that look Gyllenhaal gives when he puts a puzzle together. You know that look: his eyes widen really wide. We wait, and wait, and wait. The supporting cast of Viola Davis as Nancy Birch, Terrance Howard as Franklin Berch, Maria Bello as Grace Dover do credible jobs. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give outstanding performances. That's to be expected. Kudos. A shout-out must go to the make-up person who worked on Paul Dano as Alex showing the results of torture. Really scary. We cringed and felt the pain just looking at him. Good job. Again, this is still a good movie and you are ready to give it an "A" rating until you realize you were also kidnapped and held prisoner for 2 ? hours all because of a magician's - now a director's - trick of misdirection. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Torture: Yes. Language: Yes, at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many Loopholes but Awesome Actings &amp; Cinematography</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this movie and then gone through the reviews-section (because I wanted to write one, (that would be my first one as well)), I was utterly convinced with whatever "law-turley" (An IMDb User) wrote, and I entirely borrowed the contents from him/her. Here is how, slightly modified review goes from my side: The first 30 minutes or so of the movie were really promising. I liked the set-up of the 2 cozy families in their suburban idyll sharing a thanksgiving meal and discovering, to their horror, their kids had somehow gone missing. That part felt very real, very "based on a true story". As the film went on though, the clunky writing and flabby storytelling started to show its effects.#1. My first big problem came with the utterly implausible discovery of the body in the pedophile priest's basement. First of all, Gyllenhaal's decision to move the freezer based on the flex being dangerously stretched, just seemed...dumb. Why would he care if the guy stretches his flex? It didn't seem from his reaction ("drunks!") that he thought the freezer was hiding something, and yet he opts to shove the big heavy thing closer to the socket because presumably it bothers him. Then - whoa - there's a door there, and whoa it's a big cellar (which is not that weird really), and now - whoa - look a body! #2. And next came a great big WHY? He's a pedophile catholic priest so why was he SO outraged that a man might kill kids. He abuses children but is still so horrified by a killer that he opts to kill the guy who's (again...utterly improbably) has come to him for confession, but not so horrified that he tells ANYONE the guy's story? Or attempts to find out if it's true before he offs him? Instead he just stuffs the body in the basement and drinks a lot. Hmm!!! #3. My next problem was the biggest and clumsiest of the plot points. Gyllenhaal finds a body and hears a weird-ass tale about child murders (and presumably there's a not a lot of those locally), but despite his incredible intellect and ability to make connections, he doesn't spot the REALLY ODD MAZE NECKLACE on the body until the drawing falls conveniently from his desk alongside it, and make the connection between the two.#4. Why is escaped and presumably traumatized kidnap victim Bob stealing children's clothes, covering them in pig's blood and putting them in boxes full of snakes? It would make sense if he was somehow part of the cover-up, or working for Alex's aunt, but he's not. So for some reason known only to himself he's stealing clothes and making it seem like Anna and Joy are dead when they're not. Presumably because he's traumatized. Or just mental. But either way, it's not really explained, it's just a great big red herring that confuses everything.#5. What is the significance of Keller's dad's suicide? Because if there is no significance, why show Loki reading about it as if it's important? Presumably (again) it's so he can find out that the building that Keller's going to is where his dad died - but so what? Why is it important, other than to cloud the waters and confuse the audience even more. Was Keller connected to his father's suicide, why was no note found...all questions we have no need to ask.#6. WTF is this all maze rubbish? Right from the poster we're led to expect some kind of maze to appear. The serial killer wears a necklace with a maze on it, Alex says "they're in the maze", Bob is obsessed with drawing mazes, so where's the freaking maze man? When Holly gets Keller to back the car up we think "FINALLY! HERE'S THE MAZE!!! But there's no maze down there, just a big deep hole full of old sneakers and dead snakes. No maze, not even a sniff of one. The only maze-related thing as it turns out, is a puzzle book that Leo forces the kids to do while they're kidnapped, presumably traumatizing them with their inability to solve simple puzzles. It might just as well have been Sudoku really, but that might have looked weird on a necklace...#7. And finally, the pointless sub-plot. Just WHAT is the purpose and meaning behind Keller's kidnap and torture of Alex? It has no real purpose other than to provide a weirdly amoral counterpoint to the other story (which would have been so much better emphasized if we'd seen anything of the girls' captivity), and leaves us confused and kind of weirdly angry with the guy. Alex is an innocent child and Keller has tortured him almost to death, so what does that make him? A villain? An anti-hero? A misguided vigilante? No-one seems to care if we know, so we end up drawing no conclusion at all and Keller ends up as a shapeless figure that we ultimately care little about.#8. Despite all aforementioned loop-holes, The END comes abrupt and it starts reeling credits all of a sudden. This point was the obvious limit of tolerance to leave the audience bewildered.Ultimately my feeling was that this could have been a "good" film, if only someone had applied due experience and a keen eye had been brought in to work on the script and iron out the many (mentioned) flaws. The cinematography and the score was great, and it's a testament to the director and actors (TRULY, I give them credit) that the movie was still highly watchable despite the glaring plot holes and confusing storytelling, but on the whole it was a disappointing and lacking experience and not one I'd highly recommend...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't been a Jackman fan before, I think this is the one to change that. Terence Howard and Jake Gyllenhaal also bring some stunning performances to the film. After seeing the trailer for this I thought this is a sure winner. They could have done a little more with the 'wife' characters but the men do hold it down. This one has you from start to finish forcing you to examine your own views and the lengths that you would go to placed in that situation. The entire movie has no sunshine. It's cold, wet and miserable. I think that's just to give the characters a little more texture though. Go see it if you want an edge of your seat thriller on a Sunday afternoon. Avoid it if you're not a fan of heavy, emotional movies that make you want hot chocolate and a puppy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally I am not particularly fond of these type of movies, as they tend to be fairly much alike. And yeah, "Prisoners" do have a lot in common with many others in this particular missing people genre, but still it is an enjoyable movie that is entertaining.What makes the movie enjoyable was the amazing performances and great actors and actresses in the movie. Especially Hugh Jackman, I must admit that this is without a doubt his best performance in a movie so far that I have seen. He really gets to show so many aspects of his talent in this movie, proving that he is much more than just an action actor.The storyline in "Prisoners" is captivating and interesting, and director Denis Villeneuve manages to keep the audience at the edge of their seats all throughout the entire movie. This is indeed a very emotional roller-coaster, because the characters are so realistic and you quickly bond with them and get to be in their situation. And of course, the amazing portrayal of the characters by the actors and actresses really helped this along quite nicely.There were a couple of plot twists here and there, enough to keep the storyline interesting and pushing the movie in a new direction once in a while. However, the ending to the movie was a bit, well, let's just say that it could have been better.Despite being a rather long movie, then the time passes quickly because the movie is interesting and nicely paced. So the 153 minutes come and go quite fast."Prisoners" is overall an enjoyable and watchable movie. However, it is not the type of movie that you watch more than once, because the story doesn't have a sound enough foundation to support multiple viewings.For fans of Hugh Jackman everywhere, because he really carries the movie quite well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners will captivate you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a tense mystery-thriller that will spin you through fits of fear, repulsion, anger, and relief. We highly recommend it based on its overall enjoyability as a movie that provides expected chills along with personal moral questions when you put yourself into the hero's shoes. The beginning of the movie has a palpable sense that something bad is about to happen. It's a similar feeling that you get at the beginning of many horror movies where the characters are introduced as carefree friends through the use of pointless, mundane chatter and laughter. But once the girls disappear, it's on! Any of you who are parents, as we are, can instantly relate to that lightning strike of fear that shoots through you when you realize you don't know where you kid is. That tenseness remains with you through most of the movie as they try to unravel the circumstances around the disappearance. Jake Gyllenhaal does an adequate job as the plodding yet persistent investigator, Detective Loki. The audience will be put into a balancing act of rooting for Loki to find the abductor, and hating Loki for not laying down the law while we sympathize with the victim's father Keller Dover, played convincingly by Hugh Jackman. It's really the character of Dover that will have the audience gut-wrenched as they try to decide if they would take the law into their own hands as Dover does when, as often happens, the law lets the accused out of jail. While Loki partially redeems himself by finally getting tough with the suspects and finding his way to the abductor, he still loses points for allowing one suspect to commit suicide before he can get an answer out of him and allowing Dover to beat him to the crime scene. The Dover character lets us down by torturing the wrong suspect and by letting himself be captured at the end. So, neither main character fully rewards the audience. But the biggest letdown was the revelation of the old church lady that broke bad and started killing kids after losing her own son many years prior. It was an, "Uh, really?" moment for the audience. But despite these few flaws, the movie manages to hold the audience captive and deliver the punches expected of a knockout thriller. See it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I didn't like this movie as a 9 or a 10, is because I felt like the story writers gave the audience what they wanted, rather than what the story wanted. It is as great as people say it is, but the standard Hollywood wrap up of a story is what you see at the end. Don't get me wrong, it was unique, and the ending was unique, you wouldn't guess it. But that really wasn't what would make the movie good. Sometimes a more dismal ending, is actually what would make the story memorable and cool, in some strange way. You will notice this if you watch this movie, you can tell that the writers actively steered the story toward a Hollywood wrap up, rather than where the story was taking the viewer, if u catch my drift.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Law &amp; Order Plot With Interesting Ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to love this movie. I was a huge fan of the director's previous film Incendies, but this one is just a B grade thriller that is elevated by masterful cinematography, excellent direction, and some truly great acting by the entire cast. This movies is filled with interesting ideas that have to brushed aside in service of a plot which would not be out of place in your average Law &amp; Order episode. The film has a strange religious subtext that is both underdeveloped and overwrought. I could see half of the plot twists coming and in the third act the film basically became a Law &amp; Order episode with an overly simple resolution and "ambiguous" ending. The real problem here is the script. It does have some interesting ideas like the quirks of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters, but these and others have almost no development beyond the one or two scenes that feature them. If the director had been allowed to rewrite the script the film would have been a lot better and likely have the same impact as the director's previous film. That being said the film is still a well-acted, well- filmed, and intermittently well-written thriller that is extremely emotionally effective and occasionally disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Good as I Hoped, but Still Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a simple enough film to follow. When two little girls go missing and are believed to have been kidnapped, one of their father's -- portrayed by a gruff Hugh Jackman -- takes the law into his own hands, torturing the prime suspect when the police can't charge him with anything. This is a film that asks many moral questions, most notably -- What would you do if this happened to you? While I'd like to think most fathers wouldn't go to the extremes Jackman's character does, I don't know if I'd blame someone either for doing what he does in this film. I think that's why so many in the cast seem to relate to this material, and it shows in their performances, which are all strong, in particular a near mute Paul Dano as the prime suspect with a shattered psyche. Ultimately, though, while Prisoners offers some rich, complex characters, the lack of any levity, as well as the more, "been there, done that," procedural elements of the story, really make this a long watch. We can see much of what Prisoners has to offer, in particular the detective aspects of hunting down the kidnapper, by staying at home and watching an episode of Law &amp; Order in one-third of the time. Perhaps the film would have been stronger had it focused entirely on Jackman torturing Dano's character? Sure, there would have never been any levity in that scenario either, but at least it would have made for a more tight and concise story that would have been different and justified why this had to be a film and not just an episode of a TV show.I give Prisoners an 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Denis Villeneuve sustains the tension for two-and-a-half nerve- racking hours. The music and the murky cinematography give this film a moody atmosphere that reminded me of THE GIFT (2000), the Southern Gothic melodrama starring Cate Blanchett and Keanu Reeves. All the cast of PRISONERS bring credibility to a storyline that has a few probability-stretching elements - a a slightly daft resolution - but the film belongs to Hugh Jackman: you feel all the pent-up rage of a man who will go to any lengths, cross any moral boundary, to try and bring his daughter home. With the Madeleine McCann abduction back in the news, PRISONERS has a special resonance for UK audiences, but this is the nightmare that every parent dreads waking up to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The central theme of Aaron Guzikowski's script is retribution, in particular the irony of the way ordinary people are blinded by rage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best aspect of Denis Villeneuve's film Prisoners are the two lead performances by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Both give raw and aggressive powerhouse performances and add dramatic weight to a conventionally structured but extremely gritty 'who done it?' thriller. Jackman plays Keller, a religious and intense family man, who takes matters into his own hands when he and his neighbours Franklin (Terrence Howard) and his wife Nancy (Viola Davis) have their daughters kidnapped. Keller believes that Alex (Paul Dano), an intellectually challenged and rarely spoken individual who lives with his aunt Holly (Melissa Leo), has taken the two little girls and follows him. It is doesn't help that Alex feeds him lines of information that only fuel Jackman's rage and suspicion.The central theme of Aaron Guzikowski's script is retribution, in particular the irony of the way ordinary people are blinded by rage and in times of grief become as immoral as the initial perpetrators. Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is pressed with a near irresolvable duality: he has to prove to himself that he can solve this case, he's apparently never failed to solve one before, but also has to watch Keller closely because of his increasingly irrational and violent behaviour. He's solving one case and then preparing for another one to unfold before it even happens. Gyllenhaal makes for an incredibly resilient and determined cop, skilfully layering his character with different sides to his personality, including intimidation tactics against suspects, to care and sincerity when he promises Keller's wife Grace (Maria Bello) that he'll find their daughter. The intensity and power in this performance is so strong that it overcomes the disappointment of the non-backstory of the character. Hugh Jackman has played aggressive characters before, mainly Wolverine, but unlike his X-Men role his character doesn't have the same nobility. Keller is a vigilante and a drunk and more of a psycho than a samurai. The amount of dramatic fury and verbal rage in this performance is startling and seemingly difficult to rein in at times. Taking action into his own hands, he resorts to kidnapping and torture for answers that may not even exist. The film opens with the Our Father prayer, which gains meaning because in the scenes of torture Keller's anger prevents him from forgiving 'those who trespass against us'. In an unrelentingly grim film, sometimes heavy-handed in its mood and tone, the torture scenes verge on being over the top. These are truly horrific, ugly moments, so disturbing that they're almost unwatchable in their violent confrontations. Inevitably, the extremity of Keller's actions diminishes a lot of our sympathy for his character and the case. Arguably, the torture scenes are not included just for pure sadism. As well as retribution Villenuve is concerned with the way that people are entrapped by their perceptions of the truth and how much faith they have in their own beliefs. Reflecting this notion is the beautiful, largely static camera-work by cinematographer Roger Deakins (superb work again after True Grit), who frames the interiors of this rather muted and drab setting in a way that it makes the characters appear like prisoners of their own personal values and motives. The editing is also patient, providing time for the actors to inhabit their characters in medium close-up shots. It's a shame though that some of the side actors like Maria Bello and Viola Davis have very few scenes written where they can truly utilise their talents. There is still great suspense built through the film though and its most effective, not when it's violent, but when it forges a sense of unseen, foreboding danger preparing to intrude on the characters. The narrative of Prisoners is structured like a police procedural and it's extremely complex when accounting for a number of subplots that feed into the main crime. The film is very long, running at two and a half hours, and some of the more ambiguous aspects of the plot feel hurried, including a book with a maze that involves a copycat suspect. A second viewing might tie a lot of these elements together more neatly. Given the unpleasantness of this film, I'm not sure it's something I have any desire to see again. Despite the convoluted threads and the film's substantial efforts to blur the lines of morality, there are still very conventional mystery beats followed here, meaning you will be waiting right till the end for any revelations and for the police to notice that one key clue. Although I had trouble connecting all the dots of the plot, the very end is thankfully an excellent final scene. It echoes the film's central concept: we are all eventually captives of our actions and the systems of law emplaced by society or the people who think they know better.</fullReview>

Seriously if you walk out of that movie without feeling deeply disturbed...then you probably had your eyes closed most of the time. It was very long, but it will hold your attention. The storyline has many varying layers, but most of them are not resolved by the end of the movie, so it keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat even after the credits.

An almost unrecognizable Melissa Leo plays the aunt of one of the kidnappers, who, it turns out, is also a sicko. Even though this is supposed to come as no surprise, I didn't see it coming.

He is ably supported by Maria Bello (as his wife and doting mom of their kids) and Terrence Howard (the neighbor whose family gets into the same situation as Jackman's).The supporting cast includes the fine performance of Paul Dano (as Alex Jones) as a person with a low IQ who happens to be a suspect in this case. The detective as portrayed by Jack Gyllenhall has delivered a gritty and subdued performance in his pursuit to solve the case. Cinematography by Roger Deakins captures the chilly mood of the location as the essence of the characters. The 'suspense' part of the movie is fairly guessable for the average movie goer. Director Denis Villenuve has managed to present the story in a fair, just manner capturing the emotions of its lead characters as the story &amp;/ situations in it unfolds.I will rate this movie 7 out of 10.

		<shortDescription>Sparse, Intoxicating Odyssey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within the first half of PRISONERS it's obvious the title fits just about every character, and not all in the literal sense?Hugh Jackman's Keller Dover is an extreme, narrow-minded carpenter, father of a son and daughter: the latter abducted (along with her friend) in mysterious circumstances, throwing several people into emotional and mental chaos...Emotional for the Dover family and mental for the officer in charge of the case, a tattooed, rapidly blinking Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki, who spends more time following Keller ? who has his mind made up ? than the few possible leads.All the characters are flawed, troubled. This makes Loki's treadmill journey more interesting within the film's contained, claustrophobic atmosphere forcing our withered hero to feel as captivated, or rather, captured as Paul Dano's Alex Jones, a simple-minded young man that Keller holds hostage, resulting in bouts of grueling torture to get answers for his daughter's vanishing.While there are an abundance of red-herrings to distract Loki (and the audience) from the real culprit, prolonging a two-and-a-half hour melodrama that could have fit in a more fashionable two, and many of the side-characters eventually become peripheral and insignificant, the intensely sparse performances of Jackman and Gyllenhaal exceed the villain- revealing/monologue-spouting climax, resulting in yet another (semi) ambiguous ending: only this time it doesn't seem artsy or pretentious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filled with a barrage of visual symbolism and plenty of poetic justice (especially during the final shot) "Prisoners" would have undoubtedly made a better novel than movie. That said, it wasn't the surprisingly superb and layered Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) script that I had a problem with (well, there was one scene concerning a certain character walking his dog that was a little too absurd, but?) it's the surprisingly average direction from Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) which had me proclaiming: "If only this had been directed by the Cohen Brothers!" Synopsis: On an aggressively rainy night, six-year-old Anna Dover and her friend Joy go missing; presumably abducted. After this initial event, "Prisoners" forks off into two separate yet competing (and many times, interacting) story lines. In one, Jackman's character, Keller Dover (father of Anna) seeks vengeance on who he suspects to be the abductor, a mentally challenged man named Alex, who looks like the portrait of a child molester, and played by Paul Dano, in a role which seemed to be tailor-made for him (I don't know if that's a good or bad thing). The second storyline sees the tattooed Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as the lead investigator on the case, attempting to find the missing girls before it's too late.The Acting: While I was more than a little disappointed that Dano's character was all but completely forgotten about during the second half of this movie, the star studded cast, which consists of Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, the aforementioned Jackman (who is just "all right" here. I mean, he has one scene where he goes all Wolverine on someone, but?) and Dano all come through with decent to noteworthy performances. But the real star of the show is Gyllenhaal, who unquestionably has played some troubled and complex characters in his career and Detective Loki may be the most intriguing of them all. And it doesn't hurt that he gives an Oscar nomination worthy performance (oddly the only one in this movie).Final Thought: For 3/4th of this film, "Prisoners" is nothing less than a "worth the price of admission" thriller, entirely motivated by characters who are all interacting along the blurred lines of good and evil, in a story which basically depicts the age old outline of the Devil and God waging war over the souls of the innocent; in the same vein as 1995's "Se7en". However, the final 40 minutes is where "Prisoners" did lose me a little, as it meanders, taking twists and semi-confusing turns that may cause some viewers to check their watches rather than stay glued to their seats. That doesn't mean "Prisoners" isn't one worth checking out (just don't see it at AMC Mercado) as it is a film which will stay with you for hours after you've left the theater (in a good way) as it continuously begs the question: what lengths would you go to see that your child is safe?

		<fullReview>'Prisoners' is a thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve which tells the story about the disappearance of Anna Dover, a six-years-old girl from Pennsylvania. Anna's father, a middle-aged man interpreted by Hugh Jackman, will do anything to find her. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki and Paul Dano as the first suspect of the case. The plot focuses on the conflict between a desperated father and a slow investigation by detective Loki, in Anna Dover's missing case. While the father believes Paul Dano is the kidnapper, the police can't prosecute him because they do not have enough evidence.The film is intriguing due to an original screenplay that makes you suspect about every character. The actors, especially Hugh Jackman, give moving and believable performances, and the directing is excellent as well as its photography. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt best movie from 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me Prisoners was the best movie I saw in 2013. And to give you an example I watch about two movies per day. I just watched it a second time and even though I remembered everything from the first time I saw it I still love it. The first time I saw it was of course the best because during the entire movie you are kept in suspense and you try to figure out who is the bad guy and what really happened. It has been a long time that a movie didn't get my full attention from he first second til the last second. To me Prisoners is underrated and has his spot among classics like Seven and Silence Of The Lambs. The acting is outstanding in Prisoners. You can feel the desperation dripping of Hugh Jackman. The detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal is also a delight to watch. In fact the whole cast did an outstanding job. I don't know many of my friends that heard or saw Prisnores while everybody knows the other classics I mentioned so I could only vividly recommend you watch Prisoners. During the entire movie there is a dark gloomy ambiance that works really well. If you like mysteries and suspense you will love this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The detective was irrelevant to the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: - Huge gave a huge performance - Almost all the characters were believable. - Not a horrible story. - The kept the "annoying females crying/screeming but doing nothing about the situation" to a minimum. Cons: - The detective guy (Gyllen Haal) was absolutely irrelevant to the plot. He could have been absent and the film would have been the same. Just send one of the cops(anyone) to that woman to let her know that her nephew was found. That random person could have shot that woman and saved the day. Other than this one random fluke, the guy had no contribution towards solving the case. This fluke could have been attributed to damn near about anyone who was sent to give her the news about her nephew. - The father (Huge) does all the detective works in the movie. Which makes you wonder why the actual detective was being presented as some genius Sherlock Holmes in the beginning of the film. Yeah, they were bragging about how he solved every damn case he came across. Ironically, this movie is about the one where he didn't contribute at all. - The detective seemed totally indifferent to the father's reaction after showing him the images of his daughter's blood soaked socks. He wasn't even trying to show that he was sorry through body language/facial expression.It is actually the story about the negligence of the police in that town. If you think about it, you'll realise that if the cops only did their job, they'd be the one discovering what the father discovered. But heck! They had other things to do such as reading up old newspaper about the father(Huge)'s dad and following the father around. They invested time and resources into everything but solving the actual crime. I mean, really? They actually believed that someone with an IQ of 10 roams around with a caravan and could take dogs out for walks at night? This forces me to conclude that the story was about police failures, not psycho killers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, intense and disturbing movie, but unclarified events made the story confusing and less strong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the movie was slow paced, the great acting and the horrifying story made this movie a very intense and quite disturbing experience. However, at the end of the movie I felt that I wasn't satisfied with the way that things were explained. Some clues were given that did not contribute or even contradicted some characters:!!-- Spoilers from this point on--!!1. When Alex walked the dog, he tortured it for a few seconds. I think this was done to give the audience a negative perception of Alex which would give Keller reason to torture him. I think this does not really beat with the plot in which Alex appeared to be innocent and if you interpret the sentence: "They only cried when I left them", you might even conclude that Alex was of a comfort to the kidnapped girls. (Might be a wrong interpretation on my side). 2. I think it is not properly explained why Alex couldn't tell who the real bad guy was. 3. Joy says that Keller used duct tape on her mouth, but it wasn't explained why she thought that and it made me believe that Keller was schizophrenic and involved in the crime. These (and a couple more) events might have made the story more confusing than it needed to be. More details on the things that happened to Alex/the kidnapped girls could have cleared this confusion (or I am missing things). Also I think that there was quite a lot of coincidence and too little detective work involved in solving the mystery.In the end I think it still is a good movie depicting the moral dilemma of Keller very intensely.Not taking this in account in my review, but I found the movie so intense, dark and disturbing that I wished it to end and I wasn't entertained that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tense, atmospheric thriller with top notch performances, fantastic cinematography, and amazing direction, yet suffers from a few plot holes and a long run time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely have I ever been so captivated while watching a movie. Prisoners is a very tense drama thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the run time. The film has a gradual rising tension throughout which leads perfectly into the climax. There are more than a few jaw-dropping scenes to be had here, some of which are difficult to watch. The film is raw, brutal, and unforgiving.The performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are stellar. Hugh Jackman gives what is probably the best performance of his entire career, playing a father who is driven to the edge of insanity as he searches for his missing daughter.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a very stoic detective, obsessed with solving the puzzling case of two missing girls. Prisoners is very thought-provoking, and asks the question, "What lengths would you go to to protect a loved one?" Roger Deakins' cinematography is gorgeous. He captures the bleak, dreary tone that the director was clearly going for. From the grey, icy cold exteriors to the dimly lit interiors, the film looks nothing short of amazing.The film does, however, have a few plot holes and script problems that I won't get into due to spoilers. It also overstays its welcome by about 25 minutes, resulting in slow pacing in a few parts and a somewhat uneven feeling throughout. However, these are minor flaws in an otherwise great film.8/10</fullReview>

Director Dennis Villeneuve probably takes a leaf from Vorbrydelsen/The Murder, and creates a tense, bleak atmosphere, where it always rains and things look glum. Bit like Manchester to be honest. The cast is very good and the plot keeps you guessing to the end, keeping the suspense high. Reminds a bit of a not-much-seen Paul Walker film called Nowhere to Run in places, and in other places Silence of the Lambs. It is better than both though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. Where to begin? Let's start with that this is one exciting kidnapping/detective movie, thats for sure. From the beginning to the end this was very interesting to watch. Not much boring situations or pointless filming. The atmosphere is nice, kind of dark, calm, but still dense and threatening. It's quite unique. Not too much actors or subplots.7 is still the highest rate I can give. There's still too many problems in the movie. The whole kidnapping thing does not make sense. And the movie leave behind couple questions. First: What the heck was the point of that other suspect, who committed suicide? And what about his mazes? Other irksome thing was the ending. What about the Dover? You just can't end the movie like that. It makes the whole movie pointless. And very sad. It's just wrong that father does everything to save her daughter, and eventually girl survives, but he still never see her again. This really wasn't truly happy ending. Although it's good that there are movies which doesn't have cliché ending. Still, it's quite sad.However, like I said, the movie itself was enjoyable to watch. Good acting and atmosphere. Interesting and deep. I really recommend to watch if you like detective stories.(PS. When I first saw the detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) I was wondering through the movie, where I have seen him before... Those corners of the mouth was so recognizable. And yes, he does EXCELLENT job in this movie! Very good actor. I couldn't remember it until now I watched the filmography after the movie. And yeah, it's known from the catastrophe movie, The Day After Tomorrow (Sam Hall), which is also great movie.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners has story and performance that are great just by themselves, though, together they are what makes the film a true gem of cinema. The premise is legitimately terrifying in its presentation. The weight, severity, and tension of the film feel so real that, at times, it does what every film should do; make its fiction appear as reality to you.Though Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in this, I do feel that Hugh Jackman steals most, if not all, the attention with his performance. He's a really good in most of his other work, poor in some (more than likely bad story/bad direction), but it is in Prisoners he shows how much can come from his acting. I would equate it to the passion seen in his role as Jean Val Jean in Les Miserables. Perhaps that's what it is. He can be good with subtlety, however, it is in the passion of emotion that he does best. As Keller Dover he is nothing but passionate, yet, he is very real. He bursts out in anger in one scene, is told to calm, does so, and even apologizes for his outburst yet still persists with a degree of intensity that is clearly from being upset rather than just raw anger. There are many more scenes like this that succeed so well at removing you from just watching a movie and takes you on intimate experience of story telling that feels undeniably and hauntingly real. This is probably one of his best performances if not the principal one.Few could get away with doing a film like this and call it good. Fewer doing so in exemplary fashion. This is one of the fewer. It's honestly very good actors with a very good director showing you human character in a narrative that is by no means an easy one to tell.</fullReview>

Indeed, it's a quite disturbing story (kidnapping and lots of torture). You will not sit during this movie and wander off...no, each character delivers a great performance, and there are so many twists in "Prisoners", which is one of the things that makes it so good. The viewer can really feel what Keller Dover (Jackman) is feeling when he loses his daughter, and what difficulty he's going through not knowing who took her, and whether shes alive or not.

The story leaves us clue by clue to the answer that keeps us watching. Suspenseful and unpredictable.The movie starts out with two girls form two different families kidnapped by an unknown kidnapper which is believed to be Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Hugh Jackman, who is the father of one of the two girls is convinced that Alex is responsible and knows where they are. Meanwhile detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is head of the investigation is searching for the girls and the true kidnapper.Honestly this movie was quite terrifying for me to watch. One because of the torture that is in this movie and we never really know who is the kidnapper. This movie also connects very well with real life. I mean seriously, what would you do if someone kidnapped your child? Ultimately it is a brilliant movie, if you can take the suspense and the torture then this movie is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may sound obvious or trite, but it truly is a parent's worst nightmare: Your child just disappears, suddenly and without a trace. That's the scenario in the crime drama/thriller "Prisoners" (R, 2:33).When the young daughters of two neighbors go out to play after their families share Thanksgiving dinner together and then no one can find the girls, the panic is immediate and gut-wrenching. The helplessness of these two sets of parents (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as Franklin and Nancy Birch) is compounded when the police release a person of interest named Alex Jones (played brilliantly by Paul Dano) for lack of evidence. Despite the fact that Alex has the mental capacity of a 10-year-old, Keller is convinced that Alex knows something. He takes matters into his own hands and goes much farther than even the most devoted of parents could imagine. Keller is willing to do anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to extract the information he needs to find these two little girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is doing what he can to solve the case, and even seems willing to go a little outside the law to do it, but keeps coming up empty.The tension gradually but steadily builds as these parents know that time is running out for their missing children. Clues in the case are scant and hints as to where this story is going are there on the screen, but seem too trivial to matter ? until they do. The plot twists and ultimate reveals are shocking, but the film's real power is in the questions it forces us to ask ? and keep asking after the film is over. The script is smart enough to provide us sufficient closure to justify the emotional investment we've made in this story, but still leaves it open-ended enough to give us something to think about after the credits roll. The unusually long run time may make you feel like a prisoner, but the complex, well-directed and very well-acted story (mostly) justifies the film's length. "B+"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What such an impressive and emotional movie. Everything in the film is completely outstanding. We can start with the casting of actors in which the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is marvelous and finishing with an extraordinary Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, father of one of the kidnapped girls. I feel that I'm in debt with this character because it is one of the best acting I've ever seen on the big screen. His desperation for finding his daughter is so real that you will feel the tension during the whole film. According to what I've read Hugh Jackman even spent several nights without sleeping in order to make that impression during the shooting of the film. On the other hand, the plot cannot be more interesting and intriguing so you will see yourself trying to figure out who is the responsible of the disappearance of the little girls. Despite kidnapping of kids in Hollywood movies are pretty common, the production and direction of Prisoners is completely different. I don't usually give points easily on this website but I will do an exception with this one because I ended up totally impressed and open-mouthed. I gave nine points without any kind of hesitation. I'm looking forward to watching the next part of Prisoners because the ending of the film lead to believe that there will be a second part. I strongly recommend you to watch it. It deserves every minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim and dark, but fascinating piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brilliant talents of Hugh Jackman, Terrence Howard, and Jake Gyllenhaal come together in this bleak and emotionally complex thriller by French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. Jackman plays Keller Dover, husband of Grace Dover (played by Maria Bello) and father of a teenage son Ralph (played by Dylan Minnette) and a six- year-old Anna. On a rainy Thanksgiving evening, Keller's friends Franklin (played by Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (played by Viola Davis) come over over dinner and bring their daughter Joy to play with Anna. The two children go outside to play. Before the families know it, the two little girls end up missing. With Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) assigned to search for the missing girls, a mucky, mentally-impaired man named Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano) is found in the RV that the girls were climbing earlier during evening and is arrested. However, due to the lack of evidence, the police are left with no choice but to let him go. Keller decides to take matters into his own hands and find the girls himself.This film pulls no punches while presenting the audience with its grim atmosphere and moral ambiguity, and this is all thanks to its compelling script, powerhouse performances and a solid direction. The film is filled with plenty of twists and turns throughout the story and characters who face some thought-provoking changes. Hugh Jackman's character, desperate to find this daughter, begins blurring the lines between right and wrong as he goes out in search for the two missing girls. This is greatly demonstrated when he ties up Alex Jones and viciously tortures him, demanding him to confess to the girls' abduction. Watching this, the audience is left questioning his choices and whether he or not he is becoming a villain. These scenes never answer the question but rather let the viewers decide for themselves. The plentiful amount of suspense is also the big icing on the cake and the film does not hold back on this, with many scenes that leave you at the edge of your seat. While the violent content is enough to turn some viewers (especially the most sensitive ones) off, it decently enhances the dark tone and suspense in a way where it doesn't feel gratuitous and out of place.Prisoners is one of most brilliantly made thrillers in recent years and one of the best films with Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Terrence Howard. And this all thanks to its incredible script, performances, direction, and cinematography. Look for a good thriller? This one would be decent pick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>there are some things in this review you could see as spoilers."Prisoners" is about Dover Keller. A caring and loving father with a daughter and a son. The movie starts of with Kellers family and Franklins having a thanksgiving celebration. This beginning gives a light tone to the movie. But it also gives you a warm feeling. Keller then tells his daughter and the daughter of Franklin that they should go and play in the basement. Hereafter the camera focuses on a tree while zooming in on it and there is scary movie on the background. (I know it sounds stupid but it is beautifully shot) After this scene you know that there is something wrong. And there is, both girls have disappeared. They have been kidnapped. Keller has to be one himself to find the girls, but that doesn't come with no trouble...The directing of the movie is just amazing, every shot was beautiful. The director (Denis Villeneuve) chose nice angles to shoot from and I also like that he used almost no hand held camera's. The realistic feel to the movie was also a fun feature. An example is the torture scene. This is a very thrilling scene, and this is due to the realistic tune. Like the make-up on the beaten face, and the blood on the knuckles of Keller. Very much enjoyed that the movie kept you on the edge of your seat during the entire movie. The cinematography of the movie was also amazing. The cinematographer was Roger Deakings. But I didn't really like the ending. It was an open ending and I never really like those. Nolan does these things normally too in his movies, but I don't mind it in his because the story has ended. In this movie you still are wondering how it goes on and you don't have that with Nolans movies. But "prisoners" was still goodThe acting in "Prisoners" was just flawless. Hugh Jackman as Dover Keller was very convincing as a loving dad. When he beats Alex Jones you can see the hate in his eyes, but there is also regret. This a way better performance by Jackman than in Wolverine. His character is very well written and due this you can also see how determined he is to find the two little girls. Jake Gyllenhaal was just amazing as a cop. But this wasn't really a surprise. You can see that he really wants to find the two girls but is hold back by the rules. This is something Keller doesn't seem to follow... Paul Dano as Alex was just the perfect casting choice. I just adored his character. He was the best written and developed character of the entire movie it was also brilliant acted. Even the child actors were good. Dylan Minnette as the son of Dover was really good. I very much liked the scene in the beginning of the movie where he and Eliza are talking about hunting, it was a very well written scene just like the entire movie. Terrance Howerd gave a very good performance. And Maria Bello was also very good as a worried and desperate mother. The script of the movie is just brilliantly written. And the last person I am going to talk about is Melissa Leo. She was just so good. She played an innocent women who is the mother of Alex.But now something more about the ending. I know that I have said that I didn't really like I, But the is just the final minutes. Because the last 30 minutes were very thrilling and exciting. I very much enjoyed the twist in the end. They made you think throughout the movie that Alex did it or Bob, but it turns out to be someone else. I really didn't see that twist coming.But overall this is an amazing movie and I am really surprised that it didn't get any Oscars. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.</fullReview>

There will be a few spoilers in this review, so if you haven't seen the film, you may want to.PRISONERS just blew me away with it's story. Aaron Guzikowski wrote a screenplay that is just really amazing with great dialogue and a great plot in this film. The story focuses on the abduction of two young girls in Pennsylvania and the police's subsequent search. Keller Dover and his wife Grace attends a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch and both families' younger daughters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch goes missing. Detective David Loki arrests and questions the driver of a suspicious vehicle, Alex Jones and Dover attacks Jones after he is released.Loki is doing different cases, but Dover decides to take matters into his own hands and tortures Alex Jones for answers, but he denies that he is Alex Jones and claims that he escaped from a maze. Dover visits Jones' aunt, Holly and she tells that she and her husband were religious until their son died of cancer. Joy Birch is found drugged but alive. Dover visits her in the hospital and Joy tells him "You were there".Loki searches for Dover and discovers Jones. Dover goes to the Jones' house to get information, but Holly pulls a gun out on him. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and drinks some kind of poisoning, but I'll get to that in a minute. She explains that her and her late husband abducted many children as part of their "war on God" after their son died. She shoots him in the leg and forces him to get inside a concealed pit and imprisons him in the pit, where he finds a whistle belonging to his daughter.Anna is found with Holly, but Anna is taken to the hospital and Holly is killed. Outside the Jones' house, Loki hears Dover's labored whistling from the pit that he is imprisoned in.I thought the pacing and dialogue was a little confusing, but also really amazing throughout the movie and that is an incredible but hard and challenging thing to pull off, but a lot of movies has done this really great.***SPOILER ALERT!*** Like I said in the plot, Dover is imprisoned by Holly and this was the main issue I had with the film. Because for two reasons: ? 1. She imprisons him in a concealed pit, makes him drink some kind of poison. I don't know what it is, but it's all black. She makes him put handcuffs on his hands and shoots him in the leg, forcing him to get inside the pit. I think this could have been done better with music in the scene at least.? 2. The ending was a little confusing and I only watched this movie once, but I think the end is there just to set up a sequel.The acting is just amazing. Hugh Jackman deserves a lot of credit for his performance as Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki wonderfully. Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Maria Bello are all great in this film. Paul Dano plays Alex Jones and he is great in the part that he had to play and he was an amazing casting choice for the film.The only performance that I had trouble with was Academy Award winner Melissa Leo's character, Holly Jones. She had to wear make-up for the part, but she is just scary as heck in the part that she plays and what she did to Hugh Jackman's character did not seemed like a very good idea at all.This is the reason why this film appeared on my Top 10 Overrated Movies list is because of the ending, which I just mentioned. This movie really deserved the Oscar for Best Cinematography and Best Picture, but the Academy only chooses great movies.PRISONERS is a great film, and I will forever be angry that this did not win an Academy Award, but Frozen wins two Oscars? That is just crazy! This film was originally rated NC-17 for "substantial disturbing violent content and explicit images", but was re-edited to secure the R rating for "disturbing violent content include torture and language throughout". I am so glad that this got the R rating because I would not have been able to watch this film if it was NC-17.The music is just amazing. The cinematography, editing, production and costume designs are just amazing.Overall, I love PRISONERS. Even though the ending got on my nerves a little bit, I still love what this movie does and what it shows. This is one crime - drama / mystery - suspense thriller that I don't think gets enough credit.My rating is going to be the rating of 10 out of 10. It's a perfect movie and you should see it. Sure, it is graphic, disturbing, emotional and violent in some areas, but if you can look past some of that, you may be able to find one great drama that will satisfy you.PRISONERS is a great film that will blow you away and the performances of Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Melissa Leo, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and Paul Dano in this film will certainly blow you away from beginning to end and you will not be able to take your eyes off your television screen from start to finish once this movie begins and once it ends after 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners (2013): Dir: Denis Villeneuve / Cast: Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard, Paul Dano, Maria Bello: Riveting and powerful film where the title can reference the two abducted young girls, or the family struggling with dealing with their loss, or a police inspector struggling to do the right thing yet frustrated with the responsibility, or the suspect placed under illegal observation. Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard play two fathers who get together with their wives but their youngest girls go missing. A suspect is brought in but he has the mentality of a ten year old. When the suspect is released Jackman abducts him and locks him in an abandon building where he brutally tortures him for the whereabouts of the girls. Director Denis Villeneuve previously made the underrated Maelstrom and here treads delicately with the idea of a possible innocent person being tortured as guilty. There is several effective plot turns that provides tension as well as aim the viewer's expectations in other directions. Jackman delivers one of his greatest performances as a father struggling with his faith as well as his role of father. Howard plays the best friend who struggles to fathom his friend's illegal choice of justice. Jake Gyllenhaal is great as a cop dealing with possible failure and dealing with the emotional elements of the job. Paul Dano steals scenes as the target suspect unresponsive to the brutality. Maria Bello plays Jackman's wife whose hopes are drifting into despair and his absence doesn't help. Strong theme of family, fatherhood and trying maintain your faith in the face of God. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow burn thrillers are a dying breed. Most modern suspense films go in for gruesome and violent stories of murder to send chills down spines of the audience. A lot of this pictures offer mysteries that are not too difficult to decipher. So it is a great pleasure to discover that there filmmakers out there adventurous enough to craft a dark, intriguing dialogue driven motion picture that keeps the audience guessing for most its runtime. That director Denis Villeneuve does so with panache and some wonderfully orchestrated darkness is what elevates the material beyond escapist territory. The story is set in a Philadelphia suburb where two families the Dovers; Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace (Maria Bello) and the Birches, Franklin (Terence Howard) and Nancy (Viola Davis) are celebrating Thanksgiving together. The parents are enjoying themselves indoors while the two young girls decide to go out and play. After a certain amount of time, the parents realise that the two have not returned. After some frantic reconnoitering it is decided that the police need to be called in and the case is assigned to Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). A few preliminary investigations lead him to a suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but subsequent interrogations reveal that he lacks the intellect and the malevolence that is expected from one who has committed such a crime. He is eventually released much to the chagrin of Keller who is convinced that Jones is involved in the girls' disappearance. Filled with righteous indignation he decides that he will take matters into his own hands. While an engaging whodunit is all that is expected from a picture like this one, it is quite amazing to see how Prisoners not only aspires to be something more than just a by-the-numbers thriller. The original script by Aaron Guzikowski is an intelligent creation with some really astute observations about human nature. Difficult themes like anger, redemption, guilt, punishment and even religion find a home in this dark and at times depressing story. The film's rather chunky 153 minute runtime and the slow, deliberate pace which the story progresses gives the characters and their emotions a lot of breathing space. Though there were occasions when I found myself questioning the persistence of the director in allowing certain scenes to carry on even when their purpose in the narrative has been realised. To be fair these moments are few and far between which is why they tend to stick out. It is not possible to fully discuss the emotional weight of the story without divulging the specifics of the plot but suffice to say that the script is never guilty of feeding the audience any answers and the resolution is satisfying and I personally could not guess it beforehand. The excellent direction allows the story to be engaging at all times. The cautious building up of suspense, the natural dialogue, and the nuanced presentation are top notch and there are times when I could detect echoes of David Fincher's modern classic Zodiac (2007) that are only amplified by the involvement of Jake Gyllenhaal. That is not to say Prisoners takes cues visual cues from Zodiac. It is its own beast, but is in several ways a spiritual companion of that picture. Prisoners would not have been anywhere close to being as effective, if it wasn't for the stellar cinematography of Roger Deakins. Deakins has long been acknowledged as one of the leading exponents of his craft and here his lens work enriches (if not outright create) the creepy atmosphere that film exudes. The way the camera pans and zooms; it could be argued that Deakins' camera is a character in itself. The music in contrast comes across as merely adequate, but is never overbearing and does not take the viewer out of the moment. The emotional crux is purely dependent on the performances and in that department there is nary a complaint I can make. Five members of the main cast have Academy Award nominations and everyone plays their respective roles with great conviction. Jake Gyllenhaal has built up an impressive resume over the years and this movie adds another feather to his cap. His detective Loki is reserved yet determined and the actor brings the right amount of dedication to his role. Though, he does tend to overplay one conspicuous tick that the character displays. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the indignant, conflicted father who is willing to do whatever it takes to find his daughter is a highlight of the film. Long has the actor been under the shadow of his famous Superhero avatar. Liberated from formula he displays his talent with incredible force. Terence Howard, Viola Davis and Mario Bello do not have roles that are as hefty but they provide solid support. Paul Dano brings a lot vulnerability to Alex and his mannerisms and dialogue delivery make his mental defects seem believable. A quiet dialogue driven piece such as this one has the potential of falling into indulgence. But, prisoners never falls prey to that. There are times when the script slows down the proceedings but it is only to allow the audience a better view of the characters and their lives. Nevertheless, there is a significant of portion of the mainstream audience that may find this a little too dark and languid. But, for those who are patient enough to follow the director to the places he takes us in this picture the rewards are delectable, providing a cinematic experience that is rich, multi-layered and most of very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have no doubt that you'll leave this movie shaken for at least a couple of days, and I won't be surprised if 'Prisoners' were to be recognized come Oscar season.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve (director of the Oscar-nominated 'Incendies') has given us one hell of a terrifying and highly suspenseful ride with his first major Hollywood film, 'Prisoners'. The movie has an amazing cast and an excellent script.It seems like almost every week, we hear a news story about a child in our neighborhood, town or city that has gone missing. The reactions and damage this causes the families feel all too real and scary in the film, which features violence and suspense that never let up.The movie begins with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) teaching his son how to kill a deer for sport and food. It's an interesting and haunting scene. Next, Keller and his family head over to the home of their neighbors (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving dinner. While the mothers prepare the food, the husbands talk about work and sports, the older teenagers watch TV, and the two young daughters of the families play around the house.As the Thanksgiving afternoon goes on, the two girls venture outside to play, but they never come back. The older kids noticed a creepy old mobile home parked out front during the day, and now everyone panics for the worst. The police are called, and Det. Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes the lead in the case. The cops soon find the mobile home a few miles away and arrest the owner, Alex Jones (Paul Dano). However, Alex has the intellect of a ten-year-old, and is released a couple days later due to lack of evidence, even though he whispers incriminating evidence about the two missing girls directly to Keller.Keller observes Alex's weird behavior and is convinced that he's responsible for the abduction. Since the police aren't doing anything about him, Keller takes matters into his own hands by kidnapping Alex and torturing him to get answers. Meanwhile, Loki pursues other leads to find the missing girls, including Alex's aunt (Melissa Leo) and a strange man obsessed with mazes.'Prisoners' is as scary and suspenseful as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' put together. The film draws amazing performances from Gyllenhaal and Jackman. Both men show just how far they will go for their families and jobs, even if it makes them the bad guys. Dano is terrific playing an innocent yet highly creepy guy. You never know what he has up his sleeve.Villeneuve's direction is beautiful and haunting as he takes us through the gritty and grimy underbelly of two seemingly normal families during the worst part of their lives. I have no doubt that you'll leave this movie shaken for at least a couple of days, and I won't be surprised if 'Prisoners' were to be recognized come Oscar season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From start to finish the movie Prisoners excels in every direction. Directed by Denis Villeneuve this movie is a thrilling ride from the get go. Basically without getting to detailed into the story, the movie evolves around Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) who's daughter goes missing at the start of the film, along with Franklin Birch's (Terrence Howard) daughter as well. This leads Detective Loki (Jake Gylenhall) on the case to look for them.This isn't just your simple person goes missing film, this is a well detailed movie, the cinematography is just beautiful and the musical score is amazing to say the least, it does a great sense of showing great emotion to a lot of the film. Although having the film at 154 minutes long you will be to hooked into the story to worry about that. The movie does a great job of showing the true emotion, the film creates a dreary state with the snow and heavy rain to leave a haunting approach. Onto the acting in my opinion I was disappointed that both Jackman and Gylenhall didn't get nominated for Oscars as they were fantastic in there roles, all the acting is outstanding as well so you'll see some great performance from side characters such as (Paul Dano, Melissa Leo and Terrence Howard).Overall Prisoners is a thrilling ride from start to finish with twists and turns and brilliant story telling to keep you entertained for the entirety of 154 minutes, you will be on the edge of your seat as well. A MUST WATCH!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sombre and eerie masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very sombre and eerie story, the music, dark locations, run-down houses and wounded characters left me with a feeling of foreboding. The apparent kidnapping of two children immediately thrusts two families into a crisis in the middle of their Thanksgiving get-together. The rest of the movie deals with the fallout for families, police, neighbours, suspects, etc. and the suspense is tight enough to grip the audience until the end. The leading characters are played by Hugh Jackman, as Keller Dover, the father of one of the children, and Jake Gyllenhall, as Detective Logi, the man assigned to the case. Dover is a man of strength and ferocity who sees his purpose in life to defend and protect his wife and family from harm. When this particular crisis hits, his one objective is to rescue his daughter unharmed and nothing will stop him, even taking the law into his own hands. This leads to a some horrific scenes with the immediate suspect, a young man with a limited intelligence played by Paul Dano and his mother played by Melissa Leo. Maria Bello plays Dover's wife with Terrence Howard and Viola Davis as the parents of the second child. The detective uses every resource available to try to locate the children. Detective Loki is a low-key but determined police officer who cannot keep Keller Dover from flying into a continuous rage over the time it takes to find the kidnap victims. The final scene and ambiguous ending left a bit of a question mark. The strange sequence of events is a dark look at how people react to one horrific event but it contains elements of heroism. Denis Villeneuve has directed what I consider a brilliant movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wants you to ask yourself a question. And the movie is so cleverly constructed and well acted, that you may not be able to answer that question to yourself even partially ever. And then you understand. For those who say that this movie is unnecessarily violent, it would not have worked otherwise; an after-school special wouldn't have galvanized the viewer before the end comes the way this movie needed to. First-rate. I'm having to write more because I don't have the minimum text for a review. OK. Things that look like they might be plot holes actually aren't, if you think about the actual resources authorities would likely have available to them.

		<shortDescription>A Well Rounded Emotional Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a Thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve which is centered around the kidnapping of two daughters and how the families cope with this tragedy. The movie is both a drama which explores the evolution of various characters throughout the course of the film and how certain events affect their reasoning and decision making, where as on another hand the film is a crime, detective-like one with Jake Gyllenhaal's character of Detective Loki.The film it self is shot beautifully and the cinematography and editing really allows for it to capture a gloomy vibe, this is also because of the films filming in the fall which adds to the feeling of the film. The film has many great actors with stellar performances which seem believable. The film is generally a crime mystery which the audience begins to unravel as the movie goes on through various hints incorporated in the film. The film also has a strong moral message in regards to the characters and their choices. The film overall is a dark grim tale of not only the mystery of two lost girls but a drama regarding its affect on the family dynamic.8/10 Good film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am completely and utterly deprived and lost for words! I don't know whether to suggest you stay clear of this film and avoid at all cost, or whether to recommend it. Prisoners has really almost redefined the Thriller genre and in a sense, set the bar so high for upcoming Thrillers, its gonna take a master piece to get your heart racing even half as fast as this one does. "The Equalizer" doesn't even come close to equalizing with this high ranker.Serving suggestion: use the bathroom before viewing and put your mobile on silent or better yet, completely off. This one requires no less than your full attention. And no matter how hard you try, there is absolutely no way you can predict how this film ends. I'll tell you this much though, the closing scene will blow you away! Either in a positive or negative way, but blow you away it shall - no doubt. By the time the end credits rolled, we were rendered frozen and speechless for a good 3 minutes before we all one by one got up and went our separate ways, still void of speech and comment.Flaws? Absolutely none, whatsoever. One thing I do know, is that this could easily be Hugh Jackman at his best. His performance was astoundingly brilliant!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tagline: 'A hidden truth. A desperate search. Every moment matters!" This is an outstanding crime thriller, chilling and terrifying in parts; and one of the best I've seen in recent memory. Denis Villeneuve, who performs masterfully behind the camera, delivers his best film to date...2 1/2 hours long, it is so well paced you will likely not notice the passage of time. Two families are enjoying Thanksgiving dinner, when their two young daughters are abducted and everything spirals from there toward what I thought was a surprising climax. Hugh Jackman delivers an electrifying performance as a deeply religious and protective father, who becomes frantic and brutal in his pursuit of and questioning of the prime suspect in the abductions. Also look for superb performances from Maria Bello, as his wife; Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, as the other couple whose child is abducted; Paul Dano, as the prime suspect; and Melissa Leo as the suspect's adoptive mother. But the nod for best performance should go to Jake Gyllenhaal, as the detective investigating the two abductions...it is in my opinion his best among many excellent roles. This is a film for mature audiences only...the violence is brutal and the profanity is pervasive. But if you're mature enough to handle those caveats, and you like crime thrillers, you don't want to miss this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense Abduction Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family? Canadian director Denis Villeneuve had been making films for years, but probably achieved his biggest success with "Incendies" (2010), getting recognized by the Academy for a foreign film. This was his followup, a much more commercial venture, and probably even more widely seen. Somehow, despite the great performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Jackman, the only nomination it got was for Roger Deakins' cinematography (which is a given -- as of 2015, he has had 12 nominations).Christopher Orr wrote, "Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore." He does raise a good point, however, about the thin line. The violence is intense, and understandably earned the film an NC-17. But is it justified to show this level of violence in order to explain the characters? Perhaps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is though, suspenseful, raw and unbelievably real. It creeps up on you, slowly, like the speed of the film, it also moves slowly almost to calm you down and keep you relaxed yet very aware of what is going on and look closely at the events unfolding before you. The film is almost two and a half hour long, but in my mind it never seemed that way, it didn't get boring or trivial, it kept the suspense all the way through.If you have kids (I do), this is kind of the worst thing that could happen, what would you do, how would you react. The people in the film is just as different as you and me, they react differently, they get frustrated, they lunch out and to sum it up they do what they think is the right thing to do at the time, they do what they feel they have to do to get back what is taken from them.This is powerful acting, very believable and real, the characters and how they react, the way they go up and down, high on emotions, fueled by rage and frustrations. The choices they make and the solutions they choose individually affects the dynamic of their bonds, both family and friendship bonds a tried and tried hard. On the way the whole mood of the film and characters change, both by frustrations, lack of sleep, the lack of ability to go something about their situation. It is staggering and adds to the suspense and dark setting the film uncovers.I will not reveal anything about the movie itself, but if you have the stomach for abduction, skewed morals, the harsh facts of life and a very raw setting, if you can handle that (it is just a movie), then this is the film for you. It will keep you close to the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

It keeps you guessing from the moment the girls are kidnapped to the very end. Jackman'so performance is great with amazing character development in my opinion, with Mario Bello even doing a solid job in the few parts she appears in. But what really stood out in this movie was Gyllenhaal's performance with him showing all ranges of emotion possible in original ways with subtle and brilliant twitch in his eye that I personally find to be amazing with how he gradually brings it along in the movie and slowly makes it more aware to the viewer. Paul Dano is just solid at whatever he does as always, with all these performances tied together with a superb and original plot(even with its few minor flaws) creates a raw and surreal stellar movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow, a lot of time without seeing a movie like that. I finished exhausted because of the two and a half hours of pure tension. Maybe the dramatic overload of a developing kidnapping is the great hook for sustain the tension and interest for so much time. However I think the performances, the unexpected, help. I think an interesting thing is the way the characters acquire and manage information. The dosage of information seems carefully designed. The detective, the captain, the reaction of Mr Dover, etc, are far from clichés. I've experienced how the characters were confused and desperate like me, and that was possible (I think) thanks to the way the movie deliver information. No geniuses unveiling facts, characters are like people, they have hits and misses, very realistic. I liked the movie</fullReview>

The director succeeded in creating a tense thriller. The suspense is hold from beginning on a high level with lot of suspicious situations. There is a good message to take away: when somebody is in danger the believe in God is important and to pray. What I didn't like therefore was the very long running time of two hours and a half! I mean, there are many puzzles but at the end it is a real torture to wait until the labyrinth is solved. So it is in my opinion sometimes too long paced and some scenes could have been cut.

		<fullReview>Well, I wasn't sure what to think when the film opened up with a father and son hunt where they shoot a horrible animated fake deer. I thought Oh no this is a bad sign, but it quickly got better from that moment on. The plot is about two families whose two daughters are both abducted and the search to find them. It mainly focuses on Keller Dover (played by Hugh Jackman) one of the fathers, and Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and both of their separate efforts to find the missing girls. The sense of distressed urgency made it the most gripping and tense movie I have ever experienced. All of the acting was incredibly believable, every single actor. That is quite rare and I applaud them all. The performances along with the plot, and shots throughout made the horrors of having a child kidnapped relatable to an audience who have never experience such a thing or who may not even have a child of their own. It delves into mystery, real life horror, and issues of morality which made it a very suspenseful thriller. The only downside was the ambiguous ending, that left you unsatisfied with a story that so desperately needed closure and hope.</fullReview>

They are hard to watch not for the squeamish at all but at the same time one of the most memorable experiences in cinema of the last decade. Prisoners is no exception I cannot say for sure if you will be able to watch any of his films the second time but I can assure you they will stick with you and be memorable.This is taking revenge thrillers up a notch and the pacing is beautiful the puzzles fall into place never before time just at the right moment. But you forget the puzzle at times and just want to stop feeling what's going on through your body while watching it.The story revolves around the kidnapping of two little girls and the struggle of the parents to find them to get them home safely with the help of the detective (jake) . That is pretty much what you need to go with watching the film. Jake after zodiac gives his most memorable performance and a moment doesn't go buy when you don't understand Jackman's pain.

I loved the acting, it was really great! I was surprised how the main actors (Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal) played along and made each other look even greater. But Paul Dano really took me by surprise, mainly because I never heard of him neither have seen anything he acted in, but yet his acting in his role really impressed me, especially that he was so memorable next to such great actors!Also I'd like to add that I have watched this movie a few times already, but it was most impressive during the first watch of course ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackman and Gyllenhaal at their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will start off saying I was very apprehensive going into "The Prisoners", I have personally never been a fan of Gyllenhaal's acting I always found his style to be boring. Hugh Jackman on the other hand I am a huge fan of being a lover of X-Men for roughly half of my life.Hugh Jackman in this film was truly a spectacle to behold, he commands the screen with every second he is on it, his performance as a broken father really resonates with the audience, he really makes you pull at your own moral compass. How far would we truly go to save our blood, Jake Gyllenhaal gives an equally as good performance as Detective Loki (yes his name really is that cool). Gyllenhaal is equally as powerful. He incredibly embodies the troubled detective void of his emotions, culminating in real feeling ticks and twitches you begin to feel really embody the characters progression.I would personally say it is career best performances from Jackman and Gyllenhall, but that is to not take away from the rest of the cast, Terrance Howard is truly back to the quality of acting that won him his Academy Award nomination for "Hustle &amp; Flow" and the performance he gave in "Crash". While Paul Dano might not have had as much screen time as some of the other actors, he was truly superb playing the emotionally and intellectually stunted Alex Jones who is said to have the IQ of ten year old.While the film is not entirely perfect, Denis Villeneuve makes and incredible film for his Hollywood debut and first English language film. His use of tension building is second to none in recent years, "edge of the seat" stuff in a understatement, you start at the edge of your seat, by the end of the film you are on the floor. It has a wonderful noir feel to the film, and the use of Roger Deakins' cinematography was a true spectacle to behold, his work has been nominated for twelve Academy Awards so he is doing something right.Aaron Guzikowski writes some of the most enjoyable scenes I have seen in a thriller film for a long time, it is hard to believe that he is so early in his writing career considering his amazing grasp of twists and turns and brings a true mystery to the audience. There is a few moments of the film that are predictable but that happens with ANY film written, however for a relative newcomer Guzikowski is superb in his work.Overall, the film a truly a roller coaster ride of emotions that will keep you enticed from start to the end filled with powerful performances from the entire cast. The film does have a pretty long running time which may scare a few people off, but I assure you it is worth the long watch, that is if you are open to some violence and a few torture based scenes. If you get passed these aspects you will be in for a treat of a wonderfully shot, brilliantly directed and beautifully acted film by the leads.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling but sombre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think you have to be in the right mood for this movie. It does have some rather protracted scenes and the various plot lines don't come together especially well. Jake Gyllenhaal's character is not given any hinterland which makes it very hard for him to make the role come alive. On the other hand, if you are in the frame of mind for a whole bunch of creepy haunted house sequences and prepared to tolerate some rather nasty scenes, then you may well enjoy the way it develops. It's grey toned and slow but packs a real punch at times, with some edge of your seat moments. Not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but a worthwhile investment of your time. Interesting that it's set in Pennsylvania but was shot in Georgia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When two young girls go missing, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is called in to head the case of trying to find the children before it's too late. Before long, suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is arrested, but is released to due lack of evidence. However, the father of one of the kidnapped girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), is irate that Jones has been released, so as Dover becomes more &amp; more frustrated to know the location of his daughter, desperation takes over as he starts to take things into his own hands.OK, firstly, Prisoners is not a fast-paced movie at all, and if you don't like the more intricate, slower-paced movies then you will not enjoy this. Films of this pace draw a fine line...films that are slower but have an excellent story that immerse you, and films that are slower and boring. Thankfully, Prisoners is one of the former. It's 2? hours long, but in all honesty if it was any shorter it wouldn't have done the story any justice at all as it would have been rushed and so many story lines wouldn't have been answered.Everything about this movie is really well done, and the cast do a great job of making a great story better, with one of the stand-outs being Hugh Jackman who plays Keller Dover, an ordinary husband &amp; father who becomes obsessed with getting his daughter back no matter what it takes.The film takes you on a route that has many different twists and turns and poses so many thought provoking questions, with the main one being how far would you go if it were your child? Prisoners is a great movie and you'd be doing well to find a better crime thriller to watch this year. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good, emotionally wrenching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this was a very good, emotionally wrenching film, it was just not as good as it could have been. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers one of his best performances in a long time (I'm tempted to say since Brokeback Mountain, seriously), as his Detective Loki was the right amount of measured intensity and anguish. Conversely, Hugh Jackman's performance, while good, is just a little over the top. An emotionally powerful performance doesn't always involve screaming at the top of your lungs in every scene and unfortunately that's the lasting impression I had from him here. I also found the story suffered from a few too many plot holes in my opinion. Having said that, the director did a fantastic job of creating a dark, cold, dreadful atmosphere that permeated the film and really created a sense of despair. Overall, I would say this is worth seeing, especially for Gyllenhaal's underrated performance alone.Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch! Blog: www.themoviesnob.ca Twitter: @the_movie_snob</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enjoyable, long, dark, moody, Thriller, if at times felt rushed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a little hesitant in seeing Prisoners, as when i saw the trailers, i thought straight away that that they gave everything away. Had it shown us what really happened, who the kidnapper was and if any major twists that would ruin the film? Well many people thought so. I had a look on a few forums and websites, and everyone were the same. Had the trailers just ruined the whole premise of the film, well fortunately not. So here I am after watching Prisoners, quite happy that i was proved wrong, and I had just watched an enjoyable albeit a little dragged out crime drama.We're pretty much thrown straight into things. After a small family thanksgiving get together, and a little more booze than initially thought, the dads Keller and Franklin (Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard) along with mothers Grace and Nancy, (Maria Bello and Viola Davis) relax and wind down with a few games. After allowing their two young daughters to go outside and play about by their home which also has a creepy looking, dirty, dingy, RV camper van near by, it suddenly becomes apparent that their children are missing, and once its noticed that this suspect RV has also gone walkabouts, the conclusion is that their kids have been abducted.This leads to a police hunt led by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) promising that he will find these kids no matter what. The camper van being the supposed key to everything, has learning impaired Alex Jones at the wheel (played superbly by Paul Dano) all caught up in a story with numerous turns, twists and submissions, that it continuously keeps the viewer guessing whats going on, and who is behind everything that happens in front of their eyes. In the closing stages of the film, its seems all a little rushed in regards to the twist, but if paying enough attention, the audience should clock on with what is happening and have the reveal before the characters. A good few clues are thrown straight in front of our eyes, and I quite liked the fact that we could work this out before the some of the characters, as we were seeing things from a different perspective.Loki, the fathers, and the mothers all go through the emotions, with varying differences in how these families cope with the taking of these girls. Some take the vengeful route, others take matters in to their own hands, and some break down into an emotional wreck, disregarding anything else in the world to them. This is very apparent in the way the mothers deal with this current loss, one very different from the other. Some aspects within the film come across slightly strange, mainly for me, the police side of things and the way Keller acts. There really is only Loki looking for these children, trying to piece together what has happened, and how to solve it. Yes every now and then another police officer is seen, but generally with two girls missing, I would have thought a bigger police presence would have been on the scene. This might be because Loki has some demons of his own that is pushing him towards this case, but still it looked all a bit sparse. Keller on the other hand, when taking action into his own hands, seems so intent on one person, with really nothing to go on at most times, that his actions just seemed out of the blue for who he is and what he did. Yes his child is missing, but what he does, and somehow with complete ease, seems far- fetched in the way he gets away with it, but again that may loop to the lack of police presence, Keller is easily able to do what he wants, when he wants, to try and force answers that he wants to hear, because no one is stopping him.I thought the film would build up the families a bit more, show us who these people are, what they are like, build a relationship with the viewer before the kidnapping took place. But nope, 10-15 mins in and the films major plot begins, the two young children we are briefly introduced to have been taken, and the story starts. We were never really given any real close knit family moments, or any real introduction to the two girls, but if we were shown this, it may may have made Prisoners even darker than it is. Yes the terrible aspect of these two children taken is bad enough here, its strong enough to make the audience greatly care, and the story twists continue to intrigue, but that slight cover from the director, making the viewers not attached to these specific children by name, may have made the emotional absorbing roller-coaster of a story , that little bit easier to watch. However i did enjoy the relationship between Alex Jones and his grandmother. It was well thought out initially, but again would have liked certain parts to have been explained further.The film goes on for over 150 minutes, which at times feels like its dragging, but weirdly enough certain scenes, as like previously said, the reveal, the twist, feels rushed. I enjoyed Prisoners from the off. Some of the characters actions were questionable at the least, but the twists are interesting, and the whole building up to the reveal is done well. Prisoners has a solid story, fantastic acting, and some very emotional tense scenes. Still with a few plot holes here and there in full force once the credits roll you may be left wanting a little more.</fullReview>

The film was like staring into an outstanding painting. Roger Deakins did a fantastic job at making the cinematography look supremely natural. To add, my ears were captured by the acoustic, electronic music and sound effects. It was appropriate tunes for the genre. Johan Jonasson composed the tracks amazingly. In addition, the storytelling deeply explored religious and moral values. I found the plot very disturbing and gripping at the same time.It opened up a psychological dimension. The title triggered me to give it an 8/10, because of its wonderful creativity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just a typical thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a rather deep and compelling movie that isn't just your average thriller.It is slow-paced yet its theme is dark and sombre. The suspense is built up excellently throughout the film and it features some excellent acting performances from the cast. The film also subtly touches several social issues such as religious hypocrisy. Instances such as when Dover kneels down in prayer prior to torturing Alex Jones or when the sex-offender Father confesses to killing a man in vengeance for having allegedly killed 16 children left a rather dark impression.Though one could argue that the storyline itself suffers a few dents, they do not take much away from the end product, which is a brilliantly-acted and thought-provoking gem of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched it on blu-ray, had it lying around for some time. There is a reason I didn't see it right away - I was worried. I was aware of the many disappointments these kinds of films have often given me in various ways. I was also worried that it might be one of those kidnap-related thrillers that gives away too much and makes the horrible mistake of putting the viewer (me) ahead of the main characters in terms of plot.Thankfully, this was not the case. "Prisoners" evades so many clichés and tropes that it's worthy of some serious applause. It teases you, but mostly lets you off the hook soon after. Most of the time you're trying to unravel the mystery with the main characters at their pace, and if you at some point get ahead of them it's actually a transition that serves a purpose.This movie is the best thriller of its sub-genre I have seen in a long, long time.In terms of directing, writing, acting, cinematography and subtle music, thumbs up to the roof. The atmosphere is amazing and everything works so well together. For aspiring cinematographers and character writers this movie should be a must watch.I like Hugh Jackman a lot. He is very good and brings that rough edge to his character. But to my surprise Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely amazing and doubled my appreciation for him. You see, he didn't have a huge range to work with and the character was simple in a sense. It could've easily fallen into something monotone and uninteresting, but he was the most intense character in the film. Add the always excellent Melissa Leo and surprisingly effective Paul Dano, and you got a stellar cast. Not a single bad performance.As much as I like the story, this is as much a character film as a mystery. Our two protagonists are trying their best to handle an impossibly difficult situation. At some point, humanity and instinct will take over at the cost of everything else. I believe we all have that breaking point. If you have children, you will ask yourself some serious questions after watching this movie. I do not have kids, but I still questioned myself.Nothing is handled cheaply. In "Prisoners", characters aren't idiots. You understand the motivations. You understand the humanity and connect with it. When it comes to the antagonists, it's not (luckily) too clear and serves the story perfectly the way it's handled on their part. The ending is fitting and you don't feel cheated when it's all over. Thank you, Denis Villeneuve, for not treating us like idiots hungry for filler we've seen a thousand times.There are religious themes present in this film. It's nothing too simplified and I believe this movie isn't making a statement about these things. Doomsday-preppers may get a laugh or a frown about some things, but I found it all interesting."Prisoners" isn't an easy watch. It's not a shock/gore movie by any means, but it doesn't water itself down either. It treats its material with honesty, without pandering to PG13-audiences. This might be a little modern masterpiece for me. It's possible that I was just positively surprised after my initial worries or that it just seems so good in comparison to the usual crap Hollywood produces, but nevertheless my experience was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>atmospheric but slightly beguiling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Guzikowski fashions a deliciously twisty script that keeps you engaged for the lengthy running time of this film. With Jake Gyllenhaal as a broody and forceful guide through the mystery, and Hugh Jackman invading Michael Shannon territory as a regular guy suddenly capable of terrible acts, there is a lot to enjoy in this cerebral thriller.Two little girls go missing while their families enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner. One father, Keller (Hugh Jackman), lets his frustration with events overtake him and decides to beat information out of the initial suspect. The moral dilemma of the film hinges on the fact that in order to stop the victimization of the innocent, Keller may be victimizing the innocent.The actors do the script justice, Terrence Howard as Franklin, the other father, being as soppy and indecisive as Keller is driven and unrelenting. Melissa Leo as Holly Jones displays a quiet power, the rock that can resist the crashing wave that is Keller's rage.As finely crafted as the script is, there are a few refrigerator questions, and some other questions that niggle before leaving the theatre. Detective Loki seems to be the only cop working the case. Actions by other cops are inferred, but the lack of briefings and incident room activity seems off-beat. Paul Dano as Alex Jones brings his calling card creepiness to the show, but this character is the most problematic, saying - or not saying - only what is required to complicate the plot in the most fiendish of ways. In the end, the characterisation here veers away from plausible toward mechanistic. His initial comment that lights Keller's touchpaper seems, on reflection, a shade too conveniently timed and phrased.These quibbles aside, it is refreshing to encounter a script that forces you to pay attention rather than spoon-feeding information, and has you asking questions and discussing the story, and the themes it invokes, for days after. Guzikowski is a screenwriter to watch out for.</fullReview>

It is very hard to keep my attention for long (ADD makes me constantly distracted) and very often I have to rewind something I'm watching because I've zoned out or gotten distracted and missed a whole scene or two. But I have to say that I didn't budge or even look at my computer throughout this whole movie. A great movie keeps me guessing, holds my attention, and leaves me satisfied.

		<shortDescription>Dense, Haunting, Realistic, And The Best Film of 2013.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is a film that floored me on my first viewing and enthralled me on my second. Like most films with a central mystery, Prisoners takes its concept and unravels it into a giant web of intrigue, trapping its viewer and engulfing them in its gloomy universe. However, upon my second viewing, I realized what a dense, symbolic and haunting film this really is. This is without a doubt the best film of 2013: no other drama released this year managed to tap into human fears and desires this well. Every performance is impeccable, namely from the two leading men, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jackman is the crushed, brokenhearted father, consumed by rage and agony in his desperate attempts to reunite his family. Early in the film, he tells his son to "be ready. It doesn't matter if it's a hurricane, flood, anything." Perhaps it is either cruel irony or his character Keller Dover not heeding his own advice, but the way he is forced off the deep end as his psyche crumbles is both draining and curious to watch. Gyllenhaal's character has the most complete development in the film. A man who begins as a straight-shooting detective with a spotless record is transformed by Gyllenhaal into a man tortured by the work he held so dear, a man frozen in fear by his first real challenge in the line of duty. Every supporting performance is airtight and contributes to the film's slow-burning and unbearably tense atmosphere. Every shot lingers on for a time that floats between comfortable and uncomfortable. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villenueve are beautiful and capture some incredible shots throughout the film's massive run time. This contrast between direction and editing is one of the many contrasts in Prisoners, most of which are revealed through the film's deep-rooted symbolism. The imagery of crosses and The Lord's Prayer contrast deeply with Jackman's torture of Paul Dano's character throughout the film. The use of mazes as both a symbol and a plot device is ingenious, as the maze is seen to represent a sort of prison, in which the viewer realizes every character is trapped in after seeing the degree to which all of them have been trapped in their vices. The density and intelligence contained in this filmmaking was unmatched throughout the year of 2013. Prisoners is an incredible film and a must-watch for any lover of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Prisoners' is an unpredictable thriller with strong themes and characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many films about missing children. Most are predictable within the first fifteen minutes, but 'Prisoners' directed by Denis Villeneuve is a grossly entertaining film that always keeps you guessing. Hugh Jackman stars as a small town father of two named Keller Dover. When his six-year old daughter is mysteriously gone missing on a cloudy thanksgiving, he hires Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to investigate the crime and find his daughter. Hugh Jackman and his wife (Mari Bello) have a couple they are friends with who's daughter is kidnapped at the same time. As the investigation unfolds we see deep character change. Both Dover and Loki get wrapped up in anger, fear, revenge and stress as they try and uncover the truth. Hugh Jackman gives a powerful performance and plays the small town father perfectly. His character is so realistic and isn't forced for a second. Jake Gyllenhaal is awesome as a detective, and is an interesting aspect of the story. The script by Aaron Guzokowski is full of detail and brilliant symbolism as well as character development and suspense. The dark cinematography adds an accurate feeling to the story as you get lost up in the dark tone of the film. While watching 'Prisoners' you get to think about what you as a parent would do in situations that people like Hugh Jakcman's character face. The film provides strong messages such as getting caught up in anger and haste, forgiveness, detail, and trust. What's good to see these days is a mystery film that is thrilling, entertaining, and unpredictable, and with 'Prisoners' you simply have all those elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The rating of a 6 is purely based on the acting, but there will be several questions left when you're done watching. I started watching this accidentally one day and then ended up streaming it later to finish watching, so it was enough out of the gate to keep me interested. Several things I do not get (SPOILERS), such as: 1) Why did the one suspect kill himself in the police station when it was obvious he wasn't the kidnapper? 2) They explained the "boy" had mental problems and had the iq of a 10- year old. They showed a scene where he signed his name, clearly understanding what he was told. Yet he wouldn't say one word to he police and then to the father about the girls despite getting beaten over several days. Even a 10-year old understands the situation. 3) How did they find the black girl? It was never mentioned how she got away, just that "they found her". 4) When the black girl spoke to the father, why wasn't she questioned before that? Why were there no police there already in the room to protect her and question her? 5) The black girl gave him a clue as the location of where they were held, enough that he knew where to go. They then show the police chasing after him to stop him. What grounds did they have to stop him from doing anything when they didn't know anything about what he knew or where he was going? Why didn't he tell them to follow him if he was so damn sure? 6) When he entered the woman's house, he turns his back to her knowing full well she was the kidnapper. When he went there, I was anticipating how he would handle it, coming out directly at first or just playing it sly. He had a gun, it should have been accessible from the moment he knocked on the door and you never let them out of your sight!</fullReview>

The cast is the big draw, and they do deliver, Jackman is always a true professional, and Gyllenhaal keeps trying to be more than the roll needs though he does still deliver a solid performance. It is nothing like Taken, even though they sort of sell it that way. It is a long movie, almost 2 hours and 20 minutes before credits roll. No real action, but lots of suspense, even though you will most likely figure it out in the first half hour. Language and violence you can expect though even that is always slowly, and stretched out.

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Tale that Blurs the Line Between Right/Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was so much positive buzz when PRISONERS premiered on the festival circuit that I really expected it to have some presence at awards time. As the father of a little girl, I had a little extra bias settling in to watch this movie because the idea of a father in a desperate search for his missing daughter is a terrifying thought. PRISONERS did not disappoint on any front: the story, the acting, the tension. It's a movie that grips you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end credits begin to roll. It's a dark little film that touches on the blurring of right and wrong and what is acceptable to save the life of someone you love. PRISONERS begins on Thanksgiving as the Dovers and the Birch family come together to celebrate. The youngest daughters of each family, Anna and Joy, go outside unattended and disappear without a trace. The only clue was a beaten old RV that had been seen driving around the neighborhood. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to locate the missing girls and the RV is traced to Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a man with the mental faculties of a ten-year-old child. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) believes Jones knows where his daughter is being kept and, when Loki and the police aren't working fast enough, he takes matters into his own hands. He grabs Jones and locks him away in an old abandoned family home and begins his own investigation. Every minute counts as Loki and Keller race to find the missing girls before it's too late.PRISONERS is a very deliberately paced film and, at two and a half hours, you'll be surprised that at no point does it feel its length. It's a potboiler of a movie, building tension slowly so that the moments of extreme action hit you that much harder. The movie is a bit more complex than just, "How do we make a mentally-challenged, potentially dangerous man give us information?" Loki's investigation and the story behind the girls' abductions (as well as countless other unfortunate children before them) is almost more interesting than Keller going off on his own for his vigilante approach. The movie has the occasional red herring to throw the detective (and the audience) off course but it's never done without reason. Every person involved in the story, from the pedophile priest to the creepy stranger lurking at the girls' candlelight vigil, has some connection to the story and the people behind the disappearances. Moments that appear trivial at first are later revealed to be vital information in piecing together the over-arching story. What I'm getting at is that the movie is pleasantly complex and keeps you engaged until the screen fades to black. You never really know what to expect and you start to question how far is too far. After everything's been revealed at the end, it still leaves you wondering if all of the pain inflicted in the pursuit of saving lives was justifiable. I love that there's no right answer. What seems right at the beginning and has you gritting your teeth and silently encouraging Keller later has you looking back and thinking just how much fear can blind a person to rationality.All of this comes together with help from some great cinematography from Roger Deakins and a powerful cast. The entire movie's got a dreary, overcast feel. It's set in the winter and, when it's not pouring rain, it's a bleak gray clouded sky giving this movie not a single bright moment. It's got a strong sense of atmosphere to compliment a painful story. The cast in PRISONERS is phenomenal. Hugh Jackman breaks away from playing the X-MEN's Wolverine for a bit to portray a character with more range than cynicism and rage. That's not to say Keller doesn't have his share of rage in the film, but he sprinkles in desperation, fear, and undying determination. From the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Keller as somewhat of a religious man with a sense of preparedness for any situation. He lectures his son about how you should be prepared in the event of any catastrophe in which the rules of society might break down. Unfortunately, the one event Keller never planned for was the one in which he finds himself now and he devolves into an entirely new animal over the course of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to remind me that I don't give him enough credit as an actor. His character, Loki (not the God of Mischief sort), is a skilled investigator. He's hasn't been assigned to a missing persons case that he hasn't solved. The disappearance of Anna and Joy poses his first real struggle and it's only made worse by Keller's interference. He's just a man trying to do his job and save these girls but everyone seems to be working against him. We get Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard in supporting roles and Paul Dano as the mentally deficient Alex Jones. He's creepy and off-putting, but is he capable of something so horrible? The movie keeps you guessing and Dano's just great.There's not much more to say. I really enjoyed PRISONERS. I would've like to see it get more recognition but I suppose it's not surprising when you look at some of the other late year additions to the awards race. It's a great movie but doesn't compare to movies 12 YEARS A SLAVE or even American HUSTLE. It got lost in the shuffle but I hope it finds plenty of attention on home video from an audience to appreciate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent thriller with a solid human drama centre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two average suburban American families, meet up to celebrate Thanksgiving together, everything is normal, safe and secure.Both families take great care to ensure their younger daughters are accompanied between households. Whilst out, they briefly climb and play on an RV that is parked in the street, they come back inside the house.Later they decide to out again, same ritual but this time they do not come back, the older children did not accompany them, everything is not normal, nothing will ever be safe and secure again.The parents of "Anna", god fearing and practical survivalist "Keller Dover" (Hugh Jackman) and his wife "Grace" (Maria Bello), look in all the usual places. The respective parents of "Kyla", "Franklin" (Terrence Howard) and "Nancy" (Viola Davis) also come up short, the young girls have disappeared, the police are called.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has seen it all before, he is sympathetic, diligent and above all, realistic. The Police get a lucky break, the RV is spotted locally and before long the driver is in custody.Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is everyone's idea of someone that could abduct young children, with Jeffrey Dahmer style glasses, strange ways, hushed voice and the mental age of a ten year old. Soon he is a prime suspect, but following questioning the police are obliged to let him go.The film centres around how far you would go, to find out what you need to know. If the information is important enough, what might you do to find your loved ones? To use the well known quote from Nietzsche, "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process, he does not become a monster".When the children disappear, the initial casual concern escalates and is believably portrayed, making every parents nightmare real. The film asks some difficult questions, with no easy answers. Hugh Jackman plays a character we have not seen from him before. Whilst on occasion the acting is visible, perhaps due to how we normally perceive him. However, this is most definitely no Wolverine in civvies. All the central characters are good, notably Gyllenhaal and Jackman who are given the most to do.Davis and Bello as the grieving mothers are equally strong, as their known world starts to collapse around them. Both cope in different ways, driving a wedge into their relationships with their partners.However, Dano is the actor to watch. With so few words of dialogue, he still manages to convey a character who is at once, terrified, an object of pity, suspicion and yet still very obviously human.The film is filmed in a gritty down to earth, suburban grey and rain soaked style. Like the "Killing" TV series or "Seven", without the horror element. These are real people, in ordinary locations and everyday clothes. The abnormality of the crime screaming from behind white picket fences.There is much portentous music and on occasion we are being told what to feel but overall, this is classy, intelligent work. Guessing who did what, when and why is what these movies are all about and this does not disappoint.Some have drawn parallels with the War on Terror, this reviewer did not draw that conclusion, although it could be easily found. On this occasion, maybe a "cigar is just a cigar", what you see is what you get.By necessity the film is adult in content, however the violence is not gratuitous and whilst certain undercurrents exist, there is nothing obvious to make viewing uncomfortable. The ending deserves a mention, knowing when to fade to black is an art. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve in his largest project to date, has chosen well.Summary Anchored with strong performances, an excellent thriller with a solid human drama centre.A long film at 153 minutes but they disappear quickly, with the audience desperate to know what happens next.Recommended</fullReview>

One of the best abduction stories I have seen. Could be compared to 'taken' but with a better plot than the usual movies of abduction and rescue. The story is also not that predictable as the usual action movies.Overall, the movie is definitely worth a watch with all your friends as it leaves you on the edge of the seat wanting to know how it unfolds and it has done that wonderfully!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is a fantastic movie with a very well developed and well written storyline that is beautifully filmed with an outstanding cast that deliver extremely inspired and dedicated performances.It is without a doubt,in my own opinion,the best acting I have ever seen from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal,not that they were ever bad actors but I never expected this level of high quality acting from either of them,especially Jackman,scenes like when he's roaring at Paul Dano trying to get him to say where his daughters are,are so intense and dramatic and it's all because of how dedicated Jackman was,and the fact that he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for his performance upsets me,he was absolutely outstanding.The story is really unpredictable and will keep you wondering all the way through,the ending.which I won't spoil,is the kind of ending I don't like when most films do it,but it suited this movie and I thought it was a clever move that I actually really liked.Prisoners is an outstanding movie that should have been nominated for several Academy Awards,and I would recommend to all moviegoers,especially fans of drama and thrillers.A dedicated father will do anything he can to find his missing daughter,while the police are only finding more leads to the kidnapping.Best Performance: Hugh Jackman</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every parent's worst nightmare is losing a child in any possible way that it might happen. Here, Hugh Jackman, Elizabeth Banks, Terence Howard and Viola Davis play two pair of parents whose youngest children vanish during a thanksgiving get-together. Each pair's eldest kids then tell their parents and detectives that they have spotted a camper parked outside earlier and that their siblings tried to play on it but they stopped them and thus begins a statewide search for the two best friends. The horrific emotional toll of the two missing children pushes each parent to the brink of insanity as they stop at nothing to make sure that their children are found alive. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the lead detective hell bent on bringing the children home and his painstaking investigation as well as Jackman's vigilantism help unravel the small town's deepest darkest secrets and changes all their lives forever. At 153 minutes, you will feel the length of this film but it is with due cause that it is that long. Melissa Leo rounds out the cast of stellar performers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was awesome and mind blowing. but the main reason that i rated it 9 and not 10 is because it was very slow and at some times boring also. at many points it seemed that may be there are just stretching for example the part in which Hugh Jackson goes again and again to the house to beat that poor kid. Over all the movie was good and it was full of surprises. even till the end of the movie i was pretty much sure that the kid Hugh Jackson has locked up was the culprit but that old lady just came out of no where. another thing that i didn't like was that they left the movie like an open book. they should have concluded it and should have shown that her daughter was safely retrieved at that she was again re united with her family. leaving the movie like this was giving to ideas that may be that kid was never found and she died in that deep dark hole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent &amp; Suspenseful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is certainly the textbook definition of an edge of your seat movie. It's got a lot of suspense, and plot twists galore so that from the very beginning you're never really sure who is or isn't guilty, and the ultimate revelation of that caught me at least completely by surprise. As a result of that, this can also be a bit confusing at times, but it's never a movie that you lose interest in.The basic story revolves around the search for two young girls who have gone missing without a trace. The families are friends, and are fully involved in the search. There's a prime suspect, but no definite evidence against him. The movie is not just a story about the search for the girls. It's also a study of how far people are prepared to go when they're desperate.Hugh Jackman was excellent as Keller Dover - one of the desperate fathers, who takes his desperation to the extreme. Paul Dano also did well as the prime suspect - the mentally challenged Alex. Unlike others, I really wasn't that taken with Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective in charge of the case. For me, he really didn't seem to work in the role.Overall, though, this is an excellent and suspenseful thriller. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark vision with high tension</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For quite some period of time no other thriller film gave us the opportunity to exceed the level of our expectations that much as "Prisoners". If we take into account the fact that the whole genre is characterized by a small share in the overall production, scarce production budgets and minimal promotion, no wonder that we rarely get more than a medium-quality generic job work. However, the Prisoners' pedigree implicitly suggested that that could yield something much more interesting. The starry cast leaded by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal together with a promising Canadian director, Denis Villeneuve and scenario writer, Aaron Guzikowski, definitively have brought some new blood in a stagnant genre.The plot of Prisoners intertwined with dilemmas and intriguing reversals maintains a high level of tension throughout the whole 153-minut period. The search for the lost girls leads us through dump houses, depressive landscapes, endless rain, cold, from a clue to a clue just to end up in a vicious circle and falling down deeper and deeper into hopelessness under a watchful eye of sophistical-dark vision created by the director of photography Roger Deakins. And while the solution starts to stumble in the attempt to find the connection between the clues, the skepticism retreats under a strong atmosphere dominated by the contrasts of light and dark bringing about a surreal space ? a space where the battle between good and evil is fought . Precisely the emphasis placed on that dimension allows the film to pass beyond the limits of the whodunit framework and places the work above an average thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing do not mean bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not agree with bad reviews for this movie. I think that there is certain confusion for people, between " I do not like this movie " and " I do not like what this movie tells ". When a story, in a movie, disturbs us, if it lowers us the look or obliges us to look away from the screen because we do not support what we see, it does not mean that the movie is bad. If that we see puts back us at home with a bad sensation in the stomach because of the cruelty, of the hardness of what we contemplated, it does not mean that the movie is exaggerated. Unfortunately, reality often overtakes fiction. All this can even mean that the movie is very good. It can mean that the acting is superb.We cannot judge a movie by our limitations, our prejudices or our way of conceiving life. We go to see a movie to escape us of our own life, remove our spirit of our everyday life, or know what happens around us, even if it can be surprising and disturbing.Give a chance to this movie, watch it, because it is one of the best of 2013.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget Gravity, 12 year a slave etc etc. This are all good movies, but the best and most underrated movie of the year 2013 is this one. Been a long time since last I watched such a suspense master piece. The acting is tremendous, not only on Jackman's part, but all of the cast did a impressive job. You wont be able to blink for a second, because if you do you will loose something that will make sense a lot later into the movie. The story connects perfectly all the dots. The directing is superb. The ending is perfect. For some viewers the movie might be a little to graphic, but all the violence in the movie makes sense. It's not just for show or to make it controversial or draw attention to a no brainer. Simply put: watch it before the Oscars, because after you may be intoxicated with all the bad taste from the academy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners has terrific performances and a building sense of dread...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Prisoners' is about the abduction of two young girls, and follows the investigation through cop Jake Gyllenhaal and desperate father Hugh Jackman.This long mystery thriller never drags despite the runtime, and as the film develops its heartfelt story piece at a time, a nerve-jangling level of suspense and slow-building dread is administered, not to mention a few hard-to-watch scenes. The cast is the reason why you become so invested into the abduction plot, which never stalls for a second, and Hugh Jackman delivers a quite sensational, Oscar-worthy performance as the desperate father who'll go to extreme lengths to get his daughter back.Eventually it meets a satisfactory climax, making a few hair-raising twists and turns on its way to the final events, but not before making you feel simultaneously absorbed and disturbed for the 2.5 hour runtime. 'Prisoners' story will have you hooked from the beginning and stunned at the end, and its great ensemble cast create that bond for you as the viewer into the investment of their situation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A deeply unsettling but brilliantly directed film. It's billed as a crime movie, but feels more like a horror movie!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal put in superb performances as respectively one of the parents and the investigating officer of two children that have gone missing. It is clear that they don't trust each other even though they are on the same 'side' and it's the tension between these two characters that makes this movie spark.The horror comes from Hugh Jackman's character resorting to imprisoning and torturing a suspect who he is convinced took his child, subjecting him to probably even worse treatment than the missing children have experienced. The other parents find out what is going on, but choose to turn a blind eye. As I said, it's deeply unsettling.Towards the end the movie turns into a face-paced edge of the seat thriller, as the facts of the cases are revealed in quick succession and both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters race to find and rescue the children. The tension reaches fever pitch as the horrific truth of what has happened comes to light.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is my favourite film of 2013 simply because every single shot is perfect, as well as this the dialogue is tense and dramatic and the acting is brilliant. Before you watch this film you should know that it isn't an easy watch, it is probably the most realistic depiction of an abduction ever and at two and a half hours long it is not an easy watch, don't be expecting too sail through it like you might when watching the wolf of wall street, it is worth watching and savouring every second of. The characters are developed brilliantly and you feel a strong amount of empathy for pretty much all of the characters and have sympathy for the situation they are in. The film also has a very unapologetic tone, there is one aspect of the film which may even verge on disturbing but this only adds to the plot and character development. Have I mentioned already about how beautiful this film is, it feels like you are watching the work of someone who sat developing the set for each scene for days on end, the film also includes a one minute sequence which is one of the most beautiful set pieces ever, easily up there with the cola cabana steady cam in Goodfellas and the steady cam behind the trike in The Shining. To conclude I would easily rate this film 10/10, it is perfect in pretty much every way, Prisoners is incredible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a fun movie to watch yet a very good one...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is not the average thriller that some reviews and most previews build it up to be. Rather, this feature is a dramatic exploration of the darker side and evilness of humanity. Set in suburbia Kentucky, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a devote family man and Christian, faces a parent's worst nightmare. His daughter goes missing. A young detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned the case, which quickly becomes nearly unsolvable as the only suspect; a RV driver with an IQ of a 10 year-old (Paul Dano) is dismissed from lack of evidence. Keller takes matters into his own hands while the small town gradually begins to fall apart and the most disturbing of secrets from behind closed doors are unveiled. I cannot say that this is a film I enjoyed. It really is not one too enjoy. It is dark and violent, but not violent in the gory sense?in the realistic and psychologically one. We first hand get to see helplessly in how Keller progressively loses his soul and sanity as he continually tortures a man to desperately find any information on his missing little girl. As onlookers, we get to observe how the Dover family slips into a deep depressive state. We watch as the young cop becomes more and more flustered, agitated, and violent as he tries to close a case that he cannot fathom. Director Denis Villeneuve knows how to make the audience feel uncomfortable from depicting a mature subject matter so well and with using such a great cast. Each performance by the actors is raw and real. Hugh Jackman fits the persona of an enraged father pushed beyond his limit. We understand his motives and can accept, but not necessarily condone his brutal actions. Jake Gyllenhaal creates an interesting character that we too can feel and comprehend. He is so natural in the role. It almost seems that he is just the character and not even acting. Paul Dano plays the simpleton well, and he manages to squeeze in his trademark of embodying a whimpering wimp. None of the characters are inherently good or bad nor are they cut as black and white. They are submerged in a vat of grayness and ambivalence.Cinematographer Roger Deakins helps capture the bleak and dejecting atmosphere of the film?bland, washed out colors in the day and eerie, nightmarish shadows in the night. Shot on a digital camera, the visuals are simply breathtaking. I honestly don't think this movie would have been as impactful if it had been shot on the standard 35mm film. Though sparse, the music supports the dark, foreboding mood. While the film has sublime performances and a great visual style, it falls flat on bits regarding the story. Some subplots are not finished, forcing the viewer to try and connect the dots in a somewhat intricate story. Other elements feel drawn out unnecessarily to the point of boredom. The constant transitions of fading to black during the final act comes off as a gimmick and removes any potential for suspense or energy. The ending particularly leaves the viewer cold and without solace. Then again, as previously stated, this movie is not your traditional thriller. It focuses on drama versus thrills and chills, which supports the blah atmosphere. A little of excitement though could go a long way in spicing things up for the film's concluding act. Prisoners is a film that is not fun to watch, but it is a very good one. The two and half-hour length is not something to be disheartened over. In fact, more could have been added to complete the plot in its entirety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of 2013 ... Where's that nomination ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst.My wife wanted to watch another thriller. And what a thriller it was ultimately. With a thriller of such high level as "Prisoners", my wife starts to surf the internet so she can read the plot. She begins to get nervous and says in a indignant way that everything takes far too long and was terribly stretched."Prisoners" is a real nail-biting movie and actually a mix of a psychological drama with a heart-pounding suspense and a dash of horror. A mix of "Mystic River" and every top movie where a serial killer is hunted down like "The Silence of the Lambs" or more recently "The Frozen Ground". The viewer is confronted with terrible questions of conscience. How far would you go when your dearest person is taken away? Would you dare to take the law into your own hands and commit degrading acts to find the truth ? We are also witnessing the desperation and helplessness that an investigator of such crimes feels.Hugh Jackman plays the role of the father in despair, Keller Dover, with lot of enthusiasm. He shows a person torn by frantic rage and immense sadness because he first lost his lovable daughter and secondly fails as a householder who said he could protect his family against anything. His wife Grace, played by Maria Bello, gets in a depressed state as the days are progressing. Sleep and antidepressants are the only things that can still help her. The remaining son looks at it all from a distance and watches over Grace while Keller is constantly absent. We also get a view of the other family Birch , especially Franklin Birch who helps Keller with his desperate plan afterwards, but their emotions are not as detailed unraveled as those of the Dover's.It all begins with the disappearance of the daughters Anna and Joy when the two families celebrate Thanksgiving. The two girls had played that afternoon nearby a white mobile-home parked in front of the door which is now no longer visible. A police description is passed around and that same evening the mobile-home is spotted on a parking lot of a gas station. This is the moment Detective Loki comes into the picture. For me a huge achievement in terms of acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. Amazing how he portrays the inspector. The passion, the tics and the way he puts his teeth into the case, while sometimes it seems as if it doesn't really interests him. How careless he reads text messages and seemingly almost writes down nothing. When Grace makes a remark about that, he starts writing something in his notebook in a careless way. The fact is, that so far he has solved all the cases that were given to him.The driver of the mobile home is trying to escape and eventually arrested. The car is searched but nothing is found. What remains is the meaningless and confused explanation of the twenty years old Alex Jones, who has a mental retardation and the IQ of a 10 year old. Due to a lack of evidence they need to release Alex, while Keller is firmly convinced that Alex is guilty and should not go unpunished. When Alex uses the sentence "They only cried when i left", Keller loses control and forgets every Christian commandment although he normally holds on to that as a devout Christian. He even exceeds the bounds of humanity in such a way that a return is impossible.And this is the most important moral question of this movie. Would you torture someone, you're sure of he's guilty, so you can find out the truth. As a father I am convinced that the disappearance of your daughter is the worst you can experience as a human being. An inhuman nightmare. And after hearing the pronounced sentence, which is open to interpretation, I also would be capable of doing such a thing. Even if it should turn out that the person is innocent.The course of the film is painfully and annoyingly slow. Maybe a cinematic portrayal of the excruciatingly long time parents of missing children need to endure while waiting for positive news. It's also logical and insightful put together. Successively, we have to deal with the discovery of the remains of a child rapist in the basement of a priest, a copycat who eventually seizes the opportunity to shoot a bullet through his brains and the final denouement which wasn't totally unexpected but because of the prior still surprising. Several times I read about the fact that there are quite a few holes in the scenario, and things turn out to be wrong. I can't put my finger directly on any flaw in this movie. The mystery of the maze is that I think there really isn't one but just a perception in the mind of both a retarded boy and an abused boy. The latter looked at this image (also the medallion of the deceased father) for years. The only thing that I was still wondering about are the snakes. Do they have a particular symbolic meaning ? Also the unprofessional actions of the law enforcement officers bothered me. The superintendent wasn't much of a help in solving the case. And in such an important criminal case , I certainly wouldn't leave the prime suspect unattended. And I think the aunts house would be searched through thoroughly.Final conclusion: In my opinion this was the best movie I watched in 2013. A poignant, terrible emotionally movie with a strong storyline, engaged in a cinematic depressed decor with its greyish tones and perpetual drizzle and carried by a top cast. It shows once again shows that there are totally sick minds that inhabit our planet, and that religion is used again as an excuse to condone it.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

He kidnaps one of the suspects (Paul Dano) and tortures him for information, and, a recovering alcoholic, starts drinking again. The policeman on the case, Loki (Gyllenhaal) starts trailing him while searching for the children and looking at suspects.What a dark, gritty movie, photographed in muted colors that make the film look old. The landscape is stark. People aren't particularly well-dressed. The cars are old.This is a movie about prisoners of all types - emotional, physical, addictive. In Prisoners, everyone is just that, in his or her own way. Truly a suspenseful movie with a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman -- perhaps his best -- as the crazed father. A brooding Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent as the police officer who is desperate to find the girls.Prisoners is not always easy to watch, but you won't be able to turn away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If one needed proof that the Oscars too often ignore excellent films and terrific performances, this is it. A cautionary tale of the road rage-age we live in, this story about parents' worst nightmare of having their children suddenly disappear has its feet firmly rooted in reality while taking some breathtaking twists and turns, never melodramatic. Director Denis Villeneuve and writer Aaron Guzikowski know their beans when it comes to understanding what make our well-meaning but sometimes very sick society tick. The cast is deep and talented. Hugh Jackman's frantic father adds yet another dimension to the seemingly endless capabilities of this actor. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other parents involved in the developing tragedy are contained, believable and never anything but excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal's typically realistic, understated turn as the skeptical cop is perfect counterpoint. Paul Dano's hapless nut case almost steals the show, and Melissa Leo's turn as his "keeper" is downright frightening. I recommend this film without reservation. And Oscars _ wake up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine film and the acting is excellent. This film takes us on a journey into the world of twisted individuals and how people can become very bizarre. As it unfolds you begin to realize that all these small pieces and these players are linked together. These deranged individuals then victimize children for their own " plan " for so called religious purposes. Enter the families of the children who can't fathom why someone would take their kids and their reactions to this stress. A basic good person suddenly becomes a wrecked shell that is driven by fear and anger to find their child. They grow more doubting of law enforcements ability to find their children, so they resort to a primitive method. This film shows how average people, never violent can become a very violent person when this pain and anguish comes upon them. It is an excellent example of stress, pain and fear becoming a driving force in decision making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is disturbing, dark and depressing, but at the same time a totally riveting mystery thriller with many twists and turns. Great cast and compelling performances by all. Prisoners is an intense, powerful and unforgettable movie that for some reason, was oddly under-rated as it seemed to get overlooked. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal were superb and totally believable. They truly became the characters that they were portraying. This movie really portrays how a good person's sense of logic and compassion can be seriously twisted by events which deem them powerless. It terrified and disturbed me. It has a continuous and unrelenting sense of tension and suspense. I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I was kept guessing and totally absorbed for the entire two and a half hours and was left wanting more. Superb all round, but at the same time very disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really good, watched it three times. Takes place in real time, no extraneous dialogue or action - everything is integral to the plot and story line. Paul Dano is excellent, as are all the others. Didn't even recognize Melissa Leo. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal of course, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello - so many of my favourites.Music, location, action scenes - couldn't have been better. Everyone on the crew is to be congratulated for a job well done. So much money is spent these days on projects that have no substance or value. Thankfully "Prisoners" with director Denis Villeneuve is not one of them. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most exciting thrillers of the last years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a very good film. Firstly, the history-telling is great. The characters development served absolutely fine in the film. In fact, It's much more a story-film than a character-film(if that makes sense...). I mean, it's 150 minutes runt-time just flew by, because the story was incredibly instigating, and there was always something 'important' happening. The atmosphere of the film is dark, gritty; exactly what the film needed. And yes, shockingly violent.Second, the acting. Everyone was good but Jake Gyllenhall was definitely the one who stole the scene. He made a real freaky detective, and his gestures and mannerisms made for the 'Loki' character were priceless. Also liked, in a lesser extent, Hugh Jackman. His character is the most layered though.I also really liked one of the key components of this film that was the cinematography. Cold, dark with a 'modern' touch, all the artistic method used by the great Roger Deakins. The editing was also well-done, as we see in the final moments in the film.I wished I could've felt more the sounds of the ambient though. Everything was beautifully well made, well crafted, lacking a good job in the music/sound department. The score was way generic.Anyway...Prisoners is a very well crafted and an exciting thriller, undeniable one of the best released recently. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is The Type And Quality Of Film I would Expect Of James Wan, but Denis Villeneuve Is light-years Ahead Of Him,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a lover of suspenseful films then I highly recommend this one. This is among the better films of 2013 and I would not hesitate in voting for this one as the best film of that year.The plot of the film is about the mysterious disappearance of two little girls while they are playing outside their parent's house.Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover a construction worker who is facing financial problems and barely making ends meet for his family. When his daughter is mysteriously kidnapped, he takes matter into his own hands by kidnapping a suspect whom the police release because of lack of evidence.Seasoned actor Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective David Loki who is assigned this case. Loki has a reputation for solving difficult cases and he takes this one as a particular challenge.Both actors give a thoroughly professional performance. The direction, script, background sound effects and bleak atmosphere enhance this film. This is a film you'll be left guessing till the end and even a veteran film buff like myself couldn't figure out the person who was behind the kidnapping.Similar films: The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992), When the Bough Breaks (1986), The Silence Of The Lambs (1991), Copycat (1995), Bone Daddy (1988), Resurrection (1999), The Deliberate Stranger(1986), The Gray Man (2007), Dahmer (2002), To Catch A Killer (1992), Seven (1995).Many more recommendations but I don't have time to write them all down.

		<shortDescription>A dark and brooding thriller you won't forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a get together with their friends, Nancy &amp; Franklin Birch, Anna Dover and Joy Birch are kidnapped by an unknown culprit. Detective Loki arrests a prime suspect, Alex Jones. The despondent Keller Dover decides to take matters into his own hands when Jones is released by using physical, torturous tactics on Alex Jones. Keller starts to go over the edge, almost on the brink of insanity to try to get the two little girls back. This isn't your Mother's thriller, that's for sure, in fact, I was shocked when I found out this was a bit of a box office hit. The subject matter is absolutely gruesome. This one requires you to put your thinking cap on and leave all distractions aside. This is really tough to watch. The atmosphere is very grim, not to mention it's raining all the time, which adds to grim mood. It has an ominous score that chilled me to the bone. It took me about 45 minutes for me to fully get into this one, but that isn't a bad thing at all. It is very patient with its approach and I dug that. It is carefully thought out with torture sequences that will make even the strongest people flinch. I couldn't even fathom the pain of losing a child, or to have one disappear on you. There is not a pain the world that compares to losing a child when you're a parent. I'm not a parent, but even I know that. If you're a parent, this movie will hit very close to home, perhaps in a very uncomfortable way. The performances are amazing and I bet they were emotionally exhausted. Hugh Jackman is absolutely riveting. He is full of raw emotion. I loved how he was able and willing to throw his morals out the window and do whatever it took to find his daughter. His methods were totally understandable, if not exactly likable. If I was a father, I would do the same thing Keller did. This is Jackman's finest hour. He'll always be Wolverine to me, but the man is incredibly gifted. What a memorable show by him! Jake Gyllenhall is terrific as Detective Loki. He was on top of things the whole time and I loved his performance. Terrance Howard is very good, as is Viola Davis. I gotta mention Paul Dano's performance as a twisted, yet complex person. I hated him and felt for him at the same time. Melissa Leo steals every scene she's in, especially near the end. Maria Bello was excellent as the grieving mother. I suspect the ending will have people split 50/50Final Thoughts: I would have trimmed it just a tad, but this movie affected me in a big way. It's frightening, disturbing, engrossing, and thought-provoking. It is one of the best films of 20138.7/10</fullReview>

The director does an admirable job of conveying an atmosphere exuding tension and mystery through all the scenes, including the pouring weather, which contributes to the proper ambiance. The movie avoids clichés and its rhythm and timing are almost perfect. While Gyllenhaal confirms his brilliance and the others ? including Jackman ? do not disappoint, it's Paul Dano who really shines to a point that you start wondering if he is not portraying himself! As for the story, the excellent script and very credible characters more than compensate for what it lacks in originality. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all a film to be recommended if you want to spend the evening watching a movie with the right ratio of Mystery / Action. The film leaves an uneasy feeling from the beginning observing an isolated and eerie landscape, a feeling that leaves space soon to a sense of the unknown that conveys to the viewer anxiety and curiosity until the end. Excellent interpretation of Hugh Jackman who exudes the pain of a father who sees his daughter disappear from a moment. Leaves something to be desired the character starring Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), which seems to keep a detached attitude and shallow for the whole course ot the interlacing and then, inexplicably, spurting determination and investigative spirit to the very last frames. The plot is Very nice overall, just some nonsense leaves the viewer some faded unresolved question mark at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of 2013?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film with very low expectations: the trailer looked good enough but i was questioning whether it was worth spending over two hours of my time on, and i am so glad i did watch it in the end.The synopsis of this movie is in full in the trailer, but if you are still unsure from the trailer and reading other reviews, the main story is basically the investigation of the disappearance of two young girls from two different, but very close, families.This film is exactly what i have been looking for and i didn't even know it. This film has everything, it has tension and suspense, but also has action and is full of emotion.What makes this film so good is that i have never seen anything like it. It wasn't predictable at all, but it also wasn't so unpredictable that story line just became hard to follow and unrealistic. This film could have easily been based on a true story, which is why it was so engaging.The acting in this film was phenomenal, especially Hugh Jackman's performance, to the point where at times i forgot that this was just a film. Jake Gyllenhaal who adopted the role of the head detective was also fantastic, as was Paul Dano who portrayed the main suspect. There were only (roughly) 8 main characters; the four parents, the two children who disappeared, the detective, and the main suspect (Alex Jones) but not at any point did I feel there was a lack of detail and continuity. In fact, my only criticism would be that we barely saw the two mothers in the film in comparison to some other characters, but thats just me being picky.I would highly recommend this movie to anybody i know, unless you are not a fan of violence/gore/blood etc as it is fairly prominent throughout. This film is definitely worse watching, and as it is out on DVD tomorrow, i suggest you snatch a copy if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two suspenseful approaches to one dark crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Thanksgiving in Pennsylvania and the sky is grey, the air is cold and the ground is frozen. Two families, perfectly matched, celebrate the holiday together. Each family has two kids, a teenager and a younger daughter. The daughters are 6-year-old girls, ready to get into a harmless adventure, and the teenagers are teenagers. But the girls go missing, and the hunt goes on to find them and figure out what happened.The families have no luck and soon enough the police are there to help. The lead investigator is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the one father, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), already has his suspicions that he's not going to be useful at all. I think now is as good as time as any to declare that Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki is one of the most fascinating detectives to watch, and arguably one of the best performances of a detective ever. I want him on every case.Keller disagrees because he already has his prime suspect and any decent detective would torture him until he revealed the location of the missing girls. Unfortunately the prime suspect, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), is mentally disabled and likely incapable of committing such a serious crime."Prisoners" is a good movie because it takes two different approaches to try to get to the same result. Keller takes matters into his own hands to track down the killer and the missing girls. And Detective Loki actively tries to solve the case. Loki is really on his own with Keller against his every move and boss which won't budge on formalities. Keller, on the other hand, shouldn't be alone with a wife who needs his support, a teenage son left to deal with a tragedy on his own, and a similarly suffering best friend. He turns from all of them but the latter to take care of the case on his own.The farther that our two active participants get in opposite directions, the more that needs to be solved. And "Prisoners" spends two and a half hours leading us down a twisting, suspenseful path during a bleak November in a Pennsylvanian suburb.</fullReview>

There is one shot in which the camera just focuses on a tree which was exceptional. Yeah, just a tree. But it conveys great mood and atmosphere. The ending will leave you satisfied. This is certainly not your typical Hollywood fare - thus the high scores on IMDb. Both the dad and the detective are outstanding.

		<fullReview>When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads. But just how far will he go to protect his family?Prisoners has the strongest ensemble cast of 2013 and everybody brings their A game. Keller Dover is Hugh Jackman's most raw and complex role yet, as Jackman plays Dover's wavering belief of the justice system and descending morality to a realistic precision. Things get murky as Dover takes matters in his own hands on an unconfirmed suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and traps himself between being desperate, angry and helpless.Jake Gyllenhaal, sporting a neck tattoo and facial tics, creates the realistically compelling Detective Loki. The character is a fascinating inward look to how police detectives conduct their investigations, interrogate suspects and how the job centers on being emotionally removed from the crime itself. Loki is even darkly funny at times because he is so distanced from the crime and committed to procedures that normal things seem outlandish to him.Roger Deakins's cinematography brings layers of shades into the perpetually cloudy and otherwise flat-looking suburbia. The moody atmosphere embodies a sinister undertone; whether the location is a forest, a kitchen or a washroom, it feels like someone is lurking behind the corner. Mirroring its main characters, the cinematography impressively supports the story with a growing sense of insecurity.Denis Villeneuve directs ambitiously, as Prisoners juggles between being a character study of two families dealing with a kidnapping, a crime mystery plot and the theme of the institution versus the individual. Retrospectively, in total Alfred Hitchcock-coined "refrigerator logic" terms, the film does not entirely deliver on all three. Maria Bello, Viola Davis and Terrence Howard's characters do get sidetracked. The story thematically switches between whatever is the most interesting in the given moment, which in the moment is powerfully engaging.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's really nothing particularly exceptional about the story or the script for 'Prisoners', but in the hands of a director who uses expertly applied minimalism and an extraordinarily talented cast, it becomes a compelling tale about love, faith and how quickly hard lines can become blurred in the face of tragedy. The final act undermines this somewhat with its tonally incongruent Hollywood twists and turns that seem like they were spliced in from a different film, but ultimately 'Prisoners' is still a gripping and gut-wrenching tale that will likely stay with you long after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is the type of movie that is getting less and less recurrent in Hollywood and a must-see for anybody that enjoys a thriller that doesn't reach exaggerated proportions. Morally challenging and provoking, this is a story about how to handle a dire situation such as the disappearance of two young children. The two main characters provide us with very different scopes of this dilemma. On one hand Jackman's Dover is an emotional driven man who while acknowledging his wrong doings, doesn't restrain himself and goes past any boundaries to ensure his family's safety. On the other hand Gyllenhaal's Loki is a detective that not only shows determination to succeed in another case, but grows to be defined by it, as even he will boil under pressure. The performances are astonishing from these two men and you feel their tribulations throughout the film, whether it's Jackman's descent into near madness or Gyllenhaal's anxiety as he pursues every lead possible. Director Denie Villenueve provides us with a moody setting that not only attracts us to this shadowy story, but also connects with all aspects provided with his co-workers such as a fantastic cinematography work and a striking script that will fill with as much doubt as the characters in the movie. My only complaint is that I thought it ran a bit too long and a little sharper editing would have been fine with me, since not only would I rate it higher, but also would have had an even better experience. Having watched the film, I can only say that is deserving of its recognition (IMDB Top 250) and I hope I get to see more movies churned out like these.Rating 7/10</fullReview>

So my expectations were not that high to start with but before watching it I looked at IMDb and saw great ratings this movie has received. So my expectations rose and I was sort of carrying a real time rating meter in hand - trying to push myself to rate it while I was watching it and really I could not find any moment where I would have given it 7 out of 10...hence overall 8!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have both played a great role especially Jackman. I can say this is his one of the best roles. His acting is commendable - as a helpless and tired dad but the one who is ready to do anything possible (or even impossible) to find his daughter and he did all he could while facing push back from all people around him. He broke the rules for good and kept trying. Overall, awesome acting by all. Kudos to the director Denis Villeneuve and his entire team. Very emotional and suspenseful movie which will keep your heart pounding all the time. You fight with hope and reality and in the end wish for everything to end well.

		<shortDescription>Dark, Complex, and Haunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners (2013) is an incredibly dark, gritty crime drama. Very much a modern film, it combines realistic?if unusual?plot and characters with morally complex questions and situations. Additionally, the film is layered with symbolism, which presents no problem for a casual viewer, as it can be ignored in favor of plot, though analytical and intellectual viewers will probably enjoy puzzling through the various symbols presented in the film.The premise is simple: two families, with the help of a detective, search for their children, who have disappeared and are believed to have been abducted. The plot, however, grows increasingly complex as the film progresses, though it never becomes muddled or difficult to follow, and the twists and turns never become unrealistic, though they are unexpected. The action of the film mostly centers on Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a man whose young daughter has gone missing. The story deals mainly with his desperate search, and many of the moral issues that arise in the film derive from his growing desperation. Also central to the plot is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man with a mysterious and troubled past who has been assigned to the case. Terrence Howard also stars as the father of the other missing girl. All three turn in excellent performances, and the supporting cast is also excellent, with convincing performances from Viola Davis, Maria Bello, and Paul Dano. David Dastmalchian is also superb in a minor role.Many of the minor aspects of the film were also done very well. It has been nominated for an Oscar in Cinematography, an honor which it well deserves. The somber late-autumn weather provides a striking backdrop for the story, and the bleakness of the imagery complements the overall tone of the film. In addition, the soundtrack is very effective. Very minimalistic, it largely utilizes only strings (occasionally with a solo cello), at times echoing of Arvo Part's Fratres. It too complements the coldly eerie atmosphere.I very much enjoyed this movie (though perhaps enjoyed is not exactly the right word). It is the first film that I consciously thought while watching, "This might be the best movie I've ever seen". I'm not sure that it is, nor that it is my favorite, but it's close on both counts. It is, however, by no means an easy movie to watch; the brutality will likely be off-putting to some viewers, and the length and pacing will leave unintelligent or uninterested moviegoers bored. If one is prepared to watch it with an active and attentive mind, however, then Prisoners will be a powerful and intellectually intriguing experience.Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, I would have pegged Prisoners as a dull, run-of-the-mill drama. It may take a few minutes to gain momentum, but once it does, this film becomes a rather bleak and gripping descent into a prison of desperation and despair.The overall tone, style, and pacing of the film strikes a perfect balance, much akin to films like Zodiac, Silence of the Lambs, or Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Prisoners is every bit as dark and moody as these films. It also handles the brutal violence with just the right level of skill and effectiveness; it rarely lingers on graphic details, but it is still hard-hitting. The experience overall is mesmerizing and emotionally taut.The story covers familiar ground, for there are plenty of films, books, and TV shows that focus on missing persons and kidnapped children. Prisoners excels at telling this simple story, however, because it emphasizes the emotional despair of the case, and it feels all the more real because of it. In spite of that, it maintains a perfect level of pathos, allowing the audience to connect to the characters and really feel for them (including both the parents of the victims, who go to any length to find their children, and the cops, who want to do their jobs but inevitably clash with the parents). The conflict shifts in some surprising directions, and it becomes apparent that the real prisoners of this story are not necessarily the kidnapped victims. After a number of twists and turns, it all leads to a starkly bittersweet ending.This film uses some simple, but highly effective, photography and editing. Lighting can be very dark and drab, lending the film a perfect look and style to accentuate the tone. Acting is what really propels this film above-and-beyond though, thanks to a surprisingly emotional and nuanced performance by Hugh Jackman, and an earnest portrayal from Jake Gyllenhaal. Everybody else pulls their weight really well. Writing is good. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is appropriate as well.Prisoners is a dark and bleak mystery thriller that mesmerizes and hits hard, on a level not too far off from Zodiac or Silence of the Lambs. If you enjoy these types of thrillers, then this film is a must-see.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not expecting anything particularly impressive when I went to see this thriller. However, the dark and tormented nature of this movie and the characters within it had me attentive throughout the whole two and a half hours. The movie was very successful in building scenes of tension and keeping the story flowing. Hugh Jackman and Paul Dano's acting performances were perfect for this movie and I found myself feeling their emotions and their pain. The plot twists admittedly were slightly predictable and were not why I would rate this movie 10 stars. However the Gothic elements and acting made this movie memorable and thoroughly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Prisoners" is free from errors! Great thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not going to write too many sentences on "Prisoners", so therefore I will set you free with not too many "punalties" on my behalf. However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Keller goes all "cray cray" in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real "loco" in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though "Prisoners" sometimes got locked up with some clichés. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of "Prisoners" was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' "arrested development" of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for "Prisoners" after all; I guess that was a "hard cell" for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent "Prisoners". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WOW! What a thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Holy Wow! "Prisoners" is an unbelievable movie! To call the mystery in the film's story griping, attention-holding and pulse raising is to sell it lightly because this movie grabbed me by the jugular and didn't let go until it was over. The way the film just offered up only small bits of the answer to its mystery made me pay attention even more because I didn't want to miss a thing or a potential clue to the end. Add in the fact that there was tremendous performances from literally every actor and actress that was in the cast and you have a formula for a movie that didn't disappoint me in the entertainment department.The only real downside is the fact I don't think there's much replay value in the movie because I don't think the impact the ending and story had on me will be the same as it was during the first time around. However,that doesn't change the fact the film is amazing! Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever film I am currently watching.

		<fullReview>Although a little more development in a few areas and a little less in others might have helped, PRISONERS will probably keep you watching and keep you guessing. Just an ultra-realistic, riveting film that will not end up exactly as you think it will. Nice use of subtle clues in the random bits of dialogue, written notes, and newspaper flashes.A number of sociological and religious themes can be delved from PRISONERS: How the families, police, perpetrators, and community-at-large are all made "prisoners" by this event; the dangers of preconceived notions about who, why, and how the crime was committed, etc. At the same time, it doesn't just bombard us with deep ulterior meanings, and those who prefer to watch it as a simple "thriller" may easily do so. Really fine all-around acting: Jake Gyllenhaal and Melissa Leo give especially commendable performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. Amen." - Reinhold NiebuhrDennis Villeneuve directs "Prisoners". The film opens on Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a tough survivalist who recounts the Lord's prayer whilst hunting for deer. "Your kingdom come, your will be done," he murmurs, before watching as a bullet kills his prey.Villeneuve quickly sketches Dover as a conservative Christian, survivalist, carpenter and master of his own fate. Dover hates relinquishing control, hates waiting and, more importantly, likes to take matters into his own hands. Villeneuve then clashes Dover's obstinacy with the song "Man from Galilee", a Christian hymn about a man with "sightless eyes" who doesn't "trust in God", who refuses to wait for God's "will to be done", and who refuses to "cry for help". Dover's first name, Keller, itself recalls Helen Keller, famously deaf and blind. Dover will eventually be revealed to be similarly deaf and blind. Early in "Prisoners", Dover's daughter Anna is abducted. Joy, his neighbour's daughter, is similarly missing. Both are the victims of Holly (Melissa Leo), a serial killers who has abducted over sixteen kids. Why? After the death of her son, Holly came to blame Christ for ruining her life. Wishing to spread misery, she thus kidnaps, drugs and kills the kids of devout believers. She aims to instigate existential crises and a total disbelief in God. Dover, of course, believes in God wholeheartedly, but doesn't ACT as though he does. Developing this theme is a subplot in which Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the detective tasked with finding the two missing girls. Trusting his own private hands and his own narrow perspective, Dover refuses to have faith in Loki. Significantly, Loki is named after the Norse God of mischief and chaos, and has crucifixes tattooed to his knuckles. He's perhaps emblematic of a "higher", "mysterious" order, and perhaps also a natural "disorder", which the blustery, knuckle-headed Dover refuses to rely or call upon. "Prisoners" ends with several revelations. A man found dead under the basement of a priest is revealed to be Holly's husband, a pair of young suspects (Bob Taylor and Alex Jones) are revealed to be victims of Holly, and references to mazes prove to be allusions to methods used by Holly to psychologically torture her victims. More importantly, it is revealed that had Loki or Dover done absolutely nothing throughout the film, Joy would have escaped and revealed the identity of her kidnappers anyway. Whether this is "God's plan" or "sheer coincidence" is left up to the viewer, though the film does suggest that it views Dover's neighbours, the Birches (steadfast like hardwood birch?), as "true Christians". Joy escapes, in a sense, because her parents are unwavering in their faith. Alternatively, Joy's escape represents a sense of randomness or sheer capriciousness which the militant Dover refuses to acknowledge.Regardless, Villeneuve packs his film with odd bits of symbolism. Loki's constant blinking, for example, echoes the blinking flashlight which illuminates a priest's cellar and also Dover's sputtering flashlight, which reveals both a "cellar" and the "rape whistle" he once gave daughter Anna. Elsewhere both Holly's husband (also a serial killer) and Dover find themselves trapped underground and judged for their sins, but only Dover repents and escapes; he symbolically blows an emergency whistle, crying for help and so finally relinquishing control to a higher authority. "Prisoners" is handsomely directed by Dennis Villeneuve. The film is immaculately lit, beautifully framed, engrossing, but also unintentionally silly in places (Why would Holly let two of her victims roam free?). The film's middle act contains an extended sequence in which Dover captures and tortures a young man whom he believes to be his daughter's kidnapper, a subplot about belief which is too quickly dropped and which never convincingly seeps into or impacts the rest of the film's drama.Interestingly, without this subplot, the film's philosophical point would have been exposed as a sham: Dover is absolutely right to do anything he can to find Anna, we only chastise him because he descends into criminality. In most situations, it is silly to bow in the face of a supposed "higher power", be it God or indeterminism. The film preaches passivity, inaction and faith (in God or destiny), a stance which relies upon a very specific straw-man: the belief that the opposite is irrational, dangerous or immoral.Beyond this, the film's aesthetic recalls "Seven" and Joon-ho Bong's "Memories of Murder". It's themes recall "The Pledge", Dumont's "Humanite" and "X-Files: I Want To Believe", all more substantial crime films which touch upon similar themes. It's climax resembles "Spoorloos", also with burials and daughters kidnapped. As comparison, see "The Next Three Days" and "The Limits of Controll", the former about a man who successfully wrestles control away from "God". 7.5/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an amazing, tense thriller that is so real that you can't look away for one moment. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you like kidnapping films, you should definitely give this one a try. The acting was incredibly powerful and I'm shocked that it didn't get nominated for any Golden Globes...it is quite disturbing in some scenes that some will find hard to watch, but nothing over the top happens. The acting, direction, original score, and cinematography were all outstanding. They all contributed to making it mesmerizing and I think that is why it deserves a 10/10 and at least some Oscar nominations. Things about Prisoners that the majority of the public would maybe turn away from: Run. time - 153 minutes; Brutal and disturbing; slow-moving; strong language. If you can look beyond all of that, though, you won't be let down.</fullReview>

This begins with prepared man, Keller Dover (Jackman) and his family having Thanksgiving dinner with friends, Franklin (Howard) and Nancy Birch (Davis) plus their children. Soon, Keller and Franklin's daughters turn up missing after they decide to go play. Gyllenhaal plays police detective, Loki who catches a suspect, Alex Jones (Dano) who ends up getting released due to lack of evidence. Keller decides to take justice in his own hands while Loki is determined to solve the case. Bello plays Keller's wife, Grace and Leo plays Alex's aunt, Holly. This is a good, dramatic thriller and Jackman &amp; the cast are great in it. I recommend this.</fullReview>

I found his performance (everyone's) to be so incredibly human. No one did as we would normally expect them to do. Like a sudden change of heart, or in their morals.

		<shortDescription>A Tour de Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's "Prisoners" is a tour de force. The film is languid, every moment exuding suspense enough to make you forget to breathe. And this is no journey for the mouth-breathers or the impatient, for it is to be savored slowly, and it demands utter surrender and rapt attention.The film lacks any superfluous elements and centers around a few pivotal characters. Hugh Jackman is masterful in his role, Jake Gyllenhall does enough to be convincing and the rest of the cast do their bit admirably. The film is shot beautifully with the camera always roving a' la Robert Altman and some shots are really worthy of a Terrence Mallick comparison."Prisoners" is ultimately neither about the plot or the persons. It is a solemn recognition of the easily corruptible human nature which goes to great lengths to justify its means with its ends. An absolute dark horse of a film, and a rewarding experience for the patient viewer. 8/10</fullReview>

On the one hand 'Yes' - it's a damn good film. But, on the other hand, what of subject matter? It's harsh to say the least. I can imagine some of my friends just not able to deal with it.That being said, sod it. Recommend I will. The film darn well warrants that.The most remarkable thing I took from the film is that, irrespective of how dark, foreboding and evil they are, I can sympathise with every single character. Scary but true. The sign of such a well crafted story.Prisoners is a revelation and an indictment on today's society. It is hard to watch but impossible to ignore.Don't ignore it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really awesome movie, besides one thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[ NO SPOILERS YET ] So I just finished watching this movie and I really liked it, the suspense was really high and I was on the edge of my seat for the last 30 minutes of this movie. You really identify with some of the characters (I myself especially with Keller), you really feel their pain. This is something unique in a movie because not only the story has to be superb but the actors need to be amazing too. The ending however is very much not my taste. Recap: 10+ for the story and suspense, -2 for the ending.[ SPOILERS ] So why just an 8 after the previous words. Well that is because the movie is slightly open ended. Even though it is very clear, for me, that Keller will be found. This isn't shown in the movie, and that really bothers me, because even though the end is obvious it doesn't give you the closure a movie with a closed ending gives you. I REALLY dislike that. If the movie had shown Keller being reunited with his family before going to jail at the end, my rating would have easily been a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a rewatch confirmed that it covered many more bases than I originally thought. One of the years best, no doubt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the way the film doesn't beat-around-the-bush in the set-up. The "disappearance" comes in the first ten minutes of the film.Loads of other strengths here.The production overall is excellent. The acting across the board is fantastic. Each character has depth. I love the way the film explores the mental and physical anguish of not just the parents, but the police officer and the accused.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is a steady force in this film. We'd like to know a bit more about his background as viewers, but it's nice to see a police officer portrayed with such dignity.That said, "Prisoners" stand-out performance is delivered by Hugh Jackman. I'd go as far as to say it's the best performance of his career.All of the plot-nit-pickers on other reviews are obtuse... I watched the film a second time to see how the film covered it's bases, and literally everything was covered. There's nothing to nit-pick. Even the character consistencies are accurate. ANd after the re-view I'm tempted to up this to 9.LATE EDIT - I have now up'd this to 86/100 - in hind-site the film covers practically EVERY base... amazingly.Very tense film. Has a lot of moral questions to ask about victims AND police officers. The climax where Jake G is speeding in the rain is perhaps the most intense scene I've seen in years. It's incredibly well-shot. IMO the definitive moment of the film - when director and cinematographer take the build-up of the previous two hours and work it into an amazing crescendo. An absolutely AMAZING scene. The whole film paces, but the last 25 minutes is by far the best. Questions I had about Joy's escape, Alex's involvement, and the ending were clearly answered the second time around - I just missed them. SImple as that - as I suppose others did too.highly recommended. 84/100. The film isn't perfect, but it's very, very good. Not too many good thriller/drama's in 2013.. but this is rt up there with MUD, The East, Place Beyond the Pines, and Disconnect as one of the years best.You will like this if you liked:Zodiac(about even), Silence of the Lambs(about even - yea I just said it), or The Lovely Bones(not as good).</fullReview>

You can easily see yourself in the flesh of one of those families. You can see there's no flaw that make you doubt or question everything that happens, every actions the characters take has a reason and it makes exciting to bring shocking "reality" scenes when someone is under pressure.Spoiler content: I also think the end of the movie was really nice. We don't know if Keller Dover would be rescued from the trap. As he took good and bad actions throughout the movie, actions that would split viewers' opinions, then the denouement belongs to the viewers themselves.In my opinion, the only part that should have been more explored was the life of the boys who were tortured, but mistaken as criminals, such as the whole maze thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Prisoners' Holds You Captive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is a working class family man with a loving wife (Maria Bello), teenage son, and six-year-old daughter. On Thanksgiving, while at their friends' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house, Dover's daughter Anna, and her friend, Joy, go out to play. They never come back. After a police search, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests a disturbed man, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), for the kidnapping. After Jones is released with no charges, Dover kidnaps him to get his own answers, using any means necessary before time runs out.Dover isn't a man yielding some unknown fighting skills that he whips out on bad guys to get answers throughout the course of the movie. This isn't that type of film. He's simply a broken, desperate father in search of his daughter. He doesn't sleep, or even really blink, while the circles under his eyes become just as dark as the narrative. "Prisoners" is both parts a gritty detective story and vigilante thriller, and it works on both levels. The performances here, especially Jackman and a chilling Dano, elevate this to one of the better ensembles of the year. The cinematography by Roger Deakins and Director Denis Villeneuve shows a quiet, isolated small-town (constantly drenched in rain since the girls' disappearance) that makes all the unveiling of secrets that much more unnerving.Perhaps "Prisoners" most valuable asset is the question it asks audiences: How far will you go for your family's protection? While Jackman's Dover will go to increasingly violent lengths to find his daughter, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) represents the other side of the moral coin. Birch pleas to him to leave it to the police to investigate the disappearance of their daughters. Are you a better parent if you sit back and wait or take the law into your own hands? While audience members may root for Dover as he carries out his vigilante investigation, they may soon see the kind of toll it can take on a person to commit such violence."Prisoners" is an engrossing mystery that will stay with you days after viewing it. The film isn't built around a "twist" ending; half way through you may know where it is heading, but it doesn't take away from the excitement or tension of watching it all unfold. The moral issues raised in the film about family, religion, and the law, make this more than just an entertainment experience. Once the credits roll, it will make you look at yourself?especially if you have children?in a different light.</fullReview>

We don't know much about Gyllenhaal's character, but who cares, he is still compelling.Protecting your family is taken to the absolute limit in this film. The torture may be off-putting to some, but it is necessary to progress the story.There is a lot of religious imagery in the movie. Crosses, spoken prayer and quotes from Job.

Some people happen to handle things differently. Brich is a person who searches and hopes law enforcement can do what they can. Dover on the other hand takes matters into his own hands. Tracking down a suspect to kidnap and torture him after he is so sure of his involvement. All the while associating with alcoholism, anger, rash judgement. Loki who has solved all of his cases and wants to do everything right and is pressured because what detective wants a cold case hanging over their head? A lot of life deals with good and evil people. People who want to do the right thing. Lives jeopardized by the way one handles themselves or by the actions of someone else. Prisoners is a well crafted mystery. Certainly it has it's suspense and drama. Not a super awesome high end excellent movie. But it is still good as it portrays some of life's events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest crime drama flick I have seen in as long as I can remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you say after watching a movie like Prisoners? What words can describe the intense emotional crisis it instills in you? The moral dilemma it puts you in? The only thing one can blame this movie for is the psychological impact it will have on the viewer while and after watching it. Everything worked perfectly to bring 'Prisoners' to life.I'll start off by acknowledging the brilliance of director of photography Roger Deakins (A.S.C) on this film. Most people don't realize how crucial the cinematography of a film is and how it affects the story. Deakins created the quintessential atmosphere for a movie with such a story as Prisoners, blending it in with its (the movie) cause. The dark stormy weather, the snow cover, the wet roads, the calm ghostly neighborhood etc all these elements came together to enhance the constant feeling of dread you experience. Roger Deakins selected the right lenses and produced the right lighting necessary for the movie's gloomy appearance. I admire director Denis Villeneuve for understanding the importance of the visual aspect of Prisoners and fastidiously focusing a great deal on it. He and Roger worked together to create the atmosphere fit for a crime/drama/thriller, which is the kind you find in pictures like Shutter Island, The woman in Black, The Descent, Silent Hill etc. This should be a paradigm for flicks of these genres. If it had been set on a beautiful sunny day in a noisy neighborhood with Hispanic Chicano music resounding, this would have taken away the tension and Denis understood this clearly. Obviously Villeneuve is also greatly responsible for the visual merit of the movie. Prisoners does not rely on one aspect per se, it is a perfect collabo between those working in front of the camera and those behind it.The story. Obviously the story is the winner here. After Keller Gover (Hugh Jackman)'s daughter and her friend go missing, he realizes the police isn't helping much so he decides to act upon it himself. He does everything in his power to try to find his and Franklin's (Terrance Howard) daughter before they get in any real danger. As time passes and pressure builds, Keller finds himself in a difficult and depressive position in which he is forced to act violently in order to find out the truth about the disappearance of the two girls. His wife Grace (Maria Bello) falls into an emotional abyss and mental disconnection from reality as she copes with the tragic event. Keller is willing to do whatever it takes to save his missing girl, even if it involves acting like a maniac. The story is marvelously written by Aaron Guzikoswki whose work I'm definitely looking forward to seeing again. I particularly liked the way it unfolded on a steady pace, in synch with the protagonists' gradually degenerating psyche. The plot is not exactly perfect though, and I can't discuss the imperfections without spoiling it but what I can say is that there are a few plot holes here and there albeit generally harmless.The Acting. With a cast that is only too familiar with Oscar nominations and wins, it is hard not to get inadvertently involved with the characters they portray. Hugh Jackman (Academy &amp; Golden Globe Awards for Les Misérables) gave probably the best performance of his career. The anger, confusion, sadness, depression, frustration..all brilliantly portrayed in such a perfect way that you're sure you would have done the same thing if put in his character's position. Often times we yell at people in the movies for doing the wrong or stupid thing and making dumb decisions but with Jackman, you relate to each word he says and decision he makes. I particularly liked the scene where Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) goes to Keller's house to tell him and his wife about the progress of the search for their daughter. Keller loses control and starts yelling angrily over this one, then apologizes for his aggressive behavior. Jackman nailed that part. But it's still nothing compared to what he delivers throughout the rest of the movie. This will surely remain a memorable performance, and I think I have a new favorite actor after Leonardo Dicaprio. Jake Gyllenhaal (BAFTA award &amp; Academy award nomination for Brokeback Mountain) gave a remarkable performance as well playing the detective in the midst of this maddening case, caught between trying to find the missing girls and making sure the affected family doesn't cross borders and do something irresponsible. We manage to get under his skin and understand the fact that he chooses no sides, all he is doing and is keeping the law and making sure that things are done in accordance with it. Viola Davis (BAFTA, Academy and Golden Globe nomination for The Help) who plays Franklin's wife Nancy also as usual had an outstanding although brief screen presence. Terrence Howard (Academy Award nomination for Hustle &amp; Flow) proved his true acting abilities and I'm sure he surprised many with his role as Franklin Birch. How painful it was to watch him portray his character. Of course not forgetting Maria Bello (Golden Globe award for The Cooler) who played Keller's devastated wife. All these and the rest of the unmentioned actors' performances were career-high, aside from Wayne Duval who plays dumb captain Richard O'Malley.This genuinely remains one of the few films to have affected me deep down, even though the feeling subsided a few hours later (that makes me sound like a fraud, I know ha ha). But this is not one of those sentimental movies that try too hard to get a tear out of the audience. The story is there, you just deal with your emotions. 8.1/10 is underrating to me, I give it a 9/10 and I swipe away 1 only because of the prodding belief that nothing is perfect. "Prisoners" is recommended for Everyone!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch This Movie !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I were bored on a Saturday night and started searching Apple Movies (Apple TV) for a movie to watch. We chose "Prisoners" and boy am I glad we did. This movie is intense, full of mystery, surprises and complex scenarios. The acting by everyone is top notch ! I'm not sure why this movie didn't get more kudos than it did. Its one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Hugh Jackman is stellar in this movie. A much different role for him vs "Wolverine" but he lives up to the part for sure. As a parent, this movie terrified me, and made me think about how I would feel if my child was / were abducted. Excellent movie. Please see it. You'll be happy you did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners (2013): A Film Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pray for the best, prepare for the worst. This is the philosophy by which Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), a carpenter living in Pennsylvania, lives by. He tells his teenaged son that the most important lesson his father taught him was to be ready for anything, but nothing could have prepared him for what is about to happen.Dover and his wife Grace (Maria Bello) are happily married with a teenaged son and a young daughter. The film opens with them going to eat Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) and their two children of the same age as the Dover's kids. What starts out as a happy feast between the two families transforms into every parent's worst nightmare when the two young daughters ask if they can go to the Dovers' quickly. The children are allowed to leave, but they never return.Alex Jones (Paul Dano), who was driving an RV through the neighborhood around the same time the girls disappeared, is quickly apprehended and labeled the prime suspect. The problem is, Jones has the IQ of a ten-year-old, meaning there is no way he could successfully kidnap the girls and not leave a shred of evidence. So, he is released into the custody of his aunt (Melissa Leo) with orders to not leave the state. It doesn't come as a surprise that the parents, Keller in particular, are less than thrilled about this.Hugh Jackman has delivered some good performances in the past, most notably as the superhero Wolverine, but this is by far the best performance of his career. As the film progresses, Keller slowly becomes the kind of demon that a religious man like him would condemn. Although he is a man that the audience should feel remorse for, his actions throughout the film make you consider losing faith in him, but they also make you think long and hard about what you would do if you were in the same situation as him.At the opposite end of the spectrum is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the lead detective on the case with a perfect arrest record and a determined look in his eyes. Unlike Keller, Loki doesn't have a personal life to speak of. Instead of celebrating Thanksgiving with family and friends, we see him eating his dinner in a diner and having a conversation with his waitress over the signs of the Chinese Zodiac on his placemat.Throughout the film, Keller and Loki butt heads every time they share the screen. Keller is determined to find his daughter by any means necessary. Loki is just as determined, but police scrutiny and his sound methods are leading the case in a direction that Keller doesn't agree with and there is nothing Loki can say or do that will convince him otherwise.The performances in the film are all top notch. Jackman and Gyllenhaal both deliver the best performances of their careers, each worthy of award consideration. Bello, Howard, and Davis don't have as much screen time as you would expect considering they're the parents just as much as Keller is. Dano, who I never really have liked as an actor, gives a great performance, his character's clothing and just the general look on his face make him seem like a total creep. Leo also shines in a small, but pivotal role, and Wayne Duvall also does some fine work as the chief of police that is making Loki follow the evidence instead of his gut. The real stars here, however, are the people behind the camera. Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) had not made an English language film prior to this, but his previous films have displayed his talents from behind the camera and they show again here. Screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) took a generic plot idea and turned it on its side with a script that keeps the audience guessing while incorporating some powerful religious-based overtones to the story. Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is electrifying. And the cinematography is some of the best from the great Roger Deakins, who has ten Academy Award nominations dating back to 1991, it's that good.As good a film as it is, Prisoners is not for everyone. Some of most pivotal scenes involve torture that might make you feel uneasy later on. The two-and-a-half hour running time and the slow pacing make the film drag on at certain points. With a little sharper editing, I think this film would have come out just as good, if not better, with a running time of about 20 minutes shorter, but the problem is that I can't think of any scene that would have been better of if left on the cutting room floor. That is my only issue with this movie, though. You will not forget Prisoners after you see it.FILM GRADE: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense drama-thriller with powerhouse performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 2 and a half hour movie that takes the viewer on an intense viewing experience. Jackman shines in his role of a father who has had his daughter abducted. Gyllenhaall plays a more subdued hotshot detective, and also delivers a very strong performance. It would have been nice to find out more about his character since he doesn't fit the typical mould of a detective with the neck tattoos and tattoos on his fingers. However, that would have detracted the focus of the movie. The constantly rainy and overcast weather also gave it a very depressing atmosphere that worked well with the nature of the plot. Melissa Leo and Paul Dano both impressed in their supporting roles. The use of some camera shots was very memorable with the way the framing. The framing of Paul Dano's character's eye in the shower stands out in terms of framing. The only thing that prevents me from giving this movie a higher score was the script was not as powerful as the directing and acting. In retrospect, I can recall shots and scenes that stand out but not any specific lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Denis Villeneuve shocked us with his masterful 'Incendies' and he does it again with this intensely suspenseful highly polished drama PRISONERS written by Aaron Guzikowski. Though the film is quite long (153 minutes) the tension is sustained making the viewer not so much an observer but a member of this funky little cold town where so much evil happens.The time is the present (the location shooting was Georgia but any small town across the country could well substitute), it is Thanksgiving and two close families are gathered in their neighborhood for the feast; the Dovers ? father Keller (Hugh Jackman, mother Grace (Maria Bello), daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and the Birches ? father Franklin (Terrence Howard), mother Nancy (Viola Davis), daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Joy and Anna disappear and panic strikes. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) arrests its driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Keller Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. His methods involve capturing and torturing Alex with Franklin's help, but neither is sure of the outcome of their interrogation. Twists and turns occur involving a drunken sicko priest (Len Cariou) and the aunt/mother of Alex (Melissa Leo) ? both leading to very surprising endings.The cast is as first rate as they come. Everyone is strong by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are brilliant. Viola Davis, Melissa Leo, and Maria Bello involve with their usual excellent acting abilities. But in the end credit must go to director Denis Villeneuve for his superb sculpting of this terrifying film. Highly recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gyllenhaal steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One more Hollywood recruiter of foreign talents, Canadian Villeneuve (from INCENDIES 2010) submits his Tinseltown debut with a dark drama about a child abduction, congregated by a swathe of bankable thespians and a virtuoso DP Roger Deakins, it was a considerable success both in box office and among critics, although its Oscar prospect will not likely pan out. PRISONERS conventionally chronicles the appalling case with thorough stoicism to supply enormous stretches to the key performers, Jackson and Gyllenhaal are the two leading players, one is a dogged father believes in his own judgment and is pressured to take extreme measures to fish out information of his missing daughter; another is an idiosyncratic cop has to probe into a sordid scenario while his own backstory remains veiled. Through all these years Gyllenhaal has honed up his screen personality substantially and his quirky foibles (the compulsive blinking here) make him more human while Jackman is a tad over-the-top with a more straightforward character development. Bello, as the flip side of Jackson, her post-trauma symptom is being fully destroyed, cannot function anymore, a devastating mother is a piece of cake for her; Howard and Davis pair stand for a more neutral ethnic line here, which one can relate to oneself under the context, but their shortcomings are as glaring as they are ubiquitous. Dano, who takes us aback with another ambivalent career-turn, his make-up in the torture scenes is too surreal for general viewers, theoretically we should feel sympathetic for him, but somehow he manages to diminish this feeling with his look of opaqueness, is he a real retarded victim or a lackey enjoys the gore? It is a moot point where lingers great aftertaste. We cannot leave Melissa Leo behind here since she is the hidden culprit, her reasons for killing aside, her performance does enhance the story's credibility, and although her downfall is ordained, her encounter with Jackson in the ultimate confrontation is gold and only she can emotionally overpower and cramp Wolverine into his redemption into the darkness. Villeneuve proves wonderfully he is a dab hand can handle challenging projects like this, the whole production team is top-notch, Deakins' camera irradiates specifically in the car sequences near the end, alongside the cutthroat editing, a subdued iridescence can never be more ravishing and what's more praiseworthy is that it thrusts the narrative into its ultimacy with utter urgency and dazzlement. PRISONERS sits comfily into my top 10 year-list, PICTURE, DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTOR (2 spots), SUPPORTING ACTOR and SUPPORTING ACTRESS, for my no-gut-no-glory Oscar prediction, I sincerely hope Deakins can sneak in, alas, even so, he is no chance of winning over GRAVITY (2013, 9/10).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superbly executed detective film. There is a powerful mystery that drives the film from beginning to end. It gets very creepy and tense at times. There are some unforgettable scenes.Although the subject matter is grim, it's not actually on the whole any more disturbing or gruesome than what you see in the trailer, so I would recommend this film to anyone.There's no real weaknesses in the production or the script. At well over 2 hours, it's a testament to the skill of the filmmakers that the audience stays engrossed in the story. Another interesting feature of this film is that it simultaneously gives enough answers/resolution to satisfy the audience, but leaves plenty of ambiguous details which are fun to discuss afterwards.</fullReview>

I personally liked the detective's character. The mysterious Alex Jones(Paul Dano)and also the Runner makes things more complicated.

		<fullReview>I have seen so many movies lately that just seem to disappoint, both big and low budget films. 'Prisoner' is one the best I've seen in a long while.You already know the plot outline from the above, so as an audience member, I just want to assure you that it's well worth your money to see this film.I'm not a huge fan of Hugh or Jake, so I was a little skeptical of whether I'd really enjoy the film for that single reason, but the acting was so strong and convincing, I just saw the characters, very dynamic and memorable performances. I was intrigued by this film right from the opening scene, it definitely had an atmosphere about it, and this was maintained throughout the movie. I'm not a director, and I doubt that any critic could accurately explain the sheer talent and creative processes that go on behind the scenes, to direct a movie like this, so I wouldn't even attempt try and describe the tools he used to manipulate the audience, but i found myself questioning and guessing the whole time, was a great ride.As I said, up there with one of the best suspense/thriller films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How far would you go to protect your family from the hands of culprits who are plague to the society ? As we move into new era, the insecurity to protect your loved ones is rising high, especially with girl child. Prisoners is father's desperate measures to find his kidnapped daughter who goes missing along with her friend into the deep forest of Georgia. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, Prisoners is one of the best movie I have watched in 2013. As the movie begins, you will be immediately let into the crux of the situation and tension will build in each and every frame of the film. The Director succeeds in holding your attention and creating suspense with what-will-happen-next scenes. Hats off to brilliant screenplay which is tight and gripping. Few scenes will give you goose-bumps with an aura of chilling moments. Cinematography is eye-catching along with haunting background score which sets the mood of the film. Hugh Jackman gives his best performance till date as a helpless father trying all odds to save his daughter. Jake Gyllenhaal equally lives up to the expectations with his sheer and powerful performance. Prisoners belongs to the area where quality cinemas are appreciated and loved. Strongly recommended 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mind-Numbing Experience! &#x2666; 86%</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me few minutes of thought to finally realize the implication and the meaning of the title. What would've been a pleasant experience of a crime investigation story about abductors, turned out to be a mind- numbing experience, thanks to the writers for instilling the little details of life values.Jake Gyllenhall is very good as a cop, but Hugh Jackman steals the limelight and proves he's more than meets the eye (Wolverine?). Supporting cast is good and Paul Dano is just terrific with what was given to him. There is nothing new about the story, in itself. But then it evolves into something bigger &amp; thankfully DEEPER, which is the only reason it stands out. Other factors that sweep the experience into a great thing are the refined &amp; genius music, fine cinematography &amp; a brilliant direction. The period attribute is critically thought-upon and serves the main strong-point. How families react when a member disappears is shown on a larger scale.The character study is also a point to be noted while you watch. Certain elements in the film could've be done without because the confuse more than they adhere. Except that I thought the editing could've been more strict, Prisoners is another great experience of the year. Kudos to the crew!BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! The climax is filled both with charisma &amp; ambiguity.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

		<fullReview>Two little girls are kidnapped. An RV is seen nearby. Police begin to investigate, but this is not a simple case. The characters all feel extremely well established and real, such as Gyllenhaals' characters tattoos and eye twitching or Hugh Jackmans' characters religious tendencies and preparation for some kind of disastrous event. The movie is 2 and a half hours long, and I would say it benefits from it. It allows the plot to unfold at a good pace. It never feels rushed. This film will always have you guessing who is behind the kidnappings and how the film will play out, which is a good trait for a thriller/mystery movie. It also wraps the story up fairly well. Overall, it's a memorable thriller film which should be seen if you're a fan of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I seen the preview for Prisoners I knew it would be something that I would really enjoy. To summarize, 2 families kids are abducted and the race to save them before they are found dead or never seen again. Hugh Jackman is the father who goes to extreme measures to find the missing kids. Jake Gyllenhaal is the detective in the film who does what he can to aid the search and find these kids. The acting in the film is really good especially Jackman and J. Gyllenhaal. It's a tense film from beginning to the end. The film is almost 2 hours and 30 minutes which is way past my attention span for a movie but for some odd reason I couldn't stop watching. This could have been a 10 star rating but my main issue was the ending. Not sure if other reviews mentioned it but I do feel they could've brought some closure to the situation as a whole. Besides that one of the best movies I have seen all year. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality film by far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an outstanding movie. One of the most thought provoking films to date since The usual suspects. A man or men lose their daughters during thanksgiving. The only clue to go on was an RV which was parked out front of a building where Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) daughter went missing along with her friend Joy. Now the police are on the case to find the missing girls as soon as possible. Yet within the mix of the case, a lone man who drove the RV is suspect by Dover, and also detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). This man Alex (Paul Dano) however is more than he seemed, for it was learnt later by Dover from his aunt that he too was an abducted person. But for all of his attempts to warn Dover, and others in where to find the girls he is subject to Dover'sown justice with a five day beating spree. Convinced that Alex was the abductor, he used methods only a dark human could come up with. As with Dover's conclusions he came to realize from a few clues of his own and also Joy who was found wandering by herself that Alex's aunt was completely responsible for it all. Now faced with a new dilemma Dover is subject to his own prison under the aunts pavement where she kept the girls. I have to say this movie was well done, lots of twists, turns, pointing fingers, and deceit. This goes to show what and how far a human could actually go to save their family no matter the cost or outcome. The music was top notch, very full of impact. Emotions running high, as well as seeing how low a person can go to fetter their disposition against overwhelming odds. Hugh Jackman played an excellent example of just what length a father will stoop to finding his little girl. Even beating to near death poor Alex who didn't even know it happened at all. I highly recommend this to those over 18. It is gritty, full of dark purposes, and dangerous emotions. What did intrigue me through out the film was the odd man out who sought his own adventure by being a surreal puzzle man, (David Dastmalchian). Someone who thought using tools to makeshift himself as a serial killer. Yet shooting himself was the key to letting me know it was not him. No serial killer does that in the face of infamy. Very well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From an exceptional cast assembled comes a crime thriller of exceptional quality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is a first class crime thriller, this aspect is only secondary. Above all the mystery, clues, twists and red herrings, this movie is anchored in a nerve-wrecking struggle between two personalities, assiduously drawn out throughout the entire movie. But let us take a look first at the brilliant cast assembled, the main attraction drawing me into the cinema in the first place ? the magnificent seven. While convention wisdom has it that winning the Oscar puts ones name in history while mere nominees are all but forgotten almost immediately, I beg to differ. At times, winning it does not really prove anything ? look at John Wayne and I need elaborate no further (he, incidentally, is among my best-liked stars). On the other hand, being nominated means more than what people gives it credit for. I'll review the cast in this context.Huge Jackman, as lead actor of "Les Miserables", got an Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe. Forget about all of his previous screen persona, including Logan-Wolverine. In "Prisoners" you see a Jackman you've never seen before, throbbing with urgency that propels his character into a vortex of violence. Jake Gyllenhaal has just one supporting Oscar nomination, for "Brokeback Mountain" (which earned him a BAFTA), and should have got a lot more over the years. But never mind that. In "Prisoners", similarly, you see a very different Gyllenhaal from the handsome young man you are familiar with. With an atrocious hair style that spells "mid-age" all over, he redefines uncharismatic. Everything his character does is measured, controlled, reasoned. He has been quoted to say that in this movie, his character is the brain while Jackman's is the heart.Viola Davis has two Oscar nominations, for lead in "The help" and support in "Doubt". It verges on being incomprehensible that Maria Bello has to-date not received any Oscar nomination. Her two Golden Globe nominations, similar to Davis's Oscar nominations, were for support and lead respectively, from "The cooler" and "A history of violence". The latter, directed by none other than David Cronenberg, gave her an impressive collection of Best Actress wins in critics' award on various major cities. Terrence Howard was nominated for Best Actor by both Oscar and Golden Globe for "Hustle and flow". It is almost unbelievable that among the seven in this distinguished cast only one has actually won an Oscar, Melissa Leo in "The fighter" which won her the Golden Globe as well. Paul Dano, among today's best choices for nerdy or mentally handicapped roles, was recognized as a promising newcomer in "Little Miss Sunshine" and got a BAFTA support nomination a year later with "There will be blood".Everybody knows that about a whodunit, the less said about the plot and the developments the better. Suffices to say, therefore, that this one is not exceptionally convoluted, and certainly satisfying. And it is almost motherhood to say that a lot of crimes originate from festering, deep-rooted virulence. The most talked about aspect on this movie is not a spoiler, by the mere fact that it is so much talked-about: the moral issue of whether the objective justifies resorting to violence and torturing a crime suspect. Here, we are not talking about professional secret agents and terrorists suspects. We are talking about an everyday citizen driven to extremes by his perception of the police's incompetence in finding and rescuing his kidnapped daughter, while the clock is ticking. At this movie, many may flinch, or more. But the graphic visual has a purpose: to anchor the aforementioned conflict between the two key protagonists ? the emotional father and the reasoning cop.Finally, "Prisoners" is the English language debut of director Denis Villeneuve. For those who have seen is Oscar-nominated "Incendies" (2010), nothing further needs to be said. Those who haven't will not regret going out to but a DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Prisoners' takes none in a disturbing and utterly compelling story of masculine ordeal, religious conviction and exigent moral dilemmas in the face of child abduction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two main protagonists ? played by Jake Gylenhaal and Hugh Jackman ? are two men who see it as a moral imperative, as men, to protect others. 'Prisoners' confidently examines the consequences of their failure to do so when two young girls are abducted; and they are subsequently faced against an adversary they don't quite know how to handle.The screenplay pits a masculine sense of duty to protect one's child against religious, societal and moral forbearance. Then we watch the consequences of this fascinating clash. When blue collar patriot, religious man; and failing carpenter Keller Dover ? played by Hugh Jackman ? has his daughter abducted, this all American alpha father channels his inner Wolverine rage and decides to take the law into his own hands. In an attempt to find his abducted daughter, and her abducted friend, he sets out on a crusade to terrorize information from Paul Dano's mentally challenged character; whom he firmly believes is responsible for the kidnapping.Even though you got the sense that Jackman goes Oscar hunting, the real stand out is Jake Gyllenhaal; in an incredibly understated but subtlety complex performance as Detective Loki; the officer in charge of the case to find the missing girls. This is familiar ground for Gylenhaal, after the likes of 'Zodiac', and 'End of Watch', but he finds new depths and makes this character completely independent from any film has appeared in before. He is by far the most compelling character. Like the way Detective Loki pays attention to the details when trying to solve the mystery, we to, as an audience, have to pay attention to the details. Notice the recurring blinking of his eyes, or the moments of brutality he enforces. There are also brief glimpses of tattoos; that all add depth and mystery to a character with a past only ever curiously alluded to.We are treated to the simple but effective direction of Clint Eastwood and the chilling thrills and revelations of David Fincher. Canadian Denis Villeneuve ? in his American debut ? is a director prepared to use a tripod, and rely on the simple grace of the close-up and all the drama it brings. Roger Deakins gives the film a burdening sense of dread through his atmospherically beautiful cinematography; that lends itself fittingly to a dark story about the loss of innocence. He is truly one of the best DP's working today.The snow and ice of North America is used an awful lot as a backdrop for murder mystery thrillers; but it is a genre trope I embrace. It never fails to highlight the ice cold brutality of the story. Almost as if there were some correlation between our unrelenting natural world, and the killers/abductors that dwell in it.And 'Prisoners' is as cold as it gets. This is a dark and violent story. If that puts you off, it should be known that the violence never feels pointless, or exploitative, and it is handled in good taste to perfectly serve the story. A well played reveal of the physical abuse that a victim of torture receives is now ingrained in my mind.'Zodiac', 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', 'Mystic River' and the recent 'The Frozen Ground' are all similar genre films; and 'Prisoners' is up there with the best of them. It's slow burning; playing for over 150 minutes. But only by taking its time, are we allowed to immerse ourselves and get invested in the investigation and characters. It's not a perfect movie by any means; but a great one? sure. It's one of the best mystery thrillers I can remember seeing over the last few years.You might get lost in this maze of a movie; but you have to play detective to keep up. Deduce all you want, but this was a mystery I could not solve; and the grand revelation I really did not see coming. I can appreciate a movie that manages to successfully manipulate me into thinking that the answer is in that chest, when in fact it was another. We twist and turn through a morally complex abyss, full of religious symbolism, engaging characters; mystery and shock value.Go to hughesreviews.co.uk for the full article and many more reviews!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil is everywhere...even in ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people are comparing PRISONERS, the new dramatic thriller starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I don't really see that, not only because the two movies are quite different, but because PRISONERS is a much better film than the generally overrated SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.PRISONERS is the story of a man obsessed with finding his missing daughter. Apparently kidnapped along with another young girl on a rainy Thanksgiving Day (and isn't Thanksgiving the most depressing of all holidays anyway?), little Ana seems to be gone without a trace. The only clue to her whereabouts is the description of a strange RV the girls were playing on shortly before their absence. But when the owner of the RV is found, there is no trace of the girls, no sign they were even in his vehicle. The police, represented by Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), can't find any justification to charge the man, so they let him go. But Ana's distraught father, Keller (Jackman) knows better. And if the police won't do what's necessary to find his daughter, then Keller is more than willing to take matters into his own hands.PRISONERS is an absolutely stunning film. Visually, everything is starkly understated and dreary, much like the plot. The drama is heavy and morose, which is only appropriate given the subject matter. The script delves deep into the minds of people who have lost their children and are struggling with the unbearable burden of that loss, but it also shows us what the police who are charged with solving the most heinous of all crimes have to go through. Keller is the heart and soul of the film, and we feel his pain, rage, and frustration simmering throughout the whole movie. Keller is painstakingly detailed as a good man, a fine husband and father and devout Christian, and so the questionable moral choices he makes later take on the added weight of believable pathos.Detective Loki is likewise presented as a determined, essentially noble and sympathetic cop who is nearly as obsessed with finding Ana as her father is, though unlike Keller he understands procedure and desperately wants Keller to leave things alone so the police can do their job. Without question, each role shows Jackman and Gyllenhaal at their best, and both actors certainly deliver the finest performances of their excellent careers.PRISONERS is full of twists and turns and unexpected plot revolutions that at times threaten to devour one another in their labyrinthine dungeons, and so it is almost amazing that in the end everything comes together so logically and satisfactorily. Though a great thriller, PRISONERS is even more than that. It's a movie about the moral choices we make and the line between right and wrong, and where those choices may lead us. In short, PRISONERS is a new classic of suspense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding tension allows plot holes to be overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My nails were stubs at the end of this film. Sitting in my seat as the credits rolled and the adrenaline coursed through my veins I took a minute to marvel at the sheer power of escapism when executed properly. Not since David Fincher's 'Seven' has a director been able to elevate tension from the get go and hold it so consistently for the duration of the film. As other reviewers have mentioned, the film is not without a few inconsistencies and coincidences in plot. However, the spellbinding effect Villeneuve masterfully weaves over the audience manages to push that all aside until the post-film reflection commences. Character-wise Hugh Jackman puts in a gripping performance as Keller Dover; an ostensibly freelance carpenter whose daughter is one of the initial kidnapping victims. A hot-headed character from the get-go, we experience his anguish, moral degradation and desperation as he searches for his daughter. I thought that Jake Gyllenhal's performance was spot-on in the role of a clever small town detective trying to live up to his flawless record. His actions were plausible and never seemed overdone. The high point of the film for me was Paul Dano, who continues to showcase his versatile acting talents in the role of a deeply disturbed and mentally handicapped young man suspected of the central kidnappings on which the film is based. This is the sole Denis Villeneuve film I've watched to date but it has certainly piqued my interest in his other works. In addition to the standard thriller camera angles, we were treated to some rather exceptional camera work that played a large part in maintaining the suspenseful atmosphere of the film. Shots such as Paul Dano's single illuminated eye showed insight into the workings of the human imagination and how fear is evoked. Unfortunately not every aspect of the film is perfect. As I walked out of the theater and my pulse returned to normal I began noticing certain inconsistencies and implausibilities that appear throughout the film which may or may not (depending on the viewer) detract from the overall experience. As this ground has been covered in numerous other reviews I won't delve into details but the bottom line is that the degree in which these flaws affect your movie experience will vary somewhat depending on your mindset and approach to the film.All in all Prisoners certainly provided an exhilarating experience at the cinema that completely warrants the price of admission. Despite some minor plot mishaps and loose ends we are presented with a thoroughly enjoyable kidnapping thriller that, as the girl in the row behind me exclaimed upon exiting the theater, may take a few years off your life if you aren't careful. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definite contender for best thriller of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if he already worked for over 20 years before that, director Denis Villeneuve rose to fame considerably after giving audiences his 2010 film "Incendies", a nominee for the Best Foreign Language Oscar. With "prisoners" he directed his very first English-language movie. Two young girls disappear and the film centers on the father (Jackman) of one of them and the cop (Gyllenhaal) investigating what might have happened to them. Jackman, who already gave one of my favorite performances last year with his impressive turn as Jean Valjean, delivers again as a father who does what needs to be done to save his daughter's life and Gyllenhaal, who I've never been that big of a fan, impressed me as well. His portrayal of a loner, in his profession as well as his private life, gave me the chills occasionally and proves that he can pull off characters that go far beyond the pretty boy / nice guy image.Mostly thanks to its two leads and very atmospheric images and music, this film turned out a success and kept me on the edge of the seat for almost all of its very long 2.5 hours. It gets slightly worse when the secret behind the disappearances gets uncovered, just because most of the quiet tension vanishes and more action ensues, but it's still pretty decent. The invisible danger is far more effective than the danger from Melissa Leo when she gets exposed as the grandma from hell. She and the whole supporting cast does a decent job overall and Dano (especially), Leo, Davis and Howard did a fine job with what they were given and all have at least one scene where they can shine and command the screen. The only one who kinda left men unimpressed was Maria Bello. Once again. Guess I'm just not a great fan of her. Besides that, there were certain flaws here and there, such as the whole maze reference or the introduction of the husband to Leo's character, but looking at the whole picture, those were really just minor factors that can't remotely hurt the overall perception. This film is definitely worth a watch. Recommended, especially if you liked Eastwood's "Mystic River" and the ending scene is equally brilliant here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the years best with Oscar worthy performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his English language debut French/Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (maker of the under-seen and highly recommended Incendies) has crafted a dread laden, beautifully made thriller that shows his now Hollywood counterparts a thing or to about how to create a white knuckle believable tale of crime, loss, love and how far parental instincts will go to protect those they love. Without a doubt Prisoners is one of this year's most fully formed, well-acted and involving movies.The tale Prisoners tells is one that deserves to be kept to a pre-knowledge minimal, all that needs to be known is Jackman's Keller will stop at nothing to find his missing daughter going as far to kidnap the man he believes knows about her whereabouts in the form of the ever great and creepy Paul Dano as mentally handicapped Alex. This particular action is counteracted with Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, a man who has never not solved a case and runs into increasingly scary and mysterious possibilities of what may have happened to the girls and who may have done it. The story written by Aaron Guzikowski is a tight and taut example of how to play out an investigation procedural movie and by the films end you feel well and truly like you yourself have endured as much as the characters themselves.Prisoners would not be half the story it is on final presentation without the absolutely top tier Oscar worthy work of its main players, with particular praise going to both Jackman and Gyllenhaal who perhaps arguably give career best turns here. Never before on screen has Jackman seemed so dangerous and volatile (yes even more so than his famed mutant) and Gyllenhaal aces his role as Loki, a loner with clear OCD mannerisms but a detective you would want working on your case. Other aspects that make Prisoners such a pleasure is Villeneuve's stout direction, Johaan Johannsson's hauntingly constructed and well used score and I was wondering why the film was just so darn beautiful when it shouldn't of been then I read during the credits cinematography great Roger Deakins was at the helm therefore giving Prisoners an aesthetic that is again one of the year's best.With so many films this year disappointing and missing the mark ever so slightly it's a breath of fresh air to witness a film as complete as Prisoners is. While not an enjoyable experience perse due to its unquestionable bleak tone and subject matter it is a must see movie event and (in my opinion the following is high praise indeed) ? the best movie of its type since Zodiac, a film it mirrors in many ways and a film in which it can sit proudly equal to.4 and a half red whistles out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoves you into a bottomless pit of despair and forces you to question your morals.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>speechless. That's how I'm rendered after watching Prisoners. Let me explain first that this film is the complete opposite of feel-good cinema, and I do not recommend it to everyone. You are placed at the epicenter of one of the more sickening stories in recent memory and are forced to question your morality, your ethics, and far you would go past them for you loved ones. Prisoners is unsettling, unnerving, squirm-inducing and twisty. Its script keeps you in a quantum state of uncertainty, with suspense that intensifies like the breath-squeezing embrace of a boa. The sobering cinematography and low-key directing add to this effect and make Prisoners brilliantly atmospheric. It's been a long time since I've felt so suffocated with intimidation.Prisoners gets 4.5 stars and not the magical 5. This is due to the lack of a proper score. The silence works well most of the time and in some scenes works perfectly. However, Prisoners is hard hitting and intense, and a more powerful score would have made the stronger scenes feel much more hair-raising. I know that sounds like nit-picking, but a 5 star movie needs to be damn perfect in every aspect.No matter. Prisoners is an all-consuming challenge that requires your strictest attention. The acting from its ensemble cast is stellar, particularly from Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko). Prisoners is a hard film to sit through, but has an addictive cocktail of ambiguity, suspense, and moral complexity. And like it or not, it drags you by the scruff of the neck to a nerve-wracking and jaw- dropping conclusion. Prisoners is good. No, it's better than good. It's brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't lie: I'm a huge fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and have been for a number of years. I've never seen a movie of his I didn't like. And, while I do like Hugh Jackman (and I do think he's a great actor), he's never been one of my favourites. That being said, I did enjoy Prisoners?a lot. The movie was gritty, intense and emotionally involved. Jake has definitely found his niche with the law-enforcement-themed films. Prisoners is about child abductions and the effects it has on the families involved and those who take on the case. It is a realistic approach on that matter (much like Jake's other film, End of Watch). You have two families ((Dovers' (father played by Hugh Jackman) and the Birches (father played by Terrance Howard))) getting together for Thanksgiving, when things take a turn for the worse when their youngest children get abducted. Then you have the investigator (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who isn't really a rookie for investigations, but a rookie when it comes to dealing with child abduction cases. And it takes its toll on him. He gets emotionally invested, which is something they (investigators) try their hardest not to do. (SPOILERS START)Then you have Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) who ends up abducting the person they think is responsible, Alex Jones (Paul Dano). He ends up torturing him, trying to get information from him, despite Alex being mentally handicapped. Franklin Birch (Terrance Howard) steps in and, while he thinks it's morally wrong, is so desperate to find his daughter, he goes along with it. He does fight between what is right and wrong and even tells his wife (Viola Davis) about it, but she's on Keller's side. Meanwhile, Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is losing it to the case. He's having breakdowns and is desperate to find the girls. (SPOILERS END)Honestly, I think this is some of the best performances by these actors. I never saw Terrance as a serious actor before this, but after this film, my opinion is changing. Hugh Jackman's always been able to do serious roles and he really is great in this - probably one of his best performances. Jake, however, while I do feel this is another amazing and in intense performance, nothing will ever top End of Watch for me. This is a runner-up, though. His performance is flawless and he does show the reality these types of cases has on investigators.(SPOILERS START)One thing I did joke about with my mum afterwards, though, was that End of Watch ended with Zavala (Michael Pena) dying and Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) being forced to live with his best friend and partner being dead. This felt somewhat like a continuation on that. Like Taylor decided to quit the LAPD, move to a smaller department, but keep going and train up to be an investigator, despite being without his partner. So things got to him easier. (SPOILERS END)This film is insanely amazing. It's real, it's dark, it's gritty and it's one you have to be emotionally prepared to handle. Even if you're not, still see it. It's a great movie with intense scenes and it's the most realistic performances from Hugh and Terrance that I'd never thought I'd see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Lords Prayer opens the film as Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) an extremely religious man and his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) stalk a deer that will soon be their Thanksgiving dinner. Prisoners takes on religious undertones, without forcing any biblical views on the audience. It simply shows, religious or not, how any human is capable of having a dark side. Thanksgiving Day, the Dover's (Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Dylan Minnette, and Erin Gerasimovich) and the Birches (Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Zoe Borde, and Kyla Drew Simmons) eat their nicely prepared meal, in their cozy home, cuddled up in the suburbs. After dinner both of the young daughters Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) decide to go play outside. After a few hours, the parents begin their search, with no results, they call 911. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is brought on as lead detective, and his prime suspect is Alex (Paul Dano), a fully grown man, with the intelligence of a ten year old boy. The film has the best cast that I've seen all year. You get Hugh Jackman giving his most impressing role of his career. The intensity that Jackman brings to such a loving family man is nothing short of genius, he hits every major note perfectly. Maria Bello is also quite remarkable as Jackman's grieving wife. Its also nice to see Terrence Howard in a role where he is not a dominant male. Howard is extremely soft spoken in this film, and his vulnerability gets to shine through. Viola Davis hits another one out of the park. I believe you could throw Viola Davis into anything and she would make it better.Jake Gyllenhaal also gives one of his top three performances of his career as the constantly blinking detective that has never had a case go unsolved. At first the blinking was slightly distracting, but after a few scenes, you can see that Gyllenhaal has fully committed to the blink, it becomes just a twitch that the character has developed over his life. Its truly stunning work.Paul Dano gives his most memorable role since There Will Be Blood, which is way more of a show-offy, bombastic type roll than his character of Alex in Prisoners where he is shy, more reserve, and chooses his words carefully. Alex's Aunt is played by Melissa Leo whom along with the rest of the cast, gives an extremely brilliant, breathtaking performance. This is Denis Villeneuve's first American film and let me tell you that its more pleasing then ever. The only flaw with the film, in my opinion, is that it runs about fifteen to twenty minutes too long. But thats just a minor flaw amongst the insanely talented cast, eerie cinematography and a well written screenplay. I give Prisoners a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gut-Wrenching, Emotional, Unpredictable Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.1/5 starsAn edge-of-the-seat thriller in the truest sense of the term. You'll keep guessing right till the end and will never be able to see the shocking plot twists coming. Credit needs to be bestowed upon the Director and script writer. Supplementing their vision to great effect are the superlative skills amply displayed by the editor and cinematographer. What we get is a tense, somber, atmosphere with palpable tension and despair.And finally down to the performances. "Prisoners" boasts of an ensemble cast and boy do they deliver the goods. Viola Davis and Terrence Howard bring a sense of grit and fortitude to the hopelessness they face in their concise roles, while Maria Bello is a picture of grief in her limited screen time. Paul Dano is a past master at playing complex characters and he pulls of yet another winner. Melissa Leo was all but unrecognizable until you realize it was her once the credits start rolling. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a sound and assured performance meriting an Oscar nomination in the supporting category.But it's Hugh Jackman who acts the hell out of his portrayal of a desperate father driven to a frantic edge. It is without question the best performance of his career and so far the performance of the year too. I think the best accolade that can be give to this fine actor is that his act in "Prisoners" literally makes us forget his iconic role of "Wolverine" in the "X-Men" series and spin-offs.Along with being a nail-biting ride from start to finish, "Prisoners" also succeeds in being an emotional roller-coaster and even involves the viewers by making us relate to the moral ambiguity of the protagonists, and the lengths to which they are willing to go to save a loved one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kept me guessing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was rather impressed with this film. It kept me interested all the way to the end with the extra element of mystery, which challenges the viewer to make sense of everything. The acting by all major characters was great particularly Hugh Jackman showing fear and rage at the same time. It's been a while since I seen a film like this.The writers of this film definitely succeeded in creating a story that is cryptic and compelling. At the end I thought back over the film to see how objects, people, and other things were connected to what occurred. I didn't even understand why and how things occurred or were connected which created a lot of discussion afterwards. My partner and I shared our thoughts of what we understood; it took both of us to make sense of it all. Good writing and that correct application of it certain shows when it takes two educated people to understand everything.This film also made me think about justice and what I would do: is the law always correct? Should we take the law into our own hands? Are laws too black and white? Whether intended or not this opens a dialogue about right and wrong, trusting police, and rational thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched various films much like a psychological thriller but nothing has ever come close to this. The prisoner with the talents of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhall keep you on the edge of your seat. The most interesting thing is when you finally get to grips with what is going on you see the plot go the opposite direction. But be warned that this film is very related to reality and the emotions experienced by parents in the most unimaginable darkest hour of ones life. The emotions explored in this film will leave you will a scar that will never be removed I felt as though I was somehow glued to my seat. Hugh Jackman has very much secured himself a Oscar in my eyes and I hope you agree with me to. Jake plays very much out of his comfort zone and it is a wonderful ride. But the cinematography really opened doors don't be fooled by the dark moment in between every scene it is very much worth it. If you have not yet seen this film it is one to keep in mind because it is one that will surely be worth while.</fullReview>

The investigator Jake Gyllenhaal has done great job in the movie and the mannerisms seemed interesting when he was handing stressful situations. Hugh Jackman was able to portray the parents anxiety very well and proved that he could go to any extent to protect his daughter. As parents it was nerve-wrecking for us. The director has done a phenomenal job of keeping the thrill from frame1 till the very end.

		<fullReview>This is going to be a brief review because I really do not want to give away any hints for anybody who is going to go and see this movie.However I will say that this is a simple must see. The acting of all the cast is sublime with stand out performances from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhal (The former showing how far he really can distance himself from being the one dimensional rabid wolverine). The cinematography is simply fantastic and the whole movie is brilliantly captured. The story line has more twists and turns than the rabbit hole Alice fell down, literally keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time. If you are a fan of psychological thrillers and movies that keep you guessing this is undeniably your proverbial cup of tea. Even if you aren't you will find this suspenseful drama utterly compelling. What more can I say? Without a shadow of a doubt go and see what is definitely the movie of the year so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Two wrongs don't make a right' is a common phrase but with Prisoners we may have found an argument against its meaning. It raises the question of what is right and wrong when you are fighting to save a life. This is shown through faith, torture and upbringing with each character's personality questioning these themes. What is right? Who is wrong? And is it right to do wrong?On Thanksgiving the Dover family enjoy dinner at their old friend's house, the Birches. The enjoyment levels are at an all time high, for the only time in the film, until the youngest daughter from each family disappears. The parents begin to search frantically as the cops find the chief suspect in the RV that was parked up the road. This suspect has an IQ of a ten year old and the police believe they should look elsewhere but Keller Dover thinks otherwise and instead chooses his own methods of getting truth from the suspect. Will they find the girls and who will first?Starring Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, Prisoners raises these intriguing issues by pitting the doting father against his daughter's potential kidnapper. As a parent you'd do anything to get those answers and in Dover's case this resorts to torture, imprisonment and fear. In opposition to that we have Jake Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki, an officer who relies on hard police work. These two may be aiming for a shared goal but ultimately they are each other's antagonist as they hunt for truth in very different ways. As an audience member it is up to you to decide which one is right. Villeneuve's direction and Guzikowski's script squeeze the themes to tears by covering each angle and every scene in opposing morality questions. At times these are deep but at others they feel forced, such as a priest who has killed a child killer to prevent him from continuing. This is here to be bleak, depressing and full of moral issues and it doesn't let up from that. Its pace is slow, the music dreary, the cinematography grey and wet, all adding to the tone of Villeneuve's piece. The script at times may feel 'on-the-nose' but it does raise these questions through it. Is it right to kill in order to prevent a killer, even if you are a priest? Added to the bleak tone are exceptional performances from Jackman and Gyllenhaal. Jackman portrays the grieving father with power and emotion leaving you unsure whether to route for him when he tortures the mentally confused suspect played by Paul Dano. At times his character is empathetic but at others he is frightening. This may become a problem if he was the hero to route for but instead during these scenes we promote Gyllenhaal's Loki to the forefront and it is his desperate search for the truth that we believe in. Gyllenhall also provides a wonderful performance as the Detective who suspects everyone until they are proved innocent. Both of these men can be seen as our protagonist but in reality neither of them are and instead the shared goal is what we route for. You may have a character you believe in but that all depends on which side of the fence you come down on.All in all Prisoners is a powerful movie, oozing in contemporary and moral issues. They are all prisoners in some way or another, even those fighting to put things right. At times the script laces these issues to the max, causing a few overly uncomfortable and expositional scenes but the gorgeous cinematography, towering performances and the cold atmosphere will have you leaving the theatre questioning what your move would be if you were ever in this position. This is not for the faint hearted and if you fancy a light popcorn entertainment film than Prisoners certainly isn't it.Rating: 4.5 / 5Directing: Villeneuve keeps the story's pace slow and adds more power from doing so.Acting: Strong performances from all involved with a star turn from Jackman.Script: A taut script that is let down slightly by nailing the themes too neatly.Cinematography: Deakins keeps it grey putting a shiver continually down the audience's spine.Score: Adds to the tone and engages you fully.Editing: Seamless. The slow pace remains constant and works. Overall: A thought provoking story that keeps you gripped throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually felt like I was watching Silence of the Lambs..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...at least it felt that way. Well written and executed film. Terror on a different level. Plot is dripping with irony. Makes me sort of glad I don't have kids....who, by the way, you shouldn't bring to this - in case you might actually have been thinking about it. Sad that we live in a world where this king of sick demented abductions take place. You will likely remember from time to time this is a fictional story and a crime thriller due to the puzzles and implausibilities they throw at you from time to time, but it's pretty engrossing and, although lengthy (like this sentence), it moves quickly. The cold rain so persistent in this film makes you want to take a hot shower and move to Key West, but the allusion is not lost. Enjoy the movie, it's wonderfully acted and will (or should) make you squirm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was really suspenseful and really just on the edge of your seat drama turned suspense movie. As Hugh Jackman plays a father-businessman who goes with wife Maria Bello and two children. They go to their friends, Terrence Howard and Viola Davis. As they also have two kids. Over on Thanksgiving holiday.And as their two daughters best friends go to Jackman's house, they end up disappearing as a RV is spotted. With the daughters playing on it in the beginning of the film. A foul mouthed and volatile detective played by Jake Gyllenhaal investigates the man of the RV, Paul Dano who has the IQ of a ten-year old. As he is forced to let him go.But Jackman decides to take the law into his own hands. And beats up Dano after he kidnaps the guy and demands to know where is his daughter and friend.It is a suspenseful film as it has angst and really what a parent feels like when you lose your child. But also not to take the law into your own hands. Jackman and Gyllenhaal shine really well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller with an engaging moral dilemma.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with many foreign language directors who impress the world with a film from their native land, they then move on to work in Hollywood. Success is no guarantee but it's at least a mainstream opportunity. I haven't seen Denis Villeneuve's Incendies just yet, though it's definitely on my list, but it must have been really good to grant him not only one film but two, with this years Prisoners and next years Enemy, both starring Jake Gyllenhaal. On that note, Zodiac comparisons are the first to come to mind. Not only is it a dreary world, reliably shot by Roger Deakins, but they share similar pace and structure in its very procedural method of plot delivery. Unfortunately, and again similarly, the pace is too slow. Everything it does could have been squeezed into two hours rather than two and a half. The problem is down to the editing. Its rhythm is constantly the same, feeling like it's always building and never paying off. Scenes cut away far too early and it then it jumps along the plot. Sure, I'm sure the consequences are implied, but there's the desperate need to see them. It's frustrating and impossible to feel immersed.Otherwise, I still like the plot and Hugh Jackman in particular is absolutely terrific. He's one of the most passionate actors around today and I wish he would get more high class material. Paul Dano is thoroughly great in a complex role and Viola Davis' big scene is heartbreaking. However, it's Gyllenhaal who lets the film down. Perhaps it's in the writing, but he fails to bring a human character to the table. His Detective Loki is a poor attempt at developing a three- dimensional character. He's full of contradictions. The cop who goes by his heart, by the book, by his gut. Best cop, worst cop. People person, loner. Usually contradictions bring out true character, but his lack of characterisation and conviction results in a terribly inconsistent performance. It's a shame, especially as he's getting a lot of acclaim, but I'm certainly less excited for Enemy now. He's not the only bad one of the bunch as Melissa Leo is having too much fun to be convincing. Prisoners is still a good film with a compelling moral dilemma behind it in how far a person will go for justice, that aspect is emotionally engaging. But its muddied waters doesn't help that come through.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"There's no way someone with the I.Q. of a 10 year old boy could abduct 2 girls in broad daylight and then somehow disappear." While at Thanksgiving at their friends house Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter asks if her and her friend can run home and get a whistle. When they never return Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is called in and the search for the girls begins. When Keller thinks the police aren't doing enough he takes matters into his own hands and won't stop until his daughter is found. Based on the cast alone I was excited about seeing this. There are some movies you watch and laugh all the way through and come out feeling happy. There are some movies you watch all the time to relax you and have fun with. This is not one of those movies. While this is one of the best movies of the year and I honestly think Oscar nominations are not a long shot this movie leaves you feeling tense and uneasy the entire time. The fact that there is very little music helps create the tension it is going for. While this is a great movie and a must see this isn't one you can watch over and over due to the emotion and the way it makes you feel, especially if you are a parent. I highly recommend this but do not expect anything light and fun. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and one that sticks with you long after its over. I give it an A.</fullReview>

I am sure everyone who watched it was like, it is too long and it could have been done in 90 minutes or so, but to me... I found that the puzzles in the film and the hidden parts that we don't see are amazingly delivered to us and in the end I felt like the movie did not show me what i need to see but I know what happened and it made me feel awesome. The plot and the twists in the movie are impressive, and the fair ending was satisfying. Jackman and Gylenhaal were just perfect for the film, Melissa Leo as always was very impressive... I wanted to see more of Bello's appearances in the movie, but she was OK too... and Terrance Howard and Viola Davis were such a perfect and real match. Paul Dano as always, stands out and he was great. The movie is Oscar movie so if at least one of the actors should be nominated. I loved the movie a lot and the whole mood of it... I personally missed to see such things on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, prompts inner rage &amp; questions one's scruples.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for Prisoners is yet another example of Hollywood giving far too much away. Usually it implies a poor film with the funniest/most shocking moments spliced together because the distributors know the film is substandard and are terrified the film will bomb. So why on earth did they feel the need to give away so much in the Prisoners trailer? Prisoners is just a few plot holes away from being a ten star film. It is enthralling, shocking, exciting, it tugs heartstrings, it prompts inner rage, it questions one's scruples, it is the cause of much thought and heated discussions. Prisoners is a very fine film indeed and the best thriller we've seen on the big screen for many months. The summer blockbuster period is officially over and cinema just got down and dirty again! Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello) and their children join friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving. After lunch the parents do their thing, the two older children escape to the basement and the two youngest, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) head out to the quiet road to play. When they don't return, abduction is assumed and panic and suspicion set in. The cops are called, headed by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), and the finger is pointed directly at Alex Jones (Paul Dano). When the police release Jones due to a complete lack of evidence, Keller declares him guilty and takes matters into his own hands.Prisoners kicks into full thriller mode from the outset. The tension is ramped up with finely directed early scenes and a subtle score (from Jóhann Jóhannsson). Though it occasionally stutters, the obvious 'jump' in the basement failing miserably (fortunately!), it picks at the nerves for the full two-hour plus running time. It's not a film that makes the viewer leap out of one's skin, but niggles unpleasantly as it ask multiple questions: Is he/isn't he guilty? What happened? What does it mean? Does the end justify the means? How far is too far? What would YOU do to protect your children? Director Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) has cleverly stitched together a film that is often too close to reality for comfort and looks at issues that fill our newspapers. Take the case of Keith Bennett, the Moors Murderers' fourth victim. His body was never recovered and his mother died without being able to bury her son. Given the opportunity, would she have been justified in having a week alone the Myra Hindley and Liam Brady to find the truth of his whereabouts? The ordeal suffered by Christopher Jefferies, vilified and proclaimed guilty by the press and public, simply for looking 'odd', is also too fresh in our minds to be ignored as we watch Jones' suffering. Subtler is the prospect of ambiguity; just as Derek Bentley was hanged for his equivocal cry of "Let him have it!", does the alleged utterance from Jones, "They only cried when I left them." have only one interpretation? The performances throughout Prisoners are from the top drawer, and the actors have been gifted realistically written roles. The four parents have not merely been crafted to satisfy a particular stereotypical reaction, rather we are presented with understandable reactions. In Keller it is a desperate rage at his own impotence to protect his family and Jackman is flawless in his violence and despair. His actions are never acceptable but the way Keller is written and performed allows us to care deeply and consequently I'm sure there are many, many viewers who would turn a blind eye or even outwardly condone his methods.Though Jackman's Keller is the showier role here, Howard gives a very measured performance as the other father who has a firmer grasp of his morals though still floundering at the loss of his daughter. Equally, Bello's Grace is perhaps even easier to identify with as she crumples and enters a voluntary stasis, unable even to shower and change let alone control her emotions. Bello depicts a mother so distraught her ability to function abandons her.Davis is short changed; her Nancy brings a steely decisiveness to the table but she is given too little screen time for us to fully engage with. Gyllenhaal is the solid character in Prisoners that we can look to for balance. We don't really see what makes him tick but that is a plus point here; how many detectives arrive on the scene with the life stories laid out for us? Loki is there to do a job, solve a crime and remain as emotionally detached as possible. It is a creditable performance to add to Gyllenhaal's every-growing list.Unsurprisingly, Dano is excellent as the 'freak' who clearly 'must' be dangerous simply by dint of looking odd and being educationally subnormal. Dano has few peers in Hollywood and has cornered the market in oddball roles and there's a very good reason why: He's superb. Likewise, Melissa Leo as Jones' aunt, Holly, is perfect. Leo is a true chameleon of the screen. Enough said. Just watch her.Post-film, my companion for the evening and I debated heatedly the moral issues and how many parents may stoop to such extreme measures given cause. We agreed to differ though the questions remain. Our agreement was entire regarding the quality of Prisoners as a film, however. I can't mention the flaws without destroying the film but there are unresolved matters, unrealistic scenarios and lazy devices that keep Prisoners short of perfection. But it remains a very powerful film that, if it's intention is to leave the viewer wondering what kind of man/woman they are, succeeds admirably.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners: A dark, disturbing, and twisted film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is definitely by far one of the best crime thrillers of our generation. It is a very dark environment this film takes place in and the atmosphere is one that is cold and shocking. It attacks your core on a personal level by trying to put you in the characters' shoes, would you have done what Keller(Hugh Jackman) did to try and find his daughter, is one of the huge questions director Denis Villeneuve tries to emphasize on you and throughout you contemplate whether or not it was, which is what really got me on this film. The acting by the two leads is superb, by far my favorite Hugh Jackman role, and Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role like he has done it many times. I must say that the rest of the characters didn't really place their importance in this film besides Paul Dano, and I didn't want it to end the way it did. All in all this film was really enjoyable to watch, I'd suggest going to see this in theaters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have been waiting to see Prisoners since I saw the trailers. I do agree with others that for the first time in a long time the trailers do not give everything away. I believe that the acting was top notch, I was disappointed that the black characters had so little to do as Viola Davis and Terrance Howard are great talents. I can usually guess most of where a movie is going and I have to say that I did guess most of this one but that didn't keep me from liking the movie and there were a few things that surprise me (which is very rare). It is a movie that will make you think some and for that its a good movie.It's suppose to be high drama but there were some humorous parts and even with the gravity of the end I found myself laughing at it. I'm not sure if I was suppose to but it was funny, the expression on Det. Loki's face.</fullReview>

Jake Gyllenhaal marked one of his good role in this movie. Throughout the movie, i was on the edge of my seat, never knowing what would happen next. It was good enough to keep me awake from start to the end, not only because of the intense, bloody and suspenseful scenes, but also because the movie made it really hard for the audience to predict the truth about the abduction of the kids. There are of course heartbreaks and shocks throughout this movie, I totally recommend this for parents and people that likes mystery and thriller movies. This movie is probably perfect for parents so they can watch their kids more carefully and know the consequences if they don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be Prepared ... or Seek Vengeance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This film is one of those goldmines for discussion and debate. Each successive scene begs the viewer to judge the actions of those involved, but even beyond that, the movie is screaming to be picked apart by those of us prone to do so. It's actually the best of both worlds for film lovers ... it challenges us on a personal and moral basis, and also as one who analyzes scripts, acting choices, and filmmaking techniques.Having seen the trailer, I was very much aware of the foundation of the film ... two young girls are kidnapped and, frustrated with the lack of progress by the police, one of the dads seeks his own form of justice. So I couldn't help but cringe with the obvious metaphor opening scene where Hugh Jackman's character (Keller Dover) experiences one of those life-bonding moments with his teenage son Ralph (played by Dylan Minnette). Once past that, the set-up is expertly handled ... two middle class families sharing friendship and Thanksgiving dinner. Keller and his wife Holly (Maria Bello) have two kids: Dylan and their young daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimokovich). Their neighborhood friends Franklin and Nancy are played by Terrence Howard and Viola Davis, who have a teenage daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) and young daughter Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons). Perfect families and perfect friends shattered by a horrific ordeal when the young girls go missing. The main suspect is a simplistic man-child who drives a ratty RV. Alex Jones is played by Paul Dano in the most uncompromising manner possible.Enter Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). Loki is an odd bird who never lets a case go unsolved. His quirky personality and facial ticks and buttoned-up shirt provide us with enough backstory that we understand his dogged pursuit and need to work alone. As the story unfolds, we are overwhelmed with an abundance of terrific story lines. In fact, there are so many that we feel downright cheated at all the deadends and dropped-cold sub-plots.As a father, I certainly could relate to Keller's relentless, stop-at-nothing pursuit of the first and only lead. Exactly where would I draw the line for my own actions? I can't answer that other than to say that I totally understood his approach. That's not to say I condone such actions, only that I fully empathize. Holly's reaction to the ordeal is to curl up in bed with meds. That too is understandable. Loki's frustration with his own department and the false leads is also understandable. So while each character's actions make sense, the viewer's frustration is palpable, not just because of these things, but in the mis-use of such fine actors as Mr. Howard, Ms. Davis, and Ms. Leo. Jackman, Gyllenhaal and Dano dominate through much different methods, yet we viewers constantly find ourselves wanting to know more about the teenage kids, the priest played by Len Cariou, and of course, the Howard and Davis characters.The film's message is not vague. It's quite clear, even overly obvious. Keller is a survivalist ... the kind of guy who is prepared for any disaster. No matter how prepared one is, the loss of a child will test your morals, faith and inner-strength. What would you do? How far would you go? Is there a line you won't cross to protect your family? Those questions are much simpler until real life forces you to answer.One thing you will quickly notice is just how stunningly beautiful this film is. The credits provide the answer in Director of Cinematographer Roger Deakins, probably the best in the business. French-Canadian Director Denis Villenueve gave us the exceptional Incendies, and while this one has plenty to offer, I believe some fine-tuning with writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) could have elevated this one to Oscar worthy material. So take your friends and be prepared for post-movie discussion. Everyone will have their own thoughts and opinions. That doesn't make this a great movie, but it serves the purpose of getting us to question our faith and beliefs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! One of the best of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The review: Wow. Difficult to unpack such an emotionally riveting, suspenseful movie that has you on the edge of your seat most of the time. The fall movie season is officially underway, and couldn't be more welcome. After a disappointing summer movie season for the most part, it is easy to tell based on the previews alone before the film that the next few months will bring no lack of great movies. Okay, back to this one. I have been looking forward to this one for a while. Not that I enjoy the situation the main characters will be put into, probably more because it is at times thought provoking to think about what would you do if you were put into a situation, or a revenge or vigilante situation in which you felt the law failed you.The previews for this movie did a great job, because ? through this movie, I still had no idea what was going to happen or who the abductor of the children was. The director does such a great job with building the mystery and the revelations and foreshadowing that it's just not possible to figure it out. There are clues of course but to figure the whole puzzle out, well, it's pretty impossible, and that's part of the reason this movie is so great. It is definitely emotionally taxing. My wife did not want to watch the movie, and with good reason. In the film "Ransom" Mel Gibson is on a manhunt for his child's kidnappers and is in communication with them. The audience also gets glimpses of the child occasionally and knows that while not in an ideal situation, he is okay. In this movie, the audience does not get many revelations. The children are gone, and that's all we know. We don't know how, who, why, or where. It's difficult to explain much more without giving anything way, and I'm not going to do that. While this movie is NOT a feel good movie or a pick me up, it is superb, and for the most part, with the emotional trip.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When two family's daughters go missing on a Thanksgiving party and with the help of the police search to find them. Starring Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard and Viola Davis Prisoners is a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Prisoners really shows why good cinematography can be the difference in a movie hitting or missing and this is a testament to Roger Deakin's skill behind the camera. Which even though we sit through two and half hours the audience rarely feels bored and is always begging for more clues to eventually solve the case. This is also one of those films where there is no villain throughout we see everyone become the bad guy, become the helpless maniac that will stop at nothing to get whatever they want. Throughout you will uncover what really a prisoner means. If you thought Wolverine wasn't angry and ruthless enough in the X-Men films that should be all dispelled as you see the struggle of Jackman (Keller Dover) as he desperately searches to find his daughter.The only thing I would've wanted to see more was of the other characters and how they dealt with the loss of the two children but otherwise the audience couldn't stop but feel challenged by the story displayed. Prisoners is not for the faint hearted though as your morals will seriously be challenged and you may feel guilty inside. This is not one of those films were you go prancing out about how cool it is but it will surely impact you in some way.Rating: A+ Comment: If you don't think Wolverine (Jackman) was ruthless enough in the X-Men films expect that to be dispelled while watching this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best thrillers of recent memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners tells the story of a family broken by the kidnapping of their small daughter along with one of her friends. Unsatisfied with the police actions in the case, the father tries to take matters into his own hands.This is a very tense movie. We follow Keller Dover as he desperately tries to find the truth about what happened to his daughter. Right in the beginning we get a feel that this is a man that does what he needs and doesn't like depending on others, even the government.On the other side, we have Det. Loki, a cop with his own personal problems that is assigned to this case. We see he is actually trying to get things done. I guess it felt nice seeing an investigator that is actually human for a change, and not a Super Deduction Machine. I love Sherlock Holmes as much as the next guy, but sometimes is nice to see a regular one, specially since this is an overused trope. Not that he is stupid or anything, he just feels more real in the way he follows clues and draws his conclusions.Hugh Jackman is in full shape, showing the evolution of his characters desperation as he sees, powerless, his family falling apart. When he decides to act in a certain way, we may not agree with it, or even think he may be making a mistake, but we never doubt his motivations, and his choices feel authentic. Jake Gyllenhaal also does a great job as the detective trying to find the truth, and so we get a nice back and forth between these two characters, as in who should we trust, who should we root for?All of this is sewed together by a great story. Mystery permeates the movie and the developments are made in a way that make you never completely sure about what the truth really is. Thus, even if this movie has a slow pace, with beautiful and calm cinematography, not packed with explosions, you still feel at the edge of your seat.The script here is flawless both as a suspense and a crime story. When you get to the end you feel it in your guts. This is not a movie you will soon forget.A great experience. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterful thriller that is both tense and unnerving, one of the best of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best pieces of dramatic cinema I've seen in a long time, Prisoners is a film that will live on long after the credits roll.The term 'masterpiece' is thrown around with films too liberally, and yet, I use it so rarely that I can't recall the last time I used the word masterpiece to describe a film I watched. Prisoners is a masterpiece.After a jovial holiday feast among neighbors and friends, two families must face certain heartbreak when the two youngest daughters from each home mysteriously go missing. Keller Dover and Franklin Birch, the fathers of each girl, know the fate for missing children and the importance of time in these cases. Frustrated by stagnant police work burdened by red tape and multiple leads, they take matters into their own hands, especially Keller Dover as he grapples with crossing every moralistic line for the sake of his family and child.Prisoners is a dark film, both of subject matter and tone, so much so that I nearly did not watch the film and that would have been a grave misfortune. The mystery of Prisoners is vastly superior to its peers, leaving hints and evidence for the film to come with such sleight of hand that it is only apparent with a second viewing. For a mystery it manages to find the perfect balance of dark and brooding, complementary to the tone of the film, but is completely visually watchable.The passion and connection of these characters is complex, vital to engaging the audience and making them hope, fear, and feel with the characters. Especially notable is Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano who bring depth to potentially one-dimensional characters and emit a humanity that can be found in traces in all of us.While the cast is raw, emotional and magical , the assemblage of talent would be for naught had it not been for the director Denis Villeneuve, writer Aaron Guzikowski and cinematographer Roger Deakins. The work of these three men so seamlessly blends into this fine film that it is difficult to discern where one's efforts ends and the others begins.Prisoners is a master stroke and bold statement for the future drama films that incorporate true crime and mystery.Please check out our website for full reviews of recent releases.</fullReview>

Too bad it didn't get recognized as much as it deserved.The film starts at a Thanksgiving dinner between friends Keller Dover(spectacularly portrayed by Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard, great job as well) and their respective families. They each have 2 children, the youngest of which are mysteriously kidnapped when they go play outside. Both families call the authorities of course and desperately search for their children, Keller's older son mentions an RV who was parked in the street the first time the kids went to play. The police find the man, who is Alex Jones(Paul Dano), a person with the mentality of a 10-year-old. He is interrogated by Detective Loki (brilliant Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant) who begins to think he had nothing to do with the abduction. Keller on the other hand is sure that Alex knows where the kids are, and decides to take matters in his own hands, and ends up doing lots of illegal, horrible and cruel things. The acting in the movie is perfect, no one in the entire movie portrays their character badly, they were really all amazing, with extra extra props to Hugh Jackman, who gives a phenomenal performance, the best I've ever seen from him, he starts off as a good man, but when his daughter is kidnapped he just loses it and descends into darkness so to speak. An ironic thing in the movie (it's on purpose of course) is that he is a very religious man, and when the credits roll he has committed so many sins it's mind-blowing that a guy could go so far, even with the good reason behind his actions. There are some scenes that Jackman just flips his s***, and it's so damn realistic! Oscar worthy is an understatement. Jake Gyllenhaal is incredible in the movie as well, I mean this guy is always brilliant, come on, he also feels so real in the movie, you feel his frustration due to not being able to find the kids, he is pretty much what I expect a real detective to be like and he's the only moral character in the movie. The supporting cast is also great, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, especially Paul Dano, he was incredible.The story is very smart, it's pretty much a puzzle, you don't know what is the truth, you can only speculate using what you were given, it deals with heavy subjects though, so it is not for the faint of heart at all. The director managed to create a incredible dread- filled atmosphere, using the heavy rain and the icy winter, it all contributes to creating the sinister mood of the film, top-notch directing and cinematography. The suspense just keeps piling up until the finale, which is one of the best endings I've seen. The film's question is "how far are you willing to go in order to save your child?", and that's what Dover is doing, and holy nuts does he go far. He does have a good reason, it's true of course, but he ends up doing things that are too unjustifiable, even with the events that drove him to do them. And that makes for a great picture.Prisoners is a very intense film, I found it pretty hard to watch, especially in the heavy scenes, if you're easily shaken, don't watch this film, it's incredible, but it's the kind of film that's despite being great, you don't want to watch again, I mean I was cringing a bit with clenched fists while I watched it, on the edge of my seat of course. It is very intriguing and smart, if you can stomach it, I recommend this movie for sure, it is flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Takes No Prisoners ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine cast is the inspiration for this 2013 engrossing film where 2 little friends are kidnapped and the extremely distraught father of one of them, Hugh Jackman in a fine performance, tragically goes way beyond what someone should do in this situation with much tragedy resulting.Maria Bello is his distraught wife and Terrence Howard and Viola Davis add to the drama as the other parents. Jake Gyllenhaal is the hard-nosed detective who is always able to crack cases but is bewildered by this one.Melissa Leo has some scene stealing scenes as the aunt of the accused.The film shows Jackman's deterioration into lunacy as he kidnaps the man he feels responsible for what has occurred. Howard and Davis are reluctant participants and the ending is eerie but purely Alfred Hitchcock-like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost passed on this film, suspecting it to be yet another cliché ridden tale filled with predicable twists and turns. I was dead wrong. This is a movie unlike any other in this genre. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal inhabit the skins of a father who will stop at nothing to find his kidnapped daughter and the detective pulled in many directions while trying to solve the case. But it is Paul Dano who nearly steals the show while barely uttering a word, and Terence Howard who tosses in the ethical questions along the way. Are there twists and turns? Yes, several of them, but nothing like you've seen before. Taut direction, and realistic characterizations bereft of the nonsense you normally expect in such a film. Do not miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly Best Film of 2013?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a terrific maze of a thriller as the viewer is never quite sure of what's about to happen. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki who has solved every case he's had. And this one is not to elude him but amazingly, he's hot and cold, off and on, and only solves the case with a bit of luck. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a man who will almost stop at nothing to find his daughter. His and Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) are fathers caught between desperation and loss of ethics. As vigilantes, they take twisted justice into their own hands. As one amateur reviewer here suggests, it is an unusual thriller clouded by moral ambiguity. However, I'm not sure if that is really the case, but rather how far are we willing to test morality and ethics.Acting is excellent by all major characters including Viola Davis who plays a distraught Nancy Birch, Maria Bello who plays Grace Dover, Melissa Leo who is excellent as Holly Jones, and Paul Dano who plays Alex Jones. Cinematography by Roger Deakins and direction by Denis Villeneuve is outstanding. Kudos to Roger who was nominated for an Oscar and this is as good as his cinematography in No Country For Old Men.Amazingly, Prisoners only received one Oscar nomination. But then many great films were snubbed by the Oscars. For example, Citizen Kane often rated #1 on many critics list only won one Oscar. Taxi Driver went 0 for 4 in wins and nominations, and Once Upon a Time in the West never received any nominations but among most critics, these films are among the best.Looking up some lists as for the best films of 2013, for example, the Huffington Post lists 17 films topped by 2) Gravity and 1) American Hustle. Gravity is a spectacular visual film with a poor script, average acting and weak plot as it defies every realistic scenario in space. It will fall into the Rocky category, a film honored by a clueless academy that should beg forgiveness. American Hustle is superior to Gravity but dries up a but at the end. I would place Prisoners at the same level, and perhaps even better than American Hustle. It is probably the best thriller since Silence of the Lambs and a remarkable insightful film into human ethics. Unfortunately, despite being in that category, it happened to be made in 2013 which, frankly, appears to be one of the strongest cluster of films, although, I would think many 9s but perhaps no legendary 10s.However, only a few graphic thrillers such as Silence of the Lambs or No Country for Old Men have ever been recognized. One wonders if being too graphic turned off Oscar nominations. Hollywood would rather have a clean sentimental screening, like Gravity or 12 Years A Slave. But as time goes on, this film should rise as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world as prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seemed at first like it would prejudge sin and redemption, pitting a father's virulent worldview of a fallen world that you have to prepare against and be ready to kill to protect loved ones against a senseless evil that seems to justify it. So I was surprised to find more.It's anchored, on one end in the thriller with clear mechanics that goes back to Fritz Lang, the modern intuitions about space on the other. Jackman and the other actors inhabit the first, Deakins finds his room in the second. In one mode evil is concrete, in the other elusive. Seven was in the first, Zodiac more in the second, the film traverses both. Here we start with the disappearance of two girls and gradually acquire a story. Two men are struggling to, father and cop, one goes on faith the other reason. One and then a second culprit appear, somehow connected.The whole idea, eerily effective, is that we build loci of observation, that we have enough observation at any time only to justify a faith about what we convince ourselves to be true, either of the boys being guilty, so in being yanked from one to the other and back that faith is shaken and shakes our grounds of truth and humanity. Innocents suffer as a result. Meanwhile evil is something so banal and in plain sight, the more horrifying suggestion, also seen in the location of the makeshift prison(s).The thriller worked for me more than most in recent memory, but the most striking moments were in the second mode, the visual and elusive. As the girl's memory comes to her in the hospital bed, we have three or four shots that communicate that whole range, each of them expertly timed, each blurry in some way. And the manic driving to save the girl in time, here we have her soul between worlds, his rush to redemption, visually transcendent in the night traffic of this world.Overall it paints a tormented picture; evil, originally a shattered faith as we find, exists out there, we come close to knowing, the father, the cop, the kid who sketches mazes, but something eludes us in the way things are made, which can be as simple as the father not being able to make himself believed about what he heard in the parking lot, and as complicated as what he heard not being what he thinks. So I'm not in line with the glum worldview, I am somewhat with the latter, the difficulties of faith and clarity, tied to watching. It's a Christian vision to be sure, the world as prison, faith inescapably woven with sin. Interestingly, that pessimism emerges in the Christian mind as you move away from the early days and the "father's" coming is delayed. I followed the other day a link to an article about Christian leaders professing the religious significance of Aronofosky's upcoming Noah, how it makes the old story vibrantly relevant for a modern audience. I'd like to see them confront this, which really demands confrontation.</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman gave his best performance and Jake Gyllenhal almost did the same thing with his performance. I must commend the director Denis Villeneuve who did a great job.

		<fullReview>Yes, this might not be a film for the action nuts out there however if you like a dark, gritty film that keeps you guessing throughout then this is right up your street!The intricately woven plot that Guzikowski has written tells the story of two families searching for their missing children and the detective who is wrapped up in it all. Ultimately the film explores the human mind and shows how far people can be pushed to their breaking points. The dark, moody atmosphere Denis Villeneuve creates fits perfectly with the film.Jake Gyllenhaal and Hugh Jackman transcend among an array of highly skilled performances from the whole supporting cast. Both actors at the pinnacle of their acting powers, career bests for sure. While watching, you really begin to understand and feel for every character. The plot is absorbing and suspenseful. It took me 2 viewings to fully understand the whole story. The little things I missed the first time around makes me admire this film even more. The true testament of a great film in my book. A dark, precise, mysterious, masterpiece with a little violence thrown in means it's a must watch for any thriller fan! In my view, one of the best films of the year!</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman is able to go beyond his Volverine image and do a great job in this movie. I've never been a big fan of Jake Gyllenhal, but he really did a superb acting on this piece. He was the perfect match for his character. After watching the movie I had to read the whole plot story to make sure I did not miss anything. It has lots of talk statements, and it helps to pay close attention not to miss the details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoners - one of the best of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners' was a definite surprise hit. I have always enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performances (Donnie Darko, The Source Code), and always respected his ability to act, alongside Hugh Jackman's excellent performance as a father who will do anything to bring back his child. I walked into 'Prisoners' with no expectations; in fact I barely knew what the movie was about. I read somewhere it was a 'Taken' clone, but that is a huge disservice to the direction, screen writing and most importantly the cinematography shown in the film. The film was so incredibly moody, falling into a similar category as 'Se7en' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. One or two scenes overstayed their welcome by a minute or so, and Jackman may be overacting to some, but I think he hit the nail on the head. Gyllenhaal also portrayed an incredibly weary and tired police officer, who becomes increasingly suspicious and twitchy as the film progresses. His performance carried the film, in my opinion. The basements were dusty and the X-Files-esque flashlights pierced the fog, while the snowy environment gave the film a cold, clinical feel. Roger Deakins has never deserved a reward for his cinematography more, and is one of my biggest inspirations in the field. The film is beautiful, while retaining a dark, sinister feel. Unfortunately, Gravity broke so many boundaries in the cinematographic field, and will likely receive more credit for 2013s cinematography. A shame, Deakins has shown his skill multiple times without any reward (outside of fame and money, obviously) in the academy and such, especially after 'Skyfall' in 2012. Outside of this, the film displays an excellent dissection of morality on a fundamental basis, and it left me thinking for a long time afterwards. The film is so pleasing to watch but oh so chilling and dark. I recommend this film to anyone, but not the faint of heart, it does get messy.Excerpt from 2013 - a year in review: www.perksandpeeves.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>inconclusive and frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie with no preconceived thoughts or knowledge about it. As it progressed I felt an increasing sense of being manipulated by the script and plot. The acting is okay, lots of mannerisms, especially from Gillenhall but he's a strong character actor and can pull it off. But the movie is full of unexplained moments and weak linking. The main characters do things without any apparent motivation. Red herrings are presented and then vanish without any explanation. The storyline is full of holes. The immorality of Jackman's character's behavior is a deep concern and this is then swept away by his being incarcerated and lost to his family without any relation to the ending. It's a frustrating film because it had the potential to be so much better but the inconclusive ending and dismissive resolution leaves one feeling cheated after sitting though two and a half hours of a very slowly built tension. The script should have been heavily edited before it went into production. I don't understand why the two lead actors agreed to make this movie. Neither of them can be short of job offers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's possible that I just saw the best movie of my life, so far. It's scary beyond words, frightens you and could make you lose, during it's 2 and a half hours, another bit of faith (if you still have some left) in this humanity ravaged by hatred, lie, deceit, darkness and ugly people. The kind of people that sometimes cannot be separated from demons. Maybe some will cry during this movie; I couldn't. I was holding my breath most of the time and had my soul hanging on the very edge of my teeth ...Still, there's hope. Even in the darkest hours of our lives, all is not lost. Sometimes it is, but not always. I was frightened not because of what was happening but mostly of what I thought will never happen. I was scared that it will leave me hanging, without an answer. We all need an answer, even if that answer could haunt us for the rest of out days. We need to know, in order to try and reconcile us with God, whom we blame for all the bad things that we come across. Or if we don't believe in God, we blame fate, parents, brothers or sisters, neighbors, the country we were born or the stars which didn't aligned for us to be happy ever after. If we don't get that answer we forget who we are and why we are here. And when that happens, darkness follows ...This is not a movie for parents, and I mean that ! Nor is a movie to take out your girl to ... This is a movie after which you will never be the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To what extent can a man go to protect his loved ones? Is violence justified only because it will help bring them back from hand of the evil?'Prisoners' which released in India two weeks later than America is a must watch had anyone missed the chills and atmospherics of thriller classics such as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac'. Its the story of a desperate father taking matters into his own hands after his daughter and her friend go missing and the police discharges the prime suspect in the case. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film provides an introspection on our moral grounds at times when evil lurks around. Touching the themes of torture and violence, it is an engaging (at the same time - disturbing) drama. The contorted twist towards the end turns it into a thrilling mystery leaving us puzzled as looking for answers.Supported by a brilliant caste, the pace of the screenplay gets an uplift by their natural stance and the brilliance of their performance delivery. Hugh Jackman as the father and Jake Gyllenhaal as the frustrated lead investigator prove to be the perfect choice for the roles. Paul Dano as Alex Jones - the prime suspect plays his character so profoundly that we will hate and pity him at the same time. Stark photography by 10 times Oscar nominee Roger Deakins provides the atmospherics and the chills that completely draws us into the drama set in cold and bleak streets.With 'Rush' released the week before and 'Prisoners' matching up, maybe the Oscar season has already started.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see a movie last weekend?"Prisoners." It was a good product. At 153 minutes it seemed a little long. But I didn't fall asleep. On a scale of one to one hundred, I would score it an 85. That is a pretty good number from me, so I must have liked it. It is much easier for me to point out what I didn't like, than what I did. ? I think Hugh Jackman did a good job, but his character (Keller Dover) was a little over the top. I'm not sure how that happened, but I suspect the director, Denis Villeneuve, might have been responsible. Subtract five points. ? Unfortunately the film followed the same slothful path as do so many lesser movies? blame conservative Christianity. Subtract five points for laziness and cowardice. ? We are led to believe that the character Franklin Birch (played by Terrence Howard) would not be held accountable for the kidnapping and repeated beatings (which led to his death) of character Alex Jones (played by Paul Dano). The charge is felony murder, and he would be prosecuted. Subtract three points. ? My popcorn had too much butter. Subtract one point. Everything else about the move was great. I left the theater with a good feeling. I would recommend that "Prisoners" and Sean Penn's "The Pledge" (Jack Nicolson, Benicio Del Toro, Patricia Clarkson and Beau Daniels) be bundled. The similarities are striking. I gave "The Pledge" a strong ninety-nine when I saw it in 2001. Both films are on my top 100 list of contemporary movies.</fullReview>

Prisoners skillfully mixes suspense thriller and human drama, and beautifully exploits its characters, played by talented actors capable of extending and enhancing the dark atmosphere set by the pictures and narrative; darkness that invades the screen to embody a looming, terrifying evil. The film takes its time to develop the characters and display different but equally intense counterpoints. There are times when the plot seems too complex and one fears that the complication are resolved simplistically, as with many suspense films, but the excellent screenplay manages to solve with intelligence and intrigue. it's a contemplatively paced descent into hell, suggesting that one can not safely navigate a clear encounter with horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Mystery That Keeps You Guessing Till the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners (2013) **** (out of 4) Incredibly well-made and intense mystery about two little girls who go missing and the detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) put on the case to find them. When the original suspect (Paul Dano) is let go, one of the girl's father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take justice in his own hands. I really had high hopes going into PRISONERS and my expectations for a great film were met but I must admit that it wasn't anywhere near the type of great film I expected. A lot of thrillers these days are limited on talk and emotions and instead we just get one big, staged action scene after another. That's certainly not the case here because the film takes its time (153-minutes) telling its story and there are so many quiet moments where we just see the characters losing their grip and emotions as they try to make sense of not knowing where these two girls are. What really pushes the film over the edge are the terrific performances with Jackson leading the way in what's the best performance I've seen from him. This isn't your "loving" father in the traditional sense. Instead he's someone quite scary from the first time we see him and we see how much worse he gets as the picture goes along. While on one hand you sympathize with his situation, on the other hand you really can't support what he's doing and often wonderful about his own involvement in things. Jackman really comes off like a man full of emotion and rage and he just doesn't know how to properly let it out. The anger he shows throughout the film is something so raw that you really do feel as if you're watching a man who has a daughter missing. Gyllenhaal also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played the detective role. I really loved the various obstacles that his character gets put through and especially the own weakness and at times stuck-up approach. The supporting cast includes wonderful performances by Dano, Melissa Leo, Terrence Howard, Maria Bello and Viola Davis. The screenplay isn't going to give you a lot of easy answers and there are many times where you hate the lead characters and can't find anything in them to root for. I thought it was quite brave that the film was willing to take so many chances and it asks the viewer to ask themselves many questions about how they would react to what's going on. I can't say I agreed with all the choices but it's great that a film actually makes you think as that's something quite rare these days. PRISONERS isn't exactly an "enjoyable" film as it has you feeling dirty throughout the running time but if you stick with it the thing is certainly very rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman is reborn in this suspense-riddled thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners, 2013.One of my pet hates is when people see or hear one bad review about a movie and automatically write it off without a second thought. It's amazing how "Sheep-like" we've all become in recent years. Most likely due to social media, where one person will post a status rubbishing a movie.Hugh Jackman (Keller Dover) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki) star in this epic drama/thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve. Set in Pennsylvania, Dover runs a small carpentry business and maintains a deeply religious life. The plot begins when 2 young girls are abducted from the family's Thanksgiving dinner, one of whom is Dover's girl. Gyllenhaal plays the hard-working local detective with the "never say die" attitude, full of late nights, no sleep, plenty of coffee and provides the "won't stop until the case is solved" feel, etc.I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman sometimes, mainly due to the fact that he cops criticism of his more theatre driven roles. If there was going to be a break-away film that separated Hugh from "that guy with the beard in X-Men" and "The boy from OZ", this was it. It's evident in the way that he acts in this new thriller that he had something to prove to the world as an actor. You could tell he was making up for not receiving roles like this in the past. Every actor will always say: "I don't care what people think", but we all know deep down that we all care to some degree. It's who we are. Like most thrillers, the story-line was very slow, drowning (although in a good way) and puzzling. Constantly making you think about different scenarios and suspects. Decent movie-goers would probably work this plot out in due time. The suspense grows throughout the film, accentuated with low light levels which bring on that sense of anticipation and depth. The overall dull/gloomy appearance of the film is a credit to its own storyline. Reminding us as viewers the dimness of the whole situation and how hard it would be to be in Dover's situation. Jackman gives a portrayal of what I think any parent would do to ensure their child returns home safely. The passion, anger and overall stress steams out of Dover in many scenes where his temper is taken to new levels of hate.I thought Paul Dano (Alex Jones) played an enormous role in the success of this film. His quirky features fit his role perfectly and at times he scared the crap out of me without any dialect at all. Given the intellectual capability of a 10 year old, Alex feels the full wrath of Dover's agony, and at times, madness. Gyllenhaal also makes his mark in a role which has been played out a thousand times previously. He turns a simple script into a meaningful progression of the calm and collective. He acts as Dover's rock and plays the detective part with ease, winning him the Best Supporting Actor award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Awards.The main reason I watched this film was due to my eagerness to view Jackman's transformation from his previous typical roles. He did not fail expectations and proved his worth. You are left contemplating and thinking until the final moment of the film and even after the credits have started rolling up the screen. Prisoners is a suspense- riddled thriller from start to finish and a must see for 2013.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jingle bells. Batman Smells. Robin laid an egg. The Batmobile lost its wheels and Joker got away.With Prisoners, Denis Villeneuve delivers a perfect piece of thriller and drama punched with an impeccable blend of music and suspense, add to that Deakin's absolute sublime cinematography. A bit of David Fincher-esque thriller and a bit of Hitchcock-esque suspense that culminates into a riveting climax with some astounding developments. Superlative performances from Hugh Jackman (one of his best till date) and Jake Gyllenhaal. A story of a father who goes too far, goes too down, relinquishes all the values and morals in order to find out his possibly abducted daughter and a detective who commits himself onto his pursuit to find the same missing girl. At the end it is we who end up make ourselves the prisoner. It is we who get trapped out of a self-righteous crime. Denis Villeneuve's inch-perfect measure of storyline development, character moulding, Deakin's master cinematography and brilliance from Hugh and Jake are just too powerful to ignore what the film wants to convey. Turns out we all are prisoners in some way or the other. A must must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is not easy to fill required ten lines of a review without revealing a bit of the mystery from a plot. So let's walk around. Almost excellent movie, a bit slow paced but it should be, due to the story developing. Good cast, excellent performances. Direction - just as it should be. Nothing to add, nothing to cut off. I would not mind if this movie lasted 5 hours (about a double as it does), revealing more details, but the director decided to leave the viewer some dots to connect. Everything else in this movie is just right. There are people in Hollywood who can still make almost perfect movies out of a very good (although rather simple) story, while not spending hundreds of millions for sfx and stuff. Leaves you with much to think about. And a delightful good movie lover experience. Go for this one. Youl'll thank me later for encouraging you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done psychodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't add much about the plot because that's already been done in spades. The title Prisoners is very apt for this movie, which focuses heavily on the effect that the disappearance of two young girls has on their families, the police detective who is investigating their disappearance, and a mentally retarded young man whose RV is connected with the crime and who may be, or may not be, the perpetrator.The girls disappear right under the noses of their parents and siblings. They all must cope with the abduction, but the father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), has sworn to protect his family and reacts, often violently, to the intense stress put on him for his dereliction of duty. He kidnaps the mentally retarded young man, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), and tortures him in an abandoned apartment building, hoping to beat out of him the whereabouts of his daughter. His wife, Grace (Maria Bello) resorts to prescription drugs to deal with her loss. The other parents are bereft too. The other father (Terrence Howard) reluctantly ends up aiding Dover in the torture. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is able to relate the crime to some earlier abductions that had never been solved. He also must endure Dover's almost incessant raves that he (Loki) is mishandling the case. Eventually Dover's accusations get under his skin. Several clues are given who the real perpetrator is but they're easy to miss.The action takes place between Thanksgiving and Christmas in a small Pennsylvania town, so the weather is gloomy and overcast, often raining or snowing. Very appropriate for such a dark movie. A poignant scene is Keller Dover on his knees begging forgiveness from Jones, who's been sealed in a wooden closet for torture with only a small hole to look out of. If you grew up Catholic, it'll remind you of a penitent confessing to a priest in his darkened booth in the confessional. And Keller Dover, although driven by his demons, is a deeply religious man (he wears a cross on a chain around his neck) and is well aware he's committing mortal sin. But he'll do anything, including sacrificing his own life, to find his daughter.The ending is ambiguous in one sense. Although the perpetrator of the crimes receives justice, Keller Dover may, or may not, die in a very disquieting manner. Viewer's choice.The acting is first-rate, as well as the script and directing. If you can handle a very dark theme done in a very realistic way, then I'd highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure about this film when I heard of it, despite the two great leading actors, but I was made keener as I read about the plot, and in the news it was reported as being number one at the box office, with positive reviews, so I was definitely up for trying it. Basically deeply religious Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), who runs a struggling carpentry business, and his wife Grace (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello) and their children attend Thanksgiving dinner with their neighbours the Birches, husband Franklin (Terrence Howard) and wife Nancy (Viola Davis) and their children. After this dinner both families' young daughters, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), go missing, the police are called to search, an RV was reported parked in the neighbourhood, and it is found, the driver Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is interrogated by Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), but there is no clear evidence he did anything, and he has the intelligence of a ten year old. Keller is angry that Alex was released, as he sure he knows the whereabouts of the girls, he abducts him and imprisons him in a partially dilapidated house he owns, and with the reluctant help of Franklin he brutally beats and interrogates him repeatedly without getting anywhere. Feeling really guilty Franklin tells his wife Nancy what is going on, she comes to the house to see Alex and how severely battered he is, the Birches decide not to interfere or help and to allow Keller to continue torturing him, having suffered for a few days he does speak out, mentioning a maze, with this information Keller visits Alex's aunt Holly Jones (The Fighter's Melissa Leo) to see her reaction at mentioning mazes. Bob Taylor (David Dastmalchian) is named a suspect, and at his home the walls are covered with intricate maze drawings, and in a back room locked crates filled with maze books, snakes and blood covered clothing are covered, he is taken into custody, but he manages to commit suicide grabbing a gun, he was not involved with the crime, the blood on the clothes is pig's blood, and the clothing was stolen after the abduction. Joy Birch is found drugged and taken to hospital days later, Anna is still missing, rambling the found girl says in her prison she heard Keller's voice, Loki follows Keller, finding the abandoned house and Alex imprisoned, Keller meanwhile goes back to Holly's house realising Joy heard his voice there, she holds him at gunpoint and drugs him, revealing she was the one who abducted the girls. Holly explains that she had abducted many others before, including Bob Taylor, "waging a war on God" making parents lose their religion as revenge for the death of her child from cancer, the first child abducted was Alex, she then shoots Keller in the leg and puts him in a pit outside hidden under a car, this was where the girls was imprisoned. Loki turns up at the house to tell Holly that Alex has been found, and he catches her about to kill Anna, trying to make her raise her hands she shoots him, he shoots and kills Holly, Anna is rushed to hospital, her mother thanks the detective, the little girl mentions her red whistle that she lost whilst abducted, and back at the Jones house Loki hears the faint sound of a whistle as the film ends. Also starring Dylan Minnette as Ralph Dover, Zoe Borde as Eliza Birch, Wayne Duvall as Captain Richard O'Malley, Len Cariou as Father Patrick Dunn and Brad James as Officer Carter. Jackman gives a great provocative performance as the father will do anything to get his daughter back, Gyllenhaal is also exceptional as the police officer trying to help him unaware of the disturbing events unfolding, supporting stars Howard and Davis are good support as well. The story works as both a kidnap mystery and a desperate search for the evidence and truth behind the crime, you may need a strong stomach to watch all the violence and torture that unfolds, it also makes you question how far you would go in a situation as portrayed in this, a controversial but satisfyingly engaging crime drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim, gripping, great performances. Not a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Guzikowski's screenplay for 'Prisoners' was near the top of the list of best unmade for quite some time; at one point Hugh Jackman was attached to the project, but dropped out for reasons that remain unclear, though scheduling conflict may not be quite as pertinent as a lack of artistic cohesion with the original director. As serendipity would have it, the much later arrival of Denis Villeneuve as director, to his first English language feature, drew a mega cast of great talent, both in front of and behind the camera, including Jackman again. This is presumably based on the acknowledgement of his previous Award-nominated work. With Villeneuve on board, the screenplay seemed destined to become so much more than your average abduction thriller; to a great extent this fact is both the strength, and arguably the weakness of the final product.The straightforward setup is of two quite different but friendly families whose daughters go missing after Thanksgiving dinner. When the detective assigned to the case apprehends a suspect and finds no evidence of any crime with which to charge him, he has no choice but to release him. The subsequent act of the film follows the predictable route of a father taking the law into his own hands, and raises important questions about the morality and effectiveness of torture, the dangers of all actions and judgements, right or wrong, being governed by instinct and not logic, and the most obvious: What would you do, and where would YOU draw the line? The final act reaches a little too hard for a "Gotcha!" finale, which may disappoint those who did not want to see it become a more generic thriller, but it does not undermine the movie too badly. 'Prisoners' is beautifully shot by the man responsible for some of the best looking films you can name, Roger Deakins. Much as with the late Conrad L. Hall, you can sense that every shot took forever to setup, but the result always justifies that time. With a constantly gritty, doom-laden tone, one really cannot help but keep thinking of David Fincher; with the inclusion of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki, it is near impossible not to recall 'Zodiac'. There has been much made of Hugh Jackman's powerhouse performance as the angry Keller Dover, and there is no doubt his intensity is spot-on, but for me, Gyllenhaal actually quietly steals the show with a perfectly-pitched performance as a dog-tired, stressed detective who can feel his grip on the case gradually slipping; I don't think he has been better.The film is paced with a deliberately painful slowness; its moments of tension and excitement are highlighted as quite so intense by virtue of their brevity. This is a story of depth, with a lot to digest and discuss on every level. The thoughtful watcher will, upon reflection, come to realise nothing in the film is irrelevant; as Detective Loki himself says, "Everything matters." The twists and turns in the final act build on the idea at the heart of the film, with the title growing increasingly relevant; this encourages deeper thought than your more average thriller. Something rather fascinating about the direction is that from quite early, a lot of the audience will already know HOW the film will end; it is HOW it gets there which might take most by surprise!'Prisoners' isn't a movie you enjoy so much as admire; incredibly artful, it is more a film of ideas and thinking points. It may be possible to pick little holes in the procedural elements, but it remains a challenging piece that will probably benefit from repeat viewing. Due to the fact everything ties up well, it is not as hole-riddled as a casual viewer may think, although that is not to say that, as it heads into more generic "Fincher" territory, it does not become a little too convoluted for its own good; certainly there is little doubt the film is at its strongest as the tense, slow examination of a controversial topic. Despite the contrivances, the fact that it is, at times, more heavy-handed than it need be, and that Terrence Howard, Viola Davis and Melissa Leo are given frustratingly little to do, 'Prisoners' nevertheless remains a piece of work which demands attention and respect for the film making.It would certainly be unjust to say this isn't one of the films of the year, and I definitely sense an Oscar for the cinematography here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2013 Finally Gets it Right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners features and handles the greatest ensemble cast of 2013 (so far.) Hugh Jackman gives what might be his greatest performance, and Jake Gyllenhaal turns in the best performance of the film, playing the films most important and interesting character. Prisoners is thought-provoking and really makes people question their moral boundaries. How far would you go realistically? But what drove Prisoners home, was its honesty. It refused to go the easy route also known as Hollywood. The first half is a slow and steady build-up that adds the realism of the situation. The second half is mystery heavy and unbelievably interesting. A film has not been this involving in a long time, especially with the mystery genre. Denis Villeneuve completely breaks- out and is for sure a director to keep an eye on. Also the most beautiful cinematography of the year. (Gravity had great cinematography, but with Earth as a background a lot, it is almost unfair) It is my favorite cinematography because Roger Deakins was able to use such simple and plain locations and used them perfectly, composing impeccable imagery. Prisoners also highly deserves a best original screenplay nomination as well as other things. The score set the tone and was darkly fascinating. Favorite film of 2013</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal Imprisonment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title Prisoners suggests far more than the viewer would be led to believe. There are the obvious forms in that of the kidnapped children and the possible suspect, Alex (Paul Dano), whom one of the girl's fathers, Keller (Hugh Jackman), abducts to retrieve information from. However, these two examples are only the surface of both film and title as Denis Villeneuve's two-and-a-half hour crime thriller is a case of a cryptic nature.Exploring the film, we are first greeted by the image of a forest ? an establishing mechanism to give the feel of the wild ? as Keller recites the "Our Father" and his son shoots and kills his first deer. Keller congratulates his son and remarks that if his father ever taught him anything it was to, "Pray for the best, prepare for the worst." This exposition places Keller as a primal being; a man that clearly recognizes the importance that the father serves and categorizes hunting as a rite of passage (the importance of the first kill and the religious connotation he places over the act reinforce that). Now, juxtaposed with Keller is Franklin (Terrence Howard): father to Joy (Kyla Simmons), who along with Keller's daughter, Anna (Erin Gerasimovich), are the abductees. The first time we meet Franklin is on Thanksgiving ? the day of the kidnapping ? with a trumpet in hand as he plays an awful rendition of, "The Star Spangled Banner" (a song that Keller is jokingly rumored to sing in the shower).Delving further into the picture, we meet Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), the officer assigned to the missing persons case and our balance between good and evil. Our introduction to Loki is on Thanksgiving as well and while Keller and Franklin celebrate the holiday together with their families ? unknowing of their daughters' abduction ? our triumphant detective sits alone in an Asian diner. A self- implemented sense of isolation perhaps due to some past discrepancy is felt. Wholly dedicated to his job it is rare that we see Loki anywhere but the office or patrolling ? to be honest I cannot remember if we ever see the man at his home ? leading to notion of imprisonment by his occupation.Now, the theory of universal imprisonment in the film is further implemented by Roger Deakins' cinematography. Most houses are shot like enormous multi-room jail cells and moments when the cameras hover above Loki at his desk feel darkly voyeuristic (as if we are viewing the man not through the fourth wall but plexiglass). In fact, one of the most interesting aspects I found of the film is that the only literal prisoners - being the daughters and Alex ? are rarely ever seen. The film is not about them as much as it is the captives who believe to be free, who believe to be in the right.This sense of morality can be explored through Keller and Franklin. In the aforementioned opening scenes the polarity created between the two men could not be greater and that is where much of the film's greatest tension comes from as well. On one hand, you have the devout Christian, a patriot, a former alcoholic ? clearly a flawed yet conscious man - whose primal tendencies may very well lead him to solving the puzzle. While on the other, you have the nuclear familial father: knit sweater, non-threatening lifestyle, and an overall sense of right and wrong. A man who is thrown into the "act now, think later" mentality of Keller and begins to suffer from attacks on his own sense of morality. Our foundation of the film is the image of one father with gun in hand and the other with a trumpet. How could one expect them to work together in a cohesive manner?This sense of chaos and the balance that Loki instills keeps any possibility of these characters being shackled at bay. It is not until the film's third act when the "big reveal" is made that we realize truly how much the title, Prisoners, encapsulates. It is a marvelous twist in not the way that it makes the viewer gasp but the depth it adds to each and every character. The surface it seamlessly breaks allowing for a distinct emotional connection to form. It is the knowledge of Keller's father's suicide and his alcoholism that creates the notion that while he is our anti-hero, he suffers from deep abandonment issues (creating the driving force in his actions of doing anything to save his child) and is as much of a prisoner of himself as the others in the film. It is not until the red herring sub-plot of Bob Taylor (David Dastmalachian) ? a grown man who was kidnapped as a child and has since never been able to escape the sensations of it - that the viewer is able to understand the psychological ramifications of imprisonment. I have seen critics complain about the use of the character, Bob Taylor, yet it is through his demise that we are able to finally view characters such as Keller, Franklin, and Loki through a new lens that creates the understanding and empathy necessary to immerse yourself with the picture.While it only covers a mere week, Prisoners is a generational exploration of the ways people can place themselves and others in various forms of imprisonment. Whether it is the emotional captivity ? due to the absence of Anna - of Keller's wife, Grace (Maria Bello), or the mental arrest placed on Alex's childhood that has led him to where he is now. Prisoners suggests that whether you are in a box, a locked room, at your job, or at home with your family, none of us are really free and it is because of our pasts and the choices of others that we subconsciously continue to shackle ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Saw Prisoners on the Tuesday after it came out because it was cheap night at the Cineplex and I have to say I was blown away by the film, just the pure suspense of this film was amazing, the acting I cant even begin to explain how great it was, Hugh Jackman was at his all time best in this film, Jake Gyllenhaal (may of spelled his last name wrong) was the best in this film, he had that intensity to him that he had in End of Watch. This film kept me on the edge of my seat during the entire 2 and half hours of this film, even tho I had to use the bathrooman hour and a half in the film, I just couldn't bare my self to leave my seat because in this film, missing a second would be a stupid move. This is my first review on this site but I knew this was the first one I had to do. I recommend this film to anyone who loves to be on the edge of their seat the entire time. I loved this movie and I cant wait for it to be released on Blu-Ray. 9 out of 10 stars only because the ending was the only complaint I had with this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sombre and slow, but excellent piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films create a brilliant sense of atmosphere. 'Prisoners' is one of those films. From the moment it opens, we are greeted with an ice cold atmosphere that continues until the end, reflecting the chilly weather that pervades through the suburban Pennsylvania setting. Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography really helps in crafting this atmosphere, as like the film, it moves at a slow and often languorous pace, occasionally honing in on things that don't necessarily move the plot forward, but add to the mood. Coupled with the superb score by Jóhann Jóhannsson, a feeling of dread is created from the beginning, lingering over ever frame right up until the credits roll.This dark and chilly atmosphere suits the plot of 'Prisoners' perfectly. During a Thanksgiving gathering involving two families, each one's youngest daughter mysteriously vanishes, nowhere to seen, leaving fathers Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and God-fearing, American survivalist Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) deeply concerned over the fate of their kids. Loner Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) takes on the case and soon arrests Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a guy "with the IQ of 10 year- old", but struggles to find any evidence against him. However, it's not long before a furious Keller takes matters into his own hands. Jackman has always been a good actor, despite sometimes being considered to be just a 'movie star', and with this film he gives what is very possibly his best performance to date. He's a magnetic force whenever on screen and is perfectly credible as a devastated father. Another person who is entirely credible in their role is Gyllenhaal. It may be as a result of starring in David Ayer's excellent 'End of Watch', but Gyllenhaal is terrific as Detective Loki, offering a great contrast to the fiery Jackman. He even goes so far as adding an actor's tick, as Loki frequently blinks, signalling his stress and anxiety. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are rounded off by a good supporting cast of Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano at his creepiest.At 153 minutes, you could argue that 'Prisoners' is overlong, but its length was one of the best things about it for me, as I became absorbed in the drama. This is a slow film with slow passages; it definitely takes its time getting places, but with such a great sense of atmosphere, length is hardly an issue. This is more than simply a 'kidnap movie' as director Denis Villeneuve attempts to make a serious point about kidnapping, questioning the value of information obtained under duress and the idea of doing things with the right intentions even if it's against the law. Similarly, the characters exist in an area of gray morality, as evidenced by the fact that I sympathized with Keller and Alex. Sure, it's not perfect ? the end twist feels somewhat generic, consequently jarring with the non-generic approach to the rest of the film. Nonetheless, this is a grimly-atmospheric, well-acted and excellently structured piece of work that has something intelligent to say to say about its subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did expect much, but this topped all of my expectations regarding this movie!It's made like an old-school thriller you know from the late 80th to early 2000 - only a very few special effect but a great, complex and logic story.I love the way this movie is made. Not just that the camera is always very well placed, but the dialogs, the actions taken and the personalities of the characters are very realistic.Even if the plot is an of the more "common" ones, the making of the movie gives it something almost unique. The suspense is lasting till the last minute and often you have for yourself to think about moral decisions and a character that you liked in the beginning may become unfriendly to you as the movies goes on.One of the best part of the movie is the very last scene - it's so well done that I had to give it a 10/10 rating, even if I have to admit that I enjoyed The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a liiiitle bit much more.Thanks for that great movie that proves that they are still good directors out there making good movies and not things like X MEN number 10000000.GREAT WORK!</fullReview>

Its the movie you will want to see a 2nd time to pick up the clues you missed the first time. You are drawn into the movie and remain gripped the whole way. The story line and the twists make it a very good movie. Of course you have some well know actors as you can see from the trailer. Its not classed as a horror movie, however for there are horrific aspects. Anyway as I see from the 8 score I am not the only one who liked the movie. It could easily win an Oscar as one of the best pictures of 2013. I suppose its good to see a movie that is suburban with drama and good acting. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immersive, emotional and tense, a Thriller as it should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have teamed with relatively unknown director Denis Villeneuve to bring one of the greatest Thrillers of 2013. "Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst," is a line Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) lives his life by. But when the unimaginable happens, and his daughter and her friend are kidnapped, Keller takes matters into his own hands when the police seem unable to act.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has solved every case he's ever been assigned. He and Keller are after the same goal, to see the girls home alive, but their methods differ; one of composure, one of desperation. Now, onto discussing the brilliance of this film. For me, it really comes down to three factors: the story, the acting, and the fantastic moments of tension. Essentially, these are the elements that every film of the Thriller genre will strive to perfect, and Prisoners hits the nail on the head for all three.Boasting a run time of over two and half hours, Prisoners has a lot of story to tell. Long films aren't always a good thing, when you stretch a film to that length of time it typically starts to stagger at some point. But with Prisoners, it worked. It wasn't slow, but neither did it feel rushed, the Director told the story he wanted to tell in what felt like its entirety. The story also managed to remain intriguing without throwing twists and turns and revelations into the script every few minutes, and this is partly due to the fantastic characters and their relationships with one another.However, it doesn't matter how great a script is, especially in the Thriller genre, if you haven't got the actors to deliver the material. Jake Gyllenhaal is an immensely versatile actor, and he fits into the role of Detective Loki beautifully. Even for such a recognisable face, I didn't see Mr Gyllenhaal on screen in front of me, I only saw Detective Loki, doing everything in his power to find the missing girls. Hugh Jackman, in addition, performed genuine Academy Award winning acting for this performance. When Keller filled with sorrow, I had a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. When Keller filled with fury, my fists and jaw clenched. When Keller collapsed in grief, I slumped in my chair. To call his performance gripping would be a mammoth understatement.Finally, the tension. A trademark of the genre, if you can make your audience's hearts pound in their chests at the right moment, you're on your way to a winning product. Prisoner's has an excellent amount of tension, and by that I don't mean a wealth of it. A balance has to be struck to keep the audience gripped, but to make them really appreciate the tension when it comes by not over-doing it. Prisoners did it so well, I was literally sat on the edge of my seat in one of the closing scenes, and had my heart pounding on a number of occasions. I will be shocked of this film does not attain the prestige it deserves. If you are a fan of the Thriller genre, I really cannot recommend this film enough. Make sure to take your partner or your friends with you, because you're going to want to discuss this masterpiece at length when the credits start to roll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantastic mystery thriller! Top notch acting. Some of the scenes were so intense they made me jump a few times AND turn my head a few times as well.The only thing I did not like is they denied us the conclusion!! Hate hate hate that. I mean you pretty much know whats going to happen but they don't let us SEE it. Ugh! Why oh why do they do that? I just don't get "use your imagination" endings! I don't want to use my imagination! I don't go to the movies to use my imagination darn it! lol. I am sitting there yearning and anticipating the final 2 or 3 scenes and then... POOF its done, sigh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eh. It was okay, but creepy and no empathy for any one character.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first sign of emotional connection for me didn't happen until 30 minutes or more into the film when the 2nd dad didn't want to be involved with Jackman's character's torture plan.I think the movie got right into the swing of things and kept moving, but we really didn't spend any quality time getting to know any one character, so it was confusing who to root for. And by mid way it fell right into the typical mystery formula. No actual suspense, since the clues are all given. And of course the villein gives an oratory on why everything has happened. UGH.It was mostly creepy."The Call" (little girl kidnapping story) for example was creepy too, but you felt for Haley Berry's character right off, suffering with her. This movie lacks that central character you understand. Who's movie was it? It felt like it wanted to go to some gripping emotional areas, but sort of fizzled, at least for me.It was entertainment, but fairly average for my taste.Blessings, Max Rainet A movie lover for life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very strong in some areas, weak in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The strongest aspect of the film was the acting. Hugh Jackman knocked it out of the park. It was a shame the other actors weren't given bigger roles, fine as they are. It was atmospheric with a decent, subtle score as well. The atmosphere kept building so you felt like it was going to amount to something major, which it did and didn't. There's something inherently dissatisfying at the heart of it. The detectives better accomplishments were completely by chance, when he was depicted to be a smart man. There were very simple things they could have done to have made him have to incorporate skill into using his chance realizations. For instance, if he hand't found the picture with the necklace on Holly's late husband, he could have just walked into the next room and discovered the truth, albeit too late. A simple reworking of this scene would have made it more satisfying, as the entire revelation about the dead husband/dead guy in priests basement, was semi-obvious to begin with. Keller also failed when it counted most, and this is majorly disappointing after he went through such lengths to find his daughter. He also could have handled it much differently when he heard "he was there...we had tape on our mouths." If he fled because he thought he would become a suspect, this could have been better emphasized. Once captured, the whistle aspect could have again been used when Loki enters the house, sees the picture, and realizes Holly's identity. Basically the entire last twenty minutes could have been reworked, I think, and the film would have been an 8 instead of a 6. I think its possible the movie had a very pro-christain initiative. We are meant to feel like Keller, not becoming a "devil" has Holly called him, and praying, lead to the finding of his daughter, and not losing his faith. The initiative to show this I think really diluted what could have been a very powerful noir film. I suggest Gone Baby Gone over this movie, if you want something similar but more satisfying in several ways. It has twists, moral studies, and great acting all the same, though Hugh Jackman really did nail it in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked "Mystic River" or "Gone Baby Gone", GO SEE THIS FILM! It was one of the most intense, suspenseful, moving, frightening films I've ever seen (and I'm a 53 year old film buff.) "Prisoners" is not a horror story; not a murder-mystery; but a sort of "kidnapped" thriller genre. It's exquisitely told without modern-day-film tricks like shaky cameras; without an actor saying "the F word" in every other sentence; without a dub-step sound track; and without gratuitous frights or even unnecessary action or car chases. It's a story of a horrible kidnapping and those who are affected. It's told with such compassion and believability. The characters make excruciating choices --choices that make you shake your head in stunned wonder. And the cast! Jake Gyllenhaal, Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, and Paul Dano! How much acting chops can one get on a movie set? And the screenplay is superb. I was on the EDGE OF MY SEAT for the entire film. I am simply blown away by this film --blown away. It's a 10 out of 10. Go see it on the big screen so you'll know why it's nominated for many awards in a few months.Congratulations to all involved in the making of "Prisoners" for a fine, classic film that will haunt your audience and make us very thoughtful for quite a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak Cases</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of the film, "Prisoners", is the first mystery you will need to figure out. It's puzzling because it is technically not set in a prison nor the main characters are actually prisoners. The best thing to presume is it's a metaphorical term that might refer to the characters' imprisonment to the bleakness of their situation. The film has an intriguing idea for a verisimilitude, but the only thing that breaks that conceit is the twist in the end. However, it's still quite the experience for being a brilliantly made and terribly gripping crime drama.The investigation is scattered with MacGuffins all over the place, assuming that the film asks the audience to think hard through the mystery as well, but the real idea of the story is how a kidnapping situation may also affect to the lives of the people related to the victims, especially to the one who are desperately worried about them. How this crime can change their humanity, like the father who forces himself to commit bad things just to get them back. The whole message is obvious, but it's no denying how fascinating to study these people by their actions. One is an ugly revenge, while the other is a deliberated case that gives a lot of pressure to the detective. It's extremely gripping, but when it hits to the revelation, it somehow loses a bit of the plot's credibility. It might be for consequential reasons, but it would have been more interesting if it was less conventional.It's pretty wise to include the parts when the characters are allowed to take time to breathe, if only those parts were a little less broad in their expressions of being mad, but they get quite effective. The performances are amazing enough. Hugh Jackman might be overdoing some of the father's rage, but his greatest feat overpowers the performance. Jake Gyllenhaal, I'm saying this once again, steals the show. His acting career is recently getting better and better. Here, Detective Loki is a character that you should be rooting for throughout the film, and Gyllenhaal justifies it. The direction is artful and weighs every scene of drama, action, and suspense. While the cinematography sharply displays how bleak these lives are.Despite some of its misstep, Prisoners is an outstanding cinema; it's magnificent in direction, fantastic in acting, stunning in cinematography, and best at pacing. Of course, it never forgets to depict how a terrible crime could cause other people. Not only the victims and the suspects are in trouble here. The result of this can be love ones raging in terror, ugly vigilantism, hard time for the law, and more consequences. This is a strong subject that deserves a lot of complexity. It still includes some exasperation near the end, but aside the conclusion, Prisoners is wholly satisfying anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Thriller with Some Taboo Subject Matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the disturbing Hugh Jackman child abduction thriller "Prisoners" is like rubbernecking at the scene of a car accident. Initially, your curiosity gets the best of you and gawk. Of course, the sight of the blood and gore sickens you. Nevertheless, you can't take your eyes off it because it makes you consider your own mortality. "Prisoners" keeps the blood and gore to a minimum, but the nature of the crimes leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oscar-nominated French-Canadian director Denis Villeneuve and "Contraband" scenarist Aaron Guzikowski have created a compelling criminal melodrama that shuns the usual Hollywood glitz and glamor. Indeed, the filmmakers accentuate realism at every turn. The squeamish might reconsider seeing this tragic tale. The unwholesome subject of child abduction qualifies as heavyweight material, and "Prisoners" never resorts to humor to lighten the atmosphere. Actually, the dreadful events in this narrative may challenge your ability to enjoy this intense psychological character study. Clocking in at 153 minutes, "Prisoners" is relentless both in its length and depth. I can't say enough good things about this inspired but unsavory crime drama. The characters stand out boldly from the background. Each emerges with greater depth and irony than Hollywood allows, and Villeneuve generates considerable, white-knuckled suspense. Sometimes, the quietest moments prove to be the most suspenseful. Comparably, "Prisoners" resembles an episode of the CBS-TV crime series "Criminal Minds," but clean-scrubbed, well-dressed, FBI agents aren't investigating the crime. The local authorities handle the case and display appalling incompetence. A father turns into a vigilante and passes the point of no return to save his daughter. Nobody in this grim, lurid yarn is without a flaw. You won't want to be like them because they lose their cool. "Prisoners" is about a lot of good people doing all the wrong things. When a small-time carpenter, Dover Keller (Hugh Jackman of "The Wolverine"), isn't in the woods hunting with his son, he dotes on his adorable, six-year old daughter. Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and her African-American girlfriend, Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons), are playing in their quiet, suburban neighborhood when they notice a recreational vehicle parked on the street. Dover and his best friend Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard of "Iron Man") and their wives and older children are enjoying a peaceful Thanksgiving dinner when the girls turn up missing. Earlier, Dover had told his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and Birch's daughter Eliza (Zoe Borde) to keep tabs on the youngsters. They search the neighborhood but find no traces of either Anna or Joy. Eventually, a police organize a widespread man hunt, with Dover and his son trudging through the woods with an army of other people. Dover's wife Grace (Maria Bello of "Payback") has retreated to her bed with pills galore while her husband counts the hours. Meantime, the police spot the suspicious vehicle near a convenience store, and Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal of "End of Watch") arrives and approaches it with his gun drawn. The driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano of "Cowboys &amp; Aliens"), behaves hysterically at the sight of all the flashing blue lights. Jones tries to drive off the premises. Instead, he careens into the woods and smashes up the vehicle. Loki arrests Alex, but Loki's police chief superior releases him later because they found no incriminating evidence either on him or in the RV. Enraged at Alex's early release, Dover confronts him in the parking lot, and the police have to restrain Dover. Later, Dover abducts Alex and tortures him. He demands that Alex reveal the whereabouts of his daughter and her companion. Alex repeatedly tells him that he knows nothing about Anna and Joy. Grimly, Dover devises other ways to torture Alex. Meantime, Detective Loki is on the trail of a bizarre individual who buys children's apparel despite the fact that he has no children. Moreover, he stores the apparel in locked plastic tubs writhing with snakes. As you can see, nothing about "Prisoners" is lightweight. The scene near the end when Loki careens desperately through traffic to reach the hospital will have you poised on the edge of your seat. One major surprise occurs about three-fourths of the way through "Prisoners" when the identity of the villain who is behind a child abduction ring is divulged. By this time, Franklin and Nancy Birch have visited the sight of Dover's torture chamber and allow him to continue with this disgraceful business. Hugh Jackman delivers a shattering performance as a father prepared to torture another human if it will prolong his daughter's life. You've never Jackman play a deranged character like Dover Keller. Keller believes devoutly that his actions are appropriate. Moreover, Keller's closest friends don't flinch at his merciless interrogation techniques. In essentially supporting roles, Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Paul Dano, and Melissa Leo all distinguish themselves. As the grieving parents, Bello, Davis, and Howard are far more sympathetic than Jackman's distraught father. Paul Dano allows his behavior and bizarre appearance do most of his acting for him. Altogether, Dano emerges as one creepy worm of a guy. Ultimately, Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance of his career as a detective who struggles to find clues in the disappearance of two little girls from their neighborhood. Suffice to say, although it qualifies as a superior thriller, "Prisoners" will rattle your cage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best suspense/thriller film I've watched in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a movie about a father's desperate search for his daughter, after she gets kidnapped by an unknown threat. Keller Dover(Hugh Jackman) &amp; his family go to his friend Franklin Birch's(Terrence Howard) house for Thanksgiving dinner. After a while, Dover &amp; Birch's daughters, Anna(Erin Gerasimovich) &amp; Joy(Kyla Drew Simmons) go outside to play. However, they never return. Dover assumes they're kidnapped &amp; his son, Ralph(Dylan Minnette), tells him that there was an RV parked outside the house. The owner of this RV, Alex Jones(Paul Dano), is the primary suspect. A police officer named, Detective Loki(Jake Gyllenhaal), is given the job of finding &amp; rescuing the girls. Thinking that the police will not get the job done, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands &amp; takes extreme steps to find the two girls. By the time this movie ended, I was speechless. Wow! What a movie! The suspense keeps the viewer engaged till the very last scene of the film. Throughout the film, I was on the edge of my seat, cause you really have no idea as to what's going to happen next. This movie is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, thrills &amp; suspense. The violence may make some people squeamish but, most of it is suggested &amp; it's not that graphic. The highlight of the film is the suspense. The script has been written so beautifully that, the viewer is left with questions even after the credits start rolling. The second highlight of the film is the performances. Hugh Jackman has given the best performance of his career as Keller Dover. Jackman's acting ability improves with each film. Jackman shows various emotions like, anger, fear, grief &amp; repentance effortlessly. Jake Gyllenhaal is equally good as Detective Loki. His portrayal of Detective Loki is subtle &amp; brilliant. Even though the detective may seem emotionally challenged, you can see that the pressure of the case is getting to him &amp; this has been done by Gyllenhaal superbly. Viola Davis is great as Nancy Birch. Maria Bello is effective as Grace Dover. Terrence Howard is impressive as Franklin Birch. Melissa Leo is spectacular as Holly Jones. Last but not the least, Paul Dano is outstanding as Alex Jones. Dano does wonders with the small role that he is given. Dylan Minnette, Erin Gerasimovich &amp; Kyla Drew Simmons are impressive as the kids, Ralph Dover, Anna Dover &amp; Joy Birch. The supporting characters are adequate as well. Prisoners is a must watch. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best thrillers in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Review: The abduction of children is something we read about in the news on a horrifyingly regular basis. The image of desperate parents on the TV clinging to the hope that their missing child is still alive is something we have all seen at some point in our lives.Prisoners revolves around two working class families who are presented with the unthinkable reality that their children have gone missing only yards from their home.Hugh Jackman plays the central character of the protective father Keller Dover, desperate to find answers to the whereabouts of his missing daughter. He is joined by a second father of a missing child, played by Terence Howard.The story wastes little time in kick starting events with the girls disappearing after leaving the home without consulting their elders.A mysterious camper van parked merely yards from the family home at the time of the abduction results in the driver Alex, played by Paul Dano being branded the key suspect in the case.Here we are introduced to local Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a rough and ready, tattooed loner with a history of solving missing children cases.When Alex is brought in for questioning, the police are unable to obtain any information from the mute suspect or have enough evidence to make a conviction.Infuriated by this, Dover embarks on a dark and brutal mission to force Alex to confess to the whereabouts of their missing daughters.Prisoners is a riveting atmospheric thriller that pulls no punches in its depiction of what is without doubt one of the most unforgivable crimes that can be committed.Stylishly directed by director Denis Villeneuve and with Roger Deakins on top form with some gorgeous cinematography results in a film drenched in dread from the first frame to the last.Hugh Jackman delivers without doubt the performance of his career. The sheer weight of his need to find his daughter is etched on his face throughout. His time playing Wolverine has served him well with bursts of violence both physical and verbal as he grows more and more frustrated with the search.Gyllenhaal also delivers one his finest performances in a long time. He has the look of a man who has been to some very dark places, the former missing children cases having visibly taken their toll.Comparisons have been made to the brilliant Zodiac and like that film Prisoners takes its time, refusing to be rushed and avoiding cliché.As the credits rolled I felt exhausted like the characters up on the screen but also confident enough to shout from the roof tops that I had just seen one of the best thrillers in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much out of 10?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be very brief... Jackman as always is immense... Especially so considering that:The script is awkward and clumsy, The plot starts 'ok' but is soooo predictable and frankly 'same same' albeit teasing you early on that it has substance. My son and I figured the entire plot within 30 minutes (of a very unnecessarily long movie), The characters are soul-less and cardboard like. Even Jackmans character is wayward and only saved by his convincing portrayal of a desperate man. Gylenhall is absolutely ornamental in this film... An empty shell of a character, poorly acted with little direction, and leaves you wondering why oh why did he take on this role.I promise you that if you a connoisseur of fine thrillers you will walk away from this film with a noticeably sore bottom and questioning yourself as to why oh why did IMDb members give it such a ridiculously high rating. Its a silly film about a very serious issue and is just not nationwide cinema release material.This movie is a 7/10 all the way and without Jackman would struggle to be a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense thriller that will keep you guessing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is the rare mainstream rated R mystery film that we hardly get from Hollywood anymore. It features an All-Star cast led by Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is an intense thriller that keeps the viewer guessing and never feels contrived.Prisoners is directed by relative newcomer Denis Villeneuve who handles the star-studded cast and the heavy subject matter like a director who has a lengthy filmography of well-crafted films. The film is well paced and expertly structured. Although Prisoners is two and a half hours long, it never seems to lag. Villeneuve elevates the story and characters so it doesn't feel like an episode of one of the many "whodunnit" TV shows that pollute our airwaves.Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a blue collar survivalist who has been preparing his entire life for the worst. When his daughter is kidnapped, it's something he could never have prepared for and he doesn't know how to deal with it. Feeling like he's let his family down and that the police aren't doing enough to find his daughter, Keller takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the recently released suspect who he is certain knows more about what happened to his daughter and her friend who was also kidnapped. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Detective Loki, a passionate investigator who has solved every case he's ever worked on. Detective Loki's past is never explained, but he sports neck and hand tattoos hinting that he might have had a turbulent past. Loki also has a nervous twitch of the eyes that gets worse as the film progresses and the pressure begins to mount.It's understandable considering Detective Loki has to deal with an indifferent police captain, a grieving father who has gone rogue and a mysterious case that seems to get weirder with each clue.The rest of the cast is rounded out by Maria Bello, who plays Dover's wife. She's not given a whole lot to do here and spends much of the film in a state of sedation. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play friends of the Dover's whose daughter was also kidnapped. They play the moral conscience to Keller as he starts going to extremes to get information about the whereabouts of the lost girls. Paul Dano, who is making a career of playing creepy crazy characters, plays Alex Jones, a mentally handicapped loner that is suspected of kidnapping the young girls. He plays the character with perfect balance. One second you want to bash his head in and the next you feel bad for him and can't help but feel he's being wrongly accused.Prisoners deals with the theme of religion very heavily. Characters are seen saying the Our Father and crucifixes can be seen dangling from rear view mirrors or hanging on walls. There are also themes of vengeance, resolution, justice.The other part of the film that stands out is the cinematography by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins who has been nominated for 10 Oscars for films such as Skyfall, Shawshank Redemption, True Grit, Doubt, No Country for Old Men and A Beautiful Mind just to name a few. Deakins cloaks the film in a blanket of gloom. Every scene seems to be cloudy and rainy. Every frame is saturated with looming despair.After a summer of caped crusaders, furious cars, Brad Pitt hating zombies, giant robots and really lonely rangers, Prisoners is perfect for anybody looking for a serious film experience. Prisoners delivers an intense thriller that includes great performances from some of the better actors working today. Including a career best performance for Jackman with a possible Oscar nomination on the horizon. For me, Prisoners is up there with recent mystery films like Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone and Zodiac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wolverine in a Domestic Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The less you know about the story of this film, the better. I went into the theater not knowing anything about "Prisoners" except for the names of its lead actors. I will not give you a synopsis so you can still watch the film without knowing the full story."Prisoners" attempts to transform a story about a neighborhood kidnapping into something more than just a crime film. When a member of your family becomes a victim of a crime, you will be imprisoned in your own sense of justice. It becomes a thought-provoking film which makes you question your own sense of morality.The atmosphere created by Director Denis Villeneuve is dark and heavy from the first frame, as Hugh Jackman intones the Lord's Prayer. The cold November rainy weather sets the mood very well. However, two and half hours of a relentlessly downcast mood can take its toll on the audiences. I did feel that the film lost its bearings somehow when scalding showers and snakes entered the scene.Whatever missteps of the story and direction is made up for by the talented actors who try their best to bring this turgid story to life. It becomes a compelling drama, better than what it may have appeared on paper. The stellar Oscar-caliber stars bring their A-game to this.Hugh Jackman is explosive here as Keller Dover, the parent with the more extreme reaction to the crime against his family. He is clearly in Wolverine mode here as he gets caught up in his own warped vigilantism. He goes over-the-top in a lot of disturbing scenes, but it was that quiet moment when he recognizes a bloody item of clothing that was his best scene.Jake Gyllenhaal does very well as the dedicated officer in charge of the case, with a name as unlikely as Detective Loki. His best scene is when he was driving through the freeway in the pouring rain with a bleeding wound on his head further distorting his vision, rushing to bring a dying person to the hospital.Maria Bello plays Keller's unstable wife, trapped by her own addiction to sleeping pills. I do not like her past work, but here she was actually good despite her irritating character. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis play the Birches, close friends of the Dovers. They are generally calm people but circumstances force them to turn a blind eye and even become accomplices to another crime.Paul Dano plays a mentally-challenged guy named Alex Jones. He somehow gets us to feel for his creepy character. Melissa Leo plays his adoptive mother Holly. Their behavior will keep you guessing as to their involvement in the case on hand.Overall, this can be a very compelling film that will keep you guessing. However, this is a lengthy, deliberately slow paced film. Despite its good intentions, I feel that it could have been edited into something less meandering and repetitive. A film like this dragged too long is bound to give rise to questionable plot devices and bad red herrings, and this one unfortunately has both.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prisoner of my Thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens with Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) hunting with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette). He utters a prayer as the deer wanders into the audience's vision. They say amen and Ralph shoots the deer. They drive home in heavy rain, while Keller gives his son a lecture about being prepared in life. They then return to home and the family goes to their neighbours for Thanksgiving dinner. He we are introduced to the very well written characters such as Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and his wife Nancy (Viola Davis). Both Keller and Terrence have young daughters around the same age, and they go outside to play. Keller's daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) asks her parents if she can go with Eliza (Zoe Soul), Terrence's daughter, back to her house to find her red whistle. But the family finds later she never asked her brother to come with her. They don't hear from the girls, and panic sets on. The girls are declared missing and it is Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is put on the case. He finds a man who was near girls last known location and brings him in. His name is Alex (Paul Dano) but unfortunately isn't able to tell them much else. Without evidence he is released, but Keller is certain Alex took his daughter, and he won't stop until he can find his daughter by any means necessary. The movie may be slow for people, but it takes its time to develop strong characters and creates a sense of realism from the performances. Hugh Jackman's character is so well done I was reminded of the desperate man performances of the past like James Stewart in Vertigo (1958) or Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven (1992). It's a very enduring character that I believe will be remembered fondly in the years to come. Another interesting performance is by Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki. He's a Detective who cares about the case but is open to all possibilities as film goes on. Even his image with the slicked back hair and tattoos are rather different from the strong moral sense he exhibits. But aside from the performances the cinematography stands out. The director of photography, Roger Deakins, uses slow zooms and out focus backgrounds with great editing to create a unique visual experience. Visually it compares to Deakins' other work like Skyfall (2012) and No Country for Old Men (2007). In the end Prisoners work on multiple levels and is a great film to see in theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good crime story, just not Mystic River.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best." Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) So you think someone can replicate the sinister Silence of the Lambs and the melodramatic Mystic River; well no one can because they are grand thrillers, fraught with suspense and depravity and peppered with audience desire for revenge.Prisoners is not pop-culturally as memorable as those chestnuts, but it is thrilling and complex like the crimes themselves. There's macabre fun if you don't demand all the holes be filled. Relax and see a good if not great crime story.Revenge in thrillers, from Death Wish to Zero Dark Thirty, ignites American audiences, perhaps from the uncertainty that they can handle all the bad guys around the world. Whatever, Prisoners gives nothing new except sterling performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (both should have Oscar nominations) and noirish cinematography from the grandmaster, Roger Deakins.Conyers, Pennsylvania's, Keller Dover and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) search for their abducted daughters, while police detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) does the footwork necessary to find them while the fathers vilify him for going too slowly. In that tension rests the film's best thematic gravity: How far will you go to find the abductor of your child? Writer Aaron Guzikowski's literary ambitions about theme are on the side of heavy handed (the symbology of the opening hunting scene and Loki's constantly blinking eyes?not seeing clearly, anyone?? are overripe).However, the dialogue is crisp and the scene shifts are expertly timed to keep us from asking too many logistical questions.The plot twists are not as bad as some might think, and the moral ambiguity where the ends justify the means is as much about the limitations of the judicial system as it is about unadorned vengeance: The audience is torn as they consider the morality of the fathers' actions. Who's to judge? Not I.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Prisoners" Better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Prisoners from the outside looked like any other kidnapped story such at Taken, however it was much more than that. Prisoners had an unbelievable cast to make the story become a reality, and kept the audience on the edge of their seats for the entirety of the film. I have read several reviews on this film that have stated that the film was predictable and boring, I am going to have to respecfully disagree in that regard. This film had so many twists and turns, I have no idea how anyone could have guessed the outcome from the very beginning. The film started as a very feel good film in my opinion, with the Dovers, and the Birches sharing the Thanksgiving Holiday together. Neighbors, and very good friends it made the viewer (me at least) feel at ease, and happy for the two families. I feel that these scenes really made the story more believable and made you feel more for the two families who would later have their daughters abducted. That is one reason in my opinion that made this film so suspenseful, and made the crowd root for Keller Dover(Hugh Jackman) to find his daughter, and the daughter of his great friend and neighbor Franklin Birch (Terrance Howard). The the fathers Mr. Dover, and Mr. Birch really showed, and portrayed the emotions of a struggling father who is worried sick about his daughter. They really show the length in which a father would go to save his daughter, and that he would put his own life on the line. Hugh Jackman, and Terrance Howard both did a great job at expressing those emotions. One went to more extremes than the other but, both showed what they would do to assure their daughters would come home safely. The wives played by Maria Bello and Viola Davis also did a great and convincing job of the struggles that a mother would experience in those conditions. Maria Bello played the wife of Keller Dover named Grace Dover. She really portrayed a struggling mother by turning to prescription drugs, and many freakouts about her baby girl who she wasn't sure was dead or alive. Mrs. Birch played by Viola Davis was emotional but strong. She pertook in the torturing of Alex Jones played by Paul Dano. The torturing was started by Keller Dover, who forced Frankilin Birch to partake. He later broke down and told his wife he later went and tried to get answers from Alex Jones who was assumed to have taken the two young girls. The siblings of the two young girls were also very well played. It showed that a older brother Ralph Dover, and older sister Birch were forced to grow up through the experience, and help in the investigation of the abduction of their younger siblings. Now, lets get away from the families and talk about Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal. I saw that one opinion stated that they were always one or two steps ahead of him in the investigation of the abduction. I think that, that is irrelevant while talking about the film, people watch movies and think about it differently. I believe that the actions, and investigating that Det. Loki took made sense, and is somewhat realistic, except for the amount of time it took to make the discovery. Jake Gyllenhaal did an amazing job playing a detective who is all business in the beginning of the investigation and then becomes emotionally invested in the discovery of the two abducted girls. I think that his seriousness and attention to detail during his investigation was very professional, and realistic. Becoming emotionally involved with a family who is missing a loved one is very easy to do, and he did a great job of showing that. In the end he found the two girls, however the movie ends without Keller Dover the rest of what happens is up the the viewers imagination. This is a great film, and great role played by Hugh Jackman, and the entire cast. They made the film come to life for me, and has been the best movie I have seen this year. My congratulations goes out to the cast, and crew of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Thriller with Beautiful Cinematography and Powerful Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Denis Villeneuve, according to his biography, quit his studies in entomology to pursue his love of filmmaking. I can easily argue that such was the best decision, for if not for him, we would not have been given this wonderful masterpiece. 'Prisoners' may just be the best movie I've seen all year. After leaving the theater, I was still left with awe in regard to the incredibly dark (and awesome) atmosphere. Hugh Jackman gives his best acting performance to date, and pretty much every actor casted was sensational.You can truly feel the various emotions and mental afflictions each character faces, as it builds up to the resolution of the mystery, piece by piece. The story seems simple at first, yet the execution is just so breathtaking and well-written, you are forced to stay at the edge of your seat. You may feel like it's slow-paced at first, but as you progress, you are gradually more and more indulged by the insightful atmosphere. However, in my opinion, the strongest element (and possibly the most Oscar-worthy) of this film is the cinematography. All of the rack focuses, slow panning wideshots, close-ups, etc., along with the dark color gradients and perfect lighting, totally sold the visual tone and storytelling aspect. I really do hope Roger Deakins does win an Oscar this time. His work in this movie was incredible!I don't really have any complaints. If you're looking for a dark thriller with powerful performances and prestigious photography, this is the movie for you this year! Do not miss out! 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a terrific thriller, done the way it should have been done in terms of script, cast, sets, everything. The problem is that a basic cog in the plot is just wrong. The explanation for why the crimes were committed (I'm trying hard to avoid spoilers) was to make people turn away from god. I believe that most of us know that nearly all child abductions by strangers are sexually motivated, but this movie goes out of its way to assure us that the girls were "never touched." Well, then, why keep them alive, just semi-conscious in the back room or in a hole in the ground? It's as if the terrible violence committed against one innocent in this movie were all the makers felt we could bear; the thought that the survivors had been raped apparently made them more queasy than what was done to a mentally deficient man. Had they been brave enough to allow the completely reasonable sexual motive be behind the crimes, this would have been, for me, a perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, Refreshing Film of the 2013 Fall Season (May Contain Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As expected, September gives its film lovers the chance to cleanse themselves of the uninspired and redundant movie season that is Summer. This month is the first of many that will give many cinemas across the globe freedom from reboots, remakes, rehashes, and the now-accepted void that is New Hollywood.Thus, the first cleanse offered, in my opinion, is the newly-released film, "Prisoners", starring Best Actor Oscar nominee Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. Focusing on a parent's worst nightmare, child abduction and possible murder, the film incessantly grabs you from the first frame to the last. Walking out of this film without any feelings of gut-wrenching or punching is impossible; unless, you are a complete sociopath intending to laugh at every scene.Jackman, plays Keller Dover, a loving husband, father, and carpenter in trade, who, along with his wife, Grace (played by Maria Bello in an understandably catatonic state throughout the movie), and friends/neighbors, Franklin and Nancy Birch (played gracefully by Terrance Howard and Best Actress Oscar nominee Viola Davis), find their worlds turned upside down by the kidnappings of their youngest children after Thanksgiving dinner.Seeking the help of Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki (No "Thor" jokes, please!), an officer seemingly dealing with demons of his own, the only information they have is the appearance and disappearance of a mysterious RV parked not far from the Birch home. A creepy man-child (played astonishingly by Paul Dano) is the prime suspect, questioned, held, and, of course, released after the required 48-hours. Without giving away spoilers, Jackman decides to place justice into his own hands.While I understand his position as a desperate father, I cannot condone the behavior because of the fine line of criminality that Dover exhibits between protector of his child and sadist. "Prisoners" director, Denis Villeneuve, sharply presents that case because, as a viewer, you want the children found, but at the same time, you feel that you're participating in a crime, while questioning whether or not the ends justify the means. More so, the Birches struggle to find which side of the coin they belong as well, and they often are the voices of reason. What follows Jackman's actions is a film of welcomed twists and turns that, as cliché and trite as it sounds nowadays, truly leave you by the edge of your seat.Therefore, I recommend this film (8 out of 10 Kashmirs). The performances are top-notch. Jackson never fails to deliver as he goes back and forth with both grief and depravity as he serves as the audience surrogate. While Gyllenhaal raises the bar as he plays the reluctant hero, both wary of the individuals involved and job weary, period. Plus, I did appreciate the nod to Gyllenhaal's early work in the much underrated "Zodiac". I will leave that nod unspoiled for those desiring to figure it out themselves. Last, but not least, I must give special applause to Paul Dano, who delivers the role as a constant enigma. Viewers never know if he's a great deceiver or a victim himself.While I cannot find fault with the film, the film's ending is a cool smack to the face. While mildly annoyed, it was a taste of the unexpected and rarely used sublime. "Prisoners" is a must-see film of the Fall season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is definitely one of the best movies of 2013. It is raw, gritty and incredibly suspenseful. My heart had problems beating in a calm rhythm at several scenes. The movie opens with the Dover family walking down to the Birch's house for a thanksgiving dinner. During the dinner, the two youngest girls of both families, goes running over to Dover's house to go looking for a blue whistle toy. Time passes, and no girl is seen or heard. After a desperate search without luck, they call the police. The police is lead by detective Loki. With only an RV as a trace the investigation begins. More will i not say. The less you know, the better. "Prisoners" is a movie which builds and builds. The suspense never stops. By a running time of approximately 2:30 hours, it never dragged. That is mostly because of the great cast, lead by Hugh Jackman ("X-Men" series, "The Prestige"), Jake Gyllenhaal ("Donnie Darko", "Jarhead") and Paul Dano ("Looper", "Little Miss Sunshine"). Credits must also be given to director Denis Villeneuve ("Enemy", "Polytechnique") for a very strong direction. A movie like this is all about the present of the actors. Very little is told of the background of any of the characters. And you can almost feel the characters past, express itself through their every action. So by all that being said. "Prisoners" is a masterful achievement. It is perfection on every level. And i believe it will be remembered for a long, long time. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Prisoners came out right near the end of my summer vacation. My mom and I wanted to see a movie and the choices were between it and Blue Jasmine. The 153 minute runtime was a bit daunting for us, so we went for the latter. Meanwhile, this movie did pretty well at the box-office and got rave reviews, which is odd considering I vaguely recall any sort of marketing campaign. It came out on DVD and it still passed under my radar. So now that I finally watched it, I realized: this is by far one of the best movies of 2013.I mean where do I begin? I sincerely regret not seeing this in theaters when I had the chance. Hugh Jackman plays Keller Dover, a devoutly religious man who married to Grace, played by Maria Bello. They have two kids, Ralph and Anna, and one Thanksgiving Day, they go to their friends the Birch's for dinner. Nancy and Franklin Birch, played by Viola Davis and Terrance Howard respectively, have two kids right around the same ages as the Dover's, named Eliza and Joy. Anna and Joy, the two youngest girls, suddenly disappear after leaving the house that afternoon. All suspicions point to an RV driven by Alex Jones, played exceptionally by Paul Dano, but when no hard evidence is found, he is set loose. Keller is convinced that Jones took the girls, and resorts to extreme measures in order to find out the truth. He kidnaps Jones and locks him in an apartment and proceeds to torture him over several days.On the law enforcement side of things, Detective Loki, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, spearheads the investigation chasing down leads and trying to find a new suspect. Tensions become elevated between him and Keller after no new suspects have been found, and Loki begins to gain suspicions about Keller, which leads him to follow him rather than looking for new clues. What follows is a finely crafted tale of loss and what we find ourselves capable of doing when we lose the ones we love.Jackman gives a phenomenal performance of a man driven to the edge of his beliefs, a man who will stop at nothing in order to find his daughter. Just like he questions his faith and morals, we too do not know how we are supposed to feel about his method of extracting information. He is so convinced that Jones took his daughter that we as the audience support him. But when he begins to torture Jones, we are left to question our ethics behind his choices. It is a tough moral issue. It is a true shame that Jackman got so little recognition for his performance. His transformation throughout the film is heartbreaking, and we see it all happen, with Jackman going all out delivering what is one of the best performances of his career. His wife however, completely shuts down and is utterly ignorant to the activities of her husband, who is constantly trying to protect and reassure her that everything is going to be alright while she descends into depression.Gyllenhaal too does a great job in his role. He is rough around the edges; giving us the feeling that he can't entirely be trusted (at least that was the case for me). But the scenes involving him and Jackman are some of the best in the film. The problem is we see Loki as a hindrance to Keller; he is constantly snooping around on him, we feel as though he is more harm than good to solving the case, and even though he is trying his hardest to find the girls, it appears that Keller is more likely to get information despite his morally questionable actions.What makes this movie so compelling is its utterly intense atmosphere. There are so many different layers of tension; whether it is between Keller and Loki, which consistently rises throughout the film, or between Keller and Franklin, and eventually himself, as they both begin to wonder if torturing Jones will really lead somewhere.Along with Jackman, Gyllenhaal, Dano, who all should have been praised during the award season, Melissa Leo, Howard, and Davis all give great performances. Leo plays the aunt of Jones, who has the greatest faith in her son, and is certain he didn't do anything.But I will not ruin any of the major plot points, because this movie continually surprised me with how well written and mysterious it is. I will say that the movie is a tad too long, and that might scare people off. It is also very intense and not for people looking for a casual kidnapping mystery movie. The plot could drag for some, but for me I was completely into it the whole time. The only little qualms I had were the underwriting of the other children of the Birch's and Dover's. They are pretty nonexistent for most of the movie and they could have been featured more in a way to show the stress on them as well as their parents.I sit here writing this and still find it unfathomable how this movie only got a Best Cinematography nod. Jackman was a tour-de-force, and definitely deserved some recognition. Heck, the writing could have gotten a Best Original Screenplay nomination over Blue Jasmine or Nebraska. But one nomination for this entire movie blows my mind. I will not let another movie like this slip underneath my radar. This movie could probably be considered the most underrated of 2013.So, if you want to watch a movie that will keep you guessing, that has fantastic performances, and that palpably intense, check Prisoners out. It is a little late now, but if I were to redo my Top of 2013 list, I would most definitely add this on there. Go watch this movie.Ragingfilm.com</fullReview>

I was worried it was going to be wrecked with a stupid ending like most movies are but they even managed to do well there. At times it was so powerful you almost felt like you were one of the parents. If other movies were only half this good!!

		<fullReview>We have the detective stating early on that the girls would never have gotten into the RV, but then he did not have the savvy to ask the next question - What did the get into? And instead of him having the RV torn apart he should have gotten the woman's car to search. I am sure there were fibers and prints galore in that car. And why didn't the police officer get the phone records for the suspect. It would have shown he called home that evening.How did they get taken? Simple - He called home and told her two girls were walking on the street. She came right over and he came out an invited the girls into the RV with a strong leer. They shrank away and the woman came up and comforted them and threatened the man with the police (to get their trust). She then offered to drive them home and that was that.More incompetent police work happened when the cop sat in the rain watching the loud and obnoxious man go into the liquor store. Then he noticed that he walked out and walked in the opposite direction, but then turned and saw the detective and came over. It just took a little more yelling at the detective for him to abandon his watching. A real police detective would have sent at least two men over in that area to watch. Sloppy police work.And what detective bangs a suspects head on a table and lets him get a gun?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I use to turn into a child under a Christmas tree when it comes to a promising thriller, I surely couldn't wait for this one. It didn't disappoint. Within the first few minutes an atmosphere is unwrapped that sucks you into its cold and rainy heart, beating slowly but disturbingly intense. The presence of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't interrupt at any time as they manage to develop highly believable characters in a dark and depressing yet fascinating setting. You might think that the story maybe isn't redefining the wheel, but it's told in such a deep and awfully calm way that you won't find any reasons to question it at all. It's power lies in dealing with natural human fears, which we probably never will be truly able to withstand. I don't like reviews getting too much into detail, as to my mind nearly every trailer does, so summing it up I would highly recommend this movie to everyone who likes suspense best served subliminal, such as in Mystic River, I Saw the Devil or The Hunt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this almost three weeks ago but was never really tempted to write a review. I've always liked writing reviews for movies, and i've always loved writing on IMDb, until recently. For some reason, I don't seem to agree with most of the reviews and ratings for many movies, but it's perfectly subjective whether a movie is good or not. Anyway, prisoners is not so bad. This movie has so much potential, especially with all the great actors in the movie. Unfortunately, the supposed to be great story line fell of short due to the darn long duration and not so convincing acting of the actors. First thing first, what's good about the movie. There are so many famous and talented actors in this movie. The idea of the story is actually quite good, it's a typical kidnap story but its not quite predictable. Now the bad thing about this movie. The story line is thrilling, but only during the first 30 minutes of the movie. Then the movie just drags the story all the way for almost 3 hours and didn't achieve much. Hell, even after i waited for 2 and a half hours , i still never got my ending. The movie didn't have an ending. It was an open ending, where the director doesn't give any closure to the story, leaving the audience to think and imagine for themselves whats going to happen next. The bunch of famous actors who are supposed to be talented were for some reason not talented at all in this movie. Their acting was terrible! No one was convincing whatsoever. Its like they didn't even bother trying. I'm so disappointed for many reasons. 1, the thriller was nice. 2, Hugh Jackman and a few other famous actors are in the movie. 3, the reviews are all so good. 4, thriller is my favorite movie genre and this movie was not that thrilling, on a scale of 1-10 the thrilling factor is maybe 3, and it was at the beginning of the movie when the children got kidnapped, oh and during the beat up session where the guy's face was shown all bloody and bloated. Overall, this movie deserves a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners is way better than it looks in the trailer. The trailer seems to give away all the secrets of the film upfront; it portrays the film as lacking depth, but in reality, it's just the trailer that misleads. There is much more to Prisoners than one may anticipate.The film stars Hugh Jackman (surprise, surprise) as Keller Dover. Jackman is having an over- exposure problem at this moment in his career. As the actor seems to appear in every other film released these days, this creates questions that shouldn't exist like, "What is the Wolverine doing in this movie Prisoners?" Nonetheless Jackman delivers a solid, if not dimensional performance. His energy keeps the movie constantly driving forward.The film opens with two working class families getting together to celebrate Thanksgiving. Festivities abound, but while the responsible adults of the film have their attentions focused elsewhere, their two little girls run outside to play, unchaperoned. By the time the girls' absence is noticed, it's too late. The girls are gone. They have been taken. The major conflict of the film then is how to get the girls back alive.This job falls on Detective Loki, (Jake Gyllenhaal) but when Loki fails to produce results quickly enough, Keller Dover decides to take the search for the girls, and for civil justice, into his own hands. Performance-wise, Gyllenhaal as Loki is the highlight of the film. He maintains a subtle, calm composure, which contrasts Keller's (Jackman's) constant flying-off-the-rails. Loki shows a certain vulnerability while still being able to pull off fast-pace action sequences in an authentic, believable way. He is very enjoyable to watch.The actual visual experience of Villeneuve's films is very important. His 2010 film Incendies made full use of wide and vast cinematography applied in exotic landscapes. This visual imagery captivated, but all the technique was there to serve the story, the plot developments, the characters. Incendies is a masterfully crafted tragedy and Villeneuve's commanding technique is evident too throughout Prisoners.Like Incendies the filters and tones that are applied to the film, as in the actual visual images on screen, are gloomy and sepia-toned. There's not a single sunny sky, a warm day, an orderly room. Sets are designed to feel dark and empty, the best scenes use sets that play with space, showing both the abundance of vacant space for some characters, while still emphasizing the feeling of enclosure felt by others. The use of light and dark, order and disorder, space, all things that cradle the actors performances, are created by Villeneuve, expertly.The suspense of the film continues all the way to the very end as Keller Dover's untamed compulsion to find the missing girls leads to a perfectly executed, nail biter of an ending.More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant thriller about the Far Right's dangerous righteousness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners obviously refers to the two abducted little girls. More significantly, the other major characters are themselves imprisoned by their own weakness/strength, especially their righteousness. Their faith in their own vision makes them morally weak and dangerous.In a Georgia city a professional, black family, the Birches, have befriended the less comfortable family of the construction worker Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman). This is Obama's America, where the old race lines have been altered. The John Birch society has given way to the affluent and accepted Franklin Birch family. But when the Birches, who know better, go along with the white man's sadistic schemes even the new liberal couple are morally compromised. The older Jones couple used to be evangelists until their son's death by cancer cast them from believers into -- not disbelievers, but killers waging war against God. You have to believe in God to wage war against Him; you just believe in your own vision more. By abducting and killing children they intend to drive their victims' families away from their faith. The drunken priest Loki interrogates is another fallen believer, an alcoholic sex predator who killed the ex-evangelist to prevent his taking other children. That is, all the religious characters have become vigilantes, killing under the authority of their own judgment. Dover seems Loki's opposite in temperament, a devoted family man who raises his son to kill deer. He prays before killing, to put his evil in God's service. He hangs crosses and plays Christian radio in his car. But his temper and violence are most unChristian, especially when he unleashes them upon the pathetic man Alex Jones (Paul Dano) with his 10-year-old's mind. But Loki discovers he is more like Dover than he realized. He erupts at his suspect, enabling him to grab his revolver and kill himself. Both men's violence imperils the little girls' survival, not to mention their own soul -- and legal standing. Like the religious figures with their sense of mission, Dover is driven by his righteousness. He has absolute confidence in his intuition. That's how he justifies torturing the helpless Jones . When Loki's violence erupts he also shows Dover's dependence upon intuition, which proves wrong. Thinking he is heading off Dover, Loki races to Dover's father's ruined apartment, where he finds the imprisoned Jones. But Dover has discovered Holly Jones's (Melissa Leo) guilt and has sped there instead. Both men's righteousness imperils their cause and proves unjust and disastrous. The case is solved despite -- not because of -- the two central male characters' different confidence in their respective visions. The mazes relate to the righteousness theme because they promise a path, however tortuous, that will lead either in to the center or out to freedom. But the maze on the corpse's medallion offers no successful path. To get to the center you have to ignore the path -- that is, logic, law, social system, ethical imperatives -- and just leap to the center. That's the emblem of the righteous. They don't need to go through or to respect ordinary processes. They have their inner vision and they know they are right. Here that's the route to disaster -- something like the Tea Party "hearing the people" and shutting down the government, as it happens. (Remember, this is Obama's America.) As the maze drawings resemble the snake drawings the cases of snakes evoke the shallow righteousness that cost man Eden. In respect for the maze there are two (obligatory) car chases but the only crash is the van in the forest. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full of suspense, emotions and drama! Best movie in 2013 to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought- provoking crime drama thriller. Unlike Taken or Man On Fire, Prisoners is full of emotions as a family is put through its darkest hours. The suspense never lets up. Throughout the film you feel Dover's pain, anger and moral struggles as he deals with this situation. The director does a brilliant job keeping the audiences deep into the emotions of the family despite the fact that Dover himself kidnap Alex Jones, locks him up for days and brutally tortures him just to know the whereabouts of his daughter. This movie explores the issue of moral ambiguity, and it shows just how far desperation can change a loving father into a cruel, heartless person just to protect his own family. With his daughter's chance of survival diminishing each seconds, is Dover's action justified? That's a question for you to ponder.The two leads, Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal give the career best performance in my opinion. Jackman tears into scenes in a way we've never seen him and layers his character with plenty of affection, empathy, grief, and rage. It's his best dramatic endeavor he's ever done. As Detective Loki, Gyllenhaal stands firm and tall in one of the year's finest performances. Terrifically executed as a man disconnected from real emotion, he finds himself enamored by the mystery surrounding two missing girls. But the most surprising performance comes from Paul Dano. His character, Alex Jones was mentally-challenged, and has an IQ of that 10-year-old kid. This is a difficult character to play, but Paul manages to make that character his own by his superb portrayal of Alex.The plot is a wonderful puzzle, unraveling slowly to reveal hidden layers of depth and complexity. At 153 minutes, the film is detailed, precise, and engaging nearly throughout. With a mix of top-notch cinematography, remarkably unsettling music, superb performances, and a thrilling/powerful story, Prisoners will definitely be one of this year's features that will surely be remembered.Final Verdict: 8.5/10. If you love films that explore more than just entertainment, such as important themes and moral ambiguity as a whole, you cannot go wrong with Prisoners. I would not recommend skipping out on Prisoners unless you're of the type that prefers more lighthearted and fun movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daddy's Gone A-Hunting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is highly recommended. Emotions always run high whenever a child is in peril. For years, the hostage drama has been a successful staple in the crime drama genre. Films dealing with child abduction have been a mixed lot, from the sublime (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone) to the good (Raising Arizona, The Changeling), from the mediocre (Ransom, Man on Fire) to the ridiculous (Taken, Labyrinth, Bunny Lake is Missing). Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners belongs in that upper echelon of superior dramas. The film begins as a standard emotional melodrama about the aftermath of a child kidnapping before veering into a gripping story of vengeance and vigilantism. This is a film where bigger issues come into play. It doesn't play safe by being just a well-meaning routine crime drama. Instead, the filmmakers would rather deal with the gut-wrenching consequences done by flawed individuals and the backlash caused by revenge and retaliation in the name of justice.Over Thanksgiving dinner, two children go missing. An investigation ensues, leading one detective to a possible suspect, a mentally challenged loner who was near the scene of the crime. But with little evidence to hold him and time running out, a father decides to intervene and takes matters into his own hands.Hugh Jackman plays that father, Keller Dover, a devout Christian, an everyman who loves and protects his family at any cost. Jackman has some dark and sadistic scenes to play and his emotional range as the conflicted dad is beyond riveting. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Loki, the lead detective on the case and the actor delivers a multi-layered performance as an obsessed investigator in search of answers. Maria Bello is Keller's distraught and supportive wife, Grace. Terence Howard and Viola Davis are the other couple who are swept into this crisis and all of three actors are at the top of their game. Playing the primary suspect is Paul Dano, whose expertise in creating creepy characters comes in quite handy, along with Melissa Leo as his quirky and loyal mother.Villeneuve's direction is lean and concise. He shows some disturbing graphic imagery to incite the necessary rationale to make the audience possibly justify the acts of violence throughout the film while debating ethical questions about the brutality: When do the ends justify the means? At what price does one trade their moral conscience for justice? How far can one desperate act go to surpass another? (Warning: This is not a film for the easily squeamish or overly sensitive film-goer.)From the start, Prisoners captures the moviegoer's attention and never lets go. It is a tension- filled mystery with some surprising twists amid the moral dilemmas. The film is thoroughly engrossing due to a literate and perspective script by Aaron Guzikowski which takes its time to build characters and flesh out its plot. Add to that, some terrific acting from an outstanding ensemble, Villeneuve's solid direction, and you have one of the best films of the year. (My only reservation is a deliberately ambiguous ending that tends to mar the film's overall impact.)Prisoners works on so many varied levels: as an intense crime thriller about child abduction, an emotional melodrama about a family in crisis, or as a dark parable about the violent world we live in. See Prisoners for any of those reasons, but by all means, make sure you see this film. GRADE: B+ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bait and Switch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners offers itself as a "thriller" that transcends the genre, but the hype is a con job. It's too slow-paced to generate real gut level excitement, too logically flawed for the intellectual appeal it strives for. Naturally, there's an emotional reaction to the chilling theme of child abduction. That along with the overall quality of the filmmaking will briefly create the impression that this is serious stuff. The rambunctious performance of Hugh Jackman as the semi-civilized father of the abducted child and fine performances across the board, notably Jack Gyllenhaal as the detective, will also earn some admiration. But the notion that this is a great movie is a fleeting illusion. This movie will be soon forgotten. Taken, the Liam Neelson thriller, wanted simply to rescue a daughter in dire distress, and does so in wildly entertaining fashion. Prisoners wants to explore the nature of morality in an extreme situation, such as when the life of one's child is on the line. Good concept. I wish it had succeeded, but it doesn't. It wants to be thought-provoking, but it's a straw-man argument of a movie. No one, all things considered, condones the conduct of the child's father?not because it's violent, but because it's ineffectual. Dad is throwing a tantrum that's an obstacle to the success of the mission. That becomes apparent almost immediately. Prisoners demonstrates the futility of violence by contrivance. It's scripted to be futile. Two little girls are abducted while their families are at a Thanksgiving get-together. Hugh Jackman's character, a gun totting suburban survivalist (I've got several of them on my block? okay, don't believe me.), who has little patience with the authority's effort to solve the case. Outraged when the police release a promising suspect?a young man with the "mind of a ten year old"?he goes vigilante on the guy and imprisons him in an abandoned building. Using his fists and a scalding shower, he is relentless in his efforts to get a confession from a pathetic masochist who doesn't have much to say. Oh well, let's give it one more day. One more left hook? One more hot shower? Meanwhile, check out what's in the basement of a disgraced former priest? Is that a clue? Who cares? Solving the mystery isn't what this is all about. If standard police procedure would have found the kids (or their bodies)in the first act, then let's not get bogged down with standard police procedure. Who's got time to trail a suspect and conduct searches. Someone is trying to offer insight into the human condition here, not mere entertainment. Such lofty ambition, only to lose sight of the job at hand.What we get is bait and switch.The ending is either a moral cop-out or a clever gimmick. You get to choose the fate of the central character, based on whether you think dad is a hero or a demon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackman reaches new heights in the depths of hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy to compare this film to many classics that came before. Maybe they served as inspiration to produce something that would make any of the masters proud. Polanski, De Palma, Hitchcock, and Demme come to mind. Here is a director who has availed himself of what could rank with the best scripts ever written: a piece so tightly constructed is almost impossible to look away. We are grabbed right away when the children are abducted, and slowly the grip tightens until it's almost unbearable. We want to know the truth, we want to relax and hope for the best, but this is not going to be a smooth ride by any means.Two daughters disappear during the holidays. We have obvious suspects, but as we soon learn, the investigation will not be short or simple. The trail grows cold, and we have many frustrated parties. The police hits a dead end. One of the parents goes absolutely mad with rage and despair. Another succumbs when she is unable to look at evil on the face. The other couple feels helpless, and the younger siblings are also undergoing their own torment.One of the suspects appears unable to communicate what he might know, and this leads him to become an abducted of sorts. Before we notice, we have another possible criminal darting and out of the picture. In less capable hands, we would feel like we're being cheated, but this is a valid move by the writers, and it pays off handsomely in the end. A maze becomes an essential key to solving the problem, but this maze is a hell of a challenge.As we reach the last third of the film, we begin to reach the conclusion, but instead of losing steam, the film becomes even more gripping, giving us satisfaction unlike nothing seen in recent movies. The last time I sat at the edge of my chair was in 1991 when Clarisse wandered into hell at the end of her quest. There is an obvious tribute to that film here, and it will be talked about for ages because it at the forefront in this film's conclusion, a moment that is bound to become a classic.Jackman, Davis, Howard, Leo, Bello, and Gyllenthal do some of the best work in decades, but if we are to single out a performance, we have Jackman as the tortured father who might not like what he discovers as he searches for his daughter. It is a devastating performance, one to be studied and discussed because it shows what an actor is able to do with the right support: a beautiful script, a director who values and understand what is important in the making of a movie and doesn't rely on technology or gimmicks, and an actor who knows that in order to play any role, he must dig deep and not hold back. Jackman does just this and we are in awe.Just remember these words: THE END. The way you see any other conclusion this year will never be the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Day Hitchcock Suspense Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners was an Awesome Movie Experience. So far my favorite Movie of 2013. The Director along with all the main character actors were spot on. This movie kept me riveted to my seat the entire 2 hours, when I actually needed to go to the *%#*room. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal were indeed amazing in their lead actor rolls.Have just recently seen some of Alfred Hitchock's All Time Classics: Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, Rear Window and prisoners fits in with these well. It is also very similar to the "Silence Of The Lambs".Can't think of too much more to say But this Flick is definitely a Sleeper Hit Movie. Way Back When, I don't think "Silence" had much beginning hype. It was the word of mouth that brought more folks out to see that Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly Perfect Suspense Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buckle up and hang on tight as this movie make you feel as if you are on the roller coaster of emotions along with the families--and the cop--in this movie. Starting slowly, but not too slow, this story sucks us in and weaves a very believable but every-parent's-nightmare scenario. Plot twists and turns keep you guessing as you become drawn to and/or repulsed by the characters in the movie, and how their lives and personalities evolve over the course of a week. Excellent performances by all.My only (slight) criticism is that I would have liked to see the older siblings' characters developed more deeply, but that does not take away from the film at all.DO NOT read anything with "spoilers" or discuss the movie with anyone unless you have ALL seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this taut, this edge or your seat, and just a plain old riveting. First let's look at the actors Jackman gives a career performance, I've gotten so used to him as Wolverine I had almost forgotten this guy is an outstanding actor. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a wonderful performance as the detective. A very small role for both actress' (Belo and Davis) but they both give nice performances when they are on screen.What I really loved about this movie was it didn't try and beat you over the head with the plot and turns, it assumed that the audience weren't a bunch of drooling idiots. It points you subtly in the right direction and lets you figure out the rest on your own. I will credit the director for this.The characters are so well written and well acted, each of them are three dimensional, and they will keep you guessing throughout the entire film as to who the bad guys and the good guys are.All I can say to you the potential viewer is get this movie, get a big thing of popcorn and extra large drink because you are NOT going to want miss a minute of this movie, in fact you really don't want to pause it either.</fullReview>

But when you pass the 20 minute mark you'll find yourself not noticing that and sitting on the edge of your seat for the rest 133. I won't waste your time telling you about how brilliant the soon-to-be Oscar nominees and winners were, acting was superb. With a cast like this I take it for granted. The director should get some praises, please endorse him. So, about the movie: this in-the-beginning-slow-paced drama pretty quickly turns into a nightmare and the director manages to keep up the pace till the very end. I just wish he cut the cord at the very first whistle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best film of the year, that takes many prisoners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a film that will haunt me for a while. The story is so well constructed in not your A-Z form. There's a very realistic approach to it's unhurried plot, and how it quickly unfolds in the helplessness of the two dads, friends whose little girls have been snatched, supposedly by a faceless guy, couple, loitering around the area in an suspicious RV, in the cold frosty air. This is one of many films built around the child napping scenario, the disturbing type ones, that have run more common thing in the last couple of years (Taken, The Flock) this one never more effective, though these aren't teenagers, they're kids. Prisoners works, not just because of the A level performances, some so bloody convincing, but the realistic standpoint of the characters in how they deal with the situations. We so much feel helplessness with the driven father Jackson, who resorts to kidnapping and torturing a mum, childlike suspect, you want him so much to talk, where at one point, you realize it's gonna be like getting blood out of a stone, the girl's fates, waning, or may'be already determined. Jackson does get bloody here, mind you, while his mate, not an advocate, is reversely the opposite. "Christ, your little girl's been snatched man", but the reverse contrast in these two characters works. At one point, as Jackman's "Where's my daughter", reaches a shouting pinnacle, this just reminds us of what a great dramatic actor he is. But Gylenhall, is just fantastic, as the driven cop, carving another notch under his acting belt. He brings some truly unnerving moments to his character, that you don't when he'll pop his top next. There are some sick themes to the film too, (the snakes in those containers) in a film that touches on a disturbing subject. Playing out to nearly two and a half hours, Prisoners is a rewarding experience to the movie goer, though on the other hand, you may have to allow the effect and memory of this movie to dissipate days after the view. Just cautioning some here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies of the year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the weekend I decided to pop into the movies again, this time I went to see Prisoners. The moment I saw this trailer I knew it had potential to be a great movie. The cast is star-studded with Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrence Howard and Maria Bello. Well with all that being said lets dive right into the 9 things I liked and didn't like about Prisoners.http://thesportsscript.com/2013/09/24/prisoners-movie-review/1. Denis Villeneuve was the director of this film and I had previously never even heard of the guy, which was kind of scary because this movie looked good but the thought of a director whose never really done a big style film was concerning.But Villeneuve nailed it; from start to finish he kept you on the edge of your seat and kept you guessing throughout the movie. The pain and anguish you felt for this family was heartbreaking, you couldn't help but want to see this family get his retribution.2. This movie had a great story (Aaron Guzikowski penned this). They made you care about the characters, they didn't make you feel dumb by any means and they even got you to feel for Alex Jones (Paul Dano) which that in itself was amazing. Guzikowski has a sick mind for sure to write this movie but the writing on this was just brilliant and the fact that Villeneuve was able to translate that to the big screen so well was great.3. Hugh Jackman: It doesn't get bigger than Jackman. He is a star and he showed why in this movie. He played an intense, caring and fight to the death father that just wanted his daughter back. You slowly watch Keller Dover (Jackman) transform from a concerned father into a guy that was willing to do anything to find his daughter. A lot of people said "Oscar talk" before this and I was like that is a big statement to make but as of right now Jackman has to be a front-runner for Best Actor.4. Jake Gyllenhaal: Jake is easily one of my favorite actors, he has played in some really god movies over the past few years (End of Watch, Source Code &amp; Brothers). He rivaled Jackman with his performance in this. He played Detective Loki, who was in charge of finding these little girls and knocked it out of the park.5. Paul Dano: Dano was on the big screen with some big stars in this and held his own just fine. The way he portrayed Alex Jones, a timid scared and very creepy adult that wasn't all there, he nailed it. His character was written so well that you couldn't help but feel for him towards the end of the film.6. The rest of the cast: Terrence Howard, Maria Bello, Viola Davis &amp; others. Perfect casting for this film, Howard was great for this role and was interesting to see his character (Franklin Birch) turn into the guy that Kellen Dover wanted him to be and not who he thought he should be. Viola Davis didn't have too much screen time but one scene in particular she was amazing. I won't spoil it, you will just know whenever you see it. I think the Grace Dover character was made for Maria Bello and nobody else. A movie is only as good as its cast and this showed it.7. The emotion: I am a huge movie guy and will give just about any movie at least one shot. But the bad thing is seeing so many movies you find it hard to care about characters. Only really good movies get me to care and this was one of them. I was emotionally invested into each role; though it was a tad long they still kept the movie going at a steady pace. Whether it was Dover (Jackman) just beating Jones (Dano) into a bloody pulp or Grace (Bello) just crawled into a ball on a bed crying missing her kid, you felt what they felt. That is what makes a great movie and boy was this a damn good movie.8. Kept you guessing: I love a movie where you sit through the movie and just keep trying to guess who is the killer or who is this or that. This was that movie; I was sitting there next to my brother and just trying to figure out where they were going with the movie. I would think it was going to go right and they hooked a left 4 streets before that right. They led you to believe many different things and none of which really came to fruition.9. The payoff: I refuse to spoil any of the ending for you guys but what a freaking ending. (That is all I will say about that) If you have seen this movie, please leave a comment below on your thoughts on the ending. Would love to hear what people thought of it.The Verdict:5 out of 5 starsVilleneuve &amp; Guzikowski teamed up to bring what I think is a top 5 movie of the year so far, actually might be the best movie I've seen this year. Just a fun thrilling ride start to finish that keeps you guessing at every turn. Two Oscar worthy performances by Jackman and Gyllenhaal, a supporting cast and an amazing movie that will keep you talking about it for days.http://thesportsscript.com/2013/09/24/prisoners-movie-review/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Performances. Intense To The Max!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one intense and drawn out film, maybe too much so. I wonder if this movie really had to be over two hours long? It felt even longer but not always in a tedious way. The subject matter is extremely heavy and morose and there is no break for the viewer right through the conclusion. (BTW- the ending elicited many gasps, muttering and even consternation from the crowd I saw it with.) The performances really are superbly intense, believable and even award worthy. There are a few scenes where you really feel emotional pain ooze from the screen. Maria Bello, Viola Davis, Terrence Howard and especially Hugh Jackman each give us at least one scene that breaks the heart. It's powerful, intense acting at its most emotional peak. Despite the great performances however, this really is a one and done film for me. I recommend it but I can't say I'd ever want to see or experience it ever again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit long. But intriguing. I just have so many unanswered questions though, that I wish somebody could answer for me. The main one being "why"? If you see the film, you will know the reason I am asking that...too many loose ends... Jackman and Gyllenhall are good in this..as are Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, and Melissa Leo..though their roles are very small. At 2 /2 hours is does however keep you interested. The first few scenes are contrived..but then it ropes you in. The cinematography is gritty and grainy, and not a film for kids. It is pretty brutal in places but not gratuitous. This is a film worth seeing, with the tension of the film "Ransom" If you like movies that keep you guessing and wondering what happens next this is for you. The director seems to really know where to put the camera to make you feel like you are there. Gyllenhall gives a troubled performance worthy to see. Jackman at times seems wooden, and tries very hard to go to places to make you feel for him. Viola Davis is always good, and the few moments she has you feel for her as well. This film is worth going to and not waiting for the video to be released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the worst movies ever. The plot was slow and excessively idiotic. Either the majority of human beings who rated this movie above 7 are all imbeciles (it's quite possible that they are), or the algorithm of rating is skewed. The story of the priest, the killer and his old disgusting wife and the rest of it is unbelievable. We feel no sympathy for any character. The idiotic Alex is repulsive and him getting beaten is warranted, he should have been beaten more even though he turned out to be an innocent victim in the end. The end is poor beyond belief... The girls are found and the father disappears because the old woman kills him ?!!! an old fat freak, he could have easily knocked her down even while half-asleep but he didn't. What's the point in writing more... In the end I do not blame the writers or the actors for they are known to be stupid but I am very disappointed with the IMDb users who rated that movie as high as 8/10... Really there are so many retards in this world.</fullReview>

Films story is about how two young girls are kidnapped what both families do,what the cops do, what mystery's unravel form the crux of the story. Not enough words to explain the brilliance of the film, this film falls into the genre of film like silence of lambs and zodiac, like those films prisoners has some scenes which may be hard to digest, and gruesome.

		<fullReview>Super disturbing, creepy, angry and violent with an absolute sense of dread throughout. One of those movies that I wonder why I'm watching because it makes me so uncomfortable. I'm glad I stuck with this though because it also ended up also being one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.A bit of a slow burn, heavy on the dialogue and maybe too long but masterful storytelling that never went where I was expecting, with many moments when the dots connected and I was like oh wow that's what the significance of "that" is or he has "that" to make noise with. Multiple red herrings in the suspect arena too.The acting here is also just fantastic, Oscar worthy performances from Hugh Jackman as he takes matters into his own hands when his daughter and her friend go missing; I have never seen him in a role like this before angry, possessed driven to the point of crazy decisions. Jake Gyllenhaal is also amazing as the detective assigned to the case and Melissa Leo, I didn't even recognize her. Can't go wrong with Terrence Howard or Viola Davis either who play the parents of the other missing girl.Also nice to see a movie (these days) that doesn't rely on special effects, superheroes or crazy action sequences to tell its story. Ultimately one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.4/27/16</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just love this movie, it's so well made all around. I watched it when in came out a few years ago in theater, and again recently. This is how you do a crime thriller, very rarely can you find such complex and detailed characters. All the actors did an amazing job of making these characters and situations feel real. I think these might be my favorite performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal. I feel that you could watch this movie multiple times without getting bored, there's just so much to think about during and after. The car scene at the end in particular has to be one of my favorite things I've ever seen. I can't even believe how investing and powerful it is, it blows my mind. Not to mention beautiful! The tone and look of the entire film are wonderful. I can't recommend this movie enough to be honest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to believe that Hugh Jackman, who stars in turds like "The Wolverine", "Movie 43" and more, can actually be so effective in movies such as "The Prestige" and this one.I knew nothing about the movie before watching it, thought it would be an action film. It's not, it's a thriller. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, only that I didn't find it very satisfactory and I didn't feel everything "fell into place" at the end (actually, I'm not sure I understand what were the parts of all the people involved and what the point of the movie was). Also, I think the writer had some influence from The Vanishing. It felt like a mish-mash of ideas from several thriller movies.Good acting by the entire cast, especially Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal and Paul Dano (even Terrence Howard was bearable; and man, Maria Bello got old! She looks at least in her 50's), good low-key score by Johann Johannsson. I was surprised to see that the DP was Roger Deakins - his cinematography is usually more impressive.All in all, it's an OK movie, but lacking, with plot that is full of holes and stuff that leads nowhere. I don't understand how it got such a high rating on IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Suspenseful Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners explores the various talents and relies on its leads Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, and they deliver great performances in this suspenseful crime thriller. It's Thanksgiving in suburban Pennsylvania when two little girls go missing. Jackman is riveting as Keller Dover, a tightly wound, deeply religious, and apocalyptically inclined survivalist father of 6-year-old Anna. Bello, as his wife Grace, is less prone to the creeping, religiously tinged paranoia, but utterly believable in her shroud of shattered normalcy.Also missing is 7-year-old Joy, the daughter of next-door neighbors Franklin and Nancy Birch (Howard and Davis). Gyllenhaal is the twitchy, blinking Detective Loki, who is called in to investigate, and Dano plays a mysterious RV-driving drifter who has mental health issues and is quickly nabbed as the obvious suspect. But, as in the aforementioned Zodiac (which also starred Gyllenhaal), few things are what they at first seem.Prisoners runs at 153 minutes but watching and paying close attention, the film does not feel nearly as long, and every minute within the second half is entertaining, and gripping. Much complaint at how the ending's last 20-30 minutes are but I am in agreement that it is not therefore predictable but a lasting touch. There are several clues that are shown before then, and it is a great watch to see the final end result.</fullReview>

The cast was perfect, Gyllenhaal and Jackman give us one of their well known Oscar acting.The movie always lets the viewer in suspense, with unpredictability and twists from now on. The movie itself isn't that hard to understand, but it's also not of the usual cliché' stories where you know since the start what is going to happen.Near perfect and flawless movie, well acted, well built, great dark and gritty atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still at a Lost for Words!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember how I reacted after seeing Prisoners for the first time when it was released in theaters. It was one of the best thrillers I have ever seen and it was a disturbing watch. Now viewing it for a second time, those thoughts stay the same. The two and a half hour long movie takes the slow burn approach in telling the story, but that makes it even the better. Roger Deakin's cinematography is very effective as he draws on bleak, cold colors to bring us a constant sense of foreboding. I have never seen a movie as tense and it was almost a relief when the credits finally rolled up. But this is the kind of movie that will stay with you for weeks on end.Denis Villeneuve's film is about a man named Keller Dover who does all he can including bending the law to find his missing daughter who just suddenly disappeared with her friend after Thanksgiving dinner. There is Detective Loki who is assigned to the case and he must keep an eye on Keller while he puts all of his effort in finding the missing girls.There are no words to describe the acting of the film because it's just so darn good. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are the stars of the show as they deliver career-best performances. Hugh is fantastic as the screaming and clawing Dover who goes beyond the law to achieve his means. Gyllenhaal is the smart detective whose mannerisms including those facial tics are part of the character and his personality. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis deliver magnificent performances as the other kidnapped girls parents. Paul Dano was excellent as one of the suspects who can hardly utter a word. Finally, Melissa Leo is beyond recognizable as she delivers a creepy performance.Overall, Prisoners is not entertaining in a sense you would call a blockbuster, but it's a character study that shows what a parent would do to protect his loved ones. It's an undeniably a hard watch, but it may be worth that. This is the kind of film that you will never forget and it's a shame how this film got snubbed by the Academy. This is a foreboding, dark crime thriller and is one of the best films of 2013. Also for that ending......well it's an open book and everyone may have their own interpretations. I didn't like it too much the first time around, but it grew on me for the second time. The film surely packs a punch. I rate this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>watching the first twenty minutes of the movie you know that it won't disappoint, unlike all crime thrillers and movies based on abduction this was different because it was never about the motive, nor the reason for the abduction was never resolved, it was solely based on the emotions and struggle of a family which had just lost their daughter on thanksgiving day.The scenes which show Mr dover struggling and harassing Alex Jones (dano) were truly beautifully portrayed by Jackman, Hugh Jackman know most popularly for his role as the wolverine bought the same level of energy and enthusiasm into playing Keller dover, Jake gyllenhaal who is know to play dark and mysterious roles, did not disappoint. Terrance Howard, maria bello, and viola Davis bought great depth and emotion into the movie with a beautifully crafted script by Aron guzikowski, the cinematography is something which has to be truly appreciated, roger deakins who is probably one of the best in the business, brought this movie to a whole new level, overall an elegantly crafted crime thriller by Dennis villeneuve</fullReview>

Builds the suspense well, and keeps you engaged the whole time. You would not know the movie is nearly 2 1/2 hours long it is so gripping and suspenseful and flows so well.Solid performance from Hugh Jackman. However, he is upstaged by Jake Gyllenhaal as the detective. Fantastic performance by him. He seemed to totally immerse himself in the role, down to nervous / sleep- deprived ticks.Good support from Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano and Melissa Leo.Great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(73%) Without too much doubt this is one of the better films of the year, with its fantastically solid direction, Oscar worthy performances, a great script/plot that keeps you guessing until the end, but my god is it a hard film to sit through at times. It really is the most bleak and joyless productions since 2009's "The road" and I have rarely ever seen anything as good and yet wanted it to be over quite as much as this trip into a very real (yet still a little Hollywood) hell. The roads this goes down are the stuff of actual nightmares, and when that is combined with the very grim, cold setting it makes for an increasingly oppressive feel. This is good enough to come highly recommended, and it it one of the best modern mystery movies I've ever seen, but be aware of the unrelenting ill mood that is so well done that it's almost a trial to sit through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful and brooding masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRISONERS is an intense, unforgettable look at how far people go to protect the ones they love. Excellent performances, beautiful cinematography and a haunting soundtrack combine to create one of the best films this year. The story is about two girls who are abducted, and the ensuing investigation. One of the parents (played by Hugh Jackman) is not satisfied with how the police are doing their job, and takes it upon himself to do some investigating of his own. What follows is a journey into the abyss and dark recesses of the human soul as the rules are bent (and broken) in an attempt to solve the mystery and find closure. I don't want to give anything else away, as that would severely reduce the emotional impact. This movie does what most can't, and maintains an almost unbearable level of tension throughout it's entire run time, which is about two and a half hours. Everyone of the leads is on their A-game, and bring such pathos to their characters that you can't help but identify and sympathize with them. Of course, who couldn't given the subject matter (unless you're a psychopath)? This is greatly enhanced by a lurking sense of dread conveyed brilliantly by the cinematography (courtesy of Roger Deakins, and deserving of an Oscar) and a haunting score. You just can't take your eyes off of the screen, and you'll never want to check your watch, it's that good. Overall, this is one of the best movies I've seen all year and I highly recommend you check it out...without kids present, preferably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>meticulous direction and phenomenal acting amalgamate for a deep, dark, and disturbing mystery/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners follows the story of two little girls who go missing on Thanksgiving. A detective (Jake Gyllenhaal) hunts down several people and does everything he can to solve the case. Meanwhile, one of the girl's fathers (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Prisoners is such an incredibly made movie; each shot is diligently crafted, each piece of dialogue is captivating and dramatic. The atmosphere is very dark, gloomy, and creepy. It is almost like that of a horror movie. For example, the use of differed weather is used in may scenes. Rain, snow, hail, wind, etc., is used to create a specific mood for each scene and setting. The characters are well-developed and interesting. In fact there are many character traits that have nothing to do with the story; they are there simply for background. The acting is amazing. Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and all the supporting actors give great performances. The movie is very suspenseful and sucks you into the story within the first ten minutes. That being said, despite the two and a half hour run-time, I was not bored for one second! The entire movie has a pervasive feeling of dread and unpleasantness. The entire thing is very emotionally disturbing, depressing, and hard to watch. For that reason not all audiences will enjoy this movie, but for people looking for an intense and suspenseful thriller, Prisoners is perfect for you. I also LOVED the ending. Some people complain about it but I found it to be the perfect ending to a perfect movie.</fullReview>

You need to be patient and thoughtful in watching this movie. You can feel you emotions wanting to take you down the vigilante path, but you also see the repercussions of those choices...and this is where Gyllenhaal shines....because he truly wants justice just as bad as Jackman does...even vigilante justice but he wants it done to his code...his way. Again...be patient and just enjoy the suspense and the thrill. It is one of the few movies well worth your time.

		<fullReview>Prisoners is one of the most satisfying movie-going experiences I've ever had. The story opens in a dark and foreboding country town, shot beautifully by the masterful Roger Deakins. Soon after we meet Keller Dover, his innocent little girl vanishes without a trace. Thanks to the spectacularly dark performance by Hugh Jackman, the pain and anguish is felt like nothing else. The original suspect, Alex Jones (played by a perfectly cast Paul Dano) implies his own guilt to Dover, and it is this moment that sets the story and what the title "Prisoners" actually means.How far is Dover willing to go to find his daughter, the literal prisoner of an unknown captor? Detective Loki is imprisoned by his impeccable reputation, which means that he feels even greater pressure to find and rescue the girls. The film is spectacularly written, with red herrings that give the audience doubt that one character is on the right track, only to sideswipe them with a revelation that not only keeps you guessing, but fits superbly into the overall story. The story doesn't feel forced for even a moment, and everything pieces together for a superb overall take. The direction is spectacular, creating a lingering sense of dread that permeates the picture. One of the most underrated films of 2013, Prisoners sees Jackman is at his absolute best and is a superbly satisfying drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is an outstanding film that surprised me. It is so realistic, and even though the story line isn't the most original, the story feels fresh and harsh. The performances are outstanding and every character feels real and lends to the film. Hugh Jackman plays a stern father who lies in a gray area of morality, and is worn down as the film progresses. Viola Davis, Terrance Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, and the other cast members are incredible each in their own ways. But who really stands out is Jake Gyllenhaal, as a twitchy, aggressive, young detective with secrets. His interactions with the other characters and the situation is beautiful and perfect. Rodger Deakins spectacular cinematography creates a dreary yet beautiful world for the characters to play in and makes the film perfect. Prisoners is definitely worth your money and your time and a instant example of incredible film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film was brilliantly directed. A little on the violent side, but not as sickening as the Saw movies. A great story, but the only complaint you might see is that the story has been done before in some regards - it is a kidnapping story. That said, I'm OK as long as it's not direct plagiarism, isn't the same characters (i.e. Taken, Taken 2), and is well-directed and well-acted, which is certainly true in this case. I think Jackman somewhat underplayed his role, while Gyllenhall played the part perfectly. It left you with some questions at the end, and some parts were nostalgic cliché moments that just felt out of place. Outside of these minor problems, the story is insanely suspenseful and has you glued to your seat, so this is a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent suspense thriller. On the edge of my seat from start to end. Totally taken by surprise by the amount of viewers who gave this film a poor review. Those types of viewers aren't able to simply enjoy a flick; instead they spend their entire time looking for problems in a movie - therefore their reviews need to be disregarded because the only type of movie that could ever convince them is one taken from a live cell phone for 2 hours of some real-time event like a city-held event such as a parade or something. There is a lot of "red herrings" during the middle part of the movie, but all of them have you wondering which one of them is "the kidnapper". This effectively removes any suspicion you might have about who the real perpetrator might be.Back to the movie - nail-biting, suspenseful and intense. Excellent acting. Great plot line. Jackman delivers an awesome performance, and his anger is portrayed very well. Jake is portrayed as a hero in the ending and you can't help but think "humble hero" in your mind when you see his performance at the end. If you're the type that's going to sit there for all 2.5 hours and just look for errors, then don't bother watching, and don't bother watching any other movie for that matter, because you're obviously incapable of enjoying any film. But if you can sit back and enjoy a good flick and allow yourself to engage into a world of storytelling, then this film will not let you down. Highly recommended for movie-goers that aren't so "literal" and know how to enjoy a good flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just watched this having rented it. Wow. What an excellent thriller.On reading the sleeve I almost didn't bother as at over two and a half hours long, I didn't think it would keep my interest. How wrong I was.The plot centres around two young girls being kidnapped, and the efforts the police and the families make to try to find them. This brief description however gives no indication of the tension that builds throughout the film, the superb acting and great directing.I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Jackman as a rule. It's not that I don't like him, it's just that he doesn't appear in films that generally appeal to me. However I'm prepared to eat my words for this film. His acting was first rate. Jake Gyllenhaal on the other hand has always been a favourite of mine right since the incredible Donnie Darko, and here he proves just how good he is.I have to admit, that great though these both were, and fine supporting from everyone else, the person who stood out - although his part was relatively small - was Paul Dano. His acting is quite exemplary.The film itself does not seem long at all, indeed as the final stages approach, it travels at quite a pace and is edge of seat stuff.Well worth a watch and possibly one of the very best thrillers I've seen for quite some time.

		<fullReview>Prisoners delves into some of the darkest depths of human existence. It's horror comes from the realization that we all have such a potential for evil as Keller Dover has, given the horrible circumstances he was subjected to. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the character was criminally overlooked, as it was one of the finest performances of his career. The other performances are all excellent, but Melissa Leo stands out with a terrifying performance as the films final antagonist, who is one of the most evil I have ever seen in fiction. The beautiful and haunting score by Johann Johannsson was also overlooked. The writing however, is the film's crowning triumph.

		<fullReview>'Prisoners' is about two young girls who disappear in suspicious circumstances and what the parents (or rather mainly Hugh Jackman) does to try and get them back.And, as you can probably tell by that subject matter, it's certainly no 'feel good' movie. You have to be in the mood for something pretty horrible and disturbing to sit through it. So, if you're in the mood for that (and don't have young children!), you'll find a decent enough thriller with powerful performances from both Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal (who plays the cop in charge of the subsequent investigation).It's quite a long film (over two hours), so don't expect everything to be revealed at once.The only drawback is that, mainly towards the end, there are a few 'ploy holes' which the writers obviously think you'll probably overlook as you're caught up in the drama of the final act. If you don't look too closely and focus on the performances, you should still enjoy what is really a pretty bleak movie.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

I love the director's take on the film. Instead of focusing solely on the details of the crime, he focused more on the emotional mental turmoil of each family member of the missing girls. If none of us have ever been through something like that before then we can't begin to understand how horrifying that must feel knowing someone has your child and doing unspeakable things to them. I really appreciated the director focusing on that.Secondly, Jake Gallenhal is just simply the man. The chemistry between him and Jackman just fit so well in this drama/thriller.

		<shortDescription>VIEWS ON FILM review of Prisoners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced by busy bee actor Mark Wahlberg and helmed by acclaimed Canadian director Denis Villeneuve, Prisoners is the type of vehicle that is perfect for fall movie going season. It was filmed in Georgia (which I believe, was made to look like a drab part of Pennsylvania), takes place during Thanksgiving, and harbors a non-stop sense of doom and gloom from its opening frame (I think the sun shined maybe once during the entire 2 and a half hour running time). Listen, I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you, this picture is long, feels long, and it really takes its time. Villeneuve uses old school filming techniques and doesn't project anything flashy at all. The story, when it's all said and done however, is somewhat conventional. Therefore, I think it was necessary for the events to be drawn out and dragged through the muck a little. Based on an initial viewing, I realized that Prisoners would have felt like a TV movie and/or a Law and Order episode if the running time was trimmed to say, an hour and a half. Thankfully, it comes off as an extended director's cut (I'm not the only critic that felt this way) and that to a fault, is what makes the flick work. Watching it, I was reminded of a David Fincher film (without Fincher's signature style though) and not just because it starred staggeringly disciplined actor Jake Gyllenhaal. Prisoners is basically a mild spawn of Fincher's Se7en and Zodiac. It's not quite as effectively creepy as those films, but it's definitely good enough to recommend. Part kidnapping movie, part police detective character study, and part fatherly vigilante escapade, Prisoners tells the story of two families (neighbors from across the street) who get together on Thanksgiving day. The Birch's (Franklin Birch played by Terrence Howard and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis who barely registers here) and the Dover's (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as Keller and Grace Dover) have a relaxing, calming holiday until their respective daughters wander off and go missing. This then gets the attention of a socially inept area detective (Mr. Loki played with vigor by Jake Gyllenhaal) who garners almost complete control over handling the missing person's case. As days go by and a potential suspect who might've taken the children gets bounced free, Jackman's angry, frustrated character eventually decides to take the law into his own hands. As the film slowly creeps toward its conclusion, you get small twists and turns (as well as slightly minimal character revelations). You also get to see how important drawing mazes are when it comes to character motivation (I've seen all kinds of thrillers and this plot point was a first for me). On the acting front, one thing to notice when viewing Prisoners, is how it pushes aside the other performers in the main cast (Oscar nominees like Viola Davis and Terrence Howard) and puts its main focus on Jackman. Now I'm not saying that Hugh Jackman is a mediocre actor. I just don't think he has the fiery chops to take on such a serious, dramatic role. His fault lies in the extreme overacting and preening to the audience. He seems to be saying, "hey look at me, I should be nominated for an Oscar!" With all the focus on him, the other player's roles become seriously underdeveloped. It gets to the point where you hardly see them anymore. Using little of no background music, there are a lot of carefully set up scenes in Prisoners. To a fault, Jackman appears in almost all of them. Jake Gyllenhaal (Detective Loki), the only other actor receiving top billing, takes up almost as much of the shared time. The difference with Gyllenhaal is that he quietly out acts his co-star. His minutes on screen are underplayed but they feel more genuine, more studied (Gyllenhaal's character's facial ticks like eye blinking were a nice touch), and generally more effective. He seems born to play his role. Jackman on the other hand, has one persuasive agent (he probably needs to stick to his strengths which are the X-Men movies). As a fall release that feels as if it's a journey or a metaphoric expedition, Prisoners has a teaser of an ending that may leave viewers holding their hands in the air. The over length may also be a factor when it comes to their varied attention spans. I however, found this exercise mildly absorbing and it was able to keep me interested. You may find the opening ten minutes a little muddled and weak in terms of set up, but after that, this exercise will place you in its grip (not too tightly) and not let go. Like I said earlier, Prisoners makes its case for being serviceable because it rides the wave of other crime dramas filling the screen with gloomy, overcast, and rain-drenched sequences. While watching it, you can almost sense that it does hold back just a little. This film doesn't take too many risks and it may not haunt you like it should (Villeneuve's direction is overly careful). But hey, it still gets by though mainly because of said look and Gyllenhaal's icy magnitude. All in all, if you like crime thrillers that take their time and don't try to jerk you around with the camera, Prisoners might just set you "free."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How film has the ability to grab hold and not let go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Prisoners (2013. dir. Denis Villeneuve) last night and thought how film has the ability to grab hold and not let go. This is a thrilling, suspenseful mystery where sometimes I needed to remind myself to breathe. The camera, the acting of Jake Gyllanhal, and the mystery are the stars in this one. The mood is somber amidst a tragic abduction of two girls in a small Pennsylvania town. I immediately felt connected and invested in the story and eager to see how far the characters would go to solve the mystery. Sometimes, the "thriller" moments in the film felt exaggerated and may have had a better effect if left slightly more understated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget Waterboarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suspense get you going? Dig thrills, do ya?This flick's got plenty of both.I really enjoyed this film about kidnapping, and encouraged my parents to watch it about a week ago. I moseyed in about two-thirds the way through the film, when Hugh Jackman's wielding a claw hammer and quivering with fury."What the hell are we watching?" my Dad asked from the edge of his seat."Yeah I know, it's great, right!"Love that sink scene. Think about how the theme of imprisonment relates to each character. How informed each party is, and in turn, the motivations that result.Just from that little suggestion, you can tell you're in for a quality picture.For those who haven't seen Prisoners: If you like great movies see this film.Here's what 'great' means. It means 'great enough.' If you leave Prisoners feeling genuine hatred, you're being overly critical.So check it out, but be careful of the spoilers below.Hugh Jackman may be the best actor currently working in Hollywood. I'm biased because he's been my number one favorite since X-Men (2000), but my dude's quickly climbing the charts. He's so prolific nowadays.I've seen most his catalogue (except for Australia) and I stand by Swordfish and Van Helsing as great movies. I'll argue to the death for either. I have no idea why their Rotten Tomatoes percentages are in the twenties. Baffles me, truly.Anyway, my point is, Hugh Jackman delivers a spectacular performance as Keller Dover in this film. Keller's a wildly compelling character with complex motivations.Further acting prowess is displayed by his character's wife, Gracie Dover, played by Maria Bello, who steers a powerful teary-eyed scene.Viola Davis plays Nancy Birch, and also carries a tense scene without muttering a word of dialogue. She just delivers a long, dead stare.Terrence Howard's not my favorite, but he does a decent enough job here. I suppose I avoid giving him too much credit because I've heard some not so nice things about him.He's the second actor credited for Iron Man, after R.D.J. himself. And he was replaced by another black actor, Don Cheadle, after demanding too much money for the second installment in the series.I didn't even notice until well after 3.Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki has a wildly compelling discussion with a priest, and ties together the film in a pleasing way. Jake's rather talented, I feel like I don't see enough of him.Detective Loki's shirt is always buttoned to his chin but he's never wearing a tie, which drove me nuts until someone pointed out the tattoo on his neck. The only plot hole is the scene in which Gyllenhaal opens the trunks full of snakes. His character isn't the type to leave the lids ajar, allowing the serpents' escape.Before moving on, I must mention that David Dastmalchian delivers as a more capable deranged man than the role he plays in The Dark Knight. He's a solid actor, and I bet we'll see more from him in the future.Lot of powerful gazing goes on in this film. From Viola D.'s deadpan, to the stare-down between Jake and Paul Dano, you get some strong gawks. When Dano signs his release from prison, it gives me the chills.By the way, P.D.'s phenomenal in this film. So creepy. The dog-walking scene'll make your spine crawl.An easily avoidable thought to take away from Prisoners is that Paul Dano's character is, ultimately, the worst victim of all.But that's a reality on which I'd prefer not to dwell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like dark films and this one is dark - from the cinematography to the subject matter. You know from the first few mins. we are on a ride straight to hell. Jackman is a pained father that will do anything to find his kid and I mean anything including destroying his friends and family he is a man hellbent on discovering what happened to his missing kid (and the neighbors kid too). I don't want to say to much because this film has to be experienced even now after watching it I'm still not sure how to describe how it made me feel? Dirty? Full of rage? Cathartic? All of those are elements of the viewing experience this film takes you on. If you like to experience dark films this is up there with Martyers as a film with a point but to get there you have take some dark paths. The one thing I wasn't too sure about was why Jake G's character was named Loki - if anyone can explain - thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Twisted Descent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underneath grey skies, Director Denis Villeneuve examines the lengths people will go to for their young ones, and the rationale that might be used to justify what can only be seen as reprehensible acts. Be forewarned this movie contains scenes of brutal violence that should leave you wincing.Gyllenhaal's logical and professional Detective Loki provides an excellent foil for the irrational and illogical behaviour that comes to pass around him as he struggles to solve a missing persons case. And even as he succeeds, those with blind right wing views continue to support their own evil actions through various means including religion. Blindly they cling to their original views with twisted logic and a refusal to accept facts. Inside a situation where bad actions are compounded by more bad actions, Villeneuve also explores the depths and importance of a person's own children. In particular Villeneuve seems interested in how much of a person's life fulfilment is linked to their children's lives. Throughout the film the childless Detective Loki's history and life is never really filled in. Brilliantly though, he is still engaging to the audience, and the subject of children as always increases our emotional involvement. The atmosphere is taut in this film, and punctuated by violence that is made all the more brutal by that tautness. The full 2 1/2 hours is required to follow such a complex descent into people's emotions and the illogical and prejudiced acts that follow when a child's life may be threatened. The plot is as twisting and unpredictable as people's emotions can be, and you may be surprised by the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chilling human horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is not for the faint of heart. It starts in a peaceful suburbia, with two families coming together to celebrate Thanksgiving. But then a tragedy strikes, as the younger daughters of the families both disappear while playing outside. And from this setting we get one of the most cynical takes on human desperation I've seen in a long time.There are no perfect individuals in Prisoners, no easy answers or moral rightness. Most of the characters react to the stress of the situation in a very ugly manner, and you don't really side with any of them. But you're not supposed to. The purpose of this film is to show us that even normal, so called upstanding citizens are capable of horrifying actions under the right conditions. It's a story about desperation, human weakness, despair, stress and hopelessness. It's an excellent story, but it's not nice to watch. Set your expectations accordingly.It's also a very impressive movie on a technical level. Cinematography, the tone and the whole feel of darkness in the film are all topnotch. The actors are also phenomenal. Hugh Jackman gives one of his best performances in a while as the despairing, enraged father of one of the girls. Most of the tale is told from his perspective, and his blight is heartbreaking to witness. Jake Gyllenhaal is also very, very good in his role as an ace police detective, who for first time in his career might face a case he cannot solve. The supporting cast is also talented, though Terrence Howard, the father of the other girl, just doesn't have the sheer presence to stand next to Jackman as an equal. But he tries.Prisoners is a dark, distressing thriller that is not an easy journey to take, but is definitely worth it for those that can deal with its world view. Definitely not recommended if you're just looking to have fun and spend an evening, but if you're looking for something heavier and more meaningful, this is worth keeping in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendidly filmed but weighed down by feelings of self-importance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those concerned that Denis Villeneuve, director of art-house pieces Polytechnique (2009) and the Oscar-nominated Incendies (2010), has sold out on his trip to the U.S., then rest assured, Prisoners is a suitably grim, adult and metaphor-laden drama which just happens to be anchored by two Hollywood A-or-there-about-listers. Beginning with an almost unbearably tense opening hour or so, Prisoners soon dissolves into a formulaic thriller, abandoning the near-unbearable tension of the opening hour and packing the film with foot-chases and repetitive torture-porn, finding itself too caught up in tying all the many loose ends together for it all to make sense.Whilst attending a Thanksgiving dinner, the daughters of Keller (Hugh Jackman) and Grace Dover (Mario Bello), and their neighbours Franklin (Terrence Howard) and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis), go missing. The only clue is a mysterious RV parked outside moments before the abduction, which is quickly found by Detecive Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) in a car park with an apparently stricken Alex Jones (Paul Dano) inside. After Alex is quickly released due to a lack of evidence, Keller is furious and unconvinced, abducting him and taking him to an abandoned former home in order to instigate his own method of interrogation.Boasting Oscar-nominated cinematography by long-time Coen Brothers collaborator Roger Deakins, this is one of the finest looking mainstream thrillers in years. Drenched in grey, the miserable colour palette drapes the film in a feeling of foreboding dread. It brings to mind the beautiful and superior thriller Zodiac (2007), only without the period setting. It drags - and it does drag - on for 2 and a half hours, and the film is so lacking in humour that any realism the film was striving for suffers. It also stars Hugh Jackman, possibly the most effortlessly likable actor working today, and watching him bang on the wall shouting "where is my daughter!?" - a line that should have been retired after Taken (2008) - is silly and unconvincing. The film takes itself so seriously that it almost becomes a parody of itself.Gyllenhaal as Loki, however, is outstanding, and is a character I wish the film focused more on. With neck tattoos, a strange, buttoned-up (with no tie) appearance, slick-back hair, and blinking tic, it hints at a more interesting character than the film fully allows to develop. The film is more interested in not-so-subtle War on Terror parallels and comments on post-9/11 vigilantism, that sadly struggles to keep a hold of it's ever-widening plot and multiple plot strands, over-reaching itself constantly with scenes of stoic uber-seriousness. But it's splendidly filmed, and beautifully performed by Gyllenhaal, Dano and Melissa Leo (playing Alex's mother), which could have done with some heavier editing and less self-importance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a prime example of why I will never understand Hollywood. You've got a truly great story, an all-star cast, and a world renowned Director, making his American debut. Prisoners was considered to be an Oscar caliber film before it was even released, yet for some reason they had to make it nearly three hours long. If there was enough story for a three hour film, then I'd be all for it, but Prisoners has a good 45 minutes worth of repetitiveness, that does nothing to help the movie, in fact, it takes something away from the film. The story begins on Thanksgiving, when two little girls go outside to play and disappear. Feeling that the police aren't doing enough to find the kids, one father (Hugh Jackman) decides to take matters into his own hands. Hugh Jackman stars in a role I wouldn't have imagined him playing in a million years. Based on his other roles and what I know about the man, this doesn't even seem like the kind of role he'd be interested in, but he gives one of the strongest performances I've seen all year, I really didn't know he had that in him. Jackman is paired by Jake Gyllenhaal, another guy who I couldn't see playing a tough as nails police detective, but he too surprised, giving a very strong performance. The cast isn't the problem and the story isn't the problem, what bothered me about this film was how much of it was unnecessary. Did we really need dozens of scenes with Jackman and Dano or all the talk and sadness amongst the families? This was a great all-around movie, but it was so long, that by the end, I'd stopped caring about what was happening and just wanted it to be over. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this film for a unique twist on classic story, great performances from an unlikely cast, and the work of a Director who his known around the world for his signature style, but just a word of caution. Prisoners is a very long film, that at many points seems to go around in circles. When they eventually do get to the point, it's outstanding, but it takes a while to get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty good and had me guessing till the end. Two young girls go missing and Alex is the main suspect, only problem is he has the IQ of a 10 year old, so a lie detector won't work. The father of one of the girls, Keller, confronts Alex and Alex whispers "they only cried when I left". So Keller is convinced he knows where the girls are.So, Keller does something very disturbing and dark. He brings the other dad in on it and disturbing images ensue.Toward the end all the pieces begin to fall together. However, this is one of those movies that doesn't have a proper ending and we are left to wonder. I don't like that.FINAL VERDCIT: Good thriller, worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie with my wife in the cinema. As a movie fan who almost only watch movies in cinema and almost never watch any movies on TV, I must say that this movie is slightly soft to offer competition to other movies in 2013. However, as it turns out, it is a very good movie with a really good script and excellent performance from Gyllenhall.The plot was good, the suspense part does work and it fits the classification of an intense thriller.I went to the cinema this time really just to accompany my wife who really loves Jake Gyllenhall. I ended up liking it too and recommended it to my friends. I was gripped by it. In this movie, I felt so sorry for how low Jackman went. I could almost feel the desperation that he in felt in Prisoners and almost actually felt an empathy; I mean this sort of thing happens regularly all over the world, but he just desisted to take things into his own hands.Overall a very good movie. Go watch it if you haven't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal in very different ways seek two missing girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is a splendidly photographed neo-noir film with an excellent feel for place, time and people, graced by solid acting from its well-rounded and chosen cast. It tells the story of two kidnapped girls, not ransomed, but taken so that they can be killed. The father of one girl, Hugh Jackman, himself kidnaps the main suspect, linked to the kidnappings by the camper he was driving. He then tortures him to obtain information, making little headway but some. Meanwhile Gyllenhaal follows police procedures and eventually comes up with some clues too.The story requires us to accept too low a degree of rationality on the part of all of its major characters, thereby becoming implausible and losing effectiveness. The Jackman character can plan for survival and for torture meticulously, but he cannot communicate with Gyllenhaal without confrontation and without cutting off the conversation when he has critical information. That's early in the movie. Later in the movie he simply rushes off when he has even more information, possibly even endangering his daughter's life. Gyllenhaal is supposedly a thorough cop but the story implausibly makes him frustrated by his boss. He also finds a key link purely by the intuition of someone he sees at a candlelight vigil in the neighborhood. He has probable cause for a search warrant after the suspect makes a comment to Jackman, but instead he goes to his house and questions him. Where's the urgency in that? Jackman's neighbor, played by Terence Howard, is shown as so weak that he's swayed by both Jackman and his wife. How convenient for the story that is. Even the head person who is leading the kidnappings, for there have been more of them, irrationally is using her retarded "son" to help out. He's hardly to be trusted with such a matter. There are some coincidences as well, such as when Gyllenhaal is close to discovering the torture scene but is called away. Why doesn't he go back? Why does Jackman persist after that close call? There are so many serial killer movies that it's getting harder and harder to craft an original one without introducing implausible plot points.In my opinion, the story fell between the two leads, without focusing clearly on one or the other. It begins and ends with a focus on Jackman, but when Gyllenhaal comes in, as he must, his character is such a blank that he diverts our attention from the drama to wondering what's up with him. Why should that be a central part of a kidnap story? How do his character features, viewed as a subplot, tie into the main plot? This is not clear. Really the same goes for the Jackman character. How many people would behave as he did? Why couldn't he hire some private investigators? When all is said and done, it's a finely-executed movie but with a story that has too many unsatisfactory elements. The script also doesn't develop the characters deeply enough to bring out themes clearly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a saying when things get too disturbing: "I don't want that on my hard drive" (meaning that for me, truly disturbing scenes will etch themselves in my mind forever). If you're like me, then run, screaming, in the opposite direction from wherever this movie is showing. Once I started, however, I simply couldn't tear myself away. It's that kind of movie, supremely intriguing and gripping till the last second. These actors must have gone through some true mental anguish (particularly Hugh Jackman and Paul Dano). The darkest depths of human emotions are explored as a worst-case "what would you do if it were your family" scenario comes to life. For me, it also called to mind studies on human behavior, in which groups or mobs of humans are proved to be capable of things that go against--in theory--their beliefs or values. But again...be warned...this movie will forever be "on your hard drive."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hugh was terrific, but Jake stole the show. Putting acting aside, this movie has one major flaw. We all watch Hugh go through 2 hours of misery searching for his daughter, and of course, at the end of the movie, what we all want to see is him being united with her, but the ending robs us of this. They get her back, but we don't see her coming face to face with her father again. Really silly and left me shaking my head at the writers and director. Daughter being found but not reunited with her father after all that he went through was stupid. It was if they cut that scene out to save running time. Another sudden ending which disappoints viewers.</fullReview>

The choices made by the characters were very contradictory to reality and how things would really happen. They made characters seem a little too stupid in my opinion. I heard the movie was really good from friends, but maybe they were individuals who lacked imagination. I think the actors were great choices. I was definitely surprised in the turn of events and the suspense was amazing. I feel as though the girls initial choice in the beginning, was a little ridiculous as well. Also, the neglect of the law enforcement was very discouraging, as my Uncle is a detective. But I guess that is the realistic portion about people in general.

Because it generally doesn't work well, to me, it's prominent inclusion in the film is damagingly and offensively tasteless. I'm talking about the use of human torture to extract information. I'll concede you get information using it, but often quite unreliable information as the victim concocts anything they can think of to stop the torture. Especially in a situation of uncertain guilt, it is a really stupid way to proceed. And I hate brutality being glorified.Other than that, the film has an excellent cast who give excellent performances. But the plot is dumb in my opinion. I had high expectations from all the dazzling reviews of this film, but I thought it would be valuable to share my contrary reaction for the sake of others who may share my opinion of torture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely promising, great potential BUT ultimately very disappointing and unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the start this seemed an interesting film on a powerful subject with suspense beginning to build. Its cinematography and editing were good. I found Jackman very good in the lead role, Dano was excellent and other actors were generally good. There were suspenseful scenes and mystery keeping some interest in the outcomes along the way (these aspects give my 4/10 rating rather than any lower) but the film fell apart and totally let me down in many many ways.Firstly the totally unbelievably inept police work. First the cop (Gyllenhaal) does not shoot out the tyres of the escaping suspects motor home. He then has awful questioning technique, alienating his interviewees whilst failing to extract ANY information or insight whatsoever. He never calls for support or even informs other police of his whereabouts even in clearly life threatening circumstances! In fact he appears to be a one-man police force with no partners or backup at all. He gets every decision and judgement call completely wrong failing to work out even the most obvious clues. He does not spot a maze necklace on a dead body or notice that link to mazes later on until he accidentally sees a photo of the body when throwing a tantrum. He does not see through any of the suspects or connect any parts of the puzzle until it is almost too late. No search is done of the house opposite the girls disappearance site or the grounds right outside the main suspects house and all searches that are carried out are VERY poor, slow and superficial yet supercop searches Jackman's old house without a warrant. No surveillance is done of the parents (who would always be suspected) until Jackman has already had time to kidnap the suspect. No surveillance is even done of the released main suspect, who is as a result kidnapped by Jackman, but could just as easily gone off and murdered the kidnap victims!!!. Gyllenhaal's cop lets another suspect run away in a straightforward foot chase when he could easily have caught him or shot him in the leg. He even allows a suspect to shoot himself in the interview room!!!! The cold, blank, brainless portrayal of this cop is MASSIVELY at odds with the claim that this cop has NEVER failed to solve a case! I do not expect documentary style police work but it is not even possible for any police force or police officer to work in such a crap way. He even ends up driving whilst injured in a ridiculously unnecessarily dangerous manner, risking the child, himself and many members of the public after allowing the child to be drugged due to his slowness and ineptitude and is hailed a HERO for this!On top of that various other unbelievable actions are taken by other characters: WHY would Jackman (a fit, strong man) go along with the orders of an old feeble woman, drinking the drug when she tells him and walking at gunpoint to certain captivity or death? She stands about six inches behind him at roughly his shoulder/elbow height as he dutifully marches to a hole in the ground. ANYONE in his position would elbow the old bitch in the face or jump her at one of the numerous opportunities such as when she first answers the door! His reactions would be FAR faster than hers! WHY would all 3 apparently good decent parents go along with the torture of a suspect so easily changing from good gentle folk into hardened accomplices or perpetrators of torture? HOW would the formerly kidnapped and supposedly slow witted boy be a cold, calculating, expert break-in man, happy and able to steal victims clothes under parents noses and escaping capture by the 'great' cop in a chase. WHY ON EARTH would the evil kidnapper push a full syringe of some deadly substance into the kidnapped girl only to inject just a small amount of the substance into her?!! She wanted to kill her before being killed herself so it is ludicrous that she would carefully remove the syringe with over half the liquid still in the syringe! That is film-making at its worst!On top of this, rather than suspense it was more and more frustrating and infuriating as numerous red-herrings, badly thought through motives and twists plus incomplete and unexplained story arcs ruined the film bringing it to a very unsatisfactory conclusion. WHAT was the motivation/payoff for the kidnappers? The religious reasons given are flimsy and unconvincing. A sexual or sadistic motive would have been easily believable, this one was not executed properly at all. WHY and HOW would a feeble old lady continue her 'crusade' so successfully after her husbands disappearance? WHY was one boy kept as a 'son' while all others were killed? WHAT is the escaped boy/man doing acting as if he is aiding/involved in subsequent kidnappings? WHY would the paedophile priest murder the kidnapper/murderer? WHY would the kidnapper keep the victims alive if the purpose was just to kill them not abuse, torture or ransom them?!It is infuriating that a film with good ingredients and production values visually apparent throws it all away with such pathetically badly thought through and unprofessional writing and directing! The dialogue was also fashionably and annoyingly inaudible on many occasions. VERY disappointing film!!</fullReview>

Really wished that all the character family members played a bigger role in the movie. The older girl in one family seem to just fade away from the movie. I felt the family characters played to much of a back seat. This movie has no concern parents in this town. It felt like a child was telling this story to us. I felt the movie was to long. This movie did not have enough scary scenes. I also felt the writing of the characters did not say much about who they were. There was no history and no front story to any of the characters in the beginning of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good watch although very simple to work out.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to watch this at the cinema at a completely random time while out shopping with a friend. This was the movie which was on closest to the time we arrived so we decided to watch it. I had no knowledge of the movie having never seen any trailers for it or ever hearing about it but I'm glad to say we were not disappointed.Although knowing the supposed crimes of Keller's kidnapped victim, you can't help but feel a slight wave of emotion and pity towards him as he is being tortured.Although this film is supposed to have a twist at the end, I honestly had it worked out halfway through the movie and knew exactly what was going on.Never the less, it still had me gripped as to what would still happen next from start to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but somewhat disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" is essentially a remake of Mystic River (2003). It's a good mystery that uses great imagery. And despite the massive runtime, it doesn't lag too badly.I wanted to love Hugh Jackman's performance as the father, but he basically has 2 emotions in the entire film. Angry, sad, then angry again. Not that he doesn't do those two emotions well, but it's not enough. Gyllenhaal is fine as the detective, and I was pleasantly surprised by Terrence Howard as Franklin. For a movie that seemed ideal for great acting roles, the portrayals are only decent to good.The best part of the movie are the twists and turns of the mystery and how it is revealed and comes together. The imagery of the maze is an interesting motif and is used very well. I am honestly a little upset with the movie for how neatly it is all explained by the end. There is no room for ambiguity. The movie does a good job keeping us in the dark and guessing for at least 2 hours of its 2 hour 30 minute runtime. I wish it had ended with at least a little of the mystery that made it worth watching.Had I never seen Mystic River (2003) I probably would have liked Prisoners a little more. It's a good mystery, but I was a little let down by the acting and a little let down by the ending. Good movie, I'd recommend it, but I'd actually recommend Mystic River more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yep, disturbing,,, and completely implausible. Jake is great as the detective, but Jackmans' character is a contradiction. Ending is completely wrong. Too late to UN-see it, but, maybe not for YOU. Jackman, being a survivalist, should NEVER have let himself get into the predicament he did. First mistake was turning his back on Melissa Leo, second was allowing her to make him put on the hand cuffs, third was not gunning the Camaro in reverse and taking her off with the open door she was standing beside, fourth was allowing her to shoot him in the leg, fifth was getting into the hole, sixth was not finding a way to climb back out and simply push the plywood aside, seventh was not throwing something at the plywood when he heard voices above, and attract some attention. Add to that, the fact that NOBODY even checked the Camaro and decided to dig on the opposite side of the house. May have crossed Jakes mind, but if it did, fade-out eliminated the thought. Is that enough? How about - Are these girls MORONS talking to strangers and getting into the camper? BOTH girls? When one of their fathers is a SURVIVALIST? How about Jake telling his captain to "go f__ yourself"..???Great cast - wasted on a poor script. Sorry --but, that's the way I see it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People might say this movie was one of the greatest movies of 2013. I would strongly disagree. Jake Gyllenhall and Hugh Jackman were amazing. In fact all the actors were amazing but these two killed it. The movie, according to me, had lots more potential, could have been one of the best mystery movies EVER made, but much of the movie still remained a mystery. Questions like, why the child was kidnapped, what happened to Hugh Jackman afterwards, were still left unanswered after the movie ended. It needed answers, and this is why the ending was sad too. The movie was very long and I wouldn't have mind watching another half hour for these answers. It did build up lots of suspense, but I also feel that they added parts that had no need to be in the film, just over elongated the film. Nevertheless, I would still recommend you watch it, but don't expect too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you do not care whether or not a movie makes sense, you may find this film compelling and exciting. After all, the cinematography is moody and the performances are self-consciously intense. However, if you are the kind of movie watcher who likes your movies to be coherent, you will be disappointed. Beyond some glowing reviews no doubt posted by hacks for hire, you will find several other IMDb reviewers who point out this movie's many nonsensical plot holes. These critical reviewers are correct and I urge you to read their posts-- just look for the low scores.The writing in this film is so sloppy that at one point, suspicions hang on a half-used bag of lye. Um, people use lime, not lye, to cover up the smell of decaying bodies. I guess screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski could not be bothered to get this fact straight, since he was too busy stealing half-remembered ideas from other, better movies. If you care about story logic even just a little, skip this baggy, saggy mess of a movie.</fullReview>

At one point, I got so bored that I just skipped to the ending which I will not put in this review because it's a spoiler. However, the storyline was pretty good. Feels very powerful and could happen to anyone of us or any children. The movie had a very slow development showing the family and how they react to their children's kidnapping and what they do. The plot is pretty simple but it takes too long to show that development. I recommend you to torrent it or watch it online before actually wasting your money. If you like it and want to have the movie forever, then just buy it afterwards.</fullReview>

Hugh Jackman deserves an Oscar with his relentless dogged search as "I will do anythingto find my daughter". Paul Dano deserves an Oscar just for playing his character.

		<shortDescription>An exciting serial killer thriller but I had trouble believing torture victim wouldn't crack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is back with another densely plotted movie with 'Prisoners'. His 2011 'Incendies' was interesting but ultimately full of too many scenes which forced the viewer to suspend one's disbelief, one too many times. 'Prisoners' also has some questionable plot points but it's eminently more entertaining than Incendies.Villeneuve proffers up an interesting protagonist, Keller Dover (played by an intense Hugh Jackman), a survivalist type, who has no compunctions about teaching his son how to shoot a deer, on a hunting trip, depicted at the beginning of the film. While Jackman has a lot to work with depicting the hot-head Keller, Terrence Howard has little to do playing Franklin Birch, Keller's exact opposite: a passive (and thinly drawn) middle class black professional. The break into Act II occurs when Keller's and Birch's daughters are abducted after disappearing from the Birch family home. Since an RV was parked right near where the girls disappeared, the driver ends up as the number one suspect. The police soon track the driver down at a rest stop and he tries to escape by eluding a police blockade with his RV. The driver turns out to be Alex Jones, who on the surface appears to be mentally feeble. When Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) can find no evidence linking Alex to the girls' abduction and concludes he doesn't have the mental capacity to kidnap the girls, he's forced to release him, and allow him to return to the residence of Holly Jones, his aunt, a creepy senior, expertly played by Melissa Leo.A good deal of 'Prisoners' revolves around Keller's abduction and subsequent imprisonment of Alex, who he believes knows where the kidnapped girls are. Keller insists that Alex told him "they didn't cry until I left them," when Keller tries to choke him at the time he's released by the police, in front of a multitude of TV news reporters (no one else hears what Alex says to Keller). Before discussing the issue of Alex's refusal to talk, there are two red herrings in the plot, designed to throw you off track. Both involve Detective Loki's interaction with two suspects. The first is a priest who's on parole for a sex crime?out of the blue Loki finds a bound, deceased man in the priest's basement. The priest claims that he was forced to kill the man after he revealed (during confession) that he was a serial killer, who would kill again. Later, Loki chases after a suspicious man seen at a vigil for the missing girls, in front of the Birch's home. He turns out to be a wannabe serial killer, Taylor, who breaks into the family houses of real serial killer's victims and steals their clothes. Loki, who supposedly has solved all of his cases, blows this one, after Taylor grabs one of Loki's deputy's guns and shoots himself in the mouth.Even if you believe in both these incredible turn of events, one is hard pressed to believe in the film's main premise?that Alex would refuse to talk, despite being tortured for days by Keller. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. One of the arguments that Alex doesn't talk is because he is mentally handicapped. But that's debunked by the points Keller raises?he knew about the girls and told Keller; he tried to escape from the police in his RV and had a driver's license and was able to drive.Another reason (which seems to be suggested by the filmmakers) is that he's under the spell of Aunt Holly and is either a) afraid of her, b) evil like her, or c) both. He seemingly is given a free pass at film's end, despite Keller's statement that he confessed that he basically knew where the girls were (the free pass may be due to the fact that Keller's credibility was completely suspect, by breaking the law by abducting him). Still, while possible, I still think it's unlikely that Alex would never have turned against the old lady. Think of the child abduction case of Steven Stayner. He was imprisoned for seven years but when given the opportunity, he escaped and saved a newly abducted child. Alex was the first child abducted by Holly and her husband and the filmmakers would like us to believe he was psychologically beholden to his captor. But in real life, the Stayner case proves the opposite. I would like to think the desire for freedom would still burn in Alex's breast and his abduction by Keller would have been the perfect opportunity for him to spill the beans about his aunt. By confessing, he's smart enough to know that Aunt Holly would immediately be taken into custody and he would not have to be afraid of her anymore.Prisoners represents a critique of those who embrace the survivalist mentality and act as vigilantes. We expect Keller to save his daughter but actually Detective Loki does so after racing to the hospital and saving Keller's daughter from poisoning (Loki's big car race is not that exciting, since the outcome is pretty much expected). Instead, Keller underestimates Holly who turns out to be responsible for the girls' abduction as well as numerous other serial killings. Keller ends up in that hole and my interpretation of the abrupt (but clever) ending, is that he WILL rescue Keller, and let him face the music.'Prisoners' indeed will drag you into its electrically-charged story and keep you at the edge of your seat to the end. The supporting players, those who play the wives and children of Keller and Franklin, do quite well, but are saddled by underdeveloped parts. Ultimately, you will have to overlook the red herrings and the main premise that the feeble (or perhaps not so feeble) Alex, will not crack under torture. I prefer to believe that he would, as most people would in that situation.</fullReview>

Though it is not for the faint of heart, this incredible film takes you on a journey that you don't want to end. For me, this is ABSOLUTELY Hugh Jackman's BEST role he has ever done, even topping Les Miserables. This hair-raising thriller gives me an amazing exhilaration every. single. time. And I've seen the movie four times in the past month. With top-notch acting from Jake Gyllenhaal, this is one story you do NOT want to miss out on. You never question the dedication of Hugh as the father, as he takes things into his own hands to get his daughter back. You feel every fit of anger, every tear, every shiver Hugh feels down to your own core. With that said, i proudly give this film a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Judging by his performance in this film I find this very hard to believe, and wouldn't trust to investigate a shoplifting let alone an abduction of 2 kids.A guy with a mental age of 10 is able to endure over a week of torture without dropping his aunt in it. Some guy collects kids cloths and covers them in pigs blood, and places them in a suitcase full of snakes for no apparent reason.One of the kids manages to escape but we don't really know how.No real motive for the kidnapping.The viewer has no empathy for the family or children as no bond is established, at one point I briefly forgot that two kids had been kidnapped.The significance of the 'Maze' was never explained.I could go on but I've wasted 153 mins of my life watching this film so don't propose to waste any more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you saw in my title the script in this movie takes the main spotlight. The twists and turns, the dialogues and the right 'till the end top level suspense. All of those aspects are majorly improved by the amazing man sitting in the directors chair and the talented men acting it out in front of the camera. Especially the one and only Hugh Jackman who steals every single scene he is in. That doesn't by far mean the other actors aren't that good. Gyllenhaal and Terrence Howard both portray two desperate men perfectly. Now to the plot which puts you in this awful situation on which two girls get abducted. A detective (Gyllenhaal) is put in charge of the case while the father of one of the girls (Jackman) takes some extreme measures. I won't go further than that to not spoil you of anything awesome (which by the way tends to be the whole movie). Directing-wise this movie is just out there in space. By I literally don't remember looking away or blinking. I just sat there at the edge of my seat biting my fingers! The composition of the opening shot just gave me the chills. A still shot of some creepy snowy woods with a dear walking by, while Jackman spells out "The holy father" is beautifully unsettling. A lot of the shots are still shots. They don't shy away of lingering the shots. Props to that dude named Denis Villeneuve. I'll throw it out there that this movie made me cringe. It is disturbing **** The last thing I wanna point out is the ending. It has you on your knees by being a very quiet but intense scene full of some sweet sweet shots. In the end this movie tackled all of the aspects that make a thriller great and it will definitely get itself some of those Oscar noms! 10 out of 10 baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As all other reviews have stated the strength of this film lies with the quality of acting, and with the number of A-list stars this is exactly what we expect. I was also impressed by the tempo and atmosphere. There are moments where the silence itself gives you cause to expect the worst, and this is a prime example of a film where the acting, camera-work and script all come together to generate the sense of foreboding. It is the difference between a good horror film such as Ringu and a slasher title such as Scream.I can't help but feel that there was a change in script because the abrupt does not really deliver its intended impact. If you have watched the film then you will understand what I mean. I would not be surprised if there was an alternative ending in the DVD release.I did not give it a perfect 10/10 purely because the ideas were not original. But in a year in which there have been a huge number of blockbusters that failed to impress, this film is truly a welcome relief that 2013 was not a disaster the movie industry and brings relief that artistry is not lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A near perfect thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a star studded cast including Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Les Miserables) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain), Prisoners always looked to have the potential to hit the right spot with audiences, and it didn't disappoint. When two young girls go missing in a quiet suburb, is it up to Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) to track them down. But when the prime suspect Alex Jones (Paul Dano) is revealed to have the IQ of a 10 year old and no evidence against him, the case starts to run cold, and Loki turning more desperate as the hours tick away. With no new leads, father of one of the girls, Keller Dover (Jackman) takes it upon himself to find the girls by any means possible, and will let nothing stop him on his mission.One must first credit the acting and I would not be surprised if one or more of the cast showed up in next year's Oscar nominations. Here Jackman gives the performance of a lifetime, which is nice to see after his involvement in the horrendous, Movie 43. You really feel for his character as his anger and love for his daughter drives him to unspeakable acts. But Jackman portrays this incredibly and I'm not sure another actor could have done as good a job. His performance was truly moving and you felt both saddened by his situation and even start to sympathise with him, despite some of the atrocities he carries out. But this is only due to the quality of his acting that you connect with the character so well. Gyllenhaal was also outstanding, with some masterful acting and I would argue maybe even his career defining performance. You can really feel the characters anguish at his inability to find the girls and in the end it's more a personal vendetta against the kidnapper than the detective doing his job. Prisoners also had a tremendous supporting cast with brilliant performances given by Melissa Leo (The Fighter), Paul Dano (Looper) and Terrence Howard (Iron Man).The plot is dark and gritty and some viewers may find it a little disturbing. I certainly did which was a surprise, but this is essential for the viewers to understand the characters pain. With themes of mystery, kidnap, torture and questioning the faith of God, this thriller may not entice some of the more light hearted types. But director Denis Villeneuve weaves the viewers through a well crafted story, that whilst obvious in some places, kept the viewer excited to the very end. However it must be said that certain aspects of the plot were never fully explained, leaving for a slightly aggravating ending. Some people may watch the film and wonder "would I do such terrible things for someone in my family?" This is a little scary considering the plot, but part of the genius of the film, making you feel really involved and invested in the story throughout. The film had a fantastic score which is essential for any good dramatic piece. Many filmmakers are tempted by the ease of overusing music as mood filler, but Prisoners had just the right mix; not overusing it but rather applying it carefully where needed. The cinematography was perhaps some of the best I have ever seen, with interesting camera work, shadowy grey-scales, and wonderful use of lighting; hardcore film buffs will certainly enjoy.Ultimately Prisoners is a near perfect thriller, taking audiences on a roller-coaster of emotions. It leaves viewers with perhaps one question to consider, that we should all think about more often when heinous crimes of this nature appear in the news: who are the real Prisoners? The young girls kidnapped or the families left behind waiting for them to come home?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first glance "Prisoners " is what most critics and viewers would hail as a brilliant film. I myself would have thought the same thing 10 years or more ago when I was an aspiring young film critic. However, with age comes wisdom and I found "Prisoners" quite disturbing, quite sickening.Prisoners tells the story of two families the Dovers and the Birches who while celebrating thanksgiving manage to have both of their young daughters kidnapped the same night. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the seasoned Detective Loki, assigned to what must be the most trying case of his career. Hugh Jackman plays patriarch Keller Dover a supposed Christian and ironically a carpenter who has taught his family to hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. In the hours after the kidnapping, with view leads and what he views as an incompetent police investigation Keller slowly slides into the deepest abyss of morality all in an effort to find the would be kidnappers. Keller also enlists the aid of fellow grieving patriarch Franklin Dover ( played by Terrance Howard) to assist him in his nefarious plot to retrieve both their missing daughters.I can't imagine the thought of having a daughter go missing, however from a Christian perspective it seems the reaction of The Keller is rather anti-Christian. Part of that is the whole theme of the movie. Nevertheless, I think from a true Christian perspective , a father would never sink to the lows if Keller Dover if his child were kidnapped. The response may not be automatic, but much prayer would follow such a devastating kidnapping and also a trust in an all powerful God that no matter what the outcome that God is still in control. Even if it means that one's child might pass, there is a satisfaction in knowing that Jesus will someday bring that child back.However, on film the Keller's cuss and argue. Faith in God is completely shaken once the youngest child is missing and no one is praying, until the very end during a sad cinematic twist. This is a film wrapped in darkness and it shows the true ugliness of humanity. After watching "Prisoners" I regretted allowing this film into my psyche for over two hours . It was very unsettling and shook me to the core. Yes there are horrors in this world, but do we as an audience need too feed off of sure horrors and better yet, should we? A film as bleak as this one was felt oddly demonic, perhaps Detective Loki was name appropriately so, with Loki being the evil god of malice and mischief, because this film was a trickster of sorts maligning Christianity and mingling it with all that is frail and sinister.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit i was expecting a nicer happier film but i was still blown away by how good it was. I think what made the film so great was the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal was an excellent investigator and i loved his portrayal of the determination to find out who the kidnapper was. However he wasn't a fraction as good as Hugh Jackman who had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Although he played the enemy, i really sympathised with Paul Dano. I've only ever seen him in one other film (Knight and Day) but i thought he was also a great addition to the cast. Although the cast was good, i would have liked to see a little more from the mother (Maria Bello). I found the ending predictable although i never had a clue who the kidnapper was right up until the last moments. I personally, found some of the scenes with Hugh Jackman a little difficult to watch although others might disagree. Overall i was shocked by how good this film actually was and i would definitely recommend it to others!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great mystery film. It's definitely the kind of movie that, afterward, you can pick it apart a bit and find some major narrative flaws, but, while it's going, it's so gripping and tense you're just in the moment. Hugh Jackman and wife Maria Bello take their two kids over to their neighbors' (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) house for Thanksgiving. Their two young daughters go outside to play and disappear. Detective Jake Gyllenhaal is assigned to the case and quickly finds the driver of a mysterious RV that had been seen in the neighborhood, a severely retarded man (Paul Dano). There's no evidence whatsoever that Dano did anything, but Jackman leaches onto him, refusing to believe the police in the matter. He soon kidnaps Dano and attempts to torture the truth out of him. The theme of compromised morality is powerful, and Jackman is great in this role. Gyllenhaal is also very good, although sometimes the character feels too much like a movie cop (this dude never calls for backup, even in the most dangerous situations!). The film is gorgeously shot, edited and scored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jackman should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'PRISONERS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal star in this crime thriller about a father obsessed with finding his kidnapped daughter. The film co-stars Terrence Howard, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo, Viola Davis and Maria Bello. It was written by Aaron Guzikowski and directed by critically acclaimed (and award winning) Canadian director Denis Villeneuve. Mark Wahlberg (who was originally set to star in the film) produced it (he also starred in the 2012 Guzikowski penned crime thriller 'CONTRABAND'). The movie is about as intense and emotionally involving as crime dramas get and it's filled with stellar performances. It was just a tad too disturbing for me (at the time of the viewing) but worth it. Jackman stars as Keller Dover in the film. Keller is a religious family man with a wife, Grace (Bello), teenage son, Ralph (Dylan Minnette) and six-year-old daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich). As the movie opens his family visits their neighbors, Franklin (Howard) and Nancy Birch (Davis) and their two daughters Eliza (Zoe Borde) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons), for Thanksgiving dinner. The two six-year-old daughters run home to the Dover's house to retrieve Anna's security whistle and never return. Ralph and Eliza saw their younger siblings playing on an RV parked down the street earlier that afternoon and tell their parents this (they also noticed someone was inside it). The RV is no longer there when Keller and Franklin go looking for it. The police are alerted and Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal) is put on the case. They locate the RV but the kids aren't inside it and the man driving it, Alex (Dano), is mentally retarded with the IQ of a ten-year-old. Alex is arrested but later released (as Loki pursues other leads) but Keller is sure that Alex knows where his daughter is and will stop at nothing to get the information out of him. Gyllenhaal has been one of my favorite actors for several years (ever since films like 'DONNIE DARKO' in 2001 and 'MOONLIGHT MILE' in 2002). He gives one of his best performances to date here; as a cop almost as obsessed with saving the kids as Jackman's father character is. It's Jackman that gives the best performance of his career here though (I believe). He's so emotional and convincing that he should definitely see at least an Oscar nomination come awards time (so should Gyllenhaal though). The rest of the cast is all more than adequate as well but it's not just the acting that makes the movie work so well. The script is gut wrenchingly suspenseful and fast paced and the directing is equally as intense. The movie kicks into high gear once the kids are kidnapped and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's disturbing, heart breaking and very hard to watch (and I've seen a few too many of these types of films lately) but it's definitely worth it. A grade A crime thriller all around!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQkUJbRVsoM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best acting performances of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen many good movies from all around the world this year but "Prisoners" seems to be the best North American film of the year so far. It's not so much about the story of the movie that recalls the French Canadian "7 Days" movie by Daniel Grou that was inspired by a Patrick Senécal novel. Both films tell the story of a desperate family father who seeks revenge on a strange suspect for kidnapping (or worse?) his daughter while everything around him is suddenly falling apart.The impressive things about "Prisoners" are others. One must mention the constant dark atmosphere of the movie. This is due to the intensive story that is in fact the worst nightmare for any loving father or mother on earth. This movie is an intense mixture of the drama and thriller genres with a few decently used gore scenes and scary moments that aren't a far call from the horror genre. Each character shown in this movie is going through really hard times from the family father, his wife, his son and his best friends over the more and more isolated detective to the suspected kidnapper and a strange copycat kidnapper. In addition to this, most of the time in this movie the sky looks very grey, it's raining or actions take place in the middle of almost moonless nights. The inoffensive but dark and somewhat uneasy score underlines this depressive film noir approach.Not only the French Canadian director Denis Villeneuve who created the intense drama "Incendies" in the past delivers a detailed and intense work. The most outstanding thing is the acting. Hugh Jackman plays the role of his life as a desperate family father who is slowly going insane and ready to do anything to save his daughter. It's hard to portray a character who is going through such an incredible nightmare but Hugh Jackman is always convincing. You can feel his emotions in every word he speaks, in every move he makes and in every breath he takes. This acting performance should be worthy of an Academy Award. Jake Gyllenhaal is just as great and also does his best acting performance. He portrays a visibly nervous detective if you just take a look on his almost hyperactive eye movements. We see a detective who tries to be professional and dedicated to his job but who gets more and more isolated and who starts making more and more mistakes. By the end of the movie, the kidnapping case has also become something almost personal for him as he acts beyond rationality to solve the case. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is also worthy of an Academy Award. The supporting actors are also doing a fine job. Especially Paul Dano convinces as inscrutable and unpredictable suspect. His aunt portrayed by Melissa Leo gets better and better as the movie progresses.The tension of the story gets more and more elevated towards the end. I don't want to reveal any twists but let's say that I didn't see the incredible revelations coming. During the last thirty minutes or so, the movie even got me more on the edge of my seat than it was the case before. These last thirty minutes introduce a whole new dimension to the movie. Some viewers may dislike this new approach but I thought that it added even more intensity to the film.At the end of the day, this is an atmospheric, intense and extremely well acted film noir that mixes credible drama elements with gripping and sometimes scary crime passages. If you care for any of these genres, you can't get around this movie this year. I hope it will win a couple of Academy Awards next year as I can hardly see any better Hollywood movie these days. I'm convinced this will be considered as a classic or one of the best movies of all times one day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that goes to show how a simple plot of two missing girls can turn into a very entertaining piece of work. Led by a terrific cast including Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Terrance Howard, and Viola Davis, what could have been a very dull and boring movie, turns into one of the most gripping and intense movies of the year.Jackman and Gyllenhaal are what carried the movie in my opinion. What do you do when you lose your daughter??? And as the detective, how do you help without crossing the line? These questions are answered and answered well from the first moment they notice the 2 girls are missing.Like in most movies, there is an obvious suspect and as the audience you follow along because really, how the movie is playing out, you start to believe it. The suspect is played by Paul Dano. Who does a brilliant job and you really don't know what his deal is. In my mind, I couldn't read him.At a running time of almost 150 minutes, you don't feel like you've been watching a movie for so long, which is a very good sign of a movie you will enjoy. Like I said, the acting is brilliant, on all levels and even though you rarely see the 2 girls in the beginning, you care for them and hope that it will be resolved and quickly. One of the best movies so are in 2013 and a 9/10 rating for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is one of the best movies that 2013 has to offer. It is an absolute must-see, especially in theatre. This is Hugh Jackman is his grittiest and perhaps truest role. Jake Gyllenhaal shines as an intense and dedicated officer who struggles to balance being a good cop and being an emotionally support to the family. I felt that this movie, even though somewhat fantastical in small parts, is the epitome of what happens to families when they suffer through a child's disappearance.My entire review is below.

		<shortDescription>Edge-of-the-Seat Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Prisoners", starring Hugh Jackman-Les Miserables-2012, Van Helsing; Jake Gyllenhaal-End of Watch, Brokeback Mountain; Terrence Howard-Red Tails, Big Momma's House; Maria Bello-Grown Ups, Coyote Ugly and Paul Dano-Cowboys &amp; Aliens, There Will Be Blood.This is a tense edge-of-the-seat thriller with some hidden surprises. Hugh and Maria are visiting their neighbors during the Thanksgiving holidays when something happens that every parent dreads. Their six year old daughter and the daughter of their friend Terrence disappear. After searching everywhere, the only clue is a suspicious looking RV that was seen in the neighborhood. The police are called in and Jake is the head detective; he has a reputation for solving all of his cases. Paul is spotted in the RV and arrested but no physical evidence is found of the missing girls. With no evidence, Paul is released which does not sit well with Hugh, who decides to take matters into his own hands. The question of how far a father would go to get his daughter back is explored and then you have the idea of whether Paul is even the right guy or not. Paul has a stunted mental capacity of a ten year old, and there are other suspects, so questions are raised. I thought it was also realistically portrayed how some people will turn to drinking or drug use to cope with the stress of a missing child. FYI: There is a scene, during an interrogation, that I could have sworn a policeman calls Jake by his real name-it was something like,'Let me know if you find out anything, Gyllenhaal.' Anyway, I enjoyed the movie but the ending was kind of off; It was kind of abrupt, as if they were trying to wrap it up. It is rated "R" for violence-including scenes of torture, language and drug/alcohol use and has a running time of 2 hours &amp; 33 minutes. It was a nice thriller but I don't think that I would buy it on DVD-once was enough. It would be a good rental, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been good - and turns into a complete failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" might be the best example for a movie, that could have been really good, but then fails in every single way and leaves you behind with a mix of anger, irritation and sheer disappointment. What could have been a good movie with interesting ideas, great actors and difficult moral questions turns into a boring and annoying peace of Hollywood-average-garbage by trying to satisfy a Hollywood-average-audience, who expect every story to turn into a fluffy fairy tale with simple answers, happy endings and the destruction of evil... All proceedings after the first half of the movie are so forced and stupid and inconsistent with the whole storyline, they just lead you to face palm yourself again and again and again.What did upset me the most - beside the incredible incompetence of the on-screen-police and the fact that no one in the movie seems to give a sh** about the fate of Alex and Bob, who were victims just like the two girls - were the following points:1) Both Keller and Detective Loki try to reach their goal by using brute force without searching for alternatives.°Real-life-consequence: Every innocent victim will die: The young men - directly or indirectly - by the hands of Keller/Loki, the girls, because no one ever got the idea to ask a psychologist to TALK to the two obviously mentally ill/disordered boys to find an answer. Instead they are tortured or lead into suicide, the only chance to find a trace gets literally smashed, which gives the real kidnapper enough time to accomplish her work. (Which is even more annoying, after Loki must have recognized, that he came furthest with cool-headed investigation, while his fit of rage did ruin everything)°Prisoners/Hollywood-consequence: That's alright, because in the end everything will be fine, no matter what you do, because you are the good guy. Just sit down and relax, god and destiny will fix everything for you and turn the world into a lollipop-sky-loft with cute little rainbow-unicorns.2) Alex, a mentally ill, traumatized and, as we see, innocent boy, is tortured and violated in the most brutal way, with heat, frost, darkness, his head is nearly smashed and who knows what other bodily parts,too. °RLC: If lucky, Alex will die by the terrible injuries or a following inflammation, as he had no water, no food and the old house was full of dirt. In any case he will keep long-term damages, not only physically, he is now more traumatized than ever before. Almoust certainly he is going to kill himself sooner or later. °P/HC: That's alright, just put an article into a newspaper about a wonderful family-reunion, so the audience will know, he will live happily ever after - you know, with the rainbow-unicorns I mentioned before.3) Keller didn't achieve anything by his outrage, except leaving his family alone in their fear and grief, (nearly) killing an innocent boy, playing into the hands of kidnapper Holly Jones by keeping away Alex, who could have given a real clue with the real treatment, and turning himself into a victim of evil Holly by acting careless and imprudent.°RLC: Keller will die in that hole in the belief, that his daughter is dead - which will happen with the utmost probability. Even if he escaped, his family would turn away from him (if his wife did not die accidentally of an overdose of sleeping pills before, which is most likely), because he did not care about them all the time, brought his daughter into great danger and turned himself into a monster by violating a victim like his own daughter without any effect. He will go to jail for that - just like his two friends, whose daughter will then have no parents anymore, just like Anna is left behind with an imprisoned father, a disillusioned brother and a mother addicted to pills. °P/HC: That doesn't matter, because you're meant to be the good guy, and good guys always get saved in the end, and if anybody had a doubt about the fact, that you're the good guy, your wife will point it out loudly and proudly for the audience once more and explain, that you just did what you had to do (which does not make any sense at all, because his actions lead into nothing), that everything will be alright now and that you will be forgiven for everything.It was an interesting idea for a movie to ask the question: How far would you go to save someone you love, and what if it turns you into a more awful monster than the one you are chasing? Because in the end there is not much difference between Holly and Keller and between what they are willing to do to innocent children. The main character has done everything wrong and his actions had to be leading into a dark and deep abyss - including the death of his daughter, the death of Alex, the imprisoning of his friends, maybe the accidentally suicide of his wife and, not to forget, his own death. Instead the moral of this story is, that the end always justifies the means, torture and witch hunt are alright, no matter against whom, when you're the good guy, as who you are above reproach. In my opinion this movie is a complete failure, because the creators were too scared or too contracted (or too scared of a contracted audience) to bring their storyline to an adequate ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie came out in 2013 and yet it's 2015 and still one of my favorite movies til this day. Jake Gyllenhaal is a phenomenal actor but I must say so myself, this is his best performance by far. You can tell the directors and screen writers really took their time on this because the actors gave outstanding performances, and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole 2 hours! In fact, at the very end I was left wanting more, but it couldn't have ended more perfectly leaving it to the audience's perception. Everything about this movie was amazing, saw it twice in theaters and about a dozen times more ever since. I have yet to find a suspenseful thriller to out do this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like watching movies that have a clear and defined finish, this movie definitely does not have that. For me the finish left the movie hanging, now I love watching TV shows that have cliff hangers I cant wait for the next episode to see what happens. This movie does not have a second to help resolve definitively what happens in the ending, so for me it wrecked the rest of the movie.The storyline was OK not unfamiliar, I deciphered very early on the guilty and sat watching and waiting for the crime to be solved. The story opens many things and leaves the trail opened yet unfinished. The acting was good and it was gripping in places. However if your are like me and like to watch a movie and fill completed at the end do not watch this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too superficial; Inconsistent characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like the ethical thing to do would be to give this movie 1 or 2 stars, to offset the undeservedly high rating it enjoys in IMDb. But I'll stick to 4. I was happy to see that I wasn't a complete outlier in feeling so outraged by this movie's popularity that I felt the need to write a review. Apart from Hugh Jackman's brilliant performance (and Jake's was pretty good too), and the fact of the movie's subject - exploring the utilitarian morality of whether torture is ever justified as a means to an end - there isn't really much else that's even remotely praiseworthy. Most annoying to me was how inconsistent the characters were - Alex has the 'IQ of a 10-year old', but manages to drive around fine in his RV, lie to the police officers that he does not know the girls, and yet again, he is playful(and prepared) enough to mutter "they didn't cry until I left" when Keller suddenly confronts him! He endures days of torture for no apparent reason before talking about 'mazes'. He randomly strangles his dog while taking it for a walk, and his helplessness suddenly melts away when he attacks Nancy and Keller with a carefully selected shard of glass during his torture! I was also led to believe that this was an Argo-like nail-biting movie. It isn't. I watched this at home and I managed to fast forward a few seconds every now and then because there was no action going on and the director did not even give us anything to chew on during those moments of inactivity. The characters are also way too superficial for my liking. Gyllenhaal plays an insomniac work-obsessed good cop who is always going to scary places all by himself. But that's all we know about him - nothing else of who he is or why he does what he does. And the last one may be because of my lack of a sufficient understanding of American life, but I simply don't get how so many weird f***s like Alex, his mom, and the snake guy manage to eke out a living to maintain a house and a car while pursuing their creepy 'hobbies'.Lately I've noticed a slew of movies that for some odd reason enjoy an unusually high rating of 8+ on IMDb and then turn out to be complete trash...it's disappointing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely Filled with Inconsistencies..........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I primarily watched this movie because it received a rating of over an 8 on IMDb. What does that mean to me? A movie in the caliber of Jurassic Park, The Shining, Jaws, The Deer Hunter, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, etc. I mean..... Movies that REALLY made an impact in cinema in one way or another. Those truly unforgettable movies that are just plain special. Not only is this movie not 'special', it has more holes than a block of swiss cheese. 1) A guy sees a refrigerator with a long cord and the first thing that comes to mind is a secret door behind it??? Ridiculous.... 2) If this 'mentally challenged' suspect is in fact just a victim and not involved, why did he whisper something to the child's father like he was involved, when in the end he wasn't? 3) When the father is drugged and told to back the Trans Am up under gun point with the door is wide open, why doesn't he just step on the gas, collect the sick woman in the open door like a net, and run her over????? 4) If the woman was in fact worried about the police 'sniffing' around her house, WHY would she take the children out of the hole in the ground WHERE NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY KNOW THEY WERE, and put in a bedroom where they could easily escape and were one was eventually found by the detective?? 5) If this woman was so intent on keeping all of this a secret, why would she ALL OF A SUDDEN decide to throw in the towel and get caught red handed when the detective showed up at her house for an unrelated matter? 6) After the police departments 'forensic' team goes through the motor home, WHY is it they find no trace of the girls (when in fact that WAS the vehicle used in the kidnapping), nor they do not find any trace of that psychopath woman (which also turned out was in the RV)?? 7) Why bring this 'copy-cat' kidnapper into the movie??? Why?? He buys children's clothes from the store and breaks into the kidnapped kids houses and steals their clothes? They could have shaved 30 minutes off this overly-long movie just by keeping this unnecessary character out of the movie completely and spent that time fixing the laundry list of inconsistencies....8) How is the main characters former addiction to alcohol necessary ANYWHERE in the film?? Just another one of many distractions to keep the holes in this movie camouflaged. This is just a sign of modern day movies which fail to deliver, and the forgiving audiences that don't care that a film if full of inconsistencies and still think it is somehow it is worthy of 'film of the year'?? I've also learned that a IMDb rating of over an 8 doesn't really mean much anymore. I could go on and on and on with examples on how this movie fell apart...... Lots of suspense &amp; had potential if someone had actually taken the time to fix the storyline. It had the basic ingredients to be a GREAT film! Very little in this movie adds up. It's a shame such excellent resources were not properly utilized and all that is left is a unrealistic mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i wanted to watch this movie so bad.honestly this movie turned out to be something completely different from what i was expecting. First i found this movie to be a bit too long and was a bit boring at the moments. However i did like the acting and atmosphere was dark and completely suitable for this movie and this story.Loved also the drama and how they showed the emotions of a family struck by this misery of a daughter being kidnapped and not knowing how to help her or find her. But at some points the story is too slow for my taste,and then the ending was somewhat disappointing for me. I couldn't say that this movie is predictable and that you know from the start how it is going to end, but it has crossed my mind several times during the movie who the kidnapper is and turned out to be that i was right. All in all i would recommend it but with precaution and must point out once again that the movie is actually slow although a lot of people seem to think that every scene is important, i believe that they actually needed to cut some scenes and the story had to move faster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, fascinating, twisted and just one of the smartest films I've seen in ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always actively pursuing the next dark thriller that will hold a candle to the film Se7en. I think that was easily the most brilliant crime thriller I have ever seen. I suspected that Prisoners could potentially be a terrific film and I was so pleased to discover that it is exactly that. I don't mean to say it was good as Se7en but it absolutely holds its own. There were some truly outstanding performances (and a couple of underwhelming ones), but the best part of this film was the script. What a brilliantly crafted, artistic, stunning film filled with symbolism, twists, turns and darkness. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 1/2 hours but I didn't think it dragged at all. The pacing was consistent and I can't imagine any aspect of the film not being there in order to tell the full story. The clues added up, the twists made sense and I was able to put together the story and figure it out even before it was revealed (which is unusual for me.) But I mean that to be a good thing. As a movie goer you are privy to every detail and clue. This is absolutely not a typical mainstream film. Critics are raving about it and for good reason! I expected Hugh Jackman would give a good performance and he does. He is a powerful presence on screen and his unravelling as he desperately tries to find his daughter and will literally go to any length is disturbing and terrific. Jackman deserves acclaim once again for another performance. I thought Jackman would be the best performance in the film BUT that honour in my opinion goes to Jake Gyllenhaal. He is just electrifying on screen and what an amazing character he brings to life. Just watching him do this is fascinating because his character has so many ticks, habits, tattoo's...he clearly has a huge back story that we don't know about. I think its unusual but also brilliant for a film maker to give so much depth to a supporting character. Paul Dano gives a solid and very creepy performance as the accused Alex Jones. Dano is good but he might oversell it just a little bit in some scenes. Same goes for Melissa Leo (whom I admit I am sort of tired of and always found her overrated.) She is good in her role as Dano's Aunt but in some scenes I felt like she was overacting especially towards the end. I love Viola Davis, I think she is a great actor and she is decent in this but sort of underused and despite one particularly good scene between her and Dano, she sort of flounders in the shadow of Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The final two performances were the worst in the film unfortunately. Terrence Howard might have been alright if his character has been given more to work with. But when you have one father who is showing some powerful emotions and going to all ends to find his daughter...Howard's character comes across as skittish and boring. He looks terrified enough but that's the only emotion he demonstrates. I can't even say Maria Bello would be good under any circumstances because her character and her performance was just awful. Most of the film she spends in bed thank goodness but even in her gut wrenching grief it is overdone and overacted. Its really unfortunate because it somehow drags Jackman's scenes down just a little when she's in them. She is the weak link of this cast by far.Oscar nominated director Denis Villeneuve crafts the best thriller I think I've seen all year. I long to see the special features on a Blu-Ray release to see if he discusses all the things that were purposely done in this movie. It is clearly set in modern day and yet the homes, the appliances, the vehicles, the decor...all have a distinctive 70's/80's vibe to it. Despite some mediocre to bad performances by the main cast the film is not dragged down completely by it. Jackman and Gyllenhall are very nearly awe-inspiring in their parts so it balances out nicely. The film is so grey and bleak and the scenes are perfectly shot to leave you wondering what is coming next and what is happening. I am not a prude by any means and I can watch just about anything and have but I felt like the extreme language (particularly the "F" word) was used FAR too much. I do believe completely that it was necessary in many spots and added to the characters but it was overused again and again until it became distracting and I hate that. Honestly, Prisoners is a 10/10 movie that loses points for silly little things that should have been avoided. The story is a 10, two performances are 10's, the cinematography is a 10...but then when you start looking at things that took away from how great these things were you have to penalize it a little. Regardless, True Crime fans or anyone looking for a really above average thriller cannot go wrong with this one. I think there was so much symbolism in this movie that I missed the first time around and the bizarre but appropriate religious undertones as well. See it for yourself but make sure you understand this isn't a blow-em-up action flick but rather a brilliant, masterpiece of crime film. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating Thriller Made For the Right Reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adult films of noteworthy mention rarely exist anymore, unless they are after Oscar Gold. It's been slim pickings for adult audiences who may not be in the mood to attempt an awards contender, but want to be treated like they have some brain activity. Thrillers are a great use of adult films, actors and audience. Adults want to feel the "edge" of suspense stories, like teenagers do with horror films; but while not wasting their time with a low quality film. Prisoners brings back that genre that has felt extinct since 2005, a colossal year for thrillers. The acting is fantastic. Prisoners hired actors who know how to act and wanted to make the picture for the sake of trying their best. Hugh Jackman punches us with his vehemence, a performance that shakes you, even if his accent may not be etched out with perfection. Jake Gyllenhaal has a more unnoticed character that slowly builds to moments allowing Gyllehaal to execute strength and power.Viola Davis brings the house down with only one meaty scene. Terrance Howard reiterates he's a talent that can convey massive emotion by saying very little. Melissa Leo turns in her best post-Oscar portrayal, but still doesn't "wow" us like she used to. Sadly, Maria Bello didn't cut it for me. Her crying scenes seem phony and I don't empathize with her character. The character is written to be a mother barely grasping onto hope in her life; it feels like Bello didn't put the effort in to make that character reach her full potential. After seeing as many films as I have, especially films intended to spook you, sooner or later you learn all the tricks and your threshold adapts to the environment you've grown a part of. Prisoners is the one film in a good while to actually scare me. Some images are terrifying and built with perfect sinister tone, while other scenes match those with jolting chases or disturbing moments of torture. The themes aren't anything groundbreaking, we've felt the messages of Prisoners in dozens of other films in the past. There's parallelism drawn with the conclusion, grief and religion are inevitable in a film of this topic, but those dramatics are not what interested me. The plain message that comes with the drastic twist just pleads to parents and babysitters to never underestimate anyone. Predators are lurking to swoop anything they can get their hands on at the right time. Child kidnapping is still a sensitive topic to be used in films right now and I found the plot pushing the envelope to be exhilarating.I believe in years to come Prisoners will gain a reputation similar to Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino's '90s hit, Heat: universally praised, cult-bound, and unnoticed with accolades. Both genre films give the audience credit to maintain a well-paced narrative. Prisoners doesn't feed us unnecessary information, it often cuts a scene off when the built action reaches the goal of the scene without letting us see the predictable result. Prisoners puts its genre on the path for the future.Grade: A-Rating: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best crime thrillers in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a film best left not knowing much about it. It's a long, slow-paced crime thriller. It requires the viewers to invest themselves emotionally, and will often keep the viewer on the edge of their seats throughout it's many twists and turns. Prisoners is tedious at times because of it's slow unravelling nature, however this is used to draw the viewer in and join in this thriller. More films like this need to be made and it's a shame that Hollywood won't touch this subject matter more often. Prisoners is quite a dark and disturbing story. However I felt that it didn't quite push itself as far as it could have. That being said it still is a very dark thriller, and one of the best in recent memory. Hugh Jackman is outstanding in this film, and hopefully he gets an Oscar nod. However unfortunately I feel that this film will be ignored by the time it comes to award season. All the actors in this film are great and it's a well acted machine. Prisoners is also very well directed. I cannot recommend this film enough and easily will say this is one of the best films of the year. It's not without it's problems but this is one thriller not to miss!!Rating: 9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first must say I am going to give a major spoiler later in this review but I will try and keep that a little vague. I seldom put spoilers in reviews but this film is complex and I must bring up the turn of events. As far as acting goes this is Jake Gyllenhaal's film. He is excellent throughout and the most human person in the film. His character is certainly who I identified with. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting progressed and was superior in the last part of the film.This is certainly not a liberal film and not conservative either. The ending was clear and I do not see any ambiguousness in the ending either. It was obvious what was happening in the last 30 seconds. Further even the small comment early in the film about being against deer hunting when we sit around eating hamburgers at McDonald's with industrialized slaughter to feed millions is absolutely a good point about society's hypocrisy. But I don't want to deviate from the plot. This was just one tiny early sentence in the film.I do believe the film could have been just as good with a little less brutality. I am especially referring to the water part which was not needed. In the middle I wasn't sure if I would like the film. But ultimately I would say it was a top film. The acting and the story was fine. The religious angle actually changed as the film played out. Now for a major spoiler. Who would ever believe that the priest may actually have been correct? Was this a war against God? I will say no more about that. Ultimately, this film could not be entirely judged to be dark. Certainly the cop was intense and believable. There was some deserved justice delivered even for the brutality. Although the legal penalties were not reached and i will leave that vague. The final 10 minutes was riveting. And even some fast car scenes were very effective because of the depth of the plot. i have tried to be somewhat vague for those who have not yet seen the film. And the ending was very clear to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Denis Villeneuve did better with "Incendies"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first learned of Quebecois director Denis Villeneuve when I saw his movie "Incendies", about a brother and sister who try to find out the identity of their father in a war-torn Middle Eastern country. Having just watched "Prisoners", I was surprised to see that Villeneuve directed it. I was also disappointed. I won't deny that it's a very intense movie, but I will say that the dads' actions seem excessive. It looks like the sorts of things that Liam Neeson now does in movies (and his current characters seem to be based on Harrison Ford's characters). I'll admit that I didn't figure out what was going to happen as the movie progressed, but that doesn't make up for the extreme actions taken by the dads. The point is that this is not a movie that I recommend. In addition to the director, each of the main cast members has done better movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So how far would you go to get back your child who had just been kidnapped? That's the thrust of this dark movie which takes as its themes the disturbing and sadly, ever-topical subject of the abduction of young children and also the use of torture on the suspected perpetrator, even as I appreciate that the latter has only so far come into the public consciousness in the military world. Perhaps not being a parent and also something of a libertarian, I didn't find myself on the side of the, I hesitate to say, (avenging) angels and found the scenes of what I'll understatingly term rendition, as upsetting as they were unjustifiable in a so-called civilised society. Besides this I found the movie's condescension to the conventions demanded of Hollywood thrillers compromised the bigger subjects it attempted to address.The fulcrum of the film is the disappearance and as we soon learn, kidnapping of two young girls, one white, one black, from their two families on Thanksgiving Night in an anonymous blue-collar US town. After the prime suspect, a young, mentally retarded man, is released for lack of corroborative evidence, the two fathers, Hugh Jackman and Terrence Howard, decide to take matters into their own hands, the former leading the latter on and himself turning into a semi-crazed vigilante, abducting the suspect and creating a grisly torture chamber to extract the truth from him. Also becoming consumed with the case is the local one-man, or so it seems, police service, Jake Gyllenhaal, egged on by the impotence of the law he serves and a sympathy with the parents for their loss, he too struggles to preserve his sanity and necessary detachment from the case, but who of course still arrives at the Eureka-type resolution and ends up delivering, what I'll term a predictable Hollywood ending.Personally speaking, I couldn't marry up the wider philosophical and ideological questions the film throws up with the conventions of the dynamics of a big-money feature. I found it pandered too much to our baser emotions when in truth it should have been more questioning of Jackman's methods and I think sends out the wrong message about taking the law into one's own hands, no matter the provocation. On a more mundane level, I was unconvinced by the denouement, even to the extent of the surprise identity of the actual perpetrator and also the insertion of curious red-herrings along the way and an unbelievable life-or-death race-against-time.As for the acting, you'd certainly call it committed and driven, but for me anyway, both Jackman and Gyllenhaal failed to really engage me in their pivotal roles while the drawn- out direction, filmed to a backdrop of grainy, often rainy exteriors, never struck the required balance between docu-drama and nail-biting tension. This movie was a tough, gruelling watch (one suspects there is a much-longer director's cut in the background) and while a welcome reduction of the ridiculously over-the-top takes we've seen recently from Hollywood on this upsetting subject (Liam Neeson's "Taken" films for example), still didn't get the balance right, in my eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of time and brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friends raved and raved about this movie so I was very excited to see and probably had too high expectations? I. HATED. This. Movie.First of all, it dragged on foooorrrreeevvvveeerrrrr. It felt like I was sitting there for 5 hours. Yes it was enjoyable to try and guess whodunnit but I am so angry about the ending that it ruined the rest of it for me.Obviously I won't spoil it for anyone but be warned IT CUTS OFF! You sit through all of that, they don't show outcomes of a few characters, and you're waiting for your happy ending closure and then BAM! Credits. I can't believe I wasted that much time when I could have knocked at least 2 other movies off my list that night. Nothing, I repeat NOTHING makes me angrier than a movie with no closure. It's designed so that you can assume what happens but screw that, if I have to sit there and go through all that stuff just to leave it up to my imagination what happens in the end it's automatically failed. My other pet peeve is that Jake Gyllenhaal was a terrible cop. Not that his acting was bad, but his character itself was retarded. He was ALWAYS alone, never followed protocol, never let anyone know where he was and that is just bad writing. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've seen worse.If you are like me and need closure and answers, DO NOT waste your time on this movie.</fullReview>

At least it meant I could shrink the window whilst doing something meaningful.The movie starts OK, drops to average and finishes too late.The acting is crap. Can I say that? Jackman shows yet again why he is usually a wolf or a singer. Character acting is not his bag. He has a chance to show something, but fails. The script is routine. By part way through you'll be thinking you have seen this before and you probably have. Regular roles and diversions as seen in so many B-grade 'horror' movies. It has the production qualities of a straight-to-DVD release and the bargain bin is where it should rest.The ending is just the dumbest part. You have to accept that the whole police department is just plain incompetent. Instead it was the production team who were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Includes all the great qualities of a crime-thriller, but is dragged by too many irrationalities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After deeply religious father Jackman's daughter goes missing with a neighbor girl, he targets prime suspect Dano while detective Gyllenhaal pursues other leads. The film doesn't necessarily succeed at being epic, but it is terrifically well-paced for clocking-in at over a two-and-a-half hour runtime?director Villeneuve does an excellent job using fade-outs to skip passed the obvious melodrama. The story involves emotions and chills from all aspects of an unthinkable crime, including: the family members of the abducted children, the investigators and even those close to the suspect. Unfortunately, the movie is dragged by too many obvious detective blunders by Gyllenhaal's characters: 1) Whaaa? I can't discreetly park my car in the middle of the road in broad daylight? 2) Whaaa? I'm going to have all family members take a polygraph, but not consider looking into the fact that one of the fathers owns an abandoned building the girls may be at? 3) Whaaa? When I finally find out one of the fathers owns an abandoned building and I establish my new suspicions of him, I SHOULD call a search team? 4) Whaaa? I've been seeing a lot of mazes ever since I started investigating these girls' disappearances. There IS a connection?Another unfortunate downfall is the annoying and awkward light adjustments between interior and exterior scenes.The moral of a film should either raise questions, or provide answers or some sort of hope. This film just kind of confuses, as it doesn't really grasp hold of how suspects are sometimes guilty until proved innocent or how there are some ridiculous limitations the law has at preventing and/or solving crimes. Either: A) make a statement, or B) give the audience something to reflect on. This film seems to do neither. It would be nice to go into a crime-thriller with an open-mind and NOT have to suspend as much disbelief. But all-in-all, not a complete waste of a film.**? (out of four)</fullReview>

Terrence Howard and his wife don't go to jail as accomplices? Jackman KIDNAPS someone and beats him senseless for a week? and I actually did LAUGH out loud when they finally showed the kids face after a week of beatings. It looked like a bad Halloween mask. Totally unrealistic, just ridiculous. An he can beat him to a pulp but hitting they bad guys fingers with a hammer is where he draws the line? BAHAHAHA And then there was Jackman's useless worthless whining wife. What a horrible part poorly played. And oh yeah, I kept waiting for the air bag in the dash of the police car to explode when Jackman was pounding on it. And the real bad guy is an old woman? oh and let's linger on the maze medallion the first time we see it so we can show it again later when Gyllenhal, "great" detective that he was, has apparently forgotten seeing it around a DEAD guys neck three hours ago.Sorry but Jake just wasn't bringing it in this, he just looked like an idiot and you cant tell me he wouldn't have been fired for telling his police captain BOSS to f off. Lots of badly telegraphed crap like that whistle too. And in the end Jackman goes to jail but they don't bother to show that or the effect on his family. Just garbage, but Jackman himself at least did a good job where as Howard was just bad. Really glad he ain't Tony Stark's guy any more.Seriously, you know why this doesn't work? Because once Jackman starts beating the kid up, he becomes a criminal too REGARDLESS of why he's beating up the kid. Once your hero does something despicable, you lose sympathy for him immediately and even more so in the end when you find out the poor schmuck he pummeled isn't the bad guy anyway.</fullReview>

Tag line for this film should have been "World's stupidest father meets worlds slowest detective." Moves at a snails pace with manufactured twists and not a single character resembles a real human being. Perhaps it would have worked better if the casting of the families had been reversed.

A slight twist in the story does not save this well trodden theme. The fact this film has more than 8 in the ratings says more about the state of mind of the public than anything else. If your looking for something different , this is not the film for you. Its high time the mould was broken and people started making more films that don't leave people worrying or in fear of what might happen to you or your family. Untouchable(french film) is what im talking about, or searching for sugar man. those type of films give you a good feeling, they contribute to this world.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just because Hugh Jackman is in a film, doesn't mean it is automatically going to be good. Hugh has a far broader acting range than this film allows him to use, and he was really just an angry dad, nothing more, and nothing less. I don't think he will be winning any awards from this film, not because of his acting, but because it just doesn't showcase his abilities. Overall, the film was highly predictable, and totally oversold by the trailer. It was 2 1/2 hours long, and despite moments of anticipation, was predominately slow moving and boring. The plot was loose at best, and filled with gaps, leaving you wondering about why some of the characters were even in the film. And then there is the ending. Well. Talk about leaving it hanging. If this was meant to be a thriller, it was sadly left short. I have seen better thrillers 20 years ago, that were far more engaging, thrilling, and shocking. SEVEN for example. I should have gone and seen Gravity 3D or Rush instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Prisoners" 2013 Fine Performances, Evocative Direction, Screwball Script I wanted to see "Prisoners" after I saw the trailer. Alas, the trailer contains all the best parts of the movie. Suburban parents celebrating Thanksgiving slowly come to realize that their two daughters are missing. The trailer featured quiet, dark scenes of increasing menace and despair, shot in realistic, autumnal, suburban settings. The trailer promised big, big stars: Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello as one set of parents and Viola Davis and Terence Howard as the other, Jake Gyllenhaal as the police detective, Paul Dano as the suspect and Melissa Leo as the suspect's adoptive parent. The trailer promised an intelligent thriller that would interrogate how far an ethical person could go in attempting to rescue his daughter from an abductor. The trailer also seemed to suggest an examination of how law enforcement responds, for better or worse, in child abduction cases. The first twenty minutes of "Prisoners" delivered what I'd hoped for based on the trailer, but I was hyper-aware that I was watching scene after scene I'd already seen in the trailer. Around the time that an unlikely body was found in an unlikely spot, and a fist met a face several times more than was necessary to make any point, but certainly enough times to satisfy a film-goer's sick, sadistic bloodlust, the movie went off the rails for me, abandoned all its seriousness and intelligence, and became sensational gore and commercial pap. I was so let down I wanted to leave the theater, but I stayed because I'd roped two friends into seeing this with me. "Prisoners" is a whodunit so there's a limit to what I can say without revealing any spoilers. I can say this. Jake Gyllenhaal powerfully performs a dedicated police detective. Hugh Jackman exercises his neck veins a lot, and his American accent is wobbly but okay. Terence Howard, Viola Davis, and Maria Bello are given criminally little to do. Viola Davis has one of the most interesting scenes in the movie. This scene is only a minute or two long and it is not developed at all. That is a shame because the scene is the moral crux of the film. And the film does nothing with it; the filmmakers went with implausible sensationalism and sadism rather than substance. Paul Dano, as the suspect, and Melissa Leo, as his adoptive mother, both give powerhouse performances in very challenging roles. Denis Villeneuve's direction is flawless. He avoids explosive stunts and theatrics with his camera. His moves are slow and quiet, even while filming ugly violence. I'd like to see his work on a better script. There are many attempts to make the movie deeper than it is. There are many scenes initially shot through dirty glass. "Through a glass darkly" is a line from the Bible. Ooo big symbolism. Wow. There are many crosses, including one hanging from the rearview mirror in Keller ? Hugh Jackman's ? truck. Wow. Heavy. I just may think something ? no, I'd rather watch snakes. Oh, yes. There are snakes. Some understand Satan as taking snake form in Genesis. Heavy. Profound! Yeah, not really. Just bizarrely implausible. There are strange character names. Hugh Jackman's first name is "Keller" which brings to mind the blind and deaf Helen Keller, or maybe the word "Killer." Jake Gyllenhaal is Detective Loki. Loki is the trickster God of Norse mythology. This is all pretty high school. There are two scenes and one character treatment in this film that I found completely implausible. The two scenes are essential to the plot. I can't describe these two scenes but I can say that one is utterly implausible because of surveillance. The action of the film takes place within hours and days of a child abduction. Not only police, but also media and neighbors would be keeping an eagle eye on all suspects. Another scene is implausible because it demands that we forget everything we've been told about a key character. One character treatment is unbelievable to me because a very unlikely character is depicted as being as heroic, in his way, as John McCain. Not plausible. I also found the final resolution of the crime to be something that would only occur in a writer's imagination, and the ending to be pointlessly cute. Again, the opening scenes of the dawning awareness that a child has been abducted are powerful, but the film totally lost me with its comic book sensationalism, sadism, and ? I have to say it ? stupidity.</fullReview>

Unnecessary delays don't build good suspense, but rage and disappointment of the viewer. In this case 29-year-old mum, that somehow found enough time to watch good movie on Monday evening. What went wrong with the world where suddenly movies like TWILIGHT SAGA, HUNGER GAMES....and books like 50 SHADES OF GRAY and series like SLEEPY HOLLOW (what's up with that!?) became right measure for quality and good smart entertainment!? Are good thrillers/dramas on the same road to idiocracy!? Don't watch this, instead go for Mystic river /drama, or Taken/ thriller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential, but was unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film after having watched the trailer and feeling slightly apprehensive but mostly excited. I liked how the trailer hinted at Hugh Jackman's character being shown to change in demeanor as a result of his daughter's abduction. In reality, the film took a turn in a different and more extreme direction - one that I wouldn't necessarily say was good.The start of the film played out well, with a realistic and credible scenario. But I found myself throughout the film getting more and more confused and more disinterested as a result. Don't get me wrong: I like films with twists and turns in unexpected directions, but too much so can make me feel a little queasy. I felt like I was spending too much time trying to explain to myself what on earth was going on rather than revelling in the excitement and tension of the actual film. This I found frustrating. Having said that, if you want some thrilling and tense scenes, I think this film provides quite a few. I just think a poor plot can detract from well-acted, tense scenes. In a nutshell, I would describe this film as a lot of twists, quirks and unusual concepts all put together in quick succession; however, they were not really linked. I could barely draw a connection between a lot of what was happening and I found myself drawn into a strange, unexplained plot which overall left me very unsatisfied. And that's, unfortunately, how I would say I felt at the end of the film. Unsatisfied, confused, and after about five minutes of trying to piece what I had just watched together, I realised I didn't really care.</fullReview>

The mystery keeps the plot interesting and thrilling even when the movie reaches the end, with the twists that keep coming eventually piece the puzzle together. But even then, even when the mystery is resolved, the plot doesn't leave the audience to relax. For me, however, the movie spins around Jackman who is the character who keeps the movie together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alternate endings???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>just watched this movie again on a premium movie channel. I swear it's got a different ending than when I rented the movie a couple of years ago. Was there a different ending filmed for the movie channel ending? Help! It's driving my husband and I crazy!!! In the movie channel version the movie ends with detective Loki hearing a whistle at Alex's house but then walking off screen. The rented version I remember had him recognizing that the car had been moved and finding Keller in the hole followed by Keller's trial and acquittal. What's up? Are my husband and I just making things up or was the movie released with alternate endings????? It's been driving us crazy and I don't see any mention of alternate endings anywhere in the IMDb information.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A intense pressured triller with twist and turns throughout. You have to be very clever to work out suspect. It's not to gory but Hugh gets a bit angry. Fantastic film, I was gripped throughout and I normally get bored and switch off. Plot line great. Great director. Great film. And ... Even ... Greater twist at end. The twist, is amazing!! You really need to focus tho because this is a film where if you switch off, lose the thred you'll be lost of the plot. I like to say that it's a watcher. Not that you can actually physical turn away its a sitter and you need to switch off your smartphones and sit on the couch and take notice. There is so many avenues the director takes you down and I gaurentee you'll spend the whole film telling the others watching it to shush and you guess the storyline.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a crime drama that is just the right balance of familiar and fresh, this is the movie you want to watch. Unforgettable acting performances from Gyllenhaal and Jackman. The plot takes you places you didn't expect and then does it again when you least expect it, just like a good mystery/suspense story should. It makes you think about the mystery of human nature, and what humans are capable of when they are pushed to their limits.I'll throw in some minor criticism though:Jackman and his wife in the movie have this strange lack of chemistry, I kept forgetting they were supposed to be married at all.Gyllenhaal's character could have used a little bit more development. In the movie he just does his detective thing, usually a movie tries to give them a little subplot too. It's good they didn't throw in some stereotypical romance with a stripper, or substance abuse problem, or some trope like that, but a little something to give his character more dimension would have been good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what you would do, or how far you would go to protect your family?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever considered what you would do, or how far you would go to protect your family? What could you be capable of doing to ensure the safety of your loved ones? Prisoners is a film that pushes the boundaries of moralistic values, it crosses a line that we hope to never have to cross in a situation we pray we never have to be in. Keller Dover played by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, Les Misérables) and his wife Grace played by Maria Bello(Payback, The Secret Window) attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their neighbours Franklin played by Terrence Howard (Iron Man, Hustle &amp; Flow) and Nancy Birch played by Viola Davis (How to get away with murder, The Help). Their 2 young daughters, Anna and Joy go outside to play but never return. An investigation is launched with Detective Loki played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Nightcrawler, Brokeback Mountain)arresting the prime suspect being a young man with the IQ of a ten year old whose RV was spotted where the young girls were last seen. As time drags on and the girls remain missing slowly desperation sets in and Keller decides to take matters into his own hands?. Once again I want to say so much about the plot but if I do I'd be breaking my own rules and giving away so much. The plot is so interesting, I loved it, I loved the way the story in its entirety was played out, and I loved the characters and how well they were played. Hugh Jackman proves once again why he is so sought after in the film industry he was so convincing as the desperate father I'm surprised there was no Oscar buzz about his performance. Not only Hugh though, his fellow cast members were just as engaging and hypnotic. A perfect cast in my opinion. Jake Gyllenhaal (who did win Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival) was mesmerising with his character as well. The other stand out feature for me though was the cinematography it was amazing and really feel it helped the story teller tell his amazing tale; once again I was extremely impressed by the visuals. I don't really know the director Denis Villeneuve's other works but I can tell he is a man of talent and I'll be looking him up to see what else he has done. Prisoners will leave you feeling desperate and curious, running at a little under 3hrs it does take its toll as well, I'm not sure it really needed to be that long but for the outcome it does work and you hardly notice the time. The film is very disturbing in nature, has some very graphic scenes so not one for the kids. Be prepared for a magical ride with this one it'll have you'll be running a full gauntlet of emotions and I'm so glad to say the twists and turns the film takes throughout only make it so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the scariest thrillers I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners may not contain jump scares, ghosts, screaming, things that go bump in the night or loads of fog but it is one of the scariest movies of 2013. This terrifying child abduction thriller is unbelievably chilling and once it has viewers in its raw, icy grip it never lets go. Hugh Jackman and Terence Howard are the 2 fathers whose daughters go missing and Jake Gyllenhaal's detective tries to find them. Both the fathers go to extreme lengths to find their children. The film goes into a lot of dark territory, and it has some very disturbing scenes. But it is genuinely, completely and undeniably brilliant. It's 2 and a half hour length was unnecessary and there are scenes which weren't needed. This doesn't blunt the film's impact overall though. The acting and cinematography make the movie. Roger Deakin's amazing cinematography and Denis Villeneuve's tense direction mean the film both looks amazing and is absolutely filled with dread. If you want to be on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours watch this. Trust me, you will be.Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is subtle but excellent, and Terence Howard is very good as well. Sadly, the memory of Hugh Jackman's amazing acting in this has been obscured since I saw Movie 43 only a few days after this, but it was a terrifying, powerful and skilled performance that didn't get the attention it deserved. The mystery element is compelling and you don't guess the murderer before the end. It's very well written and none of the dialogue feels forced. None of the emotional breakdowns or freak outs feel forced either. It is too long, but there's always stuff going on and the length does not damage the film. The thrills are based on the mystery and on suspense, but when there are thrilling moments they're very well handled and have you right on the edge of your seat. I think this should have been a contender for a best picture nod as it's a lot better than American Hustle, Dallas Buyers Club and Philomena. An excellent and overlooked film from 2013 that's definitely worth your time. If you want to see Hugh Jackman lose it this is the film for you.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I don't want to sound subjective because Hugh Jackman is one of my all time favorite actors, but I truly believe that this is his best role ever and frankly I'm a bit disappointed that this movie got just one Oscar nomination. The one word that describes this movie is tension! Until the very end, you do not know what is actually going on. You see one destroyed, desperate father willing to do anything to save his daughter and you sympathize with him even when you see that there is no limit that he wouldn't cross just to see his loved ones safe. Every single scene of this movie has it's meaning because it represents a part of a brilliant puzzle which unravels slowly to reveal such disturbing ending. Remarkable acting is followed by fantastic music and all those parts put together make this movie mind-blowing! It can't leave you indifferent. You will stay speechless, confused, sad and happy at the same time - it'll give you a full mix of different emotions. I would recommend everybody to watch this movie. It is a masterpiece worth every spent minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boom!... and that's how you make a hard-hitting Crime Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm classing this as one of my favourite films of the year. These days it's a rarity to become engrossed in a film that can bend and snap your predictions of the outcome. There's no waiting around in this one, the story starts evolving from the off-set playing off Hugh Jackman's greatest performance of his career to date. The perfect balance in fear and anger brings home that feeling you dread to relate to by situation. A very touchy subject for a storyline but not one to miss with again an exceptional performance from Paul Dano.Considering the length of the film and the type of film that is perceived through the audience eyes there is no 'dragging' or slowed down 'filler' parts of the movie. It's simply is one of those 'edge of your seat' thrillers, terrifying yet you don't want it to stop. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is memorable. An interesting take on a nowadays detective. A cold yet relatable character. Very well written. If you're looking for an in-depth realistic story following a missing child and a protective father look no further, this one will sure whet your appetite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be the best movie of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion Prisoners one of the best movies of 2013 if not the best. It opens on 2 family's getting together to have a fun night. But that is quickly ruined when the little girls from both families are missing. And it proceeds to weave a dark, intelligent look at what people will do to get the ones they love back. The cast is superb all receiving their share of character development and making you feel as if you are apart of these families and experiencing what they are going through. Prisoners mainly follows Hugh jackman and jake Gyllenhaal. Hugh jackman, the father of one of the missing girls doing everything to get his daughter back from stakeouts to torture. And Gyllenhaal the stone cold detective assigned to the kidnapping case. Putting on display Gyllenhaals uncanny ability it inhabit this character and bring a level of humanity that you don't see in your average film.Both have impressive performances. Specifically Hugh Jackman. Taking a step away from Wolverine is refreshing and puts on display his acting range. Serving as a reminder that he is more then just a guy with side burns. The scenes were he is torturing a possible suspect for information are not only hard to watch but surprisingly emotional. Maybe a little extreme but really putting in perspective how far you may be willing to go for the people you love. But They are brutal scenes and are not for the faint of heart. Prisoners also is able to deliver a great plot twist as well. Not just one either. The whole film feels like are constantly on a roller coaster ride. But Just when it feels like the ending is gonna go all Hollywood and mushy on you it takes a dark turn. Not saying that this movie isn't dark already but this really takes a turn. Trust me. Overall Prisoners is brilliantly well crafted thriller chalk full of tense sequences, Fantastic performances, and a feeling of humanity you don't get in other movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dear Academy Awards, the "cinematography" is not what drew me into this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the powerful performances coming from Hugh Jackman &amp; Jake Gyllenhaal!!! REALLY, you guys...(NOTE: I watched this film, simply because I was curious, like any other movie buff. I usually don't like movies with violence or swearing. And I don't like when any favorite celebrity of mine curses or swears, but perhaps that's just me.)The fact is, it's hard to make a good film. But this... This is officially the best non-X-men-related Hugh Jackman film I've seen! I admit, the man is talented &amp; gifted. (I'm not a fan of the X-Men franchise, for certain reasons. I.E. unscientific Darwinian evolution) (No, I didn't really like "Les Miserables" - I still think Liam Neeson was the better 'Jean Valjean'; this film's also better than "The Prestige").Back to the subject matter, this is a film that definitely WAS suspenseful! From BEGINNING to END, I was hooked! Thrilling &amp; mysterious at the same time! The acting, GREAT - Hugh Jackman, WOW. And the tension...oh my word!! I especially love the story line of black and white families fellow shipping together - I've had quite a bit of that experience myself. I think it's great, cute, charming, worthwhile, &amp; helps anyone develop as a person . Seriously, this film had me GUESSING and GUESSING. The entire time! Wondering who was where, who did what, what happened, etc,.I LOVE films that do that! It's a bummer you can't erase your memory of all the revealed plot twists &amp; the ending; that's when you get the desire to watch the film again with a person who hasn't seen it before. REALLY well-directed film, I'm betting it's going to stay in my mind for a long time!Conclusively, Paul Dano is one actor I really don't like; but it was a smart move to include him in this flick; they turned him into a socially awkward &amp; weird character, to get beat up and all - that kind of relieved my negative feelings toward him. (I mean, he was *annoying* in "The Girl Next Door", "There Will Be Blood" and "12 Years a Slave" - some films of which I don't really like.)Jake Gyllenhaal's cop character is pretty cool in this film; he and Jackman share great on-screen chemistry together! MUCH BETTER than that horrible "End of Watch" film, a worthless pile of nothing, with rancorous dialogue, &amp; all-round cantankerous characters you didn't even care about! Moving way back, I'm a fan of Gyllenhaal, simply because I've got a soft spot for talented Jewish people; a fan of his since watching "October Sky", which is a true story.Hugh Jackman's character, even as a father, is so believable (he really rocks the beard! lulz). You could see the intense emotion he develops throughout the film trying to find his daughter &amp; her friend, and the lengths he goes to try to find them! He almost somewhat reminded me of my own Dad! WHY he didn't get nominated for Best Leading Actor, I honestly don't know! Would've been much better than this being Academy-nominated for "Best Achievement in Cinematography" (which went to "Gravity" for whatever strange reason, when the earth was the background the entire time), or rather than the nomination for Best Actor going to Bruce Dern (an actor I don't really like or care about, nor did I find his performance in "Nebraska" the very LEAST interesting, compelling, or memorable!); also, doesn't every film try to have the "best cinematography" there is??? Why Academy??? WHY??? What did this film ever do to you!?? Why did you instead even nominate the cast of that horrible &amp; annoying "American Hustle" flick!??Hugh Jackam's Oscar nomination should've been for THIS amazing film, instead of "Les Mis".But to be fair, the downsides to the film are of course the violence, pervasive cursing, drunkenness, and even the shameful religion of Catholicism being depicted as well, with false idols of the Virgin Mary &amp; talking of priests as "father" &amp; all. (Trust me when I say Catholicism is a real dark false religion, but that's another long story. Just Google Search "Man In Black tract" if you want the short story.)But moving back, technically-speaking... while this movie was suspenseful, at the same time I kept having to move to a different computer &amp; keep installing the players; I was always anxious, CURIOUS to know what would happened next! That just kept building the thrills &amp; suspense even *MORE*.A lot of people have mixed feelings about the ending to this film; to me, I was not disappointed! The style of the ending was indeed amazing, and I think more films should do it! I always now imagine how the story must have continued after the ending... And I love that - I love movies with endings that leave you guessing!And WHY on earth do those "negative reviews" about this film exist &amp; where dare they coming from!?? They say this film is "overrated"!?...Didn't they watch the exact same film I did!??Seriously, Wow... just wow. The title "Prisoners" was a really creative choice - it made sense &amp; everything paid off in the story!And I love that quote: "Pray for the Best, Prepare for the Worst." ...Ditto to that!Just wrote this review because I had some free time, and because this film deserved it!Definitely one of the best films, I admit, of 2013, right alongside with Man of Steel....8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent, if disturbing movie, but why is the viewer left with such an unfinished ending?? What happens to Alex and to Anna's Dad? The film leaves too much unanswered. While I get the irony of both the protagonist and the perpetrator ending up in the same position, the viewer is not given enough to go on to surmise a conclusion. Character development and acting are top notch, as is the set design. The subject though tough to watch, is developed to be believable with some missing pieces, though, such as why when working the final crime scene don't they find all of Anna's Dad's belongings in Alex's mother's kitchen? Some threads are left undeveloped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and atmospheric thriller, can't sustain the power of the first half</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners is a careful step forward for Denis Villeneuve, a Quebec director staking his way into American territory this last year with two well received films - his first, the haunting 'Prisoners' is a solid US debut, a film so steeped in atmosphere that it spills out into the theatre. Prisoners is not a tremendous departure for Villeneuve, who has until now built a career upon these kinds of brainy, Fincher-like thrillers, but it works, mostly because the director was able to coax two very coiled and believable performances from his two leading men (Gyllenhaal delivers one of the best and strangest performances of his career). The film however is marred in the third act by overcomplicated plot devices and exposition, a shame because its ambiguity until that point was one of its greatest strengths. Otherwise a very watchable and visually haunting film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great acting but a clumsy and silly script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a bit of suspense and thrill like anyone else on the planet and Prisoners starts wonderfully. we see 2 families going through everyones worst nightmare when their kids go missing. the natural reactions of any parent rise to the surface and we see Hugh Jackman take the matter into his own hands to find what has happened to his daughter. Up to the first half of this movie, we see a believable portrayal of what any father would do in his position, to find his daughter at any cost blaming the obvious target of the local kid who has a few issues in the mental department. Again, all believable.It is in the second half of the film, it starts to breakdown a little, Gyllenhaall, the detective that has "never failed a case" decides to tail Jackman due to the local kid going missing and he being the obvious target due to various altercations with the police and the kid believing he knows where his daughter is kept.There are a few silly mistakes, if Mr Gyllenhaal is such a great detective, how come he gets given away by a truck wanting to get passed him when he tailing Jackman?We also see one of the children escape or be released tbh, I have still no idea, there is a note left saying if you can solve the maze you go home? what the hell happened? i still don't know. The maze was supposed to be unsolvable....Finally, Jackman gets thrown down a hole and at no times mentions the fact to the 70 year old that just managed to get the better of him that he has her son locked away and she won't see him again either????? why?????Finally, there doesn't seem to be any motive for the kidnapping, I remembered to the start of the movie that jackman says they have no money, was this a bizarre insurance scam? no it was some 70 year old nutter.... please ! my five year old could come up with a more feasible plot.As normal, acting is good, but the plot is just plain silly. it ruined a potentially good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animal cruelty prevented this from being an 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very suspenseful film that ironically pivots on the notion that cruelty to animals in one form is a sign of mental illness while in another form is masculine and aligned with God and Country.As you probably know, the film opens with a father saying a prayer just as he and his son kill a deer. From that point forward, the hunter and god-loving father is pitted against another character who, among other things, tortures a dog. We are provided with a number of scenes where animals, patriotism, faith are emphasized. One scene is when the hunter brings venison to his family's friends' dinner party and the veterinarian mother remarks that she can't cut the "meat" since she is a veterinarian. The veterinarian's daughters asks the hunter's son, "don't you feel bad" about killing an animal, to which the son replies, "my dad would say 'do you feel bad eating a McDonald's hamburger'?" I said all of this symbolism relating to animal cruelty is ironic because an actual deer was killed in the first scene. It wasn't a pretend killing, but a real one. At the end of the film, the Humane Association disclaimer states that it "monitored SOME of the animal action and no animals were harmed in THOSE scenes." Clearly, the AHA monitored the scene where the anti-hero chokes a dog, NOT the scene where the deer was killed.Of course, the producers "pragmatically" thought that it is okay to kill a deer since hunters routinely do that and the main character is a hunter. Not in my book. Killing is wrong. It is especially wrong when it is for nothing more than a scene in a movie. Movies are fake. They are fakes of reality. So, real killing does not belong in fake realities.Animal cruelty and associated allegories and symbols figure prominently throughout the film. I am discounting the layers of meaning and symbolism in the film, but only the actual death of an animal.</fullReview>

Very much in the vein of "Silence of the Lambs."Full of red herrings and plot elements that are easy to miss or don't quite add up. For just one example, the viewer is expected to very quickly spot and understand a "maze pendant" that reappears in different scenes and plays a major role in the story. I'm an average viewer and missed this both times until reading about in an online plot summary.Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to think of this movie before we watched it. I'm a big fan of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal and I was excited that they made a movie together. However, this movie is just downright confusing. First, it's a two and half hour movie that can easily be put into an hour and half movie if they took out the stuff that doesn't matter. The story line goes like this two girls get abducted, the police end up with two suspects, the parents go insane, and then the person you never thought did it was actually the one who did it. Meanwhile, the dad tortures this poor innocent man that is completely difficult to watch. The gore was too much for me to handle. I understand how the second suspect fits into the picture but I'm not sure his role in the abduction. They never really say; he just there on the side lines doing is own creepy, stalkerish stuff. Also, as a spoiler alert: I don't see the point of the father being abducted in the end either. The movie could easily have removed this part as it has nothing to do with the plot. The ending was terrible. It just ended with really nothing being revealed as if they reached two and half hours and said good enough. On a different note, Jake Gyllenhaal is a really good actor and in this movie he gives it his all to his character. I really enjoyed watching him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having your child kidnapped is probably one of the worst fears a parents could ever imagine. That's what prisoners is all about. Prisoners is one of the best suspenseful movies I have watched, it was interesting and kept me on my toes the whole time. Although it was drowned out a little bit and the ending was annoying, that's why I only rated it 8 out of 10 stars. There were parts that I didn't like especially how long it took them to find the kidnapper, although I love how the kidnapper was someone you wouldn't expect. I did love how ever the father of one of the daughters did absolutely everything he could to try to find his daughter, I thought that was sweet even if it meant breaking the laws. I would watch this movie a thousand more times if i could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid and Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I rented this movie, I looked at the reviews and got my first clue...older women didn't rate it as highly as young males. That's weird for a movie about the kidnapping of two little girls. But now I get it.This movie is long, boring, dark, and violent. Some of it is just plain old torture porn, trying to masquerade as something more meaningful. The plot, which isn't really about the kidnapping of two little girls, borders on the ridiculous, as do most of the characters. I fast-forwarded through a good bit of it without missing any of the story, and still it was too long.As to why some people thought this was a 7- or 8-star movie...I don't even want to know. Really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Thriller Since Inception</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know a film is fantastically amazing when u sit there, in your seat, pondering about the events that just happened while the credits are still rolling. This is how 2 and half hours should be spent. You are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat throughout the film hoping that either the detective or the father gets a lead into the disappearance of the two girls. So much is needed to be said so this is sectioned. 1. Plot- The story is so simplistic yet unravels into a something dark, smart and so mind blowing that you need cant be distracted for even one second. 2. Acting- This is the single greatest piece of acting since heath ledgers performance as the joker. Each character has been carefully thought out and they have been acted by some of the most talented actors. Even the children are great and you really sympathise for every character. 3. Soundtrack- The soundtrack fits the story perfectly and in the right moments. It is dark, depressing and eerie. This movie has some really disturbing moments but they don't overpower the carefully thought out plot and characters. Great Film !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prisoners is nothing short of a scary movie; for a parent the horror will likely be tenfold. It is an engrossing&amp; harrowing story of a father &amp; detective taking different roads to find two abducted children. A seemingly generic plot on the surface is infused with such bone-chilling tension, dread, and artistic strokes that it eventually becomes a different beast altogether.The father is Hugh Jackman, who delivers a scorcher of a performance! Take away Wolverine's claws &amp; replace it with raw emotional weight and you have Jackman's character Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal is also incredibly impressive playing a character struggling between his procedural job &amp; natural instincts. Terrance Howard, Viola Davis, &amp; Paul Dano also put in excellent performances in their respective supporting roles.The movie, a long procedural hearkens back to Fincher's murder mysteries. In fact, given the pace, narrative quality, &amp; sharp editing one could be excused for mistaking it as such. That is a well-earned compliment for the director Denis Villeneuve. Although in a different context when compared to Seven, the film possesses a layer of religious insinuation that adds interest to the story-structure.The film proudly shows off Roger Deakins cinematography in what may be his best work considering that this is not a spectacle movie or one shot in some iconic location. His skills elevate the production with gorgeous lighting &amp; camera-angles. It is a technical aspect many will overlook in the dreary setting of the story, but is major strength of the film. Nowhere is it punctuated better than in a brief night-time driving sequence towards the end of the film.Overall, Prisoners is a dramatic &amp; nerve-grinding thriller of the highest order. It is a slow-burn drama that is a fitting companion-piece to films like Seven &amp; Zodiac.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, but many flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prisoners was a gritty and engaging, child kidnap film that got our attention early and kept it until the end. However, it had many needless quirks and meaningless distractions and misdirections that it was difficult at times to follow what was necessary to the story and what was not. The highlight of the film was Hugh Jackman's character Keller, the stressed-out and angry father of one of two kidnapped little girls in Conyers, Georgia. This father's anger over losing his little girl drove the story and gave it its powerful energy that had all eyeballs glued to the screen throughout, which is the true +mark of a successful suspense story.Bad weather prevailed in this gloomy story that was so full of uncaring, devious and sick human behavior that it almost made you ashamed to be one of the same species. The entire cast did a very effective job, Maria Bello as Keller's depressive wife, Paul Dano as the uber-creepy suspect nearly tortured to death, Melissa Leo as his psychopathic aunt/mother(?), Terrence Howard as a soft and sensitive black man and neighbor whose child was also taken, and Viola Davis as his so sad, grieving wife. Jake Gyllenhaal was Loki, the also sad but serious and dedicated case detective whose outward bland calm was belied by an eye-blinking facial tick that well showed the giant stress he was constantly under to solve the case for his incompetent and pushy, but very antagonistic and unhelpful, captain.As the story has been detailed by others, my concern was for the details in the telling of the story. The first half of the film was terrific and built the story effectively and emotionally, but the second half had so many unnecessary twists and incomplete explanations of what really happened that it left me with a feeling of "that could have been done much better".I had the case figured out much faster than Loki did, as he missed the main clue from an earlier murder that would have solved the case if he were a better and "more observant" detective(isn't that their job?). That he missed it was the main flaw in the story to me, but I was also irked at the case conclusion that was merely flashed too-briefly in newspaper headlines. That part left me with....."That's it?" IMO, it was a too-quick and unsatisfying resolution to the long and harrowing, two and a half hour film story. However, the cut-off ending of the film that others have complained about was very impactful even if what led to it was tipped off earlier, thus very predictable.All in all, great acting in a flawed but very interesting and foreboding film story made my rating of it a strong 7. Warning... bloody human torture scenes and violent psychopathic behavior.</fullReview>

Paul Dano did a great job as well playing the mentally handicapped adult. I have never seen him in anything before but his part was definitely played well. I am not sure what some of the bad reviews are about that I read. The movie was definitely not too long-in fact I was sad when the movie ended, as I wanted to see more!

		<fullReview>Oh my God! Just came out of the movies and already making a review. For almost two years now I've been waiting for a movie like this one. It completely blew me away. It's such a realistic story, and people can relate to it. It actually makes us more aware of what happens around us, and it makes us think about these kind of themes really thoroughly. Iwas astonished by the acting in the movie, and how they brought it closer to us. Such serious performances, and it's not the ordinary plot where we end up celebrating the hero. It shows the mentality of different kinds of persons, and how they cope. Amazing! Loved it so much, and everyone should watch it, it's so rare they make movies this great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong Hokey Climax Spoils Well Acted Thriller Somewhat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As usual, as I scan the reviews here, they tend to be either highly laudatory, or scathingly awful. I really wanted to like this film, as I love thrillers, but this one failed to satisfy me ultimately. The set up of the two girls disappearing and the realization they have been taken was excellent, and the lead performances were all believable and very intense. However, without divulging the specific revelations in the final hour, for me they seemed very far fetched, and the action scenes, especially the car-chase scene, so far over the top and excessive that they bordered on hokey. Still, the film overall is not bad, but at over two and a half hours, it left me feeling disappointed, and could have been about 30 minutes shorter. I had some questions about certain parts, but it is one of those films I wouldn't want to see again, as there are almost no moments to actually enjoy. I loved "The Butler", and "Instructions Not Included", but can only marginally recommend "Prisoners" due to its unrelenting grimness and length.</fullReview>

After seeing the movie, i am not quiet sure whether I have seen the same movies as people how have rated it high? Anyway its was a good start and good ending, but could have for sure cut one hour away without harming the movie, only making it better. To sum it up, too long and way to high rating at IMDb.

		<fullReview>This movie started out well, but after a reasonable first 20 minutes, it descended into an hour and a half of tedium. We fast forwarded through many long, slow, plodding scenes the really did not add to the plot at all, nor the character development. Or character deconstruction, perhaps. The last 45 minutes picked up a bit, and there was some tension at that point, but not enough payoff at the end to justify sitting through it. Too long, too plodding. Poorly directed, poorly edited. Some excellent actors wasted their time on this. Not a single character to like or identify with after the first 20 minutes.

		<shortDescription>Talk about INTENSE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Thanksgiving dinner, two girls from two different families decide to go outside and play. Moments later, they go missing. This causes panic between the families including Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), whose daughter is one of the girls who are missing. With Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) on the case, Dover tries everything he could to find out what is going on.With 2013 starting its fall movie season with some intense thrillers, Prisoners is one of those that I had very high hopes for. Although the trailers gave away a little too much, I thought it looked really intense. Even with an ensemble cast, this movie looked like it would get some Oscar buzz for its actors (for everything else). Prisoners didn't disappoint. Right from the very first scene, I was hooked.Hugh Jackman delivers an award-worthy performance as Dover, the father who tries to find what he is looking for. Jake Gyllenhaal might get a Best Actor nomination for his terrific work as Loki, the police detective who is on the investigation of these two girls. The supporting cast (Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Paul Dano, Melissa Leo) also does a great job.When I say Prisoners is intense, I mean it's really intense; almost to the point where it becomes eerie and unsettling. The eerie thing about this movie is that it looks real. The characters and their religious beliefs are real; the situation is real; everything in this movie is real.This movie plays out like a puzzle. You have to pay attention right from the start to figure out what is going on. It's like we (the audience) are following the characters' footsteps as they are trying to solve this case.Prisoners is an intense and thought-provoking experience that has to be seen to be believed. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are going to talk about it for days to come.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Prisoners", directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski, was an incredible story of one man who will do anything to find his daughter. Although the plot appears slow moving at first, your emotions are quickly taken for a wild ride as the plot constantly turns from one dilemma to the next, and just as soon as you think you've solved the case, a new twist sends you spiraling into a whole new line of reasoning forcing you to continuously ask "who is really guilty?"Furthermore, the cast chosen for this spectacle did a stunning job. Not only was the crises believable, but the characters were portrayed so well, that you yourself will ask "where is his daughter?!" This was by far one of Hugh Jackman's greatest performances where you truly saw a father who knew the questionable measures he'd have to take if he wanted to find his daughter. As time passes on, Keller Dover, (Hugh Jackman), displays overwhelming levels of desperation and the methods he uses, though could be considered cruel, forces the audience to question their sense of objective morality. Additionally, I tip my hat off to Jake Gyllenhaal, who also did an equally spellbinding performance as Detective Loki. From what was just another case, became the focal mission of his career as he anxiously desires to find both missing daughters alive. Finally, you will not be disappointed with the conclusion, as you see that every ounce of what appeared to be trivial information is actually fundamentally one great big basket weave of a greater evil truth. This movie will constantly leave you on the edge of your seat, and I assure you, that this movie will be something you'll want to watch again and again.Amazing!!! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly gritty, yet astonishing thriller, with the best of Jake Gyllenhall and Hugh Jackman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally I was going to see Riddick this night, but we missed the time and saw that Prisoners had just premiered. I really did not know too much about the film, other then it was a thriller/mystery with Hugh Jackman, that's it. I had no idea what kind of an edge of my seat/nearly out of breath movie this was going to be after I sat down in the theater.Every performance is incredibly well done and acted, especially Jackman and Gyllenhaal, the two main characters we follow through most of the story. It was tempting to make a statement out loud regarding Marvel references, considering Jake's characters name is Loki (of Asgard!), and Hugh Jackman. (well, you know, schnick!) That aside, both Jake and Hugh are excellent in this film. You may think that Keller (H.J.) is just out for blood to find his daughters, but he had legitimate reasons for doing what he does to find that answers and save his and his friend Franklin's (Terrence Howard) daughters. Loki is a no nonsense cop who "has solved all of his cases", and is extremely determined to find out who is behind the kidnappings and why.While this movie is 2.5 hours long, it really pulls you into the suspense, feeling for each characters emotions and "praying for the best, and preparing for the worst" throughout the whole film. Not in a long time have I been legitimately worried about the safety and lives of fictional characters in a movie. This movie is extremely gruesome at times, but just the right amount of grittiness that makes it all the better.Excellent film: brilliant cinematography, acting, suspense, and story, bringing to the big screen one of the best movies of 2013, and may very well hold that honor come the end of the year.Prisoners: 10/10</fullReview>

The first hour of the movie was both dramatic and in some ways horrifying.However, after that there were several scenes that should have been edited out due to nonchalant chatter and seemingly useless dialogue. In fact, many other theater goers were going to the rest room during the slow scenes.This movie would have been much better by making it 1.5 hours that would have added more suspense and drama.In addition, there are several fade to black that were not effective that some dramatic scenes could have been added.Wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise behind he movie is that an evil family is murdering children to "fight a war against heaven."The film tips it's hand early on who the real villain is in one of the first five scenes.There is an old saying in creative writing, impossible yes, improbable, never.This film violated this old saw throughout.Hugh Jackman's character assaults one suspect in front of police. He kidnaps the man, and the police never think that Jackman's character is behind it. (The could have searched the property records and found his lair in five minutes.)The police realized that the primary suspect could not have driven the vehicle in question, but never bother to get the prints off the vehicle that would have led to the real culprit.The police recover a corpse, but are unable to figure out who it is even with the DNA assets available today. You can get heritage, likely relatives, etc. just do a Google search on it.Then there are just offensive bits ...Look at my name, I'm not a born again type, but depicting Hugh Jackman's character as over-the-top, because he owns firearms and prays is ludicrous and demeaning to a substantial portion of the US.Also, the depiction that folks would violate the law, ethics, and common sense, because their child is involved does not automatically follow in the same way that being a police does not make you a sadist.Finally seeing someone drug kids and an adult with brain damaging drinks and injections was just gross.This film is offensive and is difficult to suspend disbelief for.It should be rated NR-17.If you hate Christians and Republicans and feel that all folks are basically evil and need to be held in check by laws then this film might be for you.I cannot recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this film, you will imagine the parents who desperately struggle to protect their children from the evil of the outside. And you will see how the children vanished right before their eyes. The worst fears are let out and the families are facing cruel reality: someone took their babies and hided them. None knows "why": why children, why they're not telling where, why to kidnap anybody at all? Maybe it's because of their sickness, maybe because of money, or there is no particular reason, who can tell? Aren't they're prisoners of their own sick mind, desperately wanting to catch an innocence, a freedom, a symbol of it? And the parents are in pain, in enormous fear, like in a black hole, doing everything: possible and impossible, imaginable and unseen and unheard, only to find them. This film is rising up some questions, maybe they're old ones, but in a whole new perspective, and you only have to take the look... You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was This Film a Thriller? Action Film? or Horror Story? Or All of the Above?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "Prisoners" has won acclaim for its style, the film's content is both unpleasant and stretches credibility beyond the pale.Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover and Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki are both excellent in the leading roles, and director Denis Villeneuve evokes plenty of suspense in his lighting, camera angles, and pacing. But as the film unfolds, the story of the abduction of two children becomes more and more depressing.One of the problems with the film was the extremely unappealing characters. Jackman's role goes well beyond that of the concerned parent, as he breaks the law by kidnapping and torturing the young man whom he believes is the perpetrator. Gyllenhaal's detective is also concerned; but he is also inept and becomes so out of control emotionally that he attacks another suspect while in police custody, turning the prime suspect into another victim when he commits suicide.The convoluted kidnapping plot is never completely unraveled in the film. SPOILER ALERT FOLLOWS: As the film moves towards its climax, one of the little girls who has escaped her captors, implicates Jackman's character as one of the kidnappers who had placed tape over the mouths of the victims. The family of Keller Dover owned the residence where an earlier kidnapping the murder had occurred. It is that residence where Keller Dover takes Alex Jones (Paul Dano) to be tortured. So, the clear implication is that the devoted father was somehow involved in the original kidnapping plot.While worthy of discussion and admirable for the good performances, "Prisoners" seems incomplete as a film, the final cut no more than a work in progress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just register to IMDb to rate this movie. It was really annoying. Starts looking good, some suspense, but that's it, then pure crap, pure garbage. Horrible script, bad, unrealistic, in one word, stupid. I know the main actors from other movies, I liked their acting in other movies, but in this one it was awful. May be not the actors itself, the problem is the movie, the plot, the script, the director. I like easy movies, I also like complex movies, when you need to think to know what is going on. But this one is none of that, it's just plain stupid, nothing makes sense, from beginning to end. Horrible ending. And I'm not talking about happy or unhappy ending, I'm talking about a just plain and stupid ending. I don't know with what I'm more angry, with the few stupid people that make this movie or with the thousands that rated them in IMDb to reach an 8.1. All this without entering into what is left by this movie. It shouts all over the movie, torture is fine if you think you're right, is more than fine, is THE way to proceed if you really care. Plus, there are bad movies of 1 hour, 1.5, but this is 2.5 hours of crap! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, IT'S JUST CRAP, BORING AND NONSENSE CRAP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What I Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Prisoners' tells the tough story of two young girls who are kidnapped on Thanksgiving. Both sets of parents struggle to cope as they are left helpless and have to rely on Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) to work on finding their missing daughters.The story starts off a little too rosy and 'happy families.' This is soon over and the atmosphere and tension build up as the families realise their children are missing, presumed kidnapped. The film has a very bleak tone and is initially quite gritty. However, the story soon turns into a Hollywood tale rather than a heart breaking story.'Prisoners' is really a film of two parts; the first is following rule-breaking Detective Loki as he tries to find the girls. His side is quite interesting and doesn't really have any negative aspects to it - it simply is what it is, an investigation. Hugh Jackman plays the father of one of the missing girls; he is understandably frustrated after the suspected kidnapper is let go due to a lack of evidence. He takes the drastic step of kidnapping the suspect and chaining him to a sink in an abandoned house to torture him. This is obviously to make the audience ask themselves the question 'what would I do in that situation?' As the film progresses, things get more and more extreme. It gets to the point where you realise no one in real life would ever do something like this and that is when 'Prisoners' looses its audience. Things just get too silly and unrealistic.Hugh Jackman gives a really good performance but his character's actions become too bizarre. Terrence Howard is really bad which is surprising. He plays the other father and has to cry and be upset in numerous points of the film. He just does not look like he cares at all though - his crying scenes look incredibly forced and unnatural. The two mothers are shown to be useless which is a little disappointing and slightly offensive; Viola Davis could have gave a fantastic and powerful performance here but all her character does is stare into space. Maria Bello lies in bed the whole time because her character becomes depressed but doesn't really revive from it - it would have been good to see her beat the illness. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an admirable performance - although it is quite similar to that in the brilliant 'Zodiac,' he plays an investigator who has never failed to solve a case with his brash approach and his 'f**k-it' attitude. He is the only character in the entire film who isn't one-dimensional. Paul Dano also gives a great performance; he somehow manages to be creepy and seem so innocent at the same time. The film could have focused more on the slow yet inevitable breakdown of the families rather than the endless - and ultimately pointless - scenes of torture. It was briefly mentioned in the beginning that Hugh Jackman's family are struggling financially - this is never mentioned again and it is fairly evidence that Terrence Howard's family are very wealthy. It seemed like such an obvious foreshadow that the two families would end up arguing at some point but they don't. A lot of reviews have questioned the ending, many have found it annoying or weird. It is a strange way to end the film but, in context it is the most positive ending possible.Overall, 'Prisoners' is quite disappointing; the story is unnecessarily complicated and becomes ridiculous. Most of the performances are good - particularly the leads. For a film like this you would expect there to be some really harrowing points - there were hardly any.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK,I went to see this movie with high expectation, because for one I love the Premise. The actors are solid. Hugh Jackman has an amazing presence, and so does Jake Gyllenhaal. I like the movie in the beginning, it just started to get so slow that I literally was desperate for the killer to come out LOL. I think its a good movie but with a very slow pace, if you like watching a movie that has a very slow pace then this is the one for you! lol. I really didn't enjoy it to be honest with you, once its' all figured out, it take away the beauty of the rescue. I couldn't really relate with Hugh Jackman's wife I thought literally she played nothing in the movie, I am sorry all she did was take medication pills and blame jackman for everything. If I was the mother I would do what Jackman did, again its part of the script so the actress has to play what's there. I also like Terrence, but in this movie they didn't give him very much to work with. The The two outstanding actors in here are Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, oh yeah the ending is a real disappointment., it leaves you feeling empty thats it.I am sorry I thought it wasn't that good I am a real girly girl and I don't mind a good thriller like the next girl but it was way toooo long, torturing of an innocent person granted did it for his daughter, but still it is hard to empathize with him, I am sorry. Paul Dano, great actor you literally feel sorry for him. Melissa Leo was Superb, literally I didn't';t see coming. I was expecting more of Terrence Howard again they didn't give him very much to work with. I guess That this Tall White Green eye Girl :) was expecting more than what she got on this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman, Maria Bello), and their two children Ralph and Anna go to spend Thanksgiving with their close family friends Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard, Viola Davis), as well as their own two children Eliza and Joy. When Anna and Joy decide to go back to the Dover house to retrieve a special whistle of Anna's, the two girls don't return. When they don't return, the two families immediately scope the neighborhood in hopes of finding them. When the two oldest children say that they saw the two girls playing around a suspicious camper earlier when they were walking together, a report is made. Enter Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). Upon hearing the news he comes across the camper driven by Alex Jones (Paul Dano). Upon investigation Loki states that Jones doesn't have the mental capability to perform such an abduction. Jones is then picked up by his aunt Holly (Melissa Leo). Keller refuses to believe that Jones didn't have anything to do with it and that he wasn't working alone. While Loki continues his search for the missing girls, Keller takes more drastic and horrific matter in order to find his daughter. Prisoners, directed by Denis Villeneuve, is an intense and heart-wrenching story about every parents worst nightmare, and the lengths people will go to for answers and justice. It is one thrill ride that hooks you never lets go. The film goes through many twists and turns and heart- pounding moments, particularly one involving Gyllenhaal's characters and a floor full of totes that reminds us of "the box" scene from Se7en. But what stands out the most about Prisoners are the performances and how character-driven it is. Hugh Jackman gives the performance of his career as a father who is driven to drastic measure to ensure that he finds his daughter. He shows his deranged side as well as his devastated and vulnerable side so flawlessly. Maria Bello brings the most heart-wrenching moments of the film as the grieving wife and mother. We watch as her character goes from hopeful, to denial, to depressed, and finally to becoming delusional. Terrence Howard is a man torn. He knows what Jackman's character is up to, and you can tell that he is torn between doing the right thing and letting his feelings aside, as well as wanting to be there for his family. Howard and Davis, while very under-used, as basically the conscience of the story. Gyllenhaal stars as the Detective who has never left a case unsolved, and through his journey to find the girls and the answers to their disappearance it slowly begins to take it's toll on him. You can see through Gyllenhaal's performance how drained but yet determined Loki is becoming. As the film goes on, we watch and see how the effect of the girls' disappearance begins effect the characters in many ways, and the cast delivers it flawlessly. As the viewer sees this, we feel ourselves beginning to grieve and hurt for these characters, and it does a solid job of keeping everything so unknown that we have no idea how things will end up as much as the characters do. However despite all of this, the film runs much longer than it really needed to. 2 hours and 30 minutes. Does this hurt the film massively? No. We are kept engaged the whole time with the mystery, but you feel yourself thinking, "okay, this has to be over soon". Prisoners is a powerhouse of a thriller filled with some of the best performances in one film, characters we really feel for and get in touch with them emotionally, and filled with many thrills and twists that leaves your heart pounding. Despite it's very long running time, I still highly recommend it. Though it may be hard movie to watch for parents. My rating 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glaring loop holes, still brilliant taut thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there are loop holes, enormous to swallow a whale, but look at this the other way, call it cinematic liberty and enjoy this brilliant movie. Some of the loop holes gets filled up when you retrospectively look at the film, yet... there are some glaring ones.... BUT... probably they were necessary to make this such a good film. Everyone cant be Alfred Hitchcock, but Denis Villeneuve is pretty darn good. You have seen the trailers, 2 kids get abducted and Hugh Jackman suspects a mentally challenged guy to be behind it. You just cannot avoid suspicion that every major character can be a suspect, the director instigates the viewer to think for every character that s/he may be the prime suspect, but you wont be able to guess and you play into the suspense. Even the small sub stories/ plots add to the final story. The story is not the main highlight, its the acting and the screenplay/ script Everyone plays their role to perfection. Hugh Jackman &amp; Jack Gyllenhal probably plays their best role till date. Its a 2 and half hour movie, you just wish it was a little more longer. A really nice taut thriller.</fullReview>

Stupidest movie element is whoever wrote and directed it, its LAUGHABLE,. Poor fellow that is a suspect pulls off his usual role in the character as a simpleton or a shyster. Jake Gyllenehaal's playing the detective excellent. Enjoyed Jake's acting in many roles. Always a believable character study playing his role to the hilt. Hugh is flat out obnoxious-n-lousy. I believe he is whizzed for accepting the role and lives it thru the moron he plays,,, regrettable flat as a pancake, not believable because the script sucks so bad. Script is a silly pot pourrie calabash of bi-poplar keystone cops. Parents character's of both girls are scripted so ridiculously its barely watchable. Whoever wrote this stuff had to gaff and haul in a real sucker to pony up the coin for this dribble. Based upon previous reviewer 9.5 buttressed by reality today equates 75% of todays entertainment is foot-bath shallow has encompassed the entire alimentary canal production in and audience out stink-bomb.

		<shortDescription>How Far Would You Go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never has a film of this caliber shaken me and begged me to ask the question, "if my child was taken, how far am I willing to go?" In Denis Villeneuve's gripping and powerful drama about the abduction of two little girls and the extreme measures one father takes to find his daughter, the film rings in emotions of panic, fear, sadness, horror and shock all wrapped into two and a half hours of tension. Twists and turns drive the action of the story to its dramatic and shocking conclusion.The casting of the film is beyond brilliant. Hugh Jackman delivers a shocking and powerful performance as Keller Dover, father to one of the missing girls, who is unwilling to sit idly by and wait for the police to find the children. He takes the law swiftly into his own hands by horrifically tortures the young man (Paul Dano) he believes has taken the children; the torture scenes led me to turn away at numerous points of the film. Watching Jackman's performance hits a chord deep inside himself as a parent in real life in addition to the fictional portrayal of the desperate father who will kill to have his daughter back. Even as a viewer, his talent in the role and the intensity it requires tugged at my heartstrings through the painful moments of the impact of the kidnapping to the horror of his actions against Alex Jones (Paul Dano), the tension the events cause in his marriage to his wife Grace (Maria Bello) and seeing him push away anyone who tries to help him (Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), Franklin and Nancy Birch, parents of the other kidnapped child (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis)). An Oscar-worthy performance here.Playing opposite Jackman in the desperate search is Detective Loki, superbly played by Jake Gyllenhaal, an officer who has never left a case unsolved. But when he delves into the abduction of these two children, Loki is more than prepared to do everything in his power as a law enforcement officer to bring them home. The conflict between Jackman and Gyllenhaal pulls the viewer back and forth as time grows shorter and the search more desperate, providing insight into the difference between the by-the-book Detective Loki and loose cannon Keller Dover. Only when the final hours are ticking away do we see Gyllenhaal finally crack and break his own rules in order to cement his reputation of efficiency. If you dare to answer the above question of "how far would I go to get my child back?" PRISONERS will still make you question your own motives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting but bad directing and weak story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the good points. There is a top notch Oscar nominated cast assembled here and the acting is good. Hugh and Jake are impassioned and calm respectively but equally effective. Hugh has always had intensity and this is no exception. Jake is sympathetically dedicated and carries his role off convincingly. Paul Dano is actually suited to the dim wit. He isn't suited to mainstream roles because of his looks but here he suits the role to a T. Not enough material given to Viola Davis and Terence Howard. Photography is good and they really capture the dreary weather of the area in winter.Now the weaknesses. The direction is lingering for unnecessary details and rushed for vital plot elements. Doesn't link up the clues and hints clearly enough. I concentrated but still was confused. The ending was badly done. Showing so much detail earlier and then short changing at the end by not showing conclusively what happened and instead just hinting at it was a cheap let down.The story - the only thing I thought was good was the slightly feel good end. But the the weaknesses in the plot show clearly how it suffers in comparison to a true story. The fact that Paul Dano's character could hold out through all that isn't believable. It's an ugly story and gut wrenching in parts.Overall this movie has a good cast and is earnestly acted but it doesn't deserve unmitigated praise. You want to see what happens and that keeps you engrossed till the end but after watching it you will have the feeling that the story just isn't that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Prisoners" Is A Long Sentence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be perfectly frank, almost all of the films that came out this year have one of the two following characteristics. They have either not been good or are just too dark and gloomy. Director Denis Villeneuve's crime drama "Prisoners", starring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, is yet another film that has both of these characteristics. The story behind "Prisoners" has been done to death by Hollywood many times before. A religious man (Jackman), his wife (Maria Bello), and their kids celebrate Thanksgiving at the house of their neighbors (Terrance Howard, Viola Davis). When two of the youngest kids are suddenly missing, a police detective (Gyllenhaal) is called in to help search for the kids. When he encounters a possible suspect (Paul Dano), based on the clues that the two families offered, the detective tries to get closer to finding them. But due to various plot developments, the religious man decides to take matters in his own hands and his actions lead to various consequences. I'll give the film credit for the two major things that it does well at. One of them is Gyllenhaal's character. While Gyllenhaal plays his part well, his character is the only one in this story who I personally thought was worth caring for mainly because he kept the plot moving along when it needed to. Another aspect of this film that I liked was a major subplot that was put into this story. This subplot being that the religious man abducts the possible suspect and tortures him for further information about his child. The consequences that ensue for the religious man as a result of this action are more interesting than the rest of the film itself. The biggest issue that I have with "Prisoners" is with how little screen time the mother (Bello) is given. She is only on screen for fifteen minutes at most and what does she do when she's on screen? All she does is lie on the bed, cry over her daughter's disappearance and take her pills. To any females reading this, if your child was suddenly missing, would this be all you would do? I don't think so. The mother's lack of development is completely unacceptable and inexcusable in this day and age. For that matter, I wanted to know more about what their neighbors were doing to search for their children. It would have at least made up for the good number of scenes that went nowhere in this flick. It would have also helped me identify with these characters much more. It might even make up for some of the glaringly dumb decisions that are made by some of the characters, too. I'm not sure that my ideas for improving the film would help. The story was already stale to begin with, not to mention the film's running time of two and a half hours is utterly excessive. In any case, "Prisoners" feels identical to one dreary and lengthy prison sentence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Dark and Chilling Thriller That Is Well Worth It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went and saw this new thriller from director Denis Villenueve. A lot of different things about it made me interested despite the fact that I haven't seen the director's other films on his resumé.Prisoners begins with Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello), who live in the small town in Pennsylvania. They are taking their son and daughter to visit the Birch family headed by Franklin and Nancy (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving. While there, the youngest daughters, Anna and Joy, go around the neighborhood and mess around on an RV, before their siblings make them stop. Later, Anna and Joy go outside again and don't return, which causes immediate panic for the Dovers and Birches. At the same time, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is eating alone at a Chinese restaurant when he gets a call about a suspicious RV at a nearby rest stop. Loki takes the call and other cops show up. The driver of the RV is Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and he is immediately a suspect in kidnapping Anna and Joy. Loki does not play around when interrogating Alex as he thinks Alex is guilty. However, the RV is clean in the sense that there is no evidence to arrest Alex. Alex is let go, and Keller is not happy about this as he also strongly believes Alex to be guilty. Keller does everything he can to track down the girls. Grace is worried sick for her girl, literally. The Birches are also very worried. Loki must do everything in his power to track the girls' kidnapper and safely have them returned home before its too late.Denis Villenueve does an excellent job with handling this dramatic and chilling material. He created some powerful and emotional scenes with the shot lists he has put together. Villenueve has does a nice job at keeping the story moving forward while making this very emotional for the audience. Aaron Guzikowski wrote the screenplay here, and does a nice job of writing a dark, gritty, chilling script. Guzikowski does a nice job at making some plot twists I was not expecting. The only fault I point out on Denis Villenueve and Aaron Guzikowski is the ending is iffy, but the film overall is very well done thanks to the director and writer.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a very powerful performance as Detective Loki. He does a great job at showing a man who cares about the job at hand and will do anything to solve this case and have the girls safely returned home. Loki is a hard worker and Gyllenhall gives the best performance of his career. Hugh Jackman also does great work as Keller Dover. With this role, Jackman is very raw and emotional as a religious man and loving father who will also stop at nothing until his daughter is home safe and sound. Jackman gives one of the best performances in his career in this film.Of the supporting cast, Maria Bello is the standout as the worried, sick mother literally. Despite having limited screen time, Bello makes the most of her role as she is told by her husband to stay home and get better. She is even suspicious when some unusual activity happens in her house that makes her wonder if it's Anna. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis do some nice and emotional work here as the Birches. Howard has a bit more to do than Davis, but does great job at acting with his facial expressions. A surprising performance to me was Melissa Leo as Alex Jones's aunt. She is great at playing like nothing's wrong, despite her nephew being highly accused of being a kidnapper. Paul Dano even does a surprising job as the guy suspected of kidnapping and is good at playing the dumb guy who doesn't know what anyone is talking about.From a technical aspect, the best is the camera work by DP Roger Deakins. Deakins really is the best DP out there and knows very well how to get the shots his directors want and his brilliant use of lighting. I also quite enjoyed the editing by longtime Clint Eastwood collaborators Joel Cox and Gary Roach. I even thought the production design by Patrice Vermette.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer was amazing but it turns out that those parts were the only interesting parts in the movie. The violence was appalling and there was nothing in the script to justify it. It was way too long and by the end of it I didn't really care and just wanted it to end. I also don't understand if we were supposed to identify with Dover's character. He was sadistic and I don't understand how any movie could allow itself to portray such acts of torture. It was really disturbing to watch.It could have been more tolerable had it been shorter. But the length of it, coupled with the graphic images of torture of a helpless person were just to much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this film attempts to do what other films like The Deep End of the Ocean or Ransom or even the latest one Hallie Berry's The Call did. It even has a Mystic River vibe to it for sure however all those films were better. For starters the good; great cast no doubt about that and thank god finally Hugh Jackman IS NOT WOLVERINE! When you see an actor play the same character so much they might as well be on a TV series so it was nice to see him do something else.You got Terrence Howard, Viola Davis, Maria Bello and Paul Dano who's come so far since the silent older bro. in Little Miss Sunshine. I will add though that Hugh's performance didn't come close to Sean Penn in Mystic River. However the only one i had a problem with was Jake Gyllenhal. This was not one of his better performances and i didn't too much like his character.He reminded me of Brad Pitt in Seven; too headstrong, impatient and not that great a detective. Definitely could've had more of a detective Stabler (L&amp;O SVU) type character (someone with kids). As far as the story goes it was a hot mess. I mean half the time we're following the detective around-not nearly enough parents POV to get the right emotion and then half the crap didn't make any sense with that creepy dude who offed himself.I really didn't think those scenes were that relevant and then the motives of the actual abductor didn't make sense but that doesn't matter cause half the crazy crap people do in real life doesn't make sense. I just felt this movie was built up too much when there's plenty of movies like it that were done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Performance on top of masterful film making, the best film of 2013 thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first glance, this film will strike many people as a typical Hollywood revenge film resembling the likes of Death Wish and Payback. However, that is furthest from the truth. Prisoners packs one hell of a punch, giving the audience not only something very entertaining, but also something very human in the process. The film plays out more like Seven, Zodiac and Mystic River, allowing the audience inside the mind of Keller Dover, a man searching for his daughter while teetering on the brink of insanity. The story kicks off when the Dover and Birch families are celebrating Thanksgiving. What seems like a normative celebration quickly descends into a frantic search for two young girls. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal)arrives at the Dover house after the abduction and soon finds a suspect in Paul Dano's character. But as time passes without finding the girls, Dano is finally let go. Much to his dismay, Keller Dover takes matters into his own hands and kidnaps the suspect, subjecting him to brutal torturous methods as he searches for the truth in finding his daughter. What makes Prisoners so well crafted is the performances from Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal, both of whom are at the top of their game in this film. The chemistry between these two actors is impeccable, bringing a natural presence to the screen. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Melissa Leo, is superb. Viola David, Maria Bello and Paul Dano also give caliber performances, and keep the film entertaining just on their performances alone.The story keeps moving and moving and never slows up despite a two and a half hour running time. While that seems like a deterrent nowadays for most audiences, this film is good enough for anyone to sit through happily and be able to walk out of the theater satisfied with the final product. This is a heavy hitting movie that Hollywood very seldom makes. It is rooted in classic revenge films from the golden age of Hollywood while introducing new style and substance, making for a truly intriguing watch.If there's any film that you should see right now, trust me, it is most definitely Prisoners.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from sitting through 2 hours and forty five minutes of this movie. Okay, this movie starts out good enough, good actors etc. but it spends a lot of time going to a whole lot of nowhere! Some of my complaints, the cop broke as many laws and committed more civil rights violations than anyone in the movie. Also, the cop's part has been seen in a million other movies. The only difference is in my opinion this cop is an idiot! Now the dad, Hugh Jackman, of course he's a great actor and does not disappoint in this movie, but his part was way over the top and he was Einstein compared to the cop, Jake Gyllenhaal. The entire movies was actually about these two and everybody else were just there! My wife's complaint, was mainly everyone spoke to quietly, so it was hard to hear and easy to miss things. Then to cap it all off... there is no real ending, it's just over, period. That's it, just over!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to this movie, I was not sure what to expect. There are a lot of twists and turns. But the highlight of the movie is how angry Hugh Jackman became when his daughter went missing. Hugh Jackman decided to do what he felt was right and abduct the weirdo he thought was responsible. Let's just say I would not want to be on the receiving end of Hugh Jackman's fist. Hugh Jackman was torturing this guy (the weirdo from There will be Blood) for the entire movie. Jake G was good as the cop and where ever this was filmed had a really gritty feel about it. It rained all the time. What bothered me was how Terrence Howard cried or was watery eyed during the entire movie. Hugh Jackman had to convince him to not be a cry baby on more than one occasion. The lady, Ms. Jones, was played by a young actress which was really good to. Hugh Jackman and she get into it on more than one occasion. Was this movie long? yes. Was it good? Yes. Will Hugh Jackman get an Oscar nod? I sure hope so. This movie had a great plot and a protagonist and antagonist. Hugh Jackman started off the movie as a nice person but transitioned into a mad man. Good going Hugh Jackman. I look forward to more of these kinds of roles. Your Wolverine character is played out. Oh, and the ending? Well let's just say that the ENTIRE movie theater moaned. It was the most different ending ever. Very similar to how the Sopranos series ended. Jake Bass would like this movie. Hugh Jackman is awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recommend Prisoner to my friends for the movie night based on the fact that its a Huge Jachman movie (as I am a Huge fan) and current rating of it on IMDb but regret it like hell since 20 minutes of the beginning.The movie is the same old kidnapping story with awful length and pathetically slow. The director tried to make the environment for suspense and thrill but failed to do so, except for the last 10 minutes, which I do not count with 2 and a half hour.The acting however is bit better, thanks to Huge Jackman and Terrence Howard. The movie has its ups and downs but as you slide down your seat, you have to wake up to catch up the sudden scene.So, my recommendation, if you want to waste some of your time or want to get frustrated, be my guest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An 8 point freaking 2 out of 10 rating for this lame movie? Really?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that is, in my humble opinion, toeing the line between So-so and bad? What happened to audiences today? Have you all lost your minds? Is the government already succeeding at dumbing-down the masses? OK, sure, the performances were solid. But what I saw in the end was great talent wasted on an insanely contrived film.We all know what the story is about and the premise is rather primal, I must admit, encouraging me to see the film. But it was poorly written. POORLY. It started with the characters then snowballed down the hill to a contrivance cesspool where it drowned.I didn't like any of the characters, except for Alex, played by Paul Dano. The second character I empathized with was Detective Loki (Gyllenhaal), who almost went on my list of "Idiots the world would be better off without," but he avoided it by really trying to find the girls and practically being tormented by Dover (Jackman), father of one of the girls abducted.Now Dover was one of the worst characters in the film, probably in movie history. He was written for us to connect to, whether we disagreed with his methods or not. But in the end, he was basically jeopardizing the investigation. His level of stupidity was dangerous, to himself and everyone around him. So, he may not be a thinking man. I could buy that. Then could he at least smarten up somewhere towards the end of the film? Where was his character arc, his moment of truth? Are we to assume he actually learned something as events unfolded? Never once did he admit his humility and humanity, and yield his control of events over to fate. It could've taken 5 seconds. But he didn't. I'm not going to give away too much, but he was angry and desperate until the end.Then you had Dover's band of douchebags, like the Birch's, who also lost their daughter and are seemingly close friends with the Dovers. They most likely shared stupid pills as well. There wasn't a single useful person in the film. Loki came close but he did things I couldn't imagine anyone with his expertise, who supposedly solved every crime or missing person case he ever worked (not clear as to the kind of detective he was), doing the things he did. Also, he rarely called for backup or assistance, and don't give me that malarkey about the town's underfunded police department. Did everyone have to be brain-dead and desperate like Dover? To answer the previous question, yes, they had to be this way otherwise things would have had to happen differently, and it could've ended badly like how things happen in real life sometimes. But, as a writer, when you intend on something happening one way to get the result you want, most likely a happy ending, then you have to have characters who can comply, even at their own detriment, and that's where contrivances find their home and breed.The film had way too many wasted moments. Most of it did nothing to move the story along. Some lines, like the "solved every case" line regarding Loki's illustrious career as a police officer, not only made me chuckle but they felt more like set pieces, like the blue lamp on Dover's end table. Other wasted elements in the film were like red herrings that only added the extra 30 minutes to the already long movie.Also, the antagonist's agenda was quite ridiculous, as most have been in recent Hollywood movies. They're now very roundabout and overly complicated, making them ridiculous, instead of more direct approaches. The bad guys are working way too hard to reach their ultimate goal. I thought the hard work was supposed to be reserved for the good guys. "Rage against God"? Really? That makes as much sense as going through the trouble to control the money and assets of all the local billionaires, taking power away from the wealthy and giving it to the the persecuted, all to create anarchy just before blowing up the city, and making the town's wounded hero watch it all from some prison pit in nowhere land. Oh wait...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expect this type of movie to be long and slow and drawn out for drama and effect and it was that, but the acting was superb. It was nice to see Jackman in a very different role for him knowing he can literally do anything well. Jake G... was also great as usual but the ending was one of those that makes you wish you hadn't wasted your time sitting thru the long slow movie. One star primarily because the ending ruined the whole thing for me! Without giving away an details, had I known it was this type of ending, I would never had bothered starting it.

		<shortDescription>Here's a spoiler to save you the trouble. It's RUBBISH.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two young girls are kidnapped. They are rescued at the end, but the blonde one loses the ability to act. They were kidnapped by the surviving widow of a couple who went round kidnapping kids in order to make people lose their faith in God, after their own son died of cancer. The nephew they adopted, who is unable to string a sentence together much, is suspected, abducted and tortured to death by Hugh Jackman, the blonde girl's father. At the end Hugh is drugged and bleeding in a deep hole, blowing a whistle which Jake G. may or may not hear.There. If I can save just one person from having to endure this pile of dung, then my life will have had meaning.You might think there would be fun to be had by pointing out complete nonsenses in the plot, characters and script of this film. There are so many, however, that it gets tedious. Just off the top of my head, then...1. It rains and snows, heavily, all the time. However, Hugh Jackman is dumped in a pothole which miraculously remains completely dry, despite being covered only by a bit of tin and an old car.2. In such abduction cases, the parents are usually initially considered prime suspects until eliminated. Despite the fact that Hugh Jackman is hysterical, violent, defensive and alcoholic, Jake Gylllenhall doesn't even have his house searched. The half-bag of lye he finds in his later casual inspection of the garage gets mentioned, then dropped.3. Jake Gyllenhall assaults a suspect in custody, with the result that the suspect manages to shoot himself (yes, the 'gun in mouth, blood on the wall' trope again). Such a cop would be IMMEDIATELY suspended. Not our Jake, however.4. Jake G arrests a priest who confesses to having imprisoned to death the husband of the evil couple in his cellar. Once that point is established, the priest and any reference to him completely disappears.5. Blonde girl's mother, after having suffered hell for a week or so, blithely tells other parent to wheel her just-rescued daughter out of the room for a little while while she talks to the cop.6. The maverick cop releases dozens of snakes into the community, without apparently bothering to determine whether they are venomous, valuable, or what; or bothering to retain them as evidence.Oh dear. There are many enormous red herrings and dead ends in the plot of Prisoners, but not with any logic behind them. A character or artifact is placed to suggest one plot turn, then dropped immediately when another comes up (eg the 'Maze' thing). This is the sort of plotting that children in junior school do. And much better, as a rule. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a TERRIBLE film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a nail biting thriller that at times, didn't win me over.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The direction and cinematography in 'prisoners' was nothing short of relative to the probable panic and eerie realism of child abduction.However, The film lacked for me in many places; plot was god awful, unrealistic in the senses of human behavior, and very.. very far fetched in the realm of noir.The first 40 minutes of the movie had me thinking that it could be on par with other similar greats like 'mystic river'. 'Prisoners' had me leaving the theater shaking my head and questionably contemplating with myself about how far a person would take matter into their own hands.A twisty thriller is one thing, but an unreal case of snakes, mazes, and a serial killing elderly couple who against all odds, were separated by yet again a sex offending pastuer? Oh brother.All in all the movie could have been summed up in the regular hour and thirty time frame. The run time had me looking at my watch every several minutes wondering when the mediocre story would end.worth watching? maybe. more than once? never.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to watch this movie today with my friend after noticing the high rating at IMDb... Started off well ....but the progression and pace were lacking. The cast was also not so convincing with Jake Gyllenhall in the lead role. The lazy face did not match up to the thrill. Forest Whitaker would have been better as the detective.(even with his sleepy looks). Though the storyline tries to maintain an element of surprise and tension for the greater part of the movie the enactment was too slow and did not have the gripping effect that good thriller movies provide. It is not the edge of the seat kind of movie ..rather a movie where u relax and stretch yourself several times waiting to get up from the seat.The story gets jumbled and the movie looses its grip in the second half. Does not deserve the high 8 rating.. definitely not!! Would like to avoid this kind of dull dragging movies.....Watch at home ....However i won't ask for my money back..they don't give anyway :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping kidnapping yarn; Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PRISONERS (2013) ***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, Paul Dano, Dylan Minnette, Zoe Borde, Erin Gerasimovich, Kyla Drew Simmons, Wayne Duvall, Len Cariou, David Dastmalchian. Gripping crime drama centered on a dual child abduction with both the law and family flummoxed to the point of extremes in finding the truth and justice (and the blind spots along the way) as the clock ticks to an inevitable climax of the point of no return. Excellent cast and a pinpricking screenplay by Aaron Guzikowski galvanized what could've been a run-of-the-mill vengeance melodrama thanks largely to shrewd and unnerving direction by Denis Villeneuve who generously takes his time in allowing enough rope for his audience to either hang onto (or hang themselves) from the utmost horror - the unknown. Jackman and Gyllenhaal give career performances as one of the aggrieved fathers and the insularly dogged police detective who share the common bond: the truth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well acted but mediocre script &amp; a major letdown. The commercials really had me sold. Normally I'm not fooled by commercials, I must admit, this time I was fooled. I won't give the ending away, let's just say you won't be happy &amp; this will be a one &amp; done movie. My advice is to skip it or wait for it on Netflix or Red Box. I knew less than half way through the movie what was coming &amp; whodunit. Unfortunately, this is a movie that Hollywood just couldn't keep their not so subtle liberal, leftist politics out of. This is set up in the very 1st scene where Hugh Jackman is out with his son shooting a poor Bambi like deer &amp; again later when you see all the "I'm ready for anything" supplies in Hugh's basement. Hugh's character ends up pulling a totally foolish act that no logical, "I'm ready for anything" right winger would ever do. I don't think any liberal capable of thought would have done what Hugh ends up doing either. No, I'm not talking about torturing the young man. The resolution to that even turns out liberal. Torture doesn't ------. You figure it out. Message of this flick is "sit on your hands &amp; be a helpless glob while the brilliant, benevolent government &amp; their employees will take care of it all for you". Puck!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film until the awful ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a good (if not too long) thriller that should have been so much better. I refer to the ending so if you don't want to know come off now.Hugh Jackman's character is seen as a tough guy who can certainly handle himself,that is until he comes up against a little old lady in her kitchen. He then acts totally out of character and does exactly what she asks even though it is obvious that she is not going to let him live, and he won't rescue his daughter. In the kitchen he could have easily over powered her, OK she had a gun but so did he in his bag. Or when she gave him the drink to weaken him, what does he do? He drinks it rather than through it in her face.Then the most stupid part. He gets into a car and reverses slowly as she asks him to, rather than reversing quickly to knock her over or oat least off her feet. And then he jumps down a hole so she can lock him in with the car over it.Sorry but none of this makes sense and it spoilt an otherwise good film.I also thought that Jake Gyllenhaal was a poor choice for his role as a cop, he was clearly unhinged and hindered the investigation, (then maybe cops are like that?). Terence Howard's character was the only one I believed out of all the parents and Paul Dano plays his part well as the mentally backward son of the nutty woman. I also thought that the film had too much unnecessary bad language, (Then I always find that people swear and curse more in movies than I ever find in real life(, But I put up with it as the story was gripping until the end.It is a real shame that this film ended the way it did. The silly ending with the whistle noise was so predictable as to almost turn this into a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies that I have seen this year, only second to Iron Man 3. The storyline was everywhere and didn't make much sense. Somehow the director expected the viewers to connect with this psycho dad who brutally beats up a retard that gives him no information about the case whatsoever. Considering I've met a few retards in my life, I could only imagine how one must feel about interacting with little kids after watching this movie. All games aside. This movie had potential based on the concept. It lacked in every category that you could think of in reviewing a movie. The lead detective has a big Mayan tattoo on his neck, the black family did little to nothing to contribute to finding their child, the mother of the white girl was sedated the entire movie, the white dad was enraged the entire movie and yielded little results after his actions, and the little black girl was obviously the smartest character in the movie. She was the only person that did something relevant enough to even talk about. Now I'm just rambling kind of how this movie rambled on for 2hrs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not that the scenes are pointless ? it's that there is easily enough content for more than one film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wealth of engrossing ideas populates "Prisoners" as it carefully unravels modicums of information to relate a macabre mystery. Tantalizingly, tidbits of notions and clues are doled out, almost teasingly, to string the audience along for a nail-biting ride. Unfortunately, despite a kidnapping premise that has the strength and suspense to pull viewers in, not unlike the cryptic mazes that one bizarre murder suspect scrawls undistractedly, the running time offers a drastic disservice.While the first half plunges straightaway into the action, the second part drags on for entirely too long. It's not that the scenes are pointless ? it's that there is easily enough content for more than one film. Rather than simply layering the mystery at the core, the story opts to branch off into multiple subplots that only lengthen the experience - not enhance it. The serpentine disappearance case proves intriguing enough; to add a grim test of faith and morality to the tale convolutes an already heavy narrative.What begins as a happy Thanksgiving meal together for the Dover and Birch families quickly escalates into a fevered nightmare when their youngest daughters Anna and Joy mysteriously vanish. Determined to locate the missing girls, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) tracks down shy, reclusive Alex Jones (Paul Dano) who may have been the last one to see the two children. But when Jones, with a defectively limited mind, refuses to talk and is released from police custody, Anna's father Keller (Hugh Jackman) takes it upon himself to continue where the law could not. Kidnapping Alex, Keller tortures the boy in the hopes of uncovering any clues to his daughter's whereabouts. But as time quickly runs out for all involved, Keller and Loki are drawn deeper into a labyrinthine mystery where everything is deviously connected.It begins with immediate ominousness, imparting a sense of disquiet against a backdrop of normalcy. Families unite for a celebratory dinner, play in the street, and reminisce with the help of alcoholic beverages. The swift disappearance of the little girls serves to remind of the realism of the fictional proposition. It could happen to anyone, especially the unsuspecting. The editing even makes a few splendidly unique decisions: the first involvement of the police and their questioning is skipped over entirely; the hysterical parents aren't shown until after the manhunt has begun; and introductions to characters and their missions are truncated when obvious. And this doesn't exactly change once the second story is integrated ? even the uncertain concluding moments strip expectations. The additional plot, however, only elongates the entire picture.Summoning the intensity of recent thrillers' story lines like "The Call," "Zodiac," or "Changling," this weighty film manages admirably with atmospheric cinematography, horrific grisliness, and tense discoveries. It seems as if, having selected the title "Prisoners," writer Aaron Guzikowski deemed it necessary to turn that designation into a triple entendre, with the morality of characters being tested, blame being assigned, actions designated as without choice, fate locked in, and physical imprisonment befalling the majority. The film isn't subtle in its questioning of viewers, continually asking for responses of approval, disappointment, disgust, or contempt; and finally, quite unintentionally, tried patience. It's not that a transition takes place to signify the slowing down of momentum, considering the dialogue and acting are regularly top-notch and the subplots individually riveting. It's simply that both a morality play and a crime drama don't fit together in this one film (perhaps a smarter editor could have made it work).- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

It isn't just about the plot (which was amazing), or the location (also perfect), but what blew my mind were the performances. I watched most of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal movies but this one will mark as their memorable work... You get to go deep into the life of the father whose daughter was just kidnapped, and who struggles against society, family and himself to find her. Jake also performs greatly as a tough policeman who doesn't trust anyone nor anything, yet he tries to find the girls regardless of the circumstances..

		<fullReview>So how did it happen? How can a movie with so many great actors, doing their best acting ever maybe be so bad? Well, I guess it starts with the script... The script for this movie is doing several things that I consider insulting for the viewers. First, it gives you all the information in advance on a silver platter, there are no real surprises in the movie (though you keep hoping there will be some), but the clues are so visible and obvious that anyone who ever had to solve a logical question, should be able to understand the plot pretty much from the beginning... It also tries to shock the viewer in order to convey the characters' dilemmas. It's an easy and cheap way of conveying a message. I find it more effective and lasting when the ideas are presented to me to digest than being thrown at my face, trying to force me consider issues that I don't even think are worth my consideration. The movie is full packed with gaping holes in the plot. Things that just don't make much sense in 2013, and Jake's character, as a detective, seems to simply be a very bad, incapable detective. Overall, it's disappointing to see so many good actors, and good acting, goes to waste on a badly written, badly thought of, screenplay.</fullReview>
