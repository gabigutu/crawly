		<shortDescription>Not Your Typical Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, dolls and poltergeists have been overdone in the past decades. It's always the same plot. However, it has NEVER been done like this. At first, it was a bit predictable. Nanny comes in, encounters creepy family, goes with the flow, experiences some disturbing shizz, still goes with the flow because continuity. There were some jumps that were nicely executed and it certainly kept the viewer interested. But movies like this usually head in one direction... This one, on the other hand, brought in something refreshing. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. There were very subtle hints, if any. Overall, it was above average yet unnerving. It wins a few points on creativity, so it's a 7.5. Rated it 9 to balance the score and encourage new opinions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd, suspenseful, creepy and a bit disturbing, but thoroughly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give it an 9 stars because the end kind of sets it up for a sequel, but hey, the rest of "The Boy" is beautifully stylized and paced similar to the spooky, suspenseful and disturbing '60's British made thrillers like Betty Davis' "The Nanny"and Debra Kerr's "The Innocents" only with an added surprise ending and faster pace.From the trailer this movie is not what you think it is and not one of your run of the mill "Child's Play" Chucky doll revenge type '80's flicks. I sort of knew this going in just from the fact smart actors such as Lauren Cohan rarely make bad decisions on movie choices such as this and by god she makes it all believable just as she does in "Walking Dead".This is a very maturely written, photographed and acted movie reminding me of a really good Twilight Zone episode that gradually unfolds revealing the layers of mystery in this case on the reasons for why an elderly couple would be caring for a life size boy doll which is disturbing on its own right from the get go.There'll be more questions than answers as the movie progresses where the end will allow the viewer to fill in the blanks with an implied causality from connecting the dots looking back which is the best way to write a movie and view it. Don't explain everything. The audience has a better imagination and intellect.This will probably be a classic as time goes on as I believe "The Orphan" both odd and unique thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Boy" is an original and entertaining horror thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you're crazy, do you know you're crazy? It's a question I've heard asked in movies and in real life, but it is quite the poser (at least for those of us who are not crazy? as far as we know). In other words, when you're doing things that other people would call "crazy", at what point do you move from "eccentric", or even "weird", to genuinely, certifiably? using the clinical term? "bat-sh** crazy"? These are some of the questions you'll be asking about more than one character in the horror thriller "The Boy" (PG-13, 1:37). But you'll soon find out that insanity is only one possible explanation for the unusual behavior of various characters and the many strange happenings throughout this very entertaining film.Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) is a young Montana woman (around 30) who is restarting her life. To escape an abusive relationship with her former boyfriend, Cole (Ben Robson), she doesn't just leave him ? she leaves the country. Greta gets hired as a nanny (a job she's never done before) by the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle), an eccentric older couple living in a big, isolated house in the English countryside. Unusual stuff, but things definitely move to weird-slash-creepy when Greta first sets eyes on her young charge. The "boy" that Greta is supposed to care for turns out to be a marionette-like porcelain doll. Greta thinks it's all a joke, but the Heelshires aren't laughing. They lost their son, Brahms (Jett Klyne), in a house fire on the boy's 8th birthday. They coped with their loss by starting to care for a doll which looks like their son and is about the size of an 8-year-old boy. They've been calling this doll "Brahms" and treating him like a real boy for about 20 years. Now, it's Greta's turn.After giving Greta detailed instructions regarding Brahms' care and leaving her with a clipboard containing a list of ten rules (and whispering a cryptic "I'm very sorry" as they head out the door), the Heelshires drive away for their first vacation in "a very long time." Greta is now alone with Brahms in that big wireless-less house. Her only contacts with the outside world are her friend, Sandy (Stephanie Lemelin), whom Greta calls regularly from an old rotary-dial phone, and Malcolm (Rupert Evans), the handsome young local man who delivers groceries and brings mail to the house about once a week.At first, Greta treats the doll as most of us would, tossing it aside and ignoring it. But the longer Greta ignores that list, the more strange things begin to happen in that house. Her clothes disappear. She gets locked in the attic. She finds a mess in Brahms' bedroom. She starts to hear noises and see shadows. Greta is creeped out and begins having scary nightmares about Brahms. Then, the doll starts showing up in places other than where Greta left him. When she calls Malcolm over to witness all this, and he sees that Greta is now treating the doll as if he's real, Malcolm starts to treat her as if she's? bat-sh** crazy."The Boy" is very well-directed and pretty original. William Brent Bell (who also helmed 2012's "The Devil Inside") masters the slow build, making us wonder throughout the film who's crazy and who's not, as he gives us a few good gotcha-type scares along the way. His cast is better than in many horror flicks and they keep us interested during the times that not much happens. Stacey Menear's script keeps us guessing and then brings everything together in a mind-blowing twist that few will see coming and which shocks, without resorting to cheap tricks. This film skillfully blends some elements of earlier horror movies like "The Shining" (1980), "Child's Play" (1988) and "The Others" (2001), but has a fresh and even more modern feel to it. All aspects of this fun and exciting horror thriller are on target ? from its creativity, to more technical aspects, such as its set, camera work, visuals and editing. Missing this movie, or letting anyone tell you the ending before you see it for yourself, would be? kinda crazy. "A"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but Definitely Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boy" presents us with an interesting premise from the start. A young American woman takes a job as a nanny to an elderly couple's child in Britain. Only when she gets to their large, creepy mansion does she learn the "boy" is really a doll that the couple treats as if it is alive and their son. Much of what ensues after this is fairly predictable. We know the doll is going to end up doing creepy things, or at least we'll be led to believe this is the case. We also know there will be something more going on than what meets the eye. Lauren Cohan does a very good job, which is essential because she has to carry most of the movie. Many scenes are with her and the doll alone. Also, the setting and the doll itself do a great job of creating the mood. The film does well at holding the viewer's attention; however, once we see the final "twist" we understand that it was really the only reasonable explanation--although it is really not all that reasonable. There are a few scenes where the dialog and impact fall a little flat. I recommend the film to those who really like this genre, because there is enough there to make it worthwhile; however, do not expect a masterpiece.</fullReview>

When I first heard about this movie I thought it was going to be anther disappointing horror movie, but instead it was a really surprising and well pacing movie with an amazing twist no one's going to see coming.The characters in this movie are likable, and smart. Even though I never heard of anyone who acted in this film, I think they did an amazing job delivering, and making the movie more intense and entertaining. The director does an fantastic job with this movie. Letting the viewers know what's going on though the whole movie. Making scenes very suspenseful and having a good pay off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm an avid IMDb user. This is actually my first time writing a review though. I felt inclined after browsing through other's reviews saying how horrible this movie was. It was actually a lot better than I expected. I wasn't in a huge hurry to see it, but I'm happy I watched it. I haven't been a fan of many newer horror movies with the exception of It Follows, but I recommend watching this with an open mind. There's a twist that makes it worth while and I must admit, I didn't see it coming a mile away. Perfect ending to my mini Friday the 13th marathon. -- -- -- -- ----- ----- -----?------------ -----?------?----------------------------- ---</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quite possibly the most absurd twist that I've ever come across</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to start off by saying despite the 5 out of 10 rating, I do recommend this movie, for reasons that will be made clear if you decide to read this before seeing the movie...For the first, I'd say, 75 minutes of The Boy, you think you know (or at least I did) where the filmmakers are taking you... sort of. It seems like a kind of mashing together of the sort of English rural-secluded countryside of an older horror film like The Innocents (and that's to the movie's credit), and the 'doll is here and what is it *doing*) of Child's Play. I'm sure there were some other influences for this work - one of which I didn't know about until I was told of it much later on social media - but this starts off as a kind of batty (in a good way) horror story about an older couple who leave a woman (Lauren Cohan) in charge of taking care of Broms: a little 8 year old boy who happens to also be a doll. And nevermind that he's a doll - he'll need lots of comfort and caring to, such as reading to Broms and making sure its tucked in at night and fed and played classical music and what the hell is going on here?!This has an intriguing premise and I was kind of surprised by the quality of the filmmaking (at least for a January movie, when in recent memory you get schlock like The Devil Inside or even boring dreck like The Forest from the start of January), and the director and cinematographer and editor all pay attention to pacing and setting the mood and not really relying too heavily on jump scares, which are the death of horror cinema. There are a couple, but it's not the name of the game - it's more about 'where is Broms now, what is he doing, or what will Greta do next with this thing, and is it all in her mind?' It turns out the latter isn't true, and it seems like you can figure the movie out pretty easily... And then the filmmakers do something that is absolutely bat-s*** insane and turn everything on its head in the dumbest way imaginable. As it turns out (and this why I clicked 'spoiler' at the top), the movie really takes a lot of inspiration from a *1970's TV movie* called Bad Ronald (unseen by me, nothing to do with McDonald's fyi), which has the plot description of a perverted teenage boy who lives in the walls of a house after being left behind by his parents (who die) finds new people move in. Um... OK, that may work for that movie, but in the case of The Boy, the reveal of who Broms really is, makes for the craziest logic that I've ever come across for a mainstream horror movie - it combats The Village if you can believe it - and yet it doesn't really earn the brainpower to go back and think 'wait, how does that connect to this and that and... damn it.'It suddenly turns what's been a not great (there's one story hole with mail that I won't get into here) but interesting horror movie with a solid lead in Cohan into a nightmare. I don't mean that in any positive sense! In the last several minutes it turns into some later-period Jason Voorhees or Michael Myers flick, as Broms - the *real* Broms - has super-human strength despite living IN THE WALLS OF HIS HOUSE and still wears a Broms-doll mask over a hipster beard. It's so insane that you can't turn away, despite the jaw dropping past the floor and down the aisles to the bottom of the theater.</fullReview>

I read a couple of reviews, and people complained about things not being explained and impossible scenarios. But this move was super entertaining. I did not want to turn away, it kept me glued, and was fun. What else do you really want from a horror or mystery movie? It was original, and inventive, and the acting was good. Was it a perfect movie, no... but it was definitely worth watching, and if your on the fence about it, don't be, watch it. And i am picky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was originally going to give this movie a seven out of ten rating, but the ending of the movie boosted it up a star for me. the first hour is basically just a typical creepy movie that leaves you wondering what the heck is going on and it build up the relationship between Great and the grocery delivery man Malcom. Now, during the last thirty minutes right about the time Greta's ex-boyfriend shows up, the pace and suspense really picks up and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I also want to add without spoiling it, that it had a great twist that I did not see coming. Overall, this was a very enjoyable movie, better than the last couple of Horror flicks I have watched. Even if you're not a die hard Horror fan, I don't think you will be wasting your time by giving this a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a horror movie with more originality than usual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are looking for a horror movie with more originality than usual this may be your film. Most horrors are standard genre films that rely on cinema clichés to frighten us and audiences have become immune to plots with spooky dolls, isolated nannies and scary mansions. The Boy (2016) stands out by combining all of these horror tropes into a single story then overlays them with a plausible thriller about parental grief. It tries to be a serious film without the lame humour which so often sugar-coats horror movies into comedy-thrillers. But the downside is also typical of the genre: it runs out of ideas on how to finish the job.Greta (Lauren Cohan) is fleeing a bad relationship and applies for a nanny job caring for an 8-year old. She arrives at an isolated mansion in the English countryside and the child turns out to be a life-size doll called Brahms. The older couple's son died in mysterious circumstances twenty years earlier and Brahms is their way of dealing with unresolved grief. The creepy parents abruptly depart for an extended holiday, leaving Greta with strict instructions on how to care for Brahms. At first she ignores Brahms but soon weird things happen like the doll changes position and strange sounds echo through the house. Greta is alone and terrified until she befriends the local grocery guy Malcolm, but all hell breaks loose when the violent ex-boyfriend turns up unexpectedly. Poor Brahms becomes the unwanted child in some high-tension scenes but predictably the doll gets its revenge.Although not a great fan of horrors, this one kept me engaged until the final quarter where a tired old stock-standard formula is used to tie the narrative ends together. Until then, the film maintains a menacing Gothic atmosphere and enough surprises to keep you guessing what will happen next. Lauren Cohan is well cast as Greta and the story moves along at a lively pace. If you are not willing to suspend disbelief and go along with the story premise, you are unlikely to see it through and you are probably not a horror fan anyway. A good test if it will work on you is to grab a toy doll and stare into its eyes; if your mind can fantasise it staring back at you with malicious intent, you pass and should see The Boy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I am not really a fan of horrors and only watch them occasionally if I'm watching a film with a few friends. So of course I haven't seen many horror films in my time but I really enjoyed this one.The plot at the start is very simple, an American nanny goes to England to babysit. When she gets there she realises that she is in fact going to be taking care of a doll instead of a human. The parents go off and leave a set of rules for her to follow but she of course thinks this is silly, after all it's just a doll...or so it would seem.Although the film does rely on a few jump scares, I found the atmosphere the film creates was terrific, and basic things happening seemed to ramp up the tension. At first I was suspicious of a few of the secondary characters involved in the film but as we got towards the end of the film, the reveal of who/what The Boy really is was a shocking twist which in my opinion worked very well.The Walking Dead's Lauren Cohan gives a good performance in the lead role (the first film I've ever seen her in) and The Boy is just creepy and put me on edge.Overall I found it to be a good film with a good horror atmosphere which doesn't rely on the usual slash and gore. I would class it as more of a thriller. Better than expected and would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Done very well, final reveal not shocking, but still good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this film I wasn't sure what to expect since the advertising for it was vague. The movie does a great job keeping you guessing. Is the doll actually alive, or perhaps an evil spirit is possessing the doll, or my personal favorite, the main character is just going crazy.The house itself plays a character in the film, besides the gorgeous architectural detail, it's huge and creepy. It lends itself nicely to the question as to what's going on. Will Greta find details in the attic, or perhaps the burnt part of the house where the son died. Or did she get herself into a Scooby-Doo situation, and the house is filled with secret passages.The parents of Brahms are great characters too, although we don't see much of them because they leave on vacation shortly after Greta gets there. The mom seems completely crazy, and the father just seems resigned that this is his life. Greta should have known something was up when a mom who is so dedicated to her son to just leave him with an almost stranger. But Greta has issues of her own, and is glad she can just hide out, without having to do much. Greta's issue comes into play later on, and only adds to the wonderful build-up of tension in this film.At first I was going to give this film four stars, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I really did like it. There were jump scares that were done very well, the actors were very talented, the tension and music was used wonderfully, and the final reveal (while not shocking), was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining but fundamentally uneven and flawed, "The Boy" is a mish-mash of ideas that are fun to watch, but don't quite come together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You ever watch a film, and at a certain point, you get the feeling that the final product is obviously a heavily edited (if not outright- butchered) re-working and simplification of an otherwise great idea? Like a studio-suit-type got their hands on a really cool and original script that defied convention... but then that same studio- suit got cold feet, and had a legion of ghost- writers re-work it into something more generic and "audience friendly"?Yup. That's the feeling I got watching "The Boy."Don't get me wrong, there's still fun to be had. And despite its rather obvious faults, I was thoroughly entertained and had a good time. It's just... so obviously a great concept that feels like it's been tampered with by studio committees and producer interference to dumb it down to certain level that can only be described as "lowest common denominator." At times I could even swear that the film feels like it was the product of two or three different scripts that were haphazardly mushed together in a last- ditch effort to try and make it more of a broadly-appealing (aka "generic") thriller than a unique spine- tingler.The film follows Greta (the adorable Lauren Cohan), an American woman who has been hired to act as nanny for a prim and proper older couple's child overseas in the UK. However, Greta is taken aback after learning that the "boy" is actually a child-sized doll that is treated by his "parents" as if he was a real, living being. He's fed and taught lessons and kissed goodnight... a routine Greta is informed she must definitely follow. But when she begins to stray and ignore the rules set for her, strange things begin to happen, and it becomes all too clear that the doll might just be more "real" and "alive" than she could have imagined.The film works for the most part mainly due to the charm of the two lead cast-members, and for the well-executed visual storytelling.Cohan is a lot of fun as our lead, and she's a great choice for the role of Greta... she's able to convey her initial annoyance over her situation, the paranoia of her character as the story progresses, and even has a lot of really good pathos due to her fairly good development and backstory. And co-star Rupert Evans (probably best known for his roles in the delightful "Hellboy" and the underrated "The Canal") is charming as can be as Malcolm, a local grocery man who delivers food to the home and develops feelings for Greta as the story progresses. They're the main focus for much of the running time of the film, and they're both perfect in their roles, creating a lot of care from the audience.Director William Brent Bell also does a wonderful job in his visual storytelling, and he elevates the material. I honestly haven't been a fan of his work in the past... "Stay Alive" was a lazy and very condescending attempt to cash-in on the growing popularity of video-games over the last 20 years. And "The Devil Inside" was a terrible mis-judgement, with its infamous final act still viewed as a low- point in the world of horror. But here, Bell is actually able to get a lot of great work done, and show he does have the chops to make a good creep-fest if he really puts his mind to it. He revels in the atmospheric visuals of the old, enormous house and nearby woods. He glides the camera organically in slow, lingering shots that are a breath of fresh-air compared to the lousy "shaky cam" nonsense polluting other horror flicks. And he even for the most part strays away from relying too much on loud jumps and noises. I particularly admired a wonderful sequence where Greta tries to demonstrate to Malcolm that the doll can move on its own... great stuff there.It's just a shame that the film is dragged down so badly due to its issues with the script and storyline. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised that if at one point in development, the film was more of a psychological drama about an emotionally damaged person forging a deep connection with an inanimate doll... because this film's best moments- and indeed the moments that feel the most complete and developed- are the sequences where Greta begins to learn about what's happening and become more and more attached to the idea that the doll just might be alive. It's wonderful in certain scenes, and it feels disturbing in all the right ways. But then other sequences contradict this... particularly the scenes that play more as straight-forward horror. They feel like scenes out of a different film. And without spoiling it, the final act feels like it comes out of left-field in a very inorganic way... almost as if the climax from a completely different script was tacked-on and retro-fitted to feature the characters from this film. It almost gave me whiplash to see how much it changed in the third act.If they had just ran with the idea of a woman in a house being forced to take care of a creepy doll like a real child, and explored the ideas of isolation and paranoia associated with the situation... it could've been a great film. (Almost a "horror version" of the wonderful indie flick "Lars and the Real Girl.") But the tacked-on scenes added to manufacture generic haunted-house thrills diminishes the impact... as does the frankly bizarre climax.Still, the performances and atmospheric direction make it worth seeing for fans of horror, and I would by lying if I said I didn't get a kick out of it.I give "The Boy" a slightly-above-average 6 out of 10. It doesn't quite come together 100%, but it's definitely a fun time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted more from this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that promised so much and just couldn't deliver throughout the 97 minute film. While promising a somewhat predictable but always scary story line of a demonic living doll, "The Boy" just seems to leave you craving more. Lauren Cohan does a rather good job of portraying the character "Greta Evans" even though Greta's character is slightly underdeveloped, which is a surprise if you follow Lauren's ability to build her character on "The Walking Dead". You are never quite sure of Greta's full background as a character other than she is running from some unknown catastrophic event in her characters past, until close to the end of the film.The supporting cast does a mediocre job at supporting this small cast, while the story line slows to an uncontrollable bore fest during the middle of the film. The shining glory of "The Boy" is the fresh twist towards the end of the film, will leave that for you to find out. Even still the ending is exciting and surprising but very short lived.Over all "The Boy" is a lackluster movie sure to NOT BE the next classic horror film of this century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy (2016): Dir: William Brent Bell / Cast: Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, Jim Norton, Diana Hardcastle, Ben Robson: Nothing is as painful as the loss of a child. In this film we have an elderly couple who take it a tad further with the loss of brains. Lauren Cohan of Walking Dead fame stars as Greta. She arrives at this castle of a place owned by this elderly couple. She is escaping an abusive relationship that we are mainly told about through phone conversations. Anyway, her task is to babysit this doll while this looney couple go off and pond jump. She ignores all the rules because she sees taking care and treating this doll as a real boy to be about as idiotic as those instructing her to do it. As predicted strange things go bump in the night that point straight at this doll but the real kicker is a third act that makes little sense. William Brent Bell previously directed such crap as Stay Alive and Devil Inside. Here he has a cool big house to show off. Cohan holds her own as this woman who is slowly losing her mind. Other characters are about as lively as the zombies she slashes in her series. Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle are given the thankless task of portraying this senile couple who cannot tell reality from fantasy. Rupert Evans plays the guy who brings the groceries and attempts to get into Greta's pants. Ben Robson plays her abusive ex who conveniently shows up and gets his ass handed to him by a doll (more or less). Well made but incredibly difficult to take seriously as a horror film because it should be accompanied by a laugh track to back up the ridiculous premise. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Boy" (2016) is kinda sometimes creepy but sometimes kinda stupid horror flick without blood - yes, it's rated PG-13. Pacing of this flick was the best thing in it (except for Lauren Cohan look - she looks gorgeous) - at it's running time it almost never drags and is kinda interesting to watch on some dull evening. The story, which looks bizarre in the beginning, becomes clear by the end - but i'm not sure if that was a good ending - it's PG-13 after all! Overall, "The Boy" is OK horror flick for one boring evening. It won't blow you away, but will (probably) do it's job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is somewhat difficult for me to explain my viewing experience of this film, and in no way do I mean to sound condescending of uppity, so kindly bear with me... Usually, after years of "experience" with a certain hobby, one is able to differentiate objective criticism from lack of personal satisfaction. For me, The Boy is a perfect example, so I'll make sure to separate my personal opinions from what I perceive to be the makings of a fine Horror film.I've always been a big fan of the Supernatural sub-genre, with a special liking to films portraying evil dolls (films like Dead Silence or Annabelle, NOT Chucky). After watching the trailer for The Boy several months ago, I've been eagerly anticipating its release. As presented in the teasers, the story is original and well told (hats off to screenwriter Stacey Menear), and the jump-scares (while still cheap) are sufficiently few and well made to add the occasional scare without damaging the experience. Music and cinematography are great, as is the acting (especially supporting actors Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle as Mr. and Mrs. Hillshire).Now for my problem... the plot twist is smart, surprising and in no way predictable (although some of you might have guessed it from the start, I personally was impressed). It adds a stroke of genius creativity and originality to an otherwise all too known pattern of a film. I just didn't like it... it felt too original, like trying to reinvent the wheel when the wheel works just fine. Objectively - great twist, great ending! In my opinion? A let down.All in all, the eerie sense of suspense and fear is maintained throughout the entire film, and I would definitely recommend it to other "supernatural dolls" fans. However, personally, I couldn't help but feeling it was ultimately a let-down, and I wouldn't watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The boy ... A little of enough original ideas but too confused ! The first part of the film holds up well : The presentation of the doll , the two old obsessive fetish doll (interesting in the photograph doll shots ) ... but then falls style with mediocre horror sequences ( slow -fast room , noise ,jump- scare ... ) ... Then again it builds a nice atmosphere when Greta begins to think that the doll is alive ... but in the epilogue climax it is reduced to some killing ( with too little blood !! ) and a greeting ...If they had deepened the psychological aspect of the two old morbid that they forced the beautiful and fragile girl to look after the doll would be a great tragedy !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The boy" is a thriller-horror movie about an American nanny who has to take care of doll whose owner treats it like their son and claims that it is really alive.Well, idea of movie was a little different but there was something missing in screenplay.Maybe it was horror content as there were not many frightening scenes.There's a nice twist in the end of the movie but even it was also not able to save movie completely because I have seen that in another movie also whose name I can't reveal.I feel that story and screenplay could have been better.But in spite of all these limitations,The Boy is nice movie but don't watch it with higher expectations(especially as a horror movie).Overall I give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watch a lot of horrors, I've rated about 800 so far (and probably seen about 300 more at the very least).And although this is not one of the better horrors I've seen I'd say it's still definitely above average.It's a mystery so I can't really talk too much about the movie without hinting at spoilers and such so I'll keep that to a minimum.It's basically a creepy doll movie but not overly silly made like for instance 'DEAD SILENCE (2007)' or a slasher-doll movie like the Chucky- movies it takes it's time to develop and keeps the mystery going for quite some time, which makes it feel a bit like a psychological thriller and keeps us wondering what's going on and what's next.Lauren Cohan who plays Maggie in the TV-series 'The Walking Dead' handles the lead well, and the cinematography is stunning.So yeah if you're looking for a new horror movie to watch this is a valid choice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy is not a bad movie. Actually it really is entertaining and not boring. Usually, this kind of a movie is predictable and the story begins or let's say first third of the film, I though I knew what was going to happen next and it kinda did, but I could not really imagine the end of the film , so when the twist occurred, I was surprised positively.The whole boy/doll thing was interesting and kinda creepy. I am not sure if this is a horror movie... Even though there are some scares and some killings, they are 'less horror and bloody' than million others in dramas and thrillers.Although the twist towards the end is a big plus, as I did not see it coming, the very end of the film is kinda a bit of a let down as I expected that the boy story be explained... I know that there was no one left to tell the story, but maybe some police or an article from the old newspapers... Also, I am not sure we got to see / read the letters the boy's parents ( but aren't they too old?!) left/sent ...All in all, I feel like there is going to be the sequel. Not only because the doll/boy is restored, but, those questions I was wondering about give the feeling they will be explained eventually.Seven from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2606;&#x2606; - "Second-hand genre banality."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greta is a young, American nanny, who has been employed by an elderly couple, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Heelshire, to take care of their child, while they are on holiday, at their isolated English mansion; but the premise of William Brent Bell's (The Devil Inside, Stay Alive) new horror film, The Boy, is not entirely that straightforward. As the title rather conveniently suggests, Bell's fifth film centres around a boy, who goes by the name of Brahms. However, the Heelshire's failed to mention some vital information to Greta regarding Brahms before she eagerly signed up to work for them: he is a doll."Hello, is anybody up there?": One of Greta's opening lines, which ticks a box on any 'horror clichés list', The Boy unquestionably delivers a concoction of cheesiness. Almost immediately, after Greta leaves the taxi driven by a perverted cab driver who has a thing for her cleavage, we are launched into this crater of predictability and genre convention: A Gothic mansion "in the middle of nowhere", many shots of creepy toys, the dull woman in danger vs. otherness? staying away from the border into perilous, ground-breaking territory; instead, sticking to the basics.After some exploring around the eerie house, Greta is introduced to the Heelshire's suave grocer, Malcolm, who can supposedly read peoples pasts by holding their chewing gum?grim. After reading Greta's gum, Malcolm predicts that she has had a troubled life. It is later revealed that Greta is escaping a violent relationship she had in the U.S., with a douche?or man?named Cole. Sensing some chemistry between both Malcolm and Greta, it is evident this shall not be the last time we see Malcolm nor hear his poncey English accent; the plot is all too familiar. Shortly after this encounter, we have the pleasure of meeting the Heelshire's. Both with voices which are the epitome of Downtown Abbey English (of course), Mrs. Heelshire is a blank but peculiar lady who?along with Mr. Heelshire?we only see for a short while. During this time, Mrs. Heelshire introduces Greta to their son, Brahms, who she discovers to be a bisque doll. The Heelshire's take care of Brahms as if he were a real young boy, using it as a decoy to sugar-coat the fact that the real Brahms was killed in a fire over 20 years ago. Greta handles the situation collectively, only letting a single giggle slip-out, presenting little resistance to the story of Brahms, which is both frustrating and questionable. Mrs. Heelshire goes through all the rules Greta needs to abide by while they are away on holiday, such as kissing Brahms goodnight and serving him food. It is not long before the Heelshire's leave Greta with Brahms, alone in the house (well it had to be done, didn't it?), na?ve and defenceless (?that too).By this point, the overarching thrill of this film has ferociously disintegrated into the ground: Jump scares have already made an appearance ten minutes after the film started, too early to construct any form of suspense. Also, we have already been introduced fully to the main spectacle of the show, Brahms, leaving us nothing but Greta's struggle to look after this child/doll and the story of why she left home to pursue her nanny career in Great Britain, which doesn't make a riveting viewing. For me, before watching a horror film, I have a buzz: A combination between excitement and fear of the unexpected, which couple together to form a hybrid emotion, otherwise known as the buzz. However, my buzz deflated a few scenes into The Boy due to its lack of suspense, leaving us nothing to anticipate, instead we watch a catalogue of second-hand genre banality.Greta originally does not treat Brahms like a human-being. After the Heelshire's leave, she begins by placing a blanket over his head, putting her feet up and nibbling on a sandwich while Brahms is collaborating an evil plan to kill Greta, or something along those lines. Strange supernaturalesque behaviour begins to kick off: The blanket on Brahms somehow has fallen on the ground when Greta returns, her necklace and dress is stolen while she showers (typical), loud noises are coming from the attic and Brahms starts appearing in different locations around the house. Greta then starts to believe that Brahms is alive, sharing this news with Malcom who, again, is another pushover who accepts this story.Performances in this film are solid?but how challenging can it be to act surprised and out of breath like Greta? Letting the side down, however, is Cole (Mark Robson), Greta's violent American ex, who could do with a few more years in drama school?if he did at all attend?as he embarks on an un-energised, naff performance. A Golden Raspberry nomination? Perhaps. Luckily, he isn't in the film for long and this didn't damage my overall opinion of the movie: its place in cinematic hell was already sealed firmly in the ground long before.Yet another one of William Brent Bell's horror films carries a dangerously thin screenplay, oozing with predictability in a joyless fashion. However, originality is not my principle disliking for this newest contemporary-genre trash; Bell does not understand the concept of suspense at all, which should be the load-bearing wall in this type of film, leaving the audience with an empty, jump-scare fest which focuses too much on Greta's past rather than building a tense atmosphere in the present. The aesthetic and style is correct, the setting is not at all uncommon but satisfactory, these are things that didn't cock-up. For Bell, horror clearly isn't his thing, perhaps an M. Night Shyamalan in the making? A good shout. I would recommend that he works on making a film in another genre, however I don't want him to obliterate yet another one. If this wasn't the tombstone of his film career, then prepare for more trash in the near but distant future? I just hope this doesn't put you off horror, or the cinema, altogether.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bad reviews have it all wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a great CREEPY movie. Not intensely terrifying, and that was not the purpose. Dolls are creepy and therefore a movie about a doll is supposed to be creepy and this movie nailed it. A lot of people complain about the ending, some say that they don't like how it wasn't actually the doll being possessed by a spirit, and I've even read some reviews from some.... Not very smart people.... Who somehow totally missed the fact that the man was the "dead" boy. He killed a little girl when he was 8. His parents were ashamed, hid him in the walls, and I believe they created doll to replace their "odd" boy. They locked the real guy up, never saw him, fed him through the walls, he had a bunch of holes he made over time that led to the inside of the house. The parents were scared of him too, so they made sure to comply with all his requests: loud music so he can hear it behind the walls. Living in isolation for 20 years behind the walls would obviously drive someone intensely mad, not to mention he was odd to start out with. Obsessive, creepy, weird. The doll was his creepy way of being loved and accepted by his parents, and as he hoped, by a woman. So he lived through the doll for 20 years. It's the story of an isolated family with a dark secret, an even more isolated and insane man who just wanted to be loved, and lived through the more lovable and accepted doll, and was murderous against anyone who rejected him. Creepy. And successful. Anyone who dislikes this movie probably wanted super scary, and it did have a couple scary moments, or they wanted poltergeist chuckie demon doll, which no offense, but that is silly. It makes it way more cool for it to not be paranormal but just a really f'ed up family in the middle of nowhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pervy Porcelin Doll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy is about a creepy ass doll that is treated like a person, and who Walking Dead star, Lauren Cohen is tasked with nannying in a equally creepy ass house.First off, the film isn't scary, and this is coming from someone who is very easily scared (if you exclude the doll giving Greta a peanut butter sandwich scene God Damn!). This film most certainly won't follow you out the movie theatre. You can see that the filmmakers really tried to build suspense and tension albeit through conventional means like; a spooky house, corridor wondering at night, dream sequences, china dolls and a few jump scares littered throughout. But, although an attempt was made, the result has little impact bar a few expected reflexes.The Boy is unfortunately one of those horror movies that contains; poorly shot scenes (yes I'm talking about the parents suicide), plot holes, hundreds of unanswered questions originated due to poor logic and also, unintentionally hilarious moments.I must say that Brahms is one pervy china doll. Literally for the majority of the film all this doll does is steal Lauren Cohen's clothes and just stare at her in general including during sexy time. To be honest it is clear that the reason she was chosen as the nanny was because of Brahms sexual attraction towards her, but to me, a perverted doll with the hots for his nanny is simply laughable.I have to bring up the parents suicide scene because I could not stop questioning and laughing at it due to its visuals and logic. Firstly the couple pick up a rather large pebble, about the size of their hand. Why? Was the pebble "so heavy" that it drowned them? Maybe if they took a dozen plus (of the same size or bigger) then put them in their pockets, THEN I may believe it... But no. One pebble equals drowning. And if that wasn't hilarious enough then the fact there isn't a shot of the two with their heads underwater is also baffling. Allow me to elaborate. The couple look like they went for a good ol' swim and then suddenly, jump cut, they disappeared, although I understood what the filmmakers where going for it could have been made much clearer and did not have to look so darn goofy.The ending. The ending to The Boy is aimed to be ambiguous, but probably not to the degree I found it so. So the big reveal of the film is that Brahms never died and was hiding in the walls of the house, moving the doll for 20 years... Why has he been in the walls for 20 years? I can understand initially to hide from the police due to killing that girl but 20 YEARS!? He could've surely come out years ago couldn't he? Also the final shot of the film is probably the most confusing shot in the entire film. The doll is put back together again by someone hidden from the camera (most likely undead human Brahms)... But why? Who is going to come to this house anymore? The parents are dead, the nanny and grocery man are long gone so who? And don't even get me started on the "HE'S STILL ALIVE" implication here.Overall the Boy is a not so scary horror movie that, to be honest, has one or two moments I must confess, but for the most part is heavily flawed with; plot holes, formulaic scares, unintentional Hilarity, lack of explanation in its logic etc. It's meh, but if you like horror films then maybe check it out, or not, up to you but it just isn't for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cohen stars as Greta, an American nanny hired by a wealthy English couple to watch their young boy Brahms while they are away on vacation. Things immediately take a turn when Greta arrives at the enormous, rural estate occupied only by an elderly couple and a super creepy porcelain doll they treat as if it were their son.Staying true to horror movie clichés, Brahms is dressed to the nines, has a wry smile and has a habit of wandering off when no one is looking. The elderly couple insist their son is alive and well as they hurry out the door and leave Greta alone in the house with strict rules not to leave Brahms alone and to always kiss him goodnight.The Walking Dead star Cohen carries the film, as she is the only character on screen for most of it. Despite her natural English accent and familiar Southern accent from Dead, she opts for a more Midwestern inflection. Cohen's Greta is the only American character in the film alongside Rupert Evans' Malcolm and the (mostly) silent Brahms. Bell has made a career out of directing horror. His flair for creating unsettling tension before action sequences have been apparent in his past films Stay Alive and The Devil Inside. Similarly, The Boy builds gradually throughout before the final reveal of what or who Brahms really is. If you've ever looked into a doll's gleaming porcelain eye and felt disquieted, then there is at least a few scares in this one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will begin by saying this movie set a high standard for horror films for the year 2016, truly a thought provoking film which keeps the viewer hooked on the screen from start to finish.The trailer basically outlines the plot of the movie, in which an American women gets a job at babysitting a boy, with a desirable pay as well, however she is shocked to see that the boy is a doll and the parents of the boy have every reason to believe that the boy is alive and as seen in the trailer a chore list is made for the nanny and is strictly ordered to follow the rules, but like any other sane person would do she ignores the list and that's when the plot really starts to get interesting.Not to spoil the movie but the plot twist towards the end is probably in my opinion the high point of the film in which the viewers' jaws drop.over all an excellent movie, with great character development, great acting, clever cinematography and stays away from the common horror cliché's, truly a film worth watching alone or with a friend.I rate it 7.5</fullReview>

The Horror Elements of this one are Jump Scares along with Tropes like Locked in the Attic, Thunderstorms, and a Gothic Mansion. This Huge Mansion is Impeccably Clean. The Old Couple have a Hired Staff of None, although it could be Ghosts that Tidy Up.Absurdity Abounds as more Questions Go Unanswered. There isn't much Tension, unless You count the Dream Sequences, there are Two in Succession in case the Audience is Asleep and need a Wake Up Jolt. No Confidence in the "Real Life" Scenes, that should be a Clue.Because the Film is as Lifeless as "Brahms" the Porcelain "Boy" with the Actors showing about as much Expression and Concern to what is Happening with Blank Looks and barely a Raised Eyebrow with the Dialog mostly in Monotone with Mid-Range Volume Throughout.The Movie Plays Out from Here to There but is Hardly Playful. Aside from the Mediocre Acting and the Lazy, Lame Script, the PG-13 Rating Dooms the Whole Thing into Lukewarm Displays of the Usual Cheats with the Violence.Overall, Not Recommended unless You have a Thing for Family Portraits Hanging on the Wall. The Director Sure Does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A novice nanny unexpectedly finds herself looking after a doll that substitutes for a dead child, which then starts demanding obedience ...An American thriller that sadly got a tax break in Britain - so we have to put up with the cringe-worthy sight of a black-cab driving through unbelievably gorgeous countryside to deliver an impossibly good- looking American actress to a ridiculously over-wrought mock-Gothic mansion.But there is promise, as we're introduced to a cast of damaged, unreliable characters who revolve around an inanimate object. Surely their inner demons will reveal themselves in a devilish unravelling of some dreadful secret? At one point I was hoping the doll would reflect the heroine's insanity, then hoping the doll would go all Asian horror. But no - it collapses back into its IKEA box with a tired, old twist to reassure its white-bread target audience.The lead actress is very good, and she could have carried a much more pervy role - you can feel her holding back. The hero is entirely unconvincing, but I think that's to do with the American-Brit mish-mash.Photography and direction are pretty good. Music is constantly on, telling us how to feel.Overall, when you deal in clichés you need to weird it up. Mediocre attempt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre Movie Made Worse by Ridiculous Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS WILL ABOUND HERE. TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT THEM PLEASEThis movie combines all of the worst aspects of what is wrong with horror and Hollywood writing, in general, in 2016. It's a mediocre, unoriginal and bland thriller that relies on generic jump scares to create most of its' tension. After, at the least, maintaining a clear narrative the movie unleashes on of the most ridiculous twist endings since HIGH TENSION.Lauren Cohen stars in this movie from Universal (that signifies how far they have fallen from their glory years of horror). She is an American girl who has moved to England to escape some dark moments in her life and take a job as a nanny. Only this is no ordinary nanny job, she is to watch a doll. As if that wasn't bizarre enough, the "parents" of this doll have a laundry list of very particular rules for the nanny to follow. Almost immediately, they leave her alone with the doll. Of course, like most of us would do, she doesn't take these duties seriously at first, ignoring the doll and going on about her life isolated in this country home. Then, things start to go weird, as items disappear and finally she is trapped overnight in an attic.After these events, our heroine starts to take the doll seriously and realize that there is a spirit in the house who demands care of the doll or will unleash devilish tricks on her. Most of us have an innate unsettled feeling with dolls and mannequins and the movie does a good job of playing with this fear. There are some genuinely creepy scenes where the doll will unnerve even the most jaded horror fan. Unfortunately, the movie falls down generic Hollywood horror traps far too often, though, as almost every real "scare" in this movie is the most boring of boring types -- the jump scare. Yes, the music ratchets up, the mood intensifies and the camera zooms in slowly only for something to jump out at us with a loud noise, accompanied by jarring music. It's such lazy film making.Lauren Cohen doesn't help much here, either. She's a pretty face that most know from THE WALKING DEAD, but even as an ardent fan of that show, I found her to be a generic actress there. Try as the show might to make Maggie interesting, Cohen just brings no real emotion to the role. Here, it's much the same. She's the pretty girl next door and that's about it. It's hard to feel much for her because the actress has done nothing to bring sympathy to the role.Still, all things considered, for the first 75 minutes or so the movie has done an average job of presenting an, at least, entertaining (if unmemorable) thriller, then we get to the twist. Hollywood seems to have a fascination with the twist and I think that horror falls into this trap the worst. This is the most horrid kind of twist. Look at a classic twist like THE SIXTH SENSE. The viewer can go back and re- watch the film and there is ample evidence everywhere that the viewer could have seen this coming. The twist does something to support the previous narrative and make it all the more impactful. Too many amateur writers seem to feel it is okay to just pull the rug out from under the viewer and say "Aha, I got you". No, you didn't "get" anyone with this ending. You spent all of this time building a tense mood around a spirit who may be possessing this doll, then soiled all over it. There are so many things the writer could have done intelligently with that premise, but the real threat is much more generic. What was the point of having a doll in the first place? Why all the rules? Why the doll? Why bother? You could have done a ghost story and left out the twist. You could have done a creepy mystery guy movie and left out the doll. By combining these, you've only created something ludicrous. It's tempting for a writer because an unintelligent viewer will typically confuse an out of nowhere twist with good writing, but this just isn't the case. A twist means nothing if you didn't support it along the way, build towards it and use it to bring meaning to what has come before. Otherwise, all you've done is left one narrative unfinished and tacked on a different story at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best twist is one where you aren't expecting a twist. The Boy is a pretty straightforward film, at least it seems like one till most of its running time. This is not a mystery, so no twist was expected, just a plain, simple, emotional creepy story about a dead boy's soul that has entered a lifelike doll! But then BAM, the twist hit me and knocked me cold. You may not like it but it's there to hit you when you least expect it? For the different story and the least expected twist ever this is quite good.And I must say this is creepy little film where I found myself living in the scary home with the lead character. Empathy and emotional quotient are high. The plot and story were fresh, the end result, is unexpected, unpredictable! Boy oh boy, what a film!</fullReview>

The only reason I opted to see this one was because of the beautiful young starlet, Lauren Cohan. If there's a Positive reason to see THE BOY, it's her.

Of course the haunted doll idea has been done many times before, but this was different from the outset. Brahms seemed to actually be a harmless childlike presence with a bit of an attitude and it was nice to see Lauren Cohen's character, Greta, click on to that rather quickly giving us a few nice scenes with her playing happy families with Brahms and her new grocery guy boyfriend. The setup for the end of the film was inevitable and everything gets messed up when Greta's abusive ex-boyfriend finds out where she's staying. I will say no more other than this: I didn't expect that ending. Loved this movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the downturn in good horror cinema over the past few years I went into this expecting the worst. Low budget, jump scares, failed humour, no character development, T&amp;A, and crap acting by unknowns or has-beens.But it turns out this movie is pretty good. It had me thinking all the way along and my partner and I talking about the movie (at length). I'd highly recommend it to others looking for something different.It's not going to become a cult cinema classic. It's not a, "I'm going to watch this 100x over my life." You probably won't even buy it. But it's a good, solid movie, and worth your time for a night in.</fullReview>

Having just watched it, several things are running through my mind, but there a few thoughts that are a bit louder than the rest.Like WHOA. And DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. And THE HECK DID I JUST WATCH? But in a good way, you know? As you all know, Hazel is one brave puppy, but as there were several jump scares, she again left me to review the Boy alone. And as always, a movie that can scare our little dog earns four stars from her. But what about my score?First off: The good.If I had to sum up this movie is one little (OK, maybe not so little) word, it would have to be: Disconcerting. The taxidermy animals looming down at you is disconcerting. The dead creepy rats in the traps are creepy. The old creepy house is disconcerting. The old couple that live in the creepy house is disconcerting. And that creepy doll, with those creepy eyes, that creepily stare at you all the time throughout this creepy movie, is DISCONCERTING. The deliberate (but not obviously so) performance by the entire cast, the atmosphere, and the setting all bring you where you need to go. This movie does far more than guide your emotions ? it outright toys with them, but that is to its betterment. For that, I have to give The Boy props. Many movies try this technique (especially horror movies) and do not pull it off, while this film does it effortlessly. All of it brings you to a very heated end, but never in a way that you expect.I don't mean the tropes because they are all conspicuously there. The dream sequence, the obligatory making out session that follows the obligatory shower scene, and the tense walk through the dark house, while it's storming outside, wrapped in a towel, holding a candle, in a big house in the middle of nowhere, with shoddy cell phone service. No, the tropes do not attempt to break any new ground. Instead, this movie uses them to its advantage, and the EVENTS that happen in this film can be described in any way but predictable.So my last point is more of a mixed bag. I would have liked to see less cheap jump scares and overused clichés, but as many twists and turns brought the movie to a very startling ending, I must say my cons for this movie are minor. Some viewers may find that there is too much build up for too little action, but the gorgeous cinematography and disconcerting atmosphere prove to be very entertaining in their own rights. For me, at least.All in all, this is definitely one to see. But the reveal, while very unexpected, lacks any defining moment of truth that some horror films make excellent use of. My original score for this horror flick was 3.5, but after comparing my score with Hazel, the adjusted score for the Boy is a solid 3.7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A spooky typical "doll" thrilling film with good acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this film and think it is worth a watch. A film that keeps you intrigued and guessing all the way through with a good twist. Rated 7/10 for a good typical spooky doll thriller, with great acting throughout- however I didn't find this film scary which was slightly disappointing as I expected more jumpy scenes. The lead role is played by Lauren Cohan who has moved to England to be a nanny from America, but things are not as Lauren seems when she meets the owners and their son who is actually a life-sized doll. Niave and desperate for the money, Lauren decides to go ahead with the job of taking care of their "son" who supposedly died in a fire 20 years ago. As time in the old house gets on, Lauren realises she's not alone at night, and has second thoughts about the doll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy (2016) : The Boy is a 2016 American-Canadian psychological horror film directed by William Brent Bell and written by Stacey Delay. The film stars Lauren Cohan and Rupert Evans.Plot: Greta is a young American woman who takes a job as a nanny in a remote English village, only to discover that the family's 8-year-old is a life-sized doll that the parents care for just like a real boy, as a way to cope with the death of their actual son 20 years prior. After violating a list of strict rules, a series of disturbing and inexplicable events bring Greta's worst nightmare to life, leading her to believe that the doll is actually alive.Plus Points: 1)Plot: Movie's plot has enough potential to scare audience.A plot which involves dolls are regular but babysitting a doll is awesome.Trailer of the movie itself raises expectations.2)Acting: Acting by actors is decent without flaws.Minus Points: 1)Climax: Climax of the movie is not at all satisfying.It got a twist but bit forced.2)Screenplay: Screenplay is not interesting but has few scary scenes.Movie does not satisfy our urge for horror.So The Boy is horror movie with great plot but average execution6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprise movie of the year!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy comes across as another haunting movie. A mother and father take care of a doll, as if the doll is their 8 year old son. When the child's keeper is left alone with the doll strange occurrences happen. The first two thirds of "The Boy" is a creepy ghost story. The two developmental characters push The Boy's story-line from a creepy ghost story into a Texas Chainsaw Massacre story twist. The rules were broken with the doll. I never saw the plot twist coming, and I usually do. A suspenseful last 20 minutes. Well acted, written, and crafted by the director. I would watch "The Boy again" a different style of horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shockingly good for a Hollywood horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, as many of my closest acquaintances know, the horror genre is a very sensitive subject to me when it comes to what I like and what I do not like. As most horror films have come within years, I have not been a fan of very many especially one of my recent views, 'The Forest'. 'The Boy' however, get ready for it? impressed and shocked me. I am a huge fan of 'The Boy'. I found the scare moments not that bad, I even fell for one jump scare but even beyond the scare moments, I felt creeped out at some of the moments presented by this film. Even after a certain point, I found myself unable to close my mouth because the film made my jaw drop in shock as some of the very eerie moments started to unravel and I lost myself in what was happening. By the end of the film I was overall shocked and appreciative of the story and how everything played out. So yes people, I am a fan of this horror flick. I would advise people to go out and check this one out, it is great for date night, it is great in regards to story and eerie horror elements, overall, it was a pretty damn great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique, Astonishing and Truly Terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would give the film 'The Boy' 8 stars, the story of the film was well presented and a sort of psychological horror that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Although when you watch the trailer of the boy you get a completely different image of what the film is actually about, watching the trailer at first I thought that it was just about a possessed doll but the complete twist in the film is somewhat genius. This film has been presented as if it is a typical horror where the doll is possessed the characters solve the horror within the doll and they all live happily ever after stereotype but that is the complete opposite of this film. The surprising twist at the end is simply shocking and will really get you asking yourself rhetorical questions because what has happened is just so unexpected it is hard to know what to contemplate with this film. First impressions of this film most of the audience that I have spoken to have thought this film is similar to the horror 'Annabelle' which is about a creepy possessed doll; this is a complete contrast to the boy. The characters in this film are just so enticing and so diverse; all of the actors involved play their parts well and really bring the story alive.Around the middle of this film I found that it got a bit uninteresting, it was rather repetitive and when you are expecting something to happen it just doesn't. At this point I feel that there could have been more going on or it could have been a bit faster paced, I feel like that would have leaded me to give a higher rating of The Boy. As the film goes on you will find yourself with constant questions and confusion, some parts were slightly emotional but that soon changed when the next horrific scene came along making you sink in your seat.Overall I loved this film; the psychological effect of it really kept me going all the way to the end and left me wanting more. It was creepy, unique and the majority of the time I was watching it I felt as though I needed a pillow to hide behind. My heart was racing throughout waiting for the next action that would make my heart stop. It was truly fantastic and I look forward to watching it again and again because each time I watch The Boy it will never not be shocking to me. I find the more you watch something the more you discover and understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film with only seven characters - including a voice on the other end of the telephone - and basically one location, "The Boy" packs a punch. Greta is a young American woman who has applied and been accepted for the post of a nanny at a mansion in the English countryside at an extortionate salary. When she meets the parents though, she has a surprise. The mother is well passed child-bearing age, because their son Brahms died two decades ago, and Greta has been hired as nanny to a doll. She does her best to hide her surprise, and gets the impression the man of the house is humouring his wife. Greta takes the post promising faithfully to stick to the routine she has been given while they go off on holiday. But is she really going to nanny a doll? The parents' holiday is not all it appears, because they have no intention of returning ever; filling their pockets with rocks, they walk into a watery death. Meanwhile, strange things are happening in the house. Are we going to see the oh so predictable devil doll chasing her knife in hand? Not quite, Greta is a young woman with issues; unfortunately, one of those issues turns up at the house and attempts to persuade her to return home with him. By this time though, she has already convinced herself that because of her other issue, Brahms has "chosen" her. What happens next is reminiscent of another low budget film - one from New Zealand - but to elaborate on that would be to give the game away. Suffice it to say if you can forgive the nightmare sequences and the heavy poetic licence needed to bridge the credibility gap, this is one psychological thriller you won't be sorry you watched to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy (2016) was for the first 1 hour a very simple and smooth rolling thriller film, though once it hit the last almost 18 minutes of the film the instant feeling of "what the f? did they do to this film" came over us. The ending of the film was the death of the movie, the acting, the story, everything just went to crap. The Boy (2016) had a simple thriller vibe going on, it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either then all of a sudden they through in the "let's hurry and destroy a movie" vibe and well the end.If you watch The Boy (2016), watch your clock and once it hits 1 hour turn the film off to leave with a feeling that you watched something fairly done, the ending made us wish we'd never have watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy is a story about an American babysitter who takes a job in England for an old couple with a son who turns out to actually be a doll. Or is he? As strange things begin to happen in the house our heroine, played by Lauren Cohan, starts to believe that the doll may have a life of its own.The film attempts to create an atmosphere of suspense but frankly I found it far more funny than scary. If you want to watch something so stupid that it makes you laugh then this could be a fun way to pass the time but after laughing at the first hour of the film I fell asleep as it just didn't hold my attention until the end. If you want an entertaining evil doll horror watch Chuckie, or even Anabelle. There really isn't much to recommend here; nothing about this film rises above mediocre, not the acting, the scares or the story. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another good horror film ruined by the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am really starting to get tired of seeing brilliant trailers of films and praying to the horror god that finally Hollywood has made a film which has a brilliant beginning middle and end!!Unfortunately that isn't the case with this film! From the trailer you would think this film would be on par or similar to the The conjuring Anna belle but better, but guess what.... Its not..From the fake English setting the random plot line, this film just has disappointment all over it!The beginning starts off slow as with any good horror movie to draw you in and create suspense! The story of a couple who have lost their son and the spirit possessing a doll seems a good plot in theory and for the beginning and middle of the film this actually works. there are a lot of questions which are unanswered through out the film, like what happened to the previous nanny, and what caused the fire, but it something that can be dealt with because of other things going within the film...The film turns south when the American nannies ex psycho partner comes into the frame! it was like the writers had ran out of ideas and just tried to finish the film as quickly as possible! changing the film from a ghost possessed doll to an obsessed crazy person living in the walls which we didn't see coming at all ruined the entire plot of the film! It was like Annabelle meet Texas chainsaw massacre and for some reason it just didn't work as it was all shoved into a small 20 minute slot right at the end of the film! Maybe again if they had explain or shown us that something was a miss in the house then we could forgive there rush to get this film finished! But i don't know about the rest of you but i am really tired of watching horrors and wanting to genuinely be scared and then just ending up disappointed because they have made a good scary ghost horror movie and just explain "aliens did it" or just ended the film with no explanation what so ever! i mean this works sometimes on films, but not when the film actually needs an ending and conclusion and not just credits! i think Hollywood needs someone to tell them when the film needs a conclusion ending and not just a cut to the credits with no explanation! it works for some not for most! Verdict for this film - good but then i would switch off after an hour into it so you keep the suspense of the film in your head and are not ruined by the Hollywood rubbish after!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is really not as good as what it has been made out to be!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into the movie, thinking it was going to be about a doll, something similar to Chucky or Annabelle but it's nothing like them. A lot of people are saying this is original, but it's not The Pact and Housebound are very similar to this. (Ending wise) A lot of the movie didn't make sense.. This is where a spoiler happens. She is given a doll to look after and he starts making you think it's a paranormal. Which it kinda makes you think, oh s**t there actually is a ghost in the doll.. But somethings don't really make sense. I'm now going to reveal the ending.. The boy isn't actually living in the doll but instead living in the house (so the doll actually had nothing to do with it) and he's a real life Adult. There's a scene where she wants to see the doll eat, to reach for his food. But he doesn't, she goes to the bin and the doll has moved, in that time frame no human can come out of a wall, pick up a doll and place it somewhere else, specially without making noise. The weird part is the ending, her ex boyfriend arrives the terrible one, at this point she thinks the ghost is still in the doll and this is the part of the film where you think they're going to tag team and kill the boyfriend together, she asks the doll to help her get rid of her ex boyfriend who is staying in the house and wants her to leave by tomorrow. So he does what she wishes. She asked for the help?! Anyway he paints blood on the wall saying "Get Out" then the scary ex boyfriend smashes the doll. Right now.. He is mad. This is where some of you may not of seen it coming, but the guy she thought was living in the doll comes out the wall.. Now obviously I would be scared as f**k. But one she asked for his help to get rid of him, two. Surely she should of been happy he get rid of her terrible ex boyfriend for her, He didn't want to kill any of them. He wanted to kill the ex for smashing the doll. I'm not saying they wouldn't be in shock and I just feel they should of explained more to him, what's happened. He was in a fire, his body was never found so what does that mean? There's a possibility he isn't dead. Certain things just don't link, like his parents killing themselves and so they give the nanny to him. But didn't his parents know before they went off to kill themselves, that she was meant to of been there for only a few months, so if none of that happened. When her months were up, did they just assumed she would stay.. If they really cared about there 'Boy' so much, why didn't they stay for a few nights before they went off and made sure she knew what she was doing.. I know I know it's just a movie. But sometimes these movie writers don't ever think? Oh that won't be ridiculous. It would of been more fun if the Doll was actually paranormal and the Nanny and Doll teamed up to try and kill the boyfriend. If you watched it.. The scenes before that were so strange. They build a relationship, but I don't understand, he nicked her clothes and necklace and he does something to prove he's 'paranormal' and she's best friends with him. Find out where that dress is.. Find out where your necklace is, like she is freaked out at first that he's paranormal then he gives her shoes back and she's happy with him and hugging him all around the house. If I knew a ghost was living in a doll, I wouldn't be okay with it. I wouldn't think it was a miracle. I would think this has never happened before and still be s**t scared and report it and get help. Don't waste your money to see this in cinema. This will be on Netflix soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greta(Lauren Cohan) gets a job in England has an nanny for a rich family, only to discover there kid is not what to be expected, it is in the form of a doll, Greta thinks they are crazy but goes along with it. The family gives her a set of rules to follow for there son the doll. And when the family leaves, Greta fails to follow the rules, then odd things start to happen, which will get you thinking is Greta going crazy or is the doll really alive? I know this premise is nothing new, a haunted doll movie. But does deliver the jump scares. The scenes in the house does give a good haunted house like feel to it. Lauren Cohan is quite good here, I thought I wasn't going to like her character at first, but has it went on she kind of grew on me. Scenes with the doll are quite menacing, I felt quite jumpy just looking at it. Ruppert Evans is also good too as the delivery guy. It does have a twist at the end, the would make Alfred Hitchcock smile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Boy" lies before a striking premise. "The Boy" is composed of a doll for nothing frightening, a house scary old and an unbalanced performance by Lauren Cohan (Maggie, "The Walking Dead"). Director William Brent Bell offers few moments of horror to satisfy fans of the genre, but the majority of the tension of the film is based on jump-scares and frights common in the world of horror, making us question Could not have been better with a development more coherent? Lauren Cohan is "Greta" a young American teenager who escapes from a tortuous relationship and takes a baby-sitting job in a village far away from society and looking gloomy, as soon as she accepts the job, should already know that Brahms should receive a kiss goodnight and must take care not to break or a single rule. After the explanations and others. Greta attempts to understand parents, and with the exception of Malcolm (Rupert Evans), she starts a single transition with the strange doll, where at the end unusually understands and follows the game in a natural and comprehensive way. This installment, is apparently a prospect of lean mixture between the so scary "Annabelle" (in matters of the doll) and the 2006 film "When a Stranger Calls" (in matters of work babysitting), we often see references of not only these two tapes, also from his previous project "The Devil Inside". From there, the film takes a couple of unnecessary turns and for fans of the horror the end despite breaking schemes of the genre, it is stupid and irrational, wasting the few merits as until then had managed to raise. But considering its classification PG -13 and what it could offer us, we all knew that this was not going to make the best horror film of the year but could reach the label " The Best and Original Horror Film of 2016 , to the date". Cohan performance is uneven, the first hour is tortuous and tense and fails her fully know what happens , unfortunately like all horror movies today , the real excitement starts in the last half hour where the film takes a turn I look that even innovative and irreproachable, also feels like a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a long day of work, I was extremely exhausted. I made myself get up to go see this film. Funny, there was no advertisement or nothing in the papers, reviews and all about his film, but it just sounded weird as I reviewed the site of the cinema I went to. Without knowing what to fully expect, I went with a female friend who very hesitantly was dragged to go see this film. We saw this around midnight. Now keep in mind, she did not want to be there and I was tired as hell. I kid you not. This film is very atmospheric and is scared the living sh** out of me. Of course any film with a doll starring in it, specially a scary doll will have that effect on me, and if its well done well... lets just say I lost my bucket of popcorn watching this film. Is was scary all the way to the end. I must, however, say i would not have chosen the ending it did, but I get it. Anyhow, don't want to spoil it, there isn't much else to say. You have to see for yourself to experience the fright. Not sure about you, but I hate when people tell me about horror films. All i need to know is that its good. So go out there and be scared cause this one is nightmare inducing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Most January Movies...Whatever That Means</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll say this, The Boy (2016) is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, One Missed Call does exist. But that does not make this movie good. The movie begins with new nanny girl butting up her shirt because chauffeur dude is creepin' on her as they come through the gates of the resident's house that new nanny will be...nannying. We are introduced to the boy himself, who ends up being a nice-looking porcelain doll, to which the homeowners believe is real. And Malcolm is there, and creepy sounds, and bad character development via phone call brought the chips. It's a fun time until 30 min in you realize the only thing that has happened is maybe creepy sounds...and the homeowners leave on vacation. And for the next hour...it's almost the same. Look, this is not a very good movie. It's not a terrible movie...and I could see someone liking this move. It is just, okay, I guess. The problem with The Boy is there is nothing new brought to the table here. Bad Character Development just brought the day-old, leftover chips from Longhorn Steakhouse. The only thing interesting in The Boy is the Boy himself. Main character nanny-girl has her backstory described in a short phone-call with her friend who disappears half-way through. Malcolm-man isn't given anything to work with but to just show up whenever the script needs him. And the scary-bits aren't really even that scary. I get this is a PG-13 horror flick, being released in January, and I give the movie props for being as good as it is during the refuse-dump that is January. But...if you can make the Boy interesting, then why not anyone else? The homeowners/parents leave 15 min into the movie, to which is shown later why...it doesn't make any sense but it's there. But by far the biggest downgrade for this movie has to be it's "twist" ending. SPOILERS AHEAD.***SPOILER ALERT*** We find out that the Boy "dies" in a fire once upon a time ago. And for some reason the parents pick up have this doll that they believe the Boy has possessed (or something to that nature). And after hanging around for a while, new nanny-girl begins to believe as well. We find out in the end, after ex-husband/boyfriend who just shows up one night (because movie, and release-boy-ex machina), breaks the doll's head. The Boy decides to reveal himself and it turns out he's really alive. And...yeah that's the twist. Nanny-girl kills him in the end, because he was being mean and killed ex-husband/boyfriend, and hurt friend Malcolm. We aren't told why he's been hiding for so long, or how he even got to the place he was in now. It just kind of...is. ***END OF SPOILERS***This script is very poor, and so loose that the twist, that should really be a pretty good one, helps in making the movie all the more confusing. The whole movie hinges on this twist (because nothing else is very interesting), and when it is revealed, it just asks more questions than it answers, and don't expect those to be explained to you either because once the twist occurs, end of the movie is close by. I will give the movie this though. At times the cinematography was good and creepy. It's use of colors (when it does use them to it's advantage)helps. I do like the performances, I don't have any issues there. But there is just wasted opportunities and wasted characters. And a twist that really makes the movie a muddy, uninteresting mess. I'm giving this one a 4/10. Normal audiences will probably find this to be an okay scary flick. I for one, just don't see the need for it's existence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this a few nights ago and quite enjoyed it. However, I felt the twist robbed the film of its initial edge. With further reflection, it's actually a rather clever plot that works well.Brahms himself is a nicely designed prop - innocent and malevolent in equal measure, though he remains an inanimate doll throughout. Cohan's performance is solid, though I felt the script could have explored the theme of isolation and paranoia a little more.Overall, this is a welcome addition to the haunted house/creepy doll genre and packs a coherent twist by the end. Creepy and thought-provoking - well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greta (Lauran Cohan 'The Walking Dead') is running away from a past she is yet ready to face up to and has left her native USA for the 'balmy' climes and eccentricities of being a nanny in England. Once she arrives she is taken to a truly inspiring country pile where she is to meet Brahms who is to become her new charge.However, what she encounters is far from a conventional nanny job as Brahms is a doll. Despite this his doting parents act as if he were a real child. His father is played by the marvellous Jim Norton who you may remember as Bishop Brennan in 'Father Ted'. The only voice of sanity seems to come from Malcolm (Rupert Evans 'The Man in the High Castle') who is the local shop owner who delivers the groceries and kindly advice on a regular basis. Then the past and the present get caught up as things get very unsettling very quickly.Now I love a good psychological thriller and so for me this ticks quite a few boxes, The acting is all great and the effects are actually very effective, this is not a slasher horror or anything though and it does trade on the twists so is one to see but only really once. All in all a very good and in many ways accomplished Brit 'Horror' flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Babysitting meets eerie pretense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young American woman Greta (Lauren Cohan) travels to the remote estate of a prosperous British couple (Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle) to become the nanny for the Heelshire family's 8-year-old boy. Greta discovers that the "boy" she is to look after is actually a life-sized doll named Brahms. The couple leave a strict list of rules to be used in taking care of the doll, that is being treated as their real son that died 20 years ago. Greta will have nightmares as she interprets events proving the doll to be a real flesh-and-blood boy.This eerie tale builds slowly, but erupts frantically. A better than you thought chiller. This mildly disturbing film was filmed in British Columbia, Canada and has the proper atmosphere for suspense. Also in the cast: Rupert Evans, Ben Robson and Lily Pater. Brahms is played by James Russell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid horror movie watcher and film major in college, I felt inclined to write a review over this movie. Typical horror movies have become so overrated and easy to predict that they are painful to watch. They will ether be really good and then have a sucky ending, or they will just become cheesy... This movie however doesn't fit the format for the regular horror genre. I thought at first "this is about a doll, how can this movie not be cheesy?", but the more I watched, the more and more I got sucked in. The movie does have somewhat of a basic story line, but you establish a connection with the main characters and it's easy to follow. It doesn't follow the format of horror movies IE: the jump scare rule of thirds, dark scenes, etc. You can actually see everything that's happening without any terrible dark scenes and poor lighting. I think "The Boy" is an all around good movie and a must see for horror movie fans! It has taken on a new twist and it took complete advantage of it! It had a wonderful twist mid movie and... THE END DIDN'T SUCK! The movie is creepy and has plenty of jump scares. It does its job of scaring you without a lot of special effects, blood, gore, etc. Horror movies today are such a disappoint and this one (at least for me) was not. I would advise anyone who is looking for a good movie to check this one out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will be short and contain no spoilers about the story itself. I rated this movie with an eight because honestly I didn't really see much wrong with the film. The character development was mostly good, the story developed to be much better than I expected, the acting, editing, lighting, sound, everything was just better than I figured.The film does start off a bit slow for about the first twenty minutes or so but it picks up and runs faster and gets far more intense and entertaining. The end of the film is great as well. I can't say weather it's really a horror film because it felt more like a thriller than anything. Truly, I expected this film to be another meh horror flick but it panned out to be much better and I do plan on buying it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A creepy doll film that's just not that creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American in England gets a job as a nanny only to discover the "child" in her care is a porcelain doll.Films with creepy dolls are nothing new and while The Boy offers a different approach, its lack of genuine tension becomes its downfall.Visually it sets a suitably eerie and claustrophobic tone, based mainly in an old English mansion, however it too often lets go, dropping you back into rather mundane conversations that jar with what the film is trying to achieve. To make matters worse a side story involving an old boyfriend feel particularly shoehorned in. He also has some laughably hammy lines.Eventually "things" do start to happen but just not enough to make the set-up worth the wait.If the idea of a genuinely scary doll film appeals may I recommend Magic with Anthony Hopkins. This perfectly paced 1978 horror film really draws you in. It is to creepy doll films what Halloween was to the slasher genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, I probably shouldn't have watched this at nearly 3 in the morning because you will have so many questions in your head so I ain't sleeping at all folks, haha!Anyways, I actually didn't find ?t scary but rather chilling and full of curious scenes. It's mind blowing that the fact, we thought the boy at first, was a spirit doll. However, we didn't realise that it turned out, he was stalking Greta at what she was doing to him and that we found out he was a serial killer all along! Man, you would really feel sorry for his parents. Crikey, it was so heartbreaking that they committed suicide together by drowning on a lake. I wish the movie concentrated on them too because I wanted to see if their bodies were found. I suppose they didn't bother to add more scenes, it would've been better but I think, the movie was more upsetting enough like.You would never look at dolls again seriously. I probably won't forget about this movie, it is thrillingly good. I would definitely suggest to any horror fan to watch this but, don't watch it at night, it will make your head spin like mine after watching it, lol!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or some boys never grow up. Which some would argue might have to do with the fact, that they aren't really boys in the common sense. But whatever you think of puppet horror movies, this has some things going for it. And it's far better than the Conjuring spin off (Annabelle), though that is not a tough task to be honest.We have beautiful leads (in the male and female department) and a very strange doll. A doll that seems to have a life of its own. Or does it? Well that is what we're here to find out. Of course someone could have warned the sitter about the situation, but where would the fun have been in her discovering on her own and laughing at the "parents" of said child? Exactly! Other than that we do have a suspenseful story that is being told, while not overly graphic. It received a 12-rating in Germany, which I think does apply well</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a watchable horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a slow-burn of a movie, especially for viewers that have seen a lot of horror movies. It just had all the similar formulaic creepy horror elements. If you have seen a movie about a creepy doll than you have practically seen everything in this except it's done in a slightly art-house manner. That is until the third act where the twist hits, which I gotta say I did not see coming. Now the actions of the female lead doesn't make much sense. "Hmm creepy old people living in a creepy house with a creepy boy doll...Yeah let's stick around a bit and stay alone at night. Oh I think I saw the doll move and creepy things start up around the house. Hmm I guess I will stick around a bit longer". You see where I am going with this, but they needed a plot device and the plot device being a woman doing things that doesn't make much sense at all. As a matter of fact just about everything about this movie just came off really far-fetched. But again this is a horror movie after all. Although there are horror movies that actually stands out this just isn't one of them. It's however a slow-burn of a movie but I still found it watchable. I thought the cinematography and few details were well done.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When a nanny meets a boy who is a weird toy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is the other 'The Boy'. The last year film was a thriller- drama, but this is a horror-mystery. It feels like watching a classic horror film, especially because of the English atmosphere and the house where it was shot. A young American woman named Greta, takes up a nanny job in England to escape from the troubled relationship with her boyfriend. She discovers the boy she has to look out is a doll and later she observes a series of strange events that leads her to find out the truth. The dark secret comes out and that's the film.A limited cast film. The suspense was the key to the story narrating successfully. So I expected a big twist at the end, but it was a decent one and the overall film was just above average. The atmosphere was creepy, and then it weakened as the development was decelerated going to the second and the final act. Until the twist, it was good and after that a bit disappointing. Not because of the bad conclusion, but comparing it with the rest, especially after the anticipation it created in us, that end part looked so small and simple. Good film to watch for once, but like the most of the horror films, it's fallen short to get my thumbs up.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than I Thought It Would Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some reservations about whether or not to review "The Boy." I had seen something similar before--the god-awful "Robert the Doll,"- - and I did not know whether or not this would be in the same vein as that train wreck was. I was pleasantly surprised.Greta, an American nanny, goes to London to escape her abusive boyfriend/stalker. She thinks she has taken a job to watch over a very young boy. She is immediately befriended by the local grocery delivery person, Malcolm.As soon as she arrives, weird things start to happen and one of those "things" includes who she will be taking care of. When she meets Brahms, she is shocked to say the least because he is a life size doll. She is given a strict set of rules and a schedule that must be met every day. These rules include waking Brahms precisely at 7:00 a.m., changing his clothes, listening to at least three hours of music, reading him poetry, and tucking him into bed. Once Brahms' parents leave for holiday, things really begin to ratchet up in the old estate."The Boy" will not win any awards for being great cinema. However, it is leaps and bounds better than some other movies I've recently seen. The director and those involved manage some to build some actual tension during the movie before the "big" reveal (nudge/nudge; wink/wink).Rated PG-13 for violence and language. As far as recommending the movie, that is a toss-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not your typical horror flick full with gore or red stuff let's even say some ghostly things. This is just a flick, like Annabelle (2014), about a doll.I can't really tell what it's all about but Greta (Lauren Cohan) appears as a nanny just to be surprised that she has to watch a doll. In the beginning nothing goes wrong but slowly she doesn't know if she's going mad or things are wrong with the doll. The acting is above mediocre and luckily for that because it's a slow mover. It wasn't that bad after all and it was great to see Lauren (Maggie from the Walking Dead) doing well. Not every geek will love this flick due it being low on everything but I must admit that it didn't bore me at all, you just want to know what's wrong with the doll.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll. After she violates a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive." The idea itself is just completely stupid, and the theater were thinking "WTF" when I saw it. But it actually is wonderfully filmed and wonderfully told that eventually by the end it all makes sense. The acting was okay. Lauren Cohan was the best thing about it. She made this bizarre story really realistic. The direction was good, the style of the whole movie was well portrayed. The cinematography was surprisingly good.The movie is a huge combination of others films such as "Child's Play" and "When A Stranger Calls." Strangely enough it is a weird combination, but it does work. The whole story starts out to give us the supernatural vibe...the doll moving...hearing voices and movement etc. It's all good, but the problem is...with this movie it gets old and boring rather quickly. That's where the main problem lies, it's the pace of the film. It all makes up for it by the end when the twist is revealed and it turns into a slasher flick. But, in the end, I just felt like it was rushed. It ended too fast. It's like they couldn't be bothered giving us more action for another 10 mins or so. Which is quite a disappointment.All in all...The Autistic Reviewers give this movie 3/5 stars. 6/10. It is acceptable and unique, but we felt it was a hugely missed opportunity. It could have been so much more. We would say go and see it on a rainy day or wait for it to come on TV.</fullReview>

But.... the Direction and performances are so darned solid you believe this is possible. She NEEDS the job badly and is running away from a bad situation in America. So hell why not take the job and just go along with it. What is the worst that could happen?The Boy is slow paced to start but compelling enough.... the first few jump scares are OK but jump scares are old hat and nothing new.The plot borrows many ideas from different horror films which I shall not name as it would spoil the little twist to come.... more than just a little twist actually! Some reviewers say the twist is absurd but I found myself going along with the last 30 minute ride and thoroughly enjoying it. Not perfect but polished nicely enough for a horror fan to enjoy. Creepy doll creepy movie and good to see a solid performance from Lauren Cohen proving she really can act outside of The Walking Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy really shines as a standalone horror flick. However, it is not original. The script owes a debt to three (possibly 4) old horror films. Two that are successful brands and the other, not well known at all but underrated. There are several glaring holes such as people being able to enter a house that would normally have been locked. There is also an unexplained scene concerning the Parents that I won't describe, since this is supposed to be a spoiler free review. For the budget, it is certainly worth a watch, and the scares are far better quality that the average slasher flicks. The pacing of the film is just right and the conclusion was neither ambiguous nor cheesy. The acting was perfect for a horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>27 January 2016 Film of Choice No 2 at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Boy A nice little horror/thriller with more emphasis on the thriller. A young woman is employed by an upper class English Couple to be nanny to their son Brahms, only thing is Brahms died and she is being employed to looked after a life size doll as if it were a real boy. What happens after the couple leave to go on holiday is a series of events governed by a list of instructions that must be followed. This wasn't edge of your seat scary, although some rather dramatic music at juuuuust the right moment led to several of my fellow cinema goers practically leaping out of their seats. A very small cast adds to the tension, coupled with a big old house, some mood lighting and lots of candles. I'm not that impressed by horror but this was a nice watchable film, which kept me out of the current rainstorm outside.</fullReview>

Besides the jump scares it also scares you by the rising suspense and I usually don't do this in horror films but me and my friend found each other covering ourselves because of the many suspenseful, amazing, and creepy scenes! The story and script are also great, so is the acting and shooting. Both great, Lauren Cohan was brilliant!

		<fullReview>The Boy is a movie about a porcelain doll. An American babysitter named Greta Evans(Lauren Cohan), travels all the way to England for her latest job. She's extremely bewildered when she finds out that, Mr. Heelshire(Jim Norton) &amp; Mrs. Heelshire's(Diana Hardcastle) son is a life-sized porcelain doll named, Brahms. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Heelshire tell Greta that, Brahms is very particular about certain things &amp; has a specific set of rules. These rules have to be compulsorily followed. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Heelshire believe that Brahms is a real boy. Greta agrees to all the conditions because, the Heelshires are paying her handsomely. However, when she carelessly avoids following the rules bizarre things start to happen in the house. After a couple of unexplained events, Greta slowly starts believing that, Brahms might actually be real. The Boy is a great film! The atmosphere created by director William Brent Bell is ominous &amp; sets the tone for a really unnerving experience. However, the film doesn't deliver what it promises at the start. There are several creepy set pieces in the movie but, none of the scenes in the film are terrifying. The jump scares in the film are so obvious that, the viewer can see them coming from a mile away. Despite all these minor flaws, The Boy is my favorite movie revolving around a possessed doll. It is way better than Annabelle(2014), which is the other most recent movie in this genre. The highlight of the movie is, the mind blowing plot twist in the end. Lauren Cohan is spectacular as Greta Evans. Cohan masterfully depicts Greta's growing vulnerability &amp; desperation throughout the film. Rupert Evans is brilliant as Malcolm. Jim Norton &amp; Diana Hardcastle are superb as Mr. Heelshire &amp; Mrs. Heelshire, respectively. Ben Robson is great as Cole. Jett Klyne is outstanding in his brief role as Brahms(Child). The Boy is a must watch for horror &amp; thriller movie buffs.</fullReview>

This movie actually is very scary and über creepy in many many scenes. The film was acted, and well casted too, all the actors really did fit their respective roles. And I was very happy that the jump scares weren't too over done or cheesy, they actually were pretty effective. The plot is so intriguing and well put together. The Boy really does pull the viewer in and makes you want more. This movie might not look like much from the previews or the commercials on television, but trust me, it's much more than you think. This movie is a really fun time for horror/psychological thriller fans. The script is also pretty well written, and the dialogue isn't cheesy or anything, like in some horror flicks. This movie is definitely worth a watch! I 100% recommend The Boy to everyone that is old enough to see it, and loves frightening thrillers. I also liked hoe they cut right to the chase, the very first scene is her arriving at the house to babysit, the filmmakers do not waste any time whatsoever. Sometimes that doesn't work, but for this one it did. 9/10 for The Boy. There's also a bit of a twist ending here, but I'm not telling.</fullReview>

She winds up at a Gothic manor home near an isolated village, to interview for what she thinks will be the job of caring for an 8-year-old boy. How is this even in horror.

		<fullReview>this movie sucks so bad. don't watch it. leaves many unanswered questions, no ending at all and nothing makes sense! at the end we understand that Braham was living inside the walls the whole time, he was the one moving the doll every time it was unwatched and he had everything he needed inside.. he used the crawl spaces and other hidden places to get around and his parents kept him hidden for about years since he was wanted for questioning about the little girl Brahama killed. it looks like his parents were scared of him and kept feeding him and protecting him and in the end they couldn't take anymore and drowned themselves. the movie gives no explanation what so ever about why he killed the little girl when he was a child, why his parents kept hiding him, what was the doll all about and why it was needed, how did the house shake when the doll was broken and the lights went crazy, and how Braham was never seen every time the doll was moved and he did stuff inside the house</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film during an impromptu sleepover. After having watched multiple trailers, this film piqued our interest. And for good reason, this film is crazy creepy. We meet a young woman, Gretta, who enlists herself to work as a babysitter for an elderly couple's son. Upon arriving, she meets Malcolm- the grocery boy/man. And eventually she meets the family- only to find that their son is actually a doll and they treat 'it' as a real person. Can you imagine? And her job, she decides is only too easy- there's nothing real to look after. No real person to feed, clothe- anything. Though the couple do expect her to fulfil a list of responsibilities: 'rules'. Does she?Of course not, why would she? There's no reason for it, right? Her responsibility is a doll. Ridiculous, but still an only too easy job. But is it really....? Just remember, everything is not what it seems. And maybe, it might be wise for Gretta to follow the rules- just maybe.While this film may not have been that horrifying, it was intriguing. I love anything with a twist, and I still have questions about it. After having a debate with heavily conflicted views regarding the little details of the film, with my buddies, we have concluded that this film may not always 'add up' and satisfy your curiosity. Nonetheless 'a fun, senseless, no right answer, built wholly on assumptions' debate after a film is worth everything.The four stars is only because I engaged in a long debate, and still have no answers! And because I was seeking a film that would give me nightmares, usually that's an easy feat for a film to accomplish- but not with this film. As much as a shame that was, the film was indeed enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cherie and Pois' verdict: Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cherie and Pois are a young, hip couple who enjoy netflix and chilling. Unfortunately, being "netflix and chill" veterans, we have quickly found ourselves looking long and hard for good films to watch. We stumbled across "The Boy" on a whim, having fiddled with the search filters on a definitely not pirated website. The following is our verdict.It was really good. Pois can tell when a film is really good, because if it isn't, Cherie tries to have sex with him. Pois has to bat her hand away. When it doesn't work, she goes to sleep. During "The Boy", Cherie neither tried to grab my willy, nor slept. That really does show the quality of this film.9/10 would watch again.Yours in earnest, Pois and Cherie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE BOY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A psychological horror flick; about a young woman that takes a new job as a nanny, only to discover that the child she's supposed to watch is a porcelain doll. The doll may or may not be a living boy, that haunts her. The film was directed by William Brent Bell (who also helmed 'THE DEVIL INSIDE'), and it was written by Stacey Menear. The movie stars Lauren Cohen and Rupert Evans. It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, but it has been mildly successful at the Box Office. I enjoyed it. A young woman, named Greta (Cohen), has been involved in an abusive relationship (in Montana). She takes a job as a nanny, in the United Kingdom, to get away. Upon meeting the boy though, she learns he's actually a porcelain doll. Apparently the couple she's working for, believe the doll is their son. When she's left home alone with the doll, mysterious things begin happening. The film is somewhat simple, and there's not a lot of action in it (or gore), but it is creepy (and even somewhat scary). I like the idea for the movie, and I think the filmmakers did a pretty good job bringing the story to life. I even look forward to seeing a sequel, or two, which the film is obviously set up for. I'd definitely recommend it to horror fans (at the very least).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/176638264</fullReview>

I thought it was original but the way it was done didn't surprise me much, I even forwarded the movie a little bit at one point. I didn't like the girl very much, I couldn't feel anything during the movie, get into the story, feel compassion with a character; nothing, it was like... emotionless. What feels strange is that I usually love this kind of things. Old castles, old and mysterious people not giving all the informations, old furniture and creepy dolls. It's usually one of my favorite things. I don't understand what happened with this one. I thought it was tasteless. Plus, the story-line appeared completely absurd and illogical to me. I tried, the idea was great, the decor was beautiful but I didn't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally a good, old-fashioned horror movie that works! Are there only me who think there are too few good horror movies around? I often find the quality poor, and the story line thin and weak in recent horror films that are made. Therefore, this film a welcome positive surprise. I'll make this review short and of course not reveal any of the action. If you like to sit down with popcorn on the sofa and watch horror movie, then you can safely rent this movie. It is well made. And the casting is very good.The film is pretty scary, and will give you some shocks under viewing. The film manages to have the elements of a classic horror film, but also manages to take it a bit further. There is also a surprising and exciting finish. Excellent movie choice a late night, in other words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first it was so interesting in the first 30 minutes I was excited, but then it became a little boring and slow, and the ending was not as expected and turned out dull and silly. Anyway I recommend watching it especially if you like horror movies. Its a little bit different and new idea. I think this movie is similar to (housebound), they have the similar events. But housebound in my opinion is so much better if like comedy. Actors' performance was good but there were few characters which, I think, made the movie slow. It was better to concentrate on what happened in the past and how Brahms was then, and how it all started, many questions if had been answered the story could have been so much better. Pictures and effects were very good. I enjoyed this movie but didn't like the ending so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well shot and scored however doesn't really deliver.Unfortunately the majority of the scares that this movie generates are within dream sequences. This is usually the tell of a movie that, within the conscious world of the movie itself, will bring minimal surprises. I had the story picked within 18 minutes which is where ALL of the key explanations are revealed.instructions that food was not to be wasted (he would have been eating them after they were disposed of in the trash bags), music was to be played loud (so he could hear it through the walls) as well as books being read loudly. That, along with the parents having a son that 'died' at the age of 8 and that he liked to play games.I spent the remainder of the movie waiting on the reveal which was done quite poorly.Unfortunately very obvious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror movie filled with wasted potential.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy (2016) is a horror movie filled with wasted potential. I went into 'The Boy' expecting a cliché, jump-scare ridden, pile of garbage horror movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this movie actually created some tension. The acting was nothing amazing, but it wasn't terrible. Lauren Cohan does a good job leading the film, but her performance is restrained. Director William Brent Bell does a great job creating a creepy atmosphere. The problems in the film lie with the script. The dialogue in the film is very subdued, and there are no truly memorable lines. The ending of the film may seem stirring at first, but upon reflection, it doesn't match up with the rest of the film. The ending brings forth a concept that doesn't make sense in comparison to the rest of the film. 'The Boy' is not dreadful, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boy" is an okay thriller of sorts. The production values are good, the performances are acceptable, and throughout there is a genuine light creepy feel. Still, I think the screenplay should have been handed back for another rewrite or two, for two reasons:(1) The movie is considerably padded out. The movie has a few too many scenes of the heroine wondering if the doll is alive or not, as well as some lengthy bits where little to no effort is placed in advancing the plot. If the movie had been cut by fifteen to twenty minutes, I thinkit would have moved better.(2) The surprise revelation. Now, I will admit that I didn't see the revelation coming. But when the revelation came, for the remainder of the movie I couldn't help but realize that certain nagging details concerning what had been going on all of this time were not answered. The more that you'll think about it, the more questions will come up in your mind.Flawed as this movie is, I'll admit I've seen worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as you would expect, it had next to no real scares and plenty of Hollywood clichés.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It could be that the quality is getting worse or it could be down to the fact that I have seen so many over the years, but Mainstream, Hollywood horror movies just don't seem to give me any real scares anymore. This however doesn't stop me actively looking out for and watching them as they are released, there is something I find satisfying about watching horror movies at night, irrelevant of their quality. I saw the promos for The Boy late last year; it was a January release which by recent history would put it in the category of rubbish. However that didn't stop me watching this and I was secretly quite looking forward to it!The plot is different, yet basic: A wealthy, elderly English couple hire a young, attractive American live-in Nanny to look after their son. Their son however isn't a boy, he is a doll. The couple talk about, talk to and generally treat the doll as if he were a living boy. Of course the Nanny finds this peculiar but cautiously goes along with it as they are paying her well. As you would expect, things start to happen once the couple leave to go on a trip and leave the Nanny home alone in this huge house with the only the doll for company. Now, if there is one thing Hollywood Horror movies have taught us over the years, it's that we are to expect clichéd jump scares. These aren't scary but they do make you jump, it's only natural for them to do so. The Boy did contain jump scares but I really didn't think they were that well done, I don't remember a scene where I actually jumped or was taken by any real surprise. If there is anything worse than jump scares, its attempted jump scares which fail! The film does however focus heavily on building suspense, each scene adds to this. A big positive I would give this movie is that it didn't reveal anything early on that would have ruined the suspense. Of course we know that the doll won't be as it seems, it's a horror film, nothing is ever as it seems but they did work at it to ensure that we are kept guessing well into the final third of the movie.The plot twist was unexpected, as the film built I had another theory of what was going to happen and I was way off the mark. I'm not saying that the twist is ground-breaking, I'm sure plenty of people did see it coming but I was expecting something else completely. After the final scenes I was able to think back to early scenes and realise why certain things were said and done, this added a little bit more depth to the story and a few things did link up nicely.The acting and script was what you would expect from a movie of this genre, it was all passable enough with nothing that stands out as impressive. The sets, props and filming locations were all well done and added to the atmosphere and realism successfully.Overall, The Boy was average but ultimately offered very few scares for me and I found the twist to be a little underwhelming, even if it was unexpected. I watched this on a rainy night after a few beers and it was a decent enough way of passing 90 minutes or so.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh boy...this is not a horror and not a good thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some hope for this one bit it's just another use of the horror genre to fool the audience.The whole set up with the doll was boring and all the rules seem to be filler to make this part longer. The elderly couple takes a third of the movie to explain the whole story and then leave and in that time there gets a bit of mystery added to the story.Another third the girl is alone in the house and the mystery of the "moving by itself when it's not seen"doll becomes more clear.The big reveal is stupid about someone living between the walls(people under the stairs)and moves the doll around. When you see this guy you're wandering how he stayed so quiet all the time.So that's the last third of the movie and is also the point I thought about stopping with watching this movie. I finished it anyway maybe it would have an intense chase scene but they even couldn't give me that.Conclusion,I don't like movies like this,I like the actress in "the walking dead"but this a bad choice as a start on the big screen.I still think she can do better but than in a different genre or even a better horror story.Also,was I the only person not getting, why he was moving the doll around?I recommend this for some people,the production value isn't bad and maybe you like PG horror/thriller than it will work well for you. If you're a horror fan like me you probably will not like it.A misleading movie.Horror-ish?LOL(with a Chuckie chuckle)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not really scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I can say I went to see this movie just for the sake of going to movies. I saw the trailer once before, but I didn't really remember much. The only thing I knew about this movie is that it's a horror movie and involves a creepy doll.My expectations weren't high at all so I wasn't disappointed, but I didn't love it either. It was entertaining, but there was only one scary scene in a movie and the rest wasn't scary at all. But the third act was pretty intense. Intense, but not scary. The movie ends up being more of a thriller, than a horror. And not even the jumpscares made me jump. I just sat there motionless. For the first half, the plot isn't going anywhere and most of the "scary" scenes were just the main character's nightmares. Then the plot finally starts to move in the second half and it gets really intense when the movie comes to it's third act. There is a plot twist at the end, but I was expecting it from the very beginning. I didn't expect what will happen, but I knew there was going to be a plot twist at the end. It just felt like it. And it's pretty cool when you're watching it, but when you think about it you realize that it's kinda dumb and a lot of stuff is left unexplained. But the villain of this movie, Brahms, is awesome. Especially in the last 15 minutes, those who saw the movie will know why. And I think if this gets a sequel (I hope it doesn't turn out to be a joke like the most horror sequels), Brahms could become a new horror icon. Kinda like Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger... Too bad the writers didn't think a little about the plot twist.But if you are going to watch this movie for entertainment, you'll be pleased. It's nothing special, but you won't feel like you wasted 90 minutes of your life for nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this after seeing the trailer. The trailer definitely had me excited because it didn't seem like it was going to be a typical horror movie. It definitely was not typical. It was pretty good overall. The acting was really good. Usually in horror movies the acting is either way over the top, or just so annoying you start hating the characters halfway through. It had a few little scares here and there. They were usually subtle and left me wondering what is going on, which is what the movie was going for. I doubt here would be a sequel, which is probably a good thing. Too many horror movies go on way too long with unnecessary sequels. I can't say I plan to watch it again, but it was worth seeing.</fullReview>

Yes the whole "living dolls" thing has been done a number of times before but it still drew me in enough to want to see it.Without giving away too much of the plot it feels like a standard creepy horror outing for a while until things start to turn towards the end. Still the environment (creepy mansion, complete with tacky taxidermy dotted around) is well done giving a nice background into how the weird old couple live. Musical score was OK, though I don't remember anything jumping out at me.Overall for someone who doesn't normally go in for horror films, I'd recommend this to both fans of typical horror and those who don't usually partake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BOY (2016) ** Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, James Russell, Jim Norton, Diana Hardcastle, Ben Robson, Jett Klyne. Meandering and familiar thriller involving a haunted doll with beguiling Cohan as a hired nanny of sorts for an elderly eccentric couple's 'child' - a boy in the form of a spooky doll. Cohan's mix of intrigue and innocence makes her character full-fledged (as well as an expected back story as to why she continues to stay in her new situation). A few new slants in the script by Stacy Menear and able direction by William Brent Bell keeps the fairly predictable plot chugging along with some nice twists and John Willett's impeccable production design conveys the eerie atmosphere intact perfectly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Boy" benefits from atmospheric visual, hissing audio and twisting narrative to make it more alive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an appeal on how the movie creates an expectation to what kind of horror it may present, then turns it around with playful change in direction. It might not be all too shocking or innovative, yet the clever shift coupled with nice backdrop of quaint village setting serve as a nice foray into mystery thriller. It does however, possesses occasional conflicting tones that might undermine the tension from its enigmatic theme.Greta (Lauren Cohen) is offered a job on rural English and it comes as a surprise to her that the job entailed is much stranger than she previously thought. While this might seem like a deal-breaker, the money is good enough to make her stick around. After a short moment there she finds strange occurrences happening to her, some of which are alarmingly eerie.The movie is at its best when it provides a mysterious vibe. It makes audience wonder whether this is a supernatural haunting, a psychological breakdown or sinister curse. The visual for "The Boy" itself is ominously creepy while the audio plays a good role in creating the suspense. It's often the visual and audio clues that create a lingering sense of curiosity, perhaps even more effective than some of its actual scares.Its flaws reside on the tired occurrences of "Is it a dream?" gimmick, which accompanied by a couple of lackluster jump scares. This is also a movie with a small cast, while the actors perform appropriately for most parts, there are some moments where the change of tone seems too jarring and might even ruin the immersion.A few hiccups from the jolting pace aside, "The Boy" has assortments of amusing tricks and mysteriously creepy production to play with delightful horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such potential wasted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh man, I just cannot seem to catch a break with horror movies lately.Quite frankly, The Boy bored me. The beginning was intriguing and the ending fast-paced (kind of too much, not sure if I really got what had happened) but, in between, there just seemed to be a whole lot of nothing. The main character's evolution is one example of why I found the movie unappealing. There was no cohesion.The story starts with a quirky couple about to leave, supposedly on vacation, so they hire a nanny to take care of their son, who turns out to be a doll. There is a list of tasks she must perform with the doll everyday or bad things will happen. At least that's what the trailed led me to believe.For me, the highlight of the movie was precisely watching that couple and how each handled the doll. The entire set was lovely as well, both the house and the few surroundings we get to see.Even though the film had its moments, there isn't nearly as much suspense as I had hoped. Or rather, it felt like all the suspense's resolution was saved till the end, in a sequence that came across as jumbled and nonsensical.SPOILER: First of all, why would that ridiculous list matter? I found no connection to the way the plot developed at all. Seems to me like things were bound to go bat crazy at any point, list following or otherwise. Also, if Brahms was really an adult, how come she heard a kid's voice every now and then? Calling her name, so it couldn't be a recording from the past. And finally, was there anything supernatural about the guy at all? The mask was all sparkly and he seemed inhumanely strong but the story seems to point towards him living locked up his whole life in the walls of the house. The supernatural strength doesn't really make much sense, does it? END SPOILERIf I am going to wait that long to have resolution, it better make me drop my jaw. It didn't. Not even close.I just cannot recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to take a movie about a "haunted" doll seriously after so many Child's Plays, and so many ripoffs (Annabelle was awful) This was my main apprehension about seeing The Boy, which I'll admit peaked my interest when it likely shouldn't have. I fell for the same trap recently with The Forrest and can't put into words how disappointing an experience that was. The Boy starts off slow, allowing you to take in just how odd the situation our protagonist finds herself in is. Once things do start to happen that are out of the ordinary they've very subtle, and I found the pacing kept me interested and anticipating what would happen next. One of the best aspects about the film is the eventual twist, which at no point did I even consider, and was pleasantly surprised by.As a fan of original concepts I can safely recommend The Boy, which puts a refreshing twist on a very dated concept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A raw review from a true horror fan who hate's movies with this kind of turn-out that was popular in the early 2000's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, was amazing! The way the movie turned out ( the twist) was exactly how horror's from 2000 to maybe 2005 were like which was never my kind of taste (not going to give it away). Usually those movies really let me down, with the way those movies revealed the twist. But there was something about this one, that made me really enjoy the movie &amp; the twist (which the way it turned out is usually not my kind of turn-around) with the way they revealed it, was vastly compelling and well done. Acting, story, cinematography, editing, sound design &amp; the structure &amp; use of movie running time was all well done. If you expect this to be a jump-scare horror you will be vastly disappointed. But it's amazing for what it was. It ends leaving you still with a chill though. A very rich mystery- suspense-horror with a few good jump scares, and some unpredictable moments. Keeps you on the edge of your seat from at least the first 20 minutes until the end. Right when you think the movie couldn't make your hair jump anymore, the last 25 minutes get's even more intense than expected. I am so sick of seeing viewers complaining about how we have way too much paranormal/possession movies over the last couple years; well here you go with the Boy. You get something a bit towards it...but not really. Go see it in theaters and enjoy. :) Very unexpected, original, keeps you on the edge of your seat. What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*** SPOILER (very minimal) ***Let me just start by saying that I really loved the movie.The ending was obviously the best part because it was really unexpected and it came out of nowhere. Most people that I asked in the movie theater where I watched also thought that the movie was something that they didn't expect to happen and it was good.There were also a lot of jump scares and I really enjoyed it.Another best part is when the nanny truly understands the old couple and started to be associated and felt responsible to take care of the doll, that was a very sweet and emotional moment.If I rate it --- 78%</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the horror movie have Asian named on the movie, that's when you will jump off the chair while watching it, spooky as hell. The Boy brings us into the two dimension between real or just "our imagination". The Doll drives us crazy, makes our heart pounds. My tips, just follow the movie without making any conclusion until the movie ends. Some scenes are make you sh*t your pants, and another one just make you questioning.For those who loves the doll so much, you have to watch this movie. The first part they make us believe that there's a spirit inside the Brams doll, and when the twist's start it will ruins all the conclusion that u made fall apart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. I'd heard really good reviews but didn't expect to love it as much as I did. I was expecting a very run of the mill 'Annabelle' style doll movie but this was 10 times better. Has a good twist which I didn't expect, at which point brings the movie into excellent. The second the score began at the beginning of the film, I was loving it. Awesome creepy music. The lead actress from 'The Walking Dead' is amazing and plays the part perfectly, I think we'll be seeing a lot of her in the future. The whole movie you will spend trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I felt that the mid section of the movie starts to fall a little flat but that only makes the twist even more brilliant. I watched the final part of the movie with my jaw wide open. I recommend you see this movie, in the cinema if possible. If you're a horror fan and have been disappointed in the lack of decent movies as of late, you're gonna love this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good stuff and worth the price of a ticket. Who doesn't like a doll that may have more going for it that one would suppose? Adding to the suspense is the supporting characters and how they have a daily routine with this doll that must be adhered to. It is even written down so there is no misunderstandings or forgetfulness. After a few minutes of setting up the movie, you become riveted to the screen and are eager to hear every word because you don't want to miss out on what is going on and what is about to go on. The plot and story allows you to focus because the premise is solid. It's about the doll and that is enough to make the audience susceptible to the whole concept as it unravels at a nice pace with some good goose-bumping thrown in. The audience was caught off guard more than once. The only relief one can have is if they are eating popcorn kernel by kernel to regulate the blood pressure of the viewer. I would have liked it to last another half hour but I am not complaining. See this with a friend so you can discuss it afterwards. No cell phones or bathroom breaks. No talking either just watch &amp; breath slowly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good suspense but bad twists.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie takes a not-so-original concept of a creepy, possibly possessed doll but does a fine job in doing so. The movie was not awful like other early year horror movie, and makes some good and some bad choices in its direction and storytelling.On the positive side, there is a creepy enough atmosphere in the movie and it does succeed to create genuine suspense. There are no false jump scares (meaning if there is a scare, it's from something that should actually elicit fear) and the acting is pretty good.However, there are a few negative points. The first are the dream sequences; there are two of them, and at this point dream sequences are pretty much always a gimmick, and add nothing to the film. It creates a false scare, which means that we can become desensitized to real scares in the rest of the movie. The ending (although a valiant effort at a cool twist) ends up making no sense when you think back on past events, and is incoherent.All in all, it was a enjoyable and was better than I thought it would have been. The director made some interesting decisions, some that paid off and some that did not. At least some attention from the cast and crew went into this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really can't understand the high rating review , did I watch another movie ?? the boy was just a crap I want my money and time back !!The story is about Greta a miserable 30-year-old American woman who is going to England to be a nanny to a country retro family's son (Brahms) and find out that it's a just a life-sized doll that the parents care for just like a real boy , and this doll is actually moving !!!!Do you find the story is great ? Yes ? OK read this- of course you are expecting a great horror movie about a frightened woman who is struggling to save her life from this psychopath doll , but the movie is actually about a woman who is afraid of the doll at the beginning but become weirdly obsessed with this doll and loved the idea of the moving doll .I may don't know your name but I'm sure you will lose your sh*t if you found out that you live at the same place with a moving doll !!!- If this psychopath boy is totally alive why he needed to live in this doll all this years and just waiting for this doll to be destroyed to kill people ?!!!- So the happy ending that Greta and her new love interest Malcolm succeed to run away from the evil Brahms , what about "Cole" who was just wanted to get back to his girlfriend but got killed ?!!- If Brahms is still alive and still going strong and re-do the Doll again , how he will pick his new Nanny (victim) again if his parents committed suicide ??!Really you should save your money and time and don't waste it in watching this trash !

		<shortDescription>The Boy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess that the "evil doll" sub-genre surged due to the natural aversion many people have against toys with a human shape, which are supposedly designed for children, even though they end up being more sinister than amusing. And, in horror cinema, this concept covers a wide range of situation, including the classic doll which comes to life and terrifies its owners (Child's Play, Dolls), the inert doll which works as a catalyst of supernatural phenomena (Annabelle, The Conjuring), or the doll which represents some way of psychological or emotional dysfunction (Magic, May). The Boy is a combination of all those variants, and even though the quality of the mixture occasionally fluctuates, I found it entertaining thanks to William Brent Bell's efficient direction and the competent performances from the whole cast, starting by Lauren Cohan in the leading role; her character isn't very well written, and she's assigned a turbulent past which will unavoidably come back in order to terrify her in the most absurd way. However, Cohan shows conviction and enthusiasm in her role, and she credibly transmits her character's initial skepticism in order to later voluntarily submit herself to the bizarre rules required by the care of the doll. And even though Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle have a limited screen-time, they bring an appropriately arrogant attitude to their characters. Regarding the "horror", The Boy achieves good moments of tension, but the final twist is too predictable, something which decreases the impact of the whole story. Nevertheless, The Boy kept me entertained, and it creates an appropriate atmosphere of tension and uneasiness. In conclusion, The Boy has enough pros to deserve a moderate recommendation... even though it's not a particularly memorable experience. In other words, it's decent enough to spend some time, but it's quickly forgettable because it's nothing exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy (2016) * 1/2 (out of 4) American nanny Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan) takes a job in Britain so that she can escape an abusive boyfriend but soon after accepting the job she realizing this isn't your typical babysitter position. Instead of taking care of a real child she is paid to look after a life-like doll and pretty soon she begins to think that it's actually alive.I must admit that I'm a little surprised that THE BOY has gotten so many positive reviews because I found it to be rather lame in most spots. I think there's a great movie here but sadly it is buried behind a bunch of cheap and rather annoying jump scares that are never actually scary.There are moments in the film where it actually works and this is when there's more of a psychological nature where we really don't know if the doll is alive or if perhaps the nanny is just losing her mind. I couldn't help but think how much better this aspect would have been but THE BOY is a PG-13 rated horror film meant to shock and scare teenagers so obviously they need jump scares. As I said, none of the scares are every scary and it should come as no shock that the majority of them are silly dream sequences.Another problem with this film is that there's really not enough atmosphere to make anything else all that creepy. The film basically takes elements of CHILD'S PLAY, ANNABELLE, THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and BAD RONALD and puts it into a blender. The only problem is that it's just not all that good. I thought Cohan and Rupert Evans were good in their roles but this can't save the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems in today's world, you will see many high ratings on this movie. I wish I knew what it was that people saw, but then again, I'm not sure I'd want to step into a mind of someone who liked this movie. The only highlight was not from the movie, but rather, when someone ripped one mid-way in the theater - I presume to show their disgust for the stupidity playing out. The trailer will paint a different picture than what you will imagine this movie to be; however, for some movies, that is OK - just not for this movie. This one left me feeling ripped off. I cannot tell you how many times this movie made me start laughing over the absurd and non logical transitions of the characters' behaviors and the realizations that make you think - you've got to be kidding. I suppose if there are people liking this movie, there must be people as crazy as the characters in the movie. I went to see a horror movie but instead feel like I watched a drama or thriller that contained little to no real suspense. In a way, I'm embarrassed for the cast as this was just terrible. If you're drowning in Hollywood for roles, I can understand they had to pick up something. I wouldn't want this on my movie resume' but we all have bills to pay.</fullReview>

I don't think people from Hollywood can remember how to make a good scary film these days. The only good horror movies worth watch that are newer are Insidious, Sinister, and the Ring.

		<fullReview>I do not want to spend much time giving this sad excuse for a movie a review however, I would like to encourage anyone thinking of seeing this "horror /thriller" to reconsider. Choose any other movie and do not waste your time or money on this atrocity. It lacks the following-originality, intensity, mystery, horror, gore etc. the ending is almost laughable...reminiscent of a CSI episode, which I am pretty sure is where the writer stole his idea for the "twist "at the end of the film. The only jolt I got during this entire movie happened close to the beginning and sadly failed to keep me interested throughout... continuously disappointing. It did not have a climatic point and some of the scenes were just completely stupid, lacking any logic. The acting wasn't horrible. The main problem came from a lack of excitement or intensity which made this movie a serious flop in my mind.Terrible terrible terrible, oh Maggie you Should stick to the walking dead!</fullReview>

I mean how do you sum up a film in two or three sentences, you really can't.This movie is not great, but it is not bad at all. When we think of horror films nowadays, there really is nothing that has not been done. I will not post spoilers but when you are finished with this film, you will see many parts that were borrowed from other earlier films.The acting was not bad at all, pretty believable in most scenes. It does have the typical large English mansion and rainy dark nights thing going on, which is not very frightening - but more of a thriller I would say.The ending should have been wrapped up a little cleaner, but it wasn't that bad.In all this would be a fun movie to watch on a dark windy night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I never really understood in horror movies:why when the hero/heroine enters a creepy house, sees a creepy doll, weird things start happening, hear weird noises, etc, why the HELL they don't get out of there. Then again, if they did, I guess there wouldn't be much of a movie. The Boy tries to be a haunted house movie, and a killer doll movie at the same time, and I think this is its greatest pitfall. If it had chosen one or the other, it could have been so much better than the final product turned out to be. This movie relies too heavily on jump scares, therefore not making it a truly horrifying movie. You know the kind. Things suddenly slam shut, something's standing behind someone when it wasn't two seconds ago, are they dreaming or not moments, etc. I give this movie credit for trying to be scary, but it falls flat. At heart, it wants to be another Annabelle, Child's Play, Dead Silence, etc all, but it just.doesn't have the substance or genuine scares that those better movies had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but not terrible either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It tried something new. The ending gave me hope for the horror genre, but I wouldn't say that it's a good movie.The movie centers around character development, atmosphere, and a plot twist to make it's film stand out. The character of Greta is shown in the film to be a scared character who is trying to escape from her problems and is dealing with her own issues in an unhealthy manner. The film acknowledges this with exposition that is never in the face of the audience. The film doesn't try to force feed the audience with information just laid out on a silver platter.She develops more and more as a character as the film goes on, and is given that ultimate test in the ending where she must choose her decision on her own and face the consequences of her actions.I wish I could say more for the other characters, as everyone just seems bland, one dimensional, and forgettable. Malcolm is the pretty faced, charming neighbor. Cole is the abusive boyfriend. The couple is just strict and played off as weird. Greta is the only character that actually was well developed.The cinematography and lighting is beautiful. The set is well made and it really gives the movie a dark and creepy atmosphere. Which is a shame as the scares in the movie are predictable and minimal. The movie serves more as a drama or thriller for how the scares can be.The ending, without spoiling, threw me off and I had my jaw dropped in the theater. I did not expect this kind of twist and had a blast at the last few minutes of the movie.However, because of plot twists, it forces the audience to reflect on the entire film and see things through a different light since the movie shows you the truth. And frankly, nothing ends up making sense. A lot of situations feel as though they could have been avoided. Certain creepy elements ended up making no sense, such as wouldn't there have been more noise in such an empty and quiet house? This movie is not good by any means. The pros of the movie are enough for me to say that it was not "terrible", but it is then overwhelmed with the problems of the film.I'm giving it a four out of ten for at least trying something new. A plot twist that would make audiences have higher expectations for more horror films. Characters that don't seem so bland and one dimensional. It tried. That's the best I can give it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Star of the show is the pediophobia Brahms doll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Montana woman, Greta, gets a temporary job as a nanny and to her surprise is paid to look after a porcelain doll, which is treated like a living child by his parents. Director William Brent Bell offers a creepy tale with plenty of shock scares. The typical British James Herbert-like setting of a large British aristocratic home with mature gardens adds to the sinister atmosphere. Lauren Cohan's performance is excellent as Greta. As things go bump in the night with objects seemingly moving around reminiscent of Child Play, Dolly Dearest and Annabel to name a few, Cohan sells the fear factor. Bell 's production is polished, aided by its sound design, Bear McCreary's score (who appears to be knocking them out in his sleep) and Brian Berdan's editing add to the pace and atmosphere throughout. Written by Stacey Menear, Greta's back story and motivations are believable but it leads to a somewhat inevitable Cape Fear-esque appearance by Cole, Greta's ex, played by Ben Robson. Rupert Evans gives a great understated performance as as Malcolm thanks to Delay's dialogue. Still grieving for their son, both Jim Norton as Mr. Heelshire and Diana Hardcastle s Mrs. Heelshire are delightfully creepy and emulate the odd couple in Dolls (1987) as their intentions are tragically revealed. Notable are the scenes where Greta demonstrates Brahms' ability to move by himself to Malcolm and when Greta is locked in the attic by an unseen force.Although the lath reveals the house is state-side and not British, the excellent interiors and grounds really sell it. As with my incessant mention of other films it covers a lot of horror tropes. Those familiar with Housebound (2014) and an array of others will see the twist coming a mile off. If anything the rushed and jarring reveal takes away the suspense and tension finely built by Bell in the first three quarters with a Halloween masked phantom closing. That said, to Bell's credit the ghoul remains masked retaining The Boy's mystery. But the star of the show is the Brahms doll, which is just plain unnerving. Those with pediophobia may want to avoid this at all costs but for the rest of us it's a solid horror thriller that works best when its honing the psychological aspect and delivering jump scares.</fullReview>

As a horror it ain't much, since it's more of the usual, but it does measure its movements to not be as corny as many other genre examples. As a creepy thriller it's not that bad, but it'll just scare impressionable viewers. The way the story turns, in the end, is half predictable and not too lazy, but still nothing original or effectively haunting. For a way better watch, I strongly suggest "The Orphanage" (2007) which is a much better story and has everything this does not.</fullReview>

She's also trying to escape an abusive relationship, which figures into the plot late in the movie in a really unbelievable way. Honestly, a lot of this movie's plot is unbelievable but you stick with it because Cohan is likable and you are dying to know what the deal is with the doll. When the truth is finally revealed, you'll likely find yourself laughing instead of being afraid. It's an entertaining enough movie of its kind, by-the-numbers up until the ridiculous twist. But the twist being ridiculous at least gives you something to remember the movie for. Otherwise it's kind of forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy is a really, really stupid so-called horror flick which starts off with an intriguing premise, before mining every cliché possible out of the old left-alone-in-a-spooky-house scenario and finally sputtering out with a completely formula ending.With only five cast members, you'd think they'd at least give each one an original personality, but sadly no. You have the woman in peril running away from a tragic past, the grocery boy who happens to be a bit of a hunk, the possessive ex with a fierce looking beard and 'tache, and the old couple with something to hide. Boring, boring, boring.I don't care how low your budget is Mr Director, I'm sure you can do a lot better than this. Moving things between shots, and strange noises in the background does not a creepy flick make. I ended up not caring about any of these characters, not frightened in the slightest and checking my phone during the l-o-n-g drawn out scenes. But hey, nice carving job on Ken.</fullReview>

The leading actress from the walking dead acted well but her character was the usual self obsessed type that you're supposed to feel sorry for. If you wanted a thriller fine but a Horror not really. The plot didn't make that much sense either with why the parents would do such a thing to begin with if they're only going to kill themselves anyway.Also the doll had a boys voice so Im not sure how anyone over the age of 14/15 would manage such a voice anyway (maybe a girl could). So overall I would say a poor horror but a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words can't describe how awful this movie was...but I'll try. First off, there was nothing original about the plot, except the last 15 minutes when we find out that Brahms is not a spirit. He is actually a burned, maniacal man-child living in the walls, killing young girls and dictating the rules of the house. The doll was creepy, yes, but not at all scary. There was no sense of suspense, danger, fear, or "Oh God, what's gonna happen next?" The acting was very sub-par; cardboard cutouts reading ridiculous dialog. The sets, music and camera work were not at all ominous. Oh, you want clichés? How about a girl in the shower being stalked? A rainy night? A shadow on the wall? A telephone that keeps ringing and no one is there? Getting locked in the attic? Creeping around at night with a candle while in a house that has electricity and plenty of light switches? Look, I knew going in that this would be a silly haunted house movie, but I was hoping to at least be entertained for 90 minutes. Instead, I was bored and insulted. This movie sucked!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Couldn't have had a better cast. &#x2665;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a one of a kind. Loved it from beginning to end. Lauren Cohan did an amazing job (as always) playing as the nanny for a little boy who turns out to be a doll. The story was well done and I would definitely watch again. This film keeps you on the edge of your seat and always make you wonder what's going to happen next. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is tired of the same old cliché horror movies. This movie is truly different and the ending stunned me unlike other types of movies where you can pretty much tell where it's going. I applaud the Director, Writer and Cast who did an astounding job on this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think it's your average cliché movie based on a possessed doll, but it's actually pretty enjoyable to watch, builds up great tension. It's well worth seeing this movie if you're a fan of classic horror themes such as ghosts and possessed dolls, it delivers exactly what it promises, and does it well.The only thing that's massively disappointing is the uninspired, cliché ending, which is one on one exactly the same as in any other horror movie that stars a female character.However the movie overall is fresh, don't hold back on watching it just because at first glance it seems like a tired old idea done again.I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I fell asleep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I am giving this movie a 4 out of 10 is because I didn't watch the whole thing, so I feel that I should give it a few pity points just because. I made the mistake of seeing this around 11:30pm and fell asleep about 30 or 40 minutes into it. I've gone to the movies a bunch of times late at night and seen a bunch of last call showings but this is only the second time I fell asleep during a movie. If I knew the movie was going to be this boring, I would have insisted on seeing it during the day. But whatever, it is what it is. The person I was with agreed it was a by the numbers horror film and nothing special. Usually films released in January and February are garbage. I wish I had more to review. Just a few jump scares here and there, nothing special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a low budget, though somewhat mysterious, film with recurring horror movie theme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy has no special acting challenges and therefore does not require any special acting skills. It features a beautiful summer mansion, which is the highlight of this film's photographic appeal. Scare scenes are filmed without any modern special effects, but the movie; however, does display an atmosphere of reality and is quite convincing. The strength of the plot is grounded in stimulating an "itching" curiosity in the audience, which is magnificently expanded upon throughout the entire movie right up until the last scene. The bottom line is... if you have decided to give this movie a chance, then be prepared to watch it until it is completely over or your curiosity will likely morph into a hellish nagging question that is hooked onto the far recesses of your conscience and will likely drive you mad. In short, The Boy offers nothing special and is similar to several other old time horror flicks following a style reminiscent of that great story teller, Alfred Hitchcock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnerving Pleasant Surprise for Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps revival is a strong word, but I really enjoyed watching The Boy. My expectations for horror films have significantly lowered especially after seeing the criminally clichéd The Forest earlier this year. The Boy is pretty generic and clichéd by its premise "a girl, running from her past, is asked to babysit a boy, or a doll rather, and is left alone for weeks by herself in an old mansion that is extremely secluded from other homes." Just by reading that I get the feeling a film like this would be filled with jump scares and unoriginal and boring characters. While the film does have its fair share of silly moments, its a refreshingly entertaining installment for the Horror genre.The Boy stars Lauren Cohan, from Walking Dead fame, who plays Greta. For the most part, the film is shrouded in mystery. The strong suits of the film lie in its secrecy. Much like The Forest a few weeks back, the build up to the reveal of the film is probably better than the actual reveal itself, though the ending is pretty great. With that said, as Greta learns to somehow grapple with the fact that she's babysitting a doll who closely resembles a boy who used to live in the house, the film grows weaker and weaker. The horror of the film takes a big rain check for the middle 30 minutes of the film.Dolls usually scare people for various reasons, and this doll is no different. The whole time you're guessing how and why the doll is doing the things that its doing and there were plenty of stupid ways to go about revealing that. The film does a good job at covering the reveal with multiple other clichéd possibilities that we all (including myself) believed it would be, thankfully the director went in a different direction. So in all, The Boy was a solid experience at the theater. Its not going to keep you awake at night like great horrors do, but I don't think it will disappoint either. I'm really glad to see someone from a prominent television show make a good transition and show promise for a future film career, well done Lauren Cohan.+Cohan holds her own+Creepy, unnerving moments+Jump scares are timely-Middle half takes a turn for the worse-Build up is probably better than the reveal6.7/10</fullReview>

I really hope there is a number 2 because it seems like they left it that way. The only thing I wish they did was answer some of my questions in which I really don't wanna say cause I don't want to spoil it, but I'm sure you Will feel the same way.

		<fullReview>I don't get why this movie only has 6.4/10??? hands down one of the best horror/thriller movies out there. to start off, i'm not a fan of horror movies. i never watch em. i think they're such a waste of money and time.why pay money just to cover your eyes throughout the movie? oh boy, this movie totally changed my opinion on horror films. i was pretty much at the edge of my seat the entire time. so exhilarating. gotta admit, the beginning was a little slow and it's kinda predictable.but nearing the end, man it took such a turn. i love the plot twist!! this movie has quite a number of jump scares, and they do get to you, even to those 'immune' to the scares. from the reaction of the audience and myself, its safe to say no one really expected what happened nearing the end.Next, Lauren Cohan's acting is A*. she gets the emotions across and i could literally sense the fear in her eyes. basically all the actors and actresses did a great job. honestly if they acted poorly, i would give this movie a rating of 5/10 despite the fact that the ending was awesome. -1 point off because of the slow start to the show. but honestly it wasn't really that bad.'The boy' is my first horror movie after years of avoiding this genre, so you could say i am a 'newbie' to this genre and might find me easily scared of nothing, but do give this movie a shot even if you're emotionless person who isn't afraid of anything; it might just surprise you.</fullReview>

The Boy keeps you on the edge of your seats and requires someone with intelligence to understand this movie. It will have you thinking and saying "Ohhhh i understand now" after you walk out of the theater. There are moments that are funny and scary at the same time and its a great combination. Pay attention to the small things that occur in this movie and you will have a better understanding afterward. I highly suggest you see this movie, come in not knowing what to expect and pay attention and I promise you'll enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Lost A Couple Brain Cells</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boy is directed by William Brent Bell and written by Stacey Menear. It stars Lauren Cohan, Rupert Evans, and James Russell.An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll. After violating a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive.I truly loved The Boy. This was one of the funniest and most original movies I have ever seen. From the the psychotic doll that wouldn't scare a 2 year old to zero gravitational towel to a fridge that is seemingly two dimensional, this movie had my friends and me cracking up. I then looked at the IMDb page and saw the tags "Horror, Thriller." How?I find it a bit too easy to just rip apart a movie this inept, therefore I find it necessary confess that The Boy isn't the worst horror movie in recent memory to pop out of January, and does feature some strong points even if these points can only be found out by digging around in miles and miles of horror movie excretion. Most of these strong points are thanks to director, William Brent Bell's moderately entertaining choices. Choosing to minimize the amount we see the "doll" he manages to create an amiable albeit completely unremarkable psychological thriller that revolves around paranoia. With that said, he fails to scare the audience as he relies way too heavily on jump scares to create urgency and tension. Though Bell is horribly devoted, his passion can't even come close to compensate for this movies lurid and wholly irritating script and characters.From the first time our squeaky and overly polished protagonist opens her mouth and the resulting slow motion sequence, I was sure I was in for something. The resulting 90 minutes of utter hilarity was mostly attributed to the shockingly dreadful script that featured incoherency in tone, character development, and plot. Uninspired and lacking any real motive, writer Stacey Menear weaves together a yarn that is irrevocably ludicrous. One of my largest issues with The Boy's script, laid in the incredibly jumbled tone which made it impossible for the actors and audience to decipher the seriousness behind pivotal scenes. Menear also struggles with character development. Unable to forge a dramatic core that's truly compelling, Menear resorts to juvenile character building techniques.Perhaps my largest gripe with The Boy stems from the fact that this movie could have been compelling. Though filled to the brim with cliché galore, at the 45 minute mark a character realization takes place that seemed out of place, by that I mean out of formula. For the next fifteen minutes we, the audience, were treated to some original twists that really worked. This new found focus was instantly broken with an ending "twist" so incredibly generic and stupid that turned what ever progress this movie made null and void, and thoroughly illogical. What a shame.The Boy's director and cast admirably attempt to showcase their talent but are ultimately let down by an incoherent and unoriginal script. The Boy gets a D+ or a 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning was good. It gets you in the movie atmosphere, but overall the story is uninspired, with pretty much no suspense for a thriller. The acting is not very good. And the end is a LOAD OF NONSENSE. There was the potential for a very good ending But they messed it up. After a guy breaks the creepy ceramic doll that has been the main subject of the movie, an adult version of the doll appears and attacks the characters. You can CLEARLY see the doll is a man with a ceramic mask and the final fight doesn't even have a supernatural nature. The twist is not even funny. But after all there are some good parts too and the movie it's decent overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She deserved whatever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I figure the chose to make Greta American for the film because of our bad reputation of "rudeness and disrespect of others property" when we travel abroad (such as signing your name on historical monuments or landscape). Unfortunately,there have been enough truth to make the stereotypical behavior used often in crossover horror films used in all of them with American visiting characters.Maybe because I played with Barbies as a child and being an only child, I felt they were my friends so at first I felt angry at Greta's behavior. I'm still an adult collector because of the dolls importance to my childhood so it doesn't have to be important to anyone else but if for instance I pay you good money to keep my dolls house dusted everyday, you should do it even if you think it's stupid or turn down the job.For this reason I think Greta deserved to get spooked. The doll was real to these people and she should have respect that as if she was caring for a disabled child. At least in the beginning. It wasn't like she had to make it up as she went along. Just follow the rules until you realize they weren't coming back. Then get the hell out of there since you were paid enough for a ticket home or a hotel in town.Now considering what the parents had planned I didn't understand why they didn't just take "The Doll" with them instead of saddling an unsuspected person with the task.I was confused that is until the haunting movie I thought it was went from a great British Gothic horror film of a spiritual love between parents and a(deceased)child to a typical American Gore film which was disappointing. I think this is why so many hated it. However thought it was better than some horror films I've seen lately due to the atmosphere set from the beginning if they had followed through with the haunting and let it end with the ghost child choosing new parents it would have been way better, I think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a movie watched for nothing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was awe at the beginning of the movie, thinking that I'd get what I watched from the trailer online. I was ecstatic to see it since I haven't got the chance to watch it on the big screen. I meant no offense but, The Boy was a downright disappointment. It included scenes that weren't even planned, or maybe were made, just for the sake of making a supposedly 'new age' horror movie. The description didn't even include the horror/SLASHER part since it was like a mixture of a horror movie and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I wasn't informed about the plot twist. Maybe I expected too much on the movie, that's why when it ended, I think it left me hanging just like the questions from Brahms past that were left hanging and needed for answers. It was a far cry from what I expected it to be. The Boy had its promising start as it gave a couple of "hair-raising" moments, but it ended there. After watching the ending of the movie, boy, I felt betrayed somehow. The trailer gave a 'ghostly' feels, then the movie kind of ruined the trailer for me. Ugh! It was a total wreck. Please, don't watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie with an ending that ruins everything the movie built up. It was terrible and hurts the movie tremendously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Whatever it might look like on the outside our son is here. He's very much with us." Greta Evans (Cohan) is an American nanny who is struggling at home and decides to take a job in England taking care of a wealthy families child. What starts off as a way to start her life over soon changes when she realizes the boy is actually a doll. She refuses to take it seriously but when strange things start to happen she wonders if the doll really is alive. First of all I will admit that I did like this movie pretty well. The idea seemed intriguing enough and the more the movie went on the more I was enjoying it. I wouldn't call the movie scary but it did have some definite creepy moments. The thing that really ruined the movie for me though and took it from being really good to something I wouldn't watch again was the way it ended. Everything the movie was building toward was ruined and it really felt like watching a balloon filled with air being released. I know some people will enjoy the end but to me it was terrible and hurts the movie tremendously. Overall, a good movie with an ending that ruins everything it built up. I give this a B-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy is about an American nanny who takes a unique position with an old-money family in the British countryside to look after the couple's son while they are on a long awaited holiday. Upon meeting the child, Greta (Lauren Cohan) is perplexed as to why mom and dad are treating a porcelain doll as if he was their son. According to the parents, the doll IS their son and Greta must follow a strict set of instructions in order to satisfy the needs of Brahms (the boy). Worried she will be alone in this mansion with only the doll for company, Greta meets the attractive local grocery delivery man Malcolm (Rupert Evans) who informs Greta of the history of Brahms and his parents. Thinking that Brahms is merely a doll with obsessed parents, it isn't long before Greta begins to feel that something is quite wrong after hearing voices and the doll mysteriously moving from place to place. Join Greta and Malcolm as they come too close to a long-kept secret with a devastating history.Despite being a January horror movie, The Boy had my attention and respect for a job well done until the end. Often horror movies may not provide us with the ending that we anticipated or were prepared for, but this film really took a turn for the worse when it played out in the manner in which it did. What I find remarkable about this modern old-school tale is the instant feeling of dread or fear of the unknown from the very beginning. From the dialog to the characters, each element of the story helps to continue to reinforce the ominous presence that Greta feels in the house. Unfortunately, there are just way too many unexplained, underdeveloped, and unanswered questions by the end of the movie to give the film the credit that it would have received otherwise. It is possible that the studio is setting up the audience for a prequel or a sequel, but usually these January movies do not see future installments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has this been sitting on the shelf since 2011?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mediocre suspense/ supernatural/ Horror (the film cannot decide which it wants to be) has a bit of atmosphere in the "Very lovely, very weird, large house", as a pretty girl is hired by an elderly couple, to be the caretaker of their weird doll.&nbsp;In addition to the elegantly creepy setting, lead girl Lauren Cohan is pretty and can act, and the entire small cast does well, but the material doesn't consistently work, unsure if it wants to be a psychological thriller (is she just going crazy and imagining everything? How else can the doll move its own head while she is looking at it?) or a supernatural haunting (how else can the doll move its own head while she is looking at it?) or a slasher flick (as fully grown Brahms is revealed to have been living in the walls of the house for " 20 years ").Confusingly, the story says Brahms died in 1991, which it says, again, was " 20 years ago ", dating this film to 2011, which makes me think that was when this was written but the date was never changed, or this was filmed in 2011 and sat unreleased until 2016.The subplot with her stalker ex-boyfriend seems needless, possibly added at last minute to stretch out the runtime, before the climax goes off into The People Under The Stairs/ Friday the 13th Part 2 hybrid territory. Maybe without this subplot, and with a bit of editing, this could have worked better as a short story in a Tales From The Crypt- like anthology?Why did this elderly couple want to give this girl, or anyone at all, sacrifice to Brahms? Then commit suicide? Was this girl supposed to take care of him for the rest of her life, and if so, why her? And why on Earth does this film have a 3rd assistant&nbsp;director (who usually would handle extras in a large crowd scene?)Maybe I'm just over analysing here. Turn off your mind, and this might be a decent watch at a matinée, because the film has some good individual components, but it doesn't add up to as much as it could. Finally, I'm quite happy it didn't resort to the generic, predictable jump scare for the final second shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy, that was scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly among the scariest movies in recent years; that is until The Boy drops the ball in the last few minutes of the movie. Within the first few minutes of the film, there is already an overwhelming sense of dread and an anticipation of what horror lies in store for our protagonist. This is one of the films where the plot was nearly perfect and even scarily close to real horrific circumstances. Quite interestingly and uncharacteristic of this sub genre of horror, the previews do not give away all the scares nor do they lend to revealing the shocking turning point during the climax of the story. In many ways, the plot is a tribute to a more classic way of building a horror movie and I can appreciate the effort to channel the Master of Suspense.The Boy is about an American nanny who takes a unique position with an old-money family in the British countryside to look after the couple's son while they are on a long awaited holiday.

There was also a Hitchcockian air about the film; although Hitch would have directed a much better (or simply bizarre) ending and provided us with far fewer unexplained plot points. The film is definitely one that is very much enjoyed in a group setting, as is the case for horror in general. So, if you don't have anything else planned to see this weekend, grab a few friends and head out to see what The Boy has in store for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to this movie after those surprisingly creepy trailers but the actual film didn't scare me as much as I thought it would. To be fair, it's difficult to actually frighten people but there's something about this movie that just felt disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and everything but it felt like more could have been done with the whole idea. I also have to admit, the ending left me a bit lukewarm. That being said, it was still entertaining enough and I thought the director, William Brent Bell, did a decent enough job. Let's talk about the story.Greta (Lauren Cohan) has just moved to the UK for a nanny job that pays surprisingly well and is located in a secluded and spooky mansion in the middle of nowhere (it is a horror movie after all). Things get weird fast when it's revealed that the child she's supposed to look after is a porcelain doll named Brahms. This is all a bit freaky but Greta agrees to watch over Brahms while his parents are out of town since the job seems easy enough and the pay is pretty good. Unfortunately, things start to get even stranger and Greta soon suspects that there's more to this doll than meets the eye.I don't have any complaints about the acting in the film. Cohan does a great job as a tough but scared young woman stuck in a situation she doesn't fully comprehend. She probably has enough practice from her work on The Walking Dead. I also enjoyed Rupert Evans as the likable and sort of desperate Malcolm. He definitely helps to add a little levity to the whole thing. I even really liked the creepy old couple played by Jim Norton and Diana Hardcastle. There are a few more people in the film but this is honestly the bulk of the cast right here. Cohan basically carries this movie for the most part.The mansion is a little spooky and the area is decently secluded but it never really feels like Greta is alone at all. Obviously we suspect the doll is doing some weird stuff behind the scenes but the mansion is in pristine condition which makes it feel like housekeepers shouldn't be too far away at any given time. Everything is shot well but it just doesn't feel like she's that secluded and in turn it feels a lot less dangerous in the house. Maybe the frequent visits from Malcolm make it feel like she's not that far from help and in turn it doesn't come off frightening to me.I'm going to get into spoiler territory pretty heavy in the next paragraph so be warned before you keep reading. I thought the film was decent for the most part but I really didn't like the ending to the movie. Basically, it turns out Brahms has been living in the walls of the mansion and is responsible for all the weird stuff that has been happening throughout the story. The reveal of Brahms was pretty freaky right at first but then the whole tone of the film changes as Brahms suddenly becomes a slasher villain. I swear this guy just reminded me of a more chatty version of Michael Myers. I mean the guy is huge and able to dish out and take some punishment and wears a creepy mask while he chases people. The situation would be frightening but it's been done so many times before. Whether it was a doll or the actual Brahms, the movie just wasn't very scary and felt a bit cliché to me. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the movie for what it was but I guess I expected something different after the trailers.I honestly thought this film would be a lot scarier than it was and I think that may have soured me a little bit on the movie but I still found it to be enjoyable. It's nowhere near the best horror film out there but it's worth a watch if nothing else is on. I think some of the fans of the genre might want to check it out for a different take on a tried and true formula but otherwise I'd recommend something else.</fullReview>

Apparently Greta's mom never taught her NOT to strip down in front of a boy doll, and the consequences of her wanton disregard for the niceties of proper decorum Young Ladies Must Know bring havoc to the Hillshire Home in THE BOY. Honestly, what American Girl would conduct her first tryst in plain sight of her Ken Doll?! But Greta is from Montana, where the sheep ranchers don't have time to teach their daughters the Facts of Life, as the TV police drama CSI: NEW YORK taught us a few years back. The bottom line is that NO amount of tax-free cash should be enough to entice a Proper U.S. Female to "humor" a demanding male plaything, no matter how much "in control" of her situation she thinks she is. Kow-towing to a tyrannical toy amounts to the first step on the Trail to Insanity--or worse.

From the look of the trailer when the baby sitter meets the boy she will be baby sitting and finds out that it's a doll that the two parents are really treating like their son. We all know something is up with the doll.Just like in the movie Annabelle. Seeing the doll in the Boy, I did not think it could creep me out as much as Annabelle creep me it. Than, the movie flips the script on me. It's not like the typical horror thrillers done lately. It hits you with a curve ball that is so well played out. It was the most insane experience.

		<shortDescription>Not exactly great, but not bad either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suffice to say, I had really low expectations for this. I was taken to it because a friend really wanted to see it. To my surprise, the film wasn't the loud, bombastic, over-the-top, really stupid and clichéd horror film that I expected. Sure, it's stupid at times, and clichéd sure... but it's also pretty slow paced, meaning that it doesn't come off as awful as one would expect. I have to be honest, I was a little entertained by it and I think that the premise is a scary one. The plot is thin, but I welcomed this. I wouldn't necessarily say that it's a good film really. Just perhaps not a bad one, which is entirely a surprise. I'm really happy to see Lauren Cohan get this role though, I think she's a pretty good actress and she does hold her own as the lead here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Discount Mila Kunis with Discount Brad Pitt with a fresh doll</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all. This movie makes no sense. It starts out with fresh family with their fresh doll. At the beginning it's a melt spirit or something but then it turns out to be a fresh sorry hard with a fresh beard who's ripped despite eating nothing but scraps and never working out because he lives in a FRESH wall. Oh no i spoilt the movie but seriously who cares it is terrible. You know who this movie is for? You know your mum's fat friend.You know that friend has a fresh life doing nothing but looking after her kids and cheating on her husband. THAT woman. Yes her. They get scared at jump-scares and think they know what real horror is. If this film was printed on 70mm film i would get that film and wipe my a** with it. If you want to be a real human being go and watch Zootropolis or batman vs superman and stop cheating on your husband. Right ill go back to my review. The main girl in it is a bit dumb and fit like every single girl in a horror film. Her acting is so bad that when she enters the big mansion she says "wow" like 5 times. Honestly my cat is dead and is more alive than her. In conclusion "The boy" Should have never been created and they should have spent the money on advertising for Batman v Superman and Zootropolis. Listen for some people they make ?6.50 an hour (Minimum wage)&gt; A ticket is ?7.50. Meaning for some of you, you'd HAVE to work MORE than an hour to pay for the ticket. Also since your a fat woman who cheats on her husband you're gonna want popcorn and drinks which is like ?7. Meaning you'd have to work MORE than two hours to actually pay for this. I mean like 2hrs and 30 minutes. Which is as long as Batman V Superman. So basically if you see this movie you should die and don't worry i am already dead inside so it doesn't matter to me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This mediocre dummy had potential at greatness, but end up being kinda dumb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally titled 'In a dark place' and previously known as 'The Inhabitant', 2016's 'The Boy' is an surprisingly step up, for director William Brent Bell, considering his last widely released film was the universally loathed, 2012's The Devil Inside. Most general consensus see the American psychological horror movie as decent at best, however, for me, I saw it as below average. Yes, I like how the film is focusing less on cheap jump scares and more on the story, however, this Gothic horror is nowhere near watchable. First off, the dreadful story reads like a script going through a lot of studio interference. First off, the title for this movie is way too broad. There has been, way too many movies titled 'The Boy' in recent years. I don't know, why the studio thought the title 'the boy' would be better. It's clear, in how this movie flows, that the original story was written, sometime in the year 2011/2012. It match well, with 'The Inhabitant' title, however the studio change it, when the 2014's horror film, 'Annabelle' became a hit. Not only, did they forgot to change or update a lot of the 2011 original story, but there are plenty of parts, in this movie, that seems like they stole from the 'Annabelle' horror concept. If it wasn't that film, then it had to be from another 2014's film, call 'Housebound'. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, I'm glad, the movie had a quick pace. I just didn't like, how the movie move in a very incoherency way. It really didn't match the tone. Very odd character behavior comes and goes with the main character. Written by Stacey Menear, the movie tells the story of Greta Evans (Lauren Cohan), an American woman on the run from her abusive ex-lover, Cole (Ben Robson). She winds up in England and accepts a job as a nanny for an eccentric old couple, Mr. and Mrs. Heelshire (Jim Norton &amp; Diana Hardcastle). But the interview are apparently turn out, a lot creepier than it seems; for it turns out that Greta won't actually be taking care of a real boy, but rather a porcelain doll who represents Brahms, the couple's long deceased son. Rather than reject the job, Greta is grateful for the safe haven, the mansion provides, and the enjoyment, she gets from the flirtations of Malcolm (Rupert Evans), the local grocery boy. Unfortunately, the spirit of Brahms think otherwise of her visit. Her recent actions has violating a sacred series of strict rules of his, and now a series of disturbing and inexplicable supernatural events has come to make Greta's life, into a living hell. At least, whatever, a low-budget PG-13 rating can muster as scares, such as loud noises, and really pitch black scenes; which in my opinion, fails to scare me. The movie is so dark that you can barely see anything. The loud noises sounds very clichés and recycled. The movie is not overly gory, but characters do die. Not only that, but some of the supporting characters like Malcolm seem useless. Honestly, besides, playing Greta's love-interesting, there is barely any reason to keep him, around. I really, maybe, he would have a bigger part, toward the end. You know, be related to the twist. Sadly, he isn't. Even, Brahms himself, doesn't seem as scary as the film makes it out to be. I thought, the twist toward the end with him, didn't make much sense. After all, it's hard to believe, that movie thought, 1974's 'Bad Ronald' and 1989's 'Hider in the House' was a clever way to end the film. I also didn't like how much of a man-child, the movie makes Brahms is. Are we really suppose, to take Greta ordering Brahms to go to sleep, serious? This is the high level of nonsense. Remind me of the killer mistaking his victim for his mother scene from '1981's Friday the 13th Part 2'. Trust me, when I say this, I was really dumb. Another thing, that kinda bug me, is how Laura Cohan is playing an American nanny. I really don't see her as that type of a character. Don't get me wrong, she's a fine actress, but I really don't see any sense of 'motherhood' with her performance, here. Also, doesn't it seem a bit odd, for her to want to take care of somebody else kid, after the recent miscarriage of her own!? I just, don't buy it. However, I was really hoping the movie would go, 1992's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, with this sub-plot. Sadly, in my opinion, the miscarriage subplot comes in and out of the film, way too often. I don't know, if she wants to be a mother or not, with her, trying to screw the grocery boy. Also, why is Laura Cohan still doing her American accent rather than her normal British sounding voice? I know, she's an American playing an American, but she does hold a British citizenship as well. Wouldn't her normal English voice, sound a lot better, here since the settlings is in England?! The reason, why I say this, is because I just don't buy the fact; that this American is flying all the way to England from Montana for a job that she doesn't know, anything about. It makes no sense. It make more sense, if she was British. Overall: This movie was very disappointing. If you want to see it. Its might be alright for you. However, this isn't a movie, I'm willing to rewatch, anytime soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey! That's Maggie from The Walking Dead! She's not baddass in here though.OK, what you see in the trailer, it's not the story you think you are going to see.I only saw the trailer once, and I didn't finish watching it because most horror movie trailers show us all - if not most - the good bits. Remember Sinister? Yeah, the boy in the box, the photo of Bughuul in the bush,... all in the trailer.So, yes,this movie is creepy. I hate "It's only a dream" scenes (No, that's not the ending) because those steal the horror away. They shouldn't do that anymore. It pisses people.Anyhow, I love this movie. I didn't expect it to turn out to be THIS kind of movie. A bit slow in parts.But one question, though, who the hell cleans up the house?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What an amazing, outstanding movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best movie I've seen in the last 10 years. You must see it in the theater for the experience. Tight, gripping, well-acted, well-written, expertly directed. Not a dull moment, and elicits lots of screams. Tense, but not gory. It draws you in and makes you feel like you are in the house with them. It may even cause you to doubt your own sanity at times. If you like a good, scary movie that plays like a Twilight Zone episode, this is the one for you.From the moment Greta arrives at the eerie mansion in the very beginning you'll find yourself trying to figure out why her new employers are so mysterious. It's an exhilarating ride. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The BoyThe best thing about babysitting British kids is they'll believe your skulking boyfriend is actually a magical chimney sweep.Unfortunately, that fib wouldn't fly with the inanimate child in this horror movie.After a breakup stateside, Great (Lauren Cohan) gets a nanny gig at an English manor where she'll be looking after the Heelshire's (Jim Norton, Diana Hardcastle) son, Brahms.When she arrives she's shocked to learn Brahms is really a doll the homeowners believe to be their deceased son. While they're away, Greata must adhere to Brahms' strict schedule, or face his cruel wraith.Relying on the played out premise of a possessed doll to deliver its hackneyed scares, this horrible haunter has no redeeming qualities to speak of, including the toy's design or it's failed attempt at an eerie ambiance.Besides, the only way to rid yourself of a haunted doll is to give it to your dog.

		<shortDescription>A decent attempt at a tired genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when the original 'Child's Play' came out, the filmmakers wanted to leave some mystery around whether or not the doll was the one causing all the trouble or whether it was the little boy. In hindsight, while the idea had merit, it made the film less effective and left us with a big chunk of the film having very little actual horror. 'The Boy' tries to create a similar mystery. We never actually see this doll move and yet it is strongly implied that it is moving off camera. Of course any astute audience member will be very suspicious of the way the film is trying to portray this to them, and rightly so. The film actually has almost the exact same twist as a recent New Zealand film 'Housebound'. The twist leads to a tense last 10 or so minutes but was it enough to justify all the build up?I often think when I see a dream sequence in a horror film used to generate scares it's a sign of a weak story. 'The Boy' has more than one and this is simply not acceptable. The mystery element of the film however is the best thing it has going for it. I didn't believe the doll was really coming alive but I couldn't quite put my finger on what exactly was going on. Even though I'd already seen the twist before in a separate film, I still felt it worked effectively here. There's not a lot of life left in the doll horror genre it must be said but if there was any this is probably the way to go about bringing it to life (so to speak).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trailer itself gave me an idea this would be a drop movie (not good). And i guess I am right. First the scenes are a bit slow it's like "yes, we know the doll can move around." and please girl, who do you think would hide your pink dress when no one is around that house and it's night? Then all of a sudden she became attached to the doll because it gave her, her favorite food? Oh come'on. Then after an hour, the story became interesting because we thought the doll was possessed with good spirit and all of a sudden the girl's ex lover came and broke the doll then what? something came from the inside of the house? "WAIT I THINK I ALREADY SAW A MOVIE LIKE THAT! OH YEA. HOUSEBOUND" Such a boring movie, i felt sorry for the actress and the crews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "okay" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film with no expectations at all. Prior to walking into the theater, I had heard nothing and seen nothing about "The Boy." My initial thoughts were that this movie would be yet another rip-off of the "killer doll" archetype popularized by "Child's Play" and it's sequels. Knowing a few names such as "Lauren Cohan" and "Bear McCreary" from the Walking Dead, my hopes were raised, yet realizing that Lauren Cohan, an English actress was playing an American immigrant visiting England, was a bit odd. My hopes were overall fulfilled as what began as a horror movie about a doll became a thriller about a burn-victim- turned-murderer. The movie takes an unexpected twist when Brahms, the main antagonist is revealed to be a loving person after all. A quite odd movie had a quite odd finish, but it overall delivered and I feel as though I got my money's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Between Annabelle and Chucky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "The Boy", starring Lauren Cohan-Maggie in The Walking Dead_tv, Van Wilder 2:The Rise of Taj; Rupert Evans-Agora, Hellboy; Jim Norton- Water For Elephants, American History X and Diana Hardcastle-The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies, If Only.This is one of those spooky horror films with a doll as the protagonist. As far as it's spooky factor goes, I would say it's not as good as the Chucky movies but it is better than the ones about that Annabelle doll. Lauren plays an American that is hired to be a nanny for an English couple, Jim and Diana. The money is good and Lauren has personal reasons to get away from the states for awhile-someone is looking for her. The only hitch is that the English couple seem to be a little twitched in the head because their son, that needs taking care of, is a life-sized doll. It seems that the little boy, Brahms, died when he was 8 years old and his parents replaced him with a doll that looks like Brahms did, as an 8 year old. Now, 20 years later, Jim and Diana are going on a little vacation and so they leave a list of do's and don'ts for Lauren about how to handle Brahms-I guess he got his name from his love of classical music, you know, the Brahms Lullaby. Jim and Diana tell Lauren to follow the rules closely or there might be consequences. Of course, she doesn't and there are. Rupert is the local grocery delivery man that helps fill in information to Lauren about Brahms' past. He also wants to get to know her a little better, if you know what I mean. When the 'consequences' start to kick in-mysterious things start happening -the question is, is Brahms a ghost, an evil spirit, or maybe something even worse. It's not a bad movie but it could have been a little better. It's rated "PG-13" for violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 37 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright, as a rental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More awful January horror films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Continuing on the awful January horror movie tradition, The Boy takes on the haunted doll sub- genre of horror and stars The Walking Dead's Lauren Cohan as an American nanny hired by a deranged older couple to care for their son. The son just happens to be a doll and though at first Cohan's character Greta finds this odd, she still signs on for the job desperate to hide away and earn the excessive amount of money she will be paid.The Boy contributes to more awful horror movies. I'm not sure how this movie was produces, it seemed like such an awful idea in the first place. I'm such a sucker for these earlier year horror flicks though and find small enjoyment in the slow build. There were a few clever jump out scares and the mysterious grocery boy played by Rupert Evans, whose performance in the first Hellboy is one of my favorite in a superhero movie, kept me guessing up to the final third of the movie.

Housebound except the character is a killer... with a doll mask... so how he can eat ? this movie is a little bit stupid... if you watch Housebound, the guy steal food and was about to survive and no one knows he was there... There's a great mystery with the doll sometimes but it sounds obvious where they are going since there's no ghost or doll that moves... To me The Boy is a disappointment, i like the main actress and that was about it... the scares are rare and not really effectives. i was bored a little, still the end is kinda cool... it seems like it's what people did not like, and it's what i like... wait for the DVD or blu-ray or better on TV for free because i'm glad i just spent 5 pennys to see this... at the regular price of 12,50$ i would have been rubbed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boy (2016)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not since last year's generic exorcism flick The Vatican Tapes have I had such low expectations for a movie. Its January release date, unflattering trailer, and awful director (William Brent Bell, director of The Devil Inside and Stay Alive) seemed to be a recipe for disaster. Maybe it's because my expectations were so low, but The Boy is actually a halfway-decent January thriller. The Boy is about an American woman, Greta, who becomes a nanny for a boy named Brahms whose parents will be away for a few months. What Greta comes to find out is that Brahms is actually a life-sized porcelain doll that is used to replace the real Brahms who died in a fire when he was 8. A list of rules is created for Greta to follow, and increasingly disturbing events start happening when she does not follow those rules. The enormous manor that she resides in calls to mind the mansion from The Innocents, creating an interesting setting for the film. As the film progresses, Greta does begin following the rules and treats the doll like a real boy, and it is pretty creepy seeing how the doll can mentally control her in that way. The plot itself is rather thing, specifically during the second act. There is an abusive husband sub-plot thrown into the film like last year's disappointing Sinister 2, but instead of being ridiculously over- the-top like that movie, the side plot actually does serve some relevance in The Boy and is believable enough. It provides a reason for why Greta becomes so attached to Brahms. The big twist at the end will divide viewers, but I thought it served the rest of the movie well. It is revealed that Brahms actually survived the fire and has been living in the walls ever since the incident, and the parents committed suicide and left Greta for Brahms. The fact that he's always in the walls listening and watching everything creates a creepy atmosphere. The Boy certainly won't blow anyone's minds, but it is a decent thriller that should give you an excuse to go out to the cinema in January.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boy started off pretty decent. It was a slow out of the gates for sure, but the suspense was definitely there, and it was really great at keeping you guessing: Is the boy alive? Is he haunted? Is everyone just psycho? As the movie progressed it got better. I was on the edge of my seat, and then it took a sudden turn in a direction I was really hoping they wouldn't go. I don't think the idea for the twist at the end is awful. However, I do think that the movie would have been better if they went an alternate route. The slasher way they went just didn't mesh well with the rest of the movie. The acting was pretty much a bell curve, and I base this on three of the characters. The guy who plays Cole, the violent, obsessive, ex- boyfriend did a lousy job. Even at playing a jerk, he sucked. The woman playing Greta was for the most part, decent. She had really high moments. She also very much had her low moments. The man playing Malcolm was amazing, in my opinion. Probably the one truly believable actor in the whole movie.A decent movie overall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>one of the worst horror movies out there.If you liked Annabelle, I can guarantee that you will like this movie. But if it's the other way around, don't waste your 90 minutes to watch this movie unless if it's for that hottie woman in The Walking Dead.The first 10 minutes was pretty engaging but nevertheless, it just went down the hill just until the climax scene appeared.The final scene came back with a good plot twist. It's totally different from Chucky or Annabelle. You may find some definite clues to puzzle the twist, but at the end, you will find the shocking truth behind the curtains.Let's just skip to the jump scare parts, all I can say is that throughout the whole movie, there were only about 6 cheap, cringe- worthy jump scares.The best part was not the movie itself, but in the cinema that I rarely experienced before. Saw it with my friends, we got bored until we made laughs off that movie, we would laugh on almost every scene. Note that the cinema was packed of only 25+ people. If you want to have a good laugh, watch it at midnight or go to a remote cinema with your boisterous members and you will feel the joy of happiness.</fullReview>
